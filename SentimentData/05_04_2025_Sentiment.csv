Here’s what on-chain data says regarding if BTC is going anywhere with them. Bitcoin Realized Profit/Loss Ratio Could Shed Light On Broader Dynamics In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the recent trend in the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio for Bitcoin, which is an indicator that can be useful to study how investors are reacting to price volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.57 Or $0.06? Analyst Says DOGE’s Fate Hinges On This Level The metric measures, as its name already suggests, the ratio between the amount of profit and that of loss being realized by the holders or addresses as a whole. The indicator works by looking at the transaction history of each coin being sold on the network to find what price it was transferred at prior to this sale. If this previous selling value is less than the latest spot price for any token, then the metric includes it under the profit volume. The total profit realized in the sale of the coin is assumed to be equal to the difference between the two prices. The indicator calculates this value for all coins belonging to the profit volume and takes a total sum to determine the scale of profit realization happening across the blockchain. Similarly, the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio also finds the total amount of loss being realized by referring to the sales of the coins of the opposite type (that is, the tokens with the last transaction value higher than the current spot price). Then, it takes the ratio between the two sums, to estimate the net situation for the sector. During the last couple of months, Bitcoin has been going through a phase of bearish price action. Here’s what investor trading behavior has been like in this period, according to the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio: As the analytics firm has highlighted in the chart, the indicator has seen dips under the 1 mark during each of BTC’s recent lows. A value in this region corresponds to loss-taking being more dominant than profit-taking. “This imbalance typically marks a degree of seller exhaustion, where downside momentum fades as sell-side pressure is absorbed,” explains Glassnode. Due to this reason, capitulation tends to help BTC arrive at local bottoms. From the graph, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency also benefited from this effect during the recent bursts of loss realization, as its price found a rebound following each of them. These Bitcoin rebounds, however, have so far not been anything sustained. Will they eventually culminate into a return of proper bullish momentum, or are they only dead-cat bounces on the way down? To tackle the question, the analytics firm has referred to a long-term view of the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio. As shown in the above chart, the 90-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has been sharply trending down recently, despite the jumps in profit realization that have come on the short-term view. “These brief profit-driven surges have failed to reverse the broader downtrend, suggesting that the macro picture remains one of generally weaker liquidity and deteriorating investor profitability,” notes Glassnode. Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Among Coins Seeing The Largest Decline In Profit Supply: Data So, as for whether Bitcoin has been witnessing a shift towards bullish momentum with the recent rebounds, the answer is seemingly no, at least from the perspective of the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $83,600, down almost 2% in the last seven days.

However, amidst this exhilarating innovation, the United States has found itself playing catch-up in the regulatory arena. Many argue that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement-first strategy has inadvertently pushed burgeoning crypto ventures and talent overseas, hindering domestic growth. But hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! Change is in the air, and it’s coming straight from Capitol Hill. Why is Digital Asset Regulation Suddenly a Hot Topic? For years, the lack of clear digital asset regulation in the U.S. has been a thorn in the side of the crypto industry. Imagine trying to navigate a complex maze without a map – that’s been the reality for businesses operating with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The absence of well-defined rules has led to: Uncertainty for Businesses: Companies wanting to innovate in the crypto space have been hesitant, unsure of the legal boundaries and potential penalties. Investor Hesitation: The regulatory grey area has made some investors wary, slowing down capital inflow into the U.S. crypto market. Innovation Drain: As mentioned earlier, the stringent enforcement approach has encouraged crypto entrepreneurs to seek more welcoming regulatory environments abroad. The urgency for a clear framework has become undeniable, and finally, lawmakers are taking note. The recent move in Congress signals a significant shift towards embracing and regulating this transformative technology. Bipartisan Breakthrough: A Unified Front on Crypto Regulation In a refreshing display of unity, the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees have joined forces, passing the first bipartisan crypto regulation market structure bill. This is not just another piece of legislation; it’s a landmark moment, signifying a growing consensus across party lines on the need for a comprehensive approach to digital assets. This bipartisan effort is built upon six core principles, designed to foster innovation while safeguarding consumers and the integrity of the financial system: Principle Description Benefit Promoting Innovation Creating a regulatory environment that encourages the development and adoption of digital asset technologies. Spurs economic growth, technological advancement, and job creation within the US. Clarifying Asset Classification Establishing clear definitions for different types of digital assets to determine appropriate regulatory oversight (e.g., are they securities, commodities, or something else?). Reduces confusion, provides legal certainty for businesses, and simplifies compliance. Regulating New Asset Issuance Setting guidelines for the issuance of new digital assets, ensuring transparency and investor protection. Mitigates risks associated with fraudulent schemes and protects investors from scams. Overseeing Spot Markets Implementing regulatory oversight for the spot markets where digital assets are traded, enhancing market integrity and preventing manipulation. Builds trust in the market, attracts institutional investors, and ensures fair trading practices. Protecting Customer Funds Establishing robust safeguards to protect customer funds held by digital asset platforms and custodians. Enhances consumer confidence, reduces the risk of loss due to platform failures or hacks, and protects user assets. Safeguarding Decentralized Projects Developing a regulatory approach that accommodates the unique nature of decentralized projects, fostering innovation while addressing potential risks. Allows for the growth of decentralized technologies, recognizing their potential benefits while managing associated risks in a balanced way. These principles form the bedrock of a balanced framework that aims to nurture the burgeoning digital asset market while mitigating potential risks. It’s about creating a space where innovation can thrive responsibly. What’s Next? The Road Ahead for US Crypto Regulation This bipartisan bill is a crucial first step, but the journey towards comprehensive US crypto regulation is far from over. Lawmakers are committed to refining and expanding this framework. A joint hearing is already scheduled for May, indicating the continued momentum and dedication to advancing digital asset regulation. Here’s what we can expect in the coming months: Further Deliberation and Refinement: The May hearing will likely involve expert testimonies, industry input, and further debate among lawmakers to shape the legislation. Collaboration Across Agencies: Effective regulation will require collaboration between various government agencies, including the SEC, CFTC, and Treasury Department, to ensure a cohesive and coordinated approach. International Alignment: As crypto is a global phenomenon, the U.S. will need to consider international regulatory standards to maintain competitiveness and prevent regulatory arbitrage. Focus on Consumer Protection: Protecting consumers from fraud and scams will remain a paramount concern, influencing the final shape of the regulations. The ultimate goal? To establish the U.S. not just as a participant, but as a global leader in the crypto space. By providing a clear, balanced, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment, the U.S. can attract investment, foster technological advancements, and solidify its position in the digital economy. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you are a crypto investor, a business owner exploring blockchain applications, or simply a curious observer, this development in bipartisan crypto bill matters. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the developments in Congress and the evolving regulatory landscape. Resources like CoinDesk and other crypto news outlets will be crucial. Engage with Policymakers: If you are part of the crypto industry, consider engaging with policymakers and industry associations to contribute to the regulatory dialogue. Prepare for Compliance: Businesses operating in the crypto space should start preparing for potential regulatory changes. Understanding the six principles outlined in the bill is a good starting point. Consider Long-Term Opportunities: The move towards clearer regulation can be seen as a positive signal for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto market in the U.S. A New Chapter for Crypto in America? The bipartisan push for digital asset regulation in the U.S. marks a pivotal moment. It’s a signal that lawmakers are recognizing the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology and are committed to creating a framework that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. While the journey is ongoing, this initial bipartisan bill is a monumental leap forward, potentially paving the way for the U.S. to become a global powerhouse in the digital asset revolution. The future of crypto in America is looking brighter, and it’s a space to watch with keen interest.

While the digital asset world keeps us on our toes, a seismic shift is happening in the traditional markets that might just ripple through our crypto universe. Whispers are turning into shouts as reports emerge about a massive stock market decline in the U.S. since Donald Trump’s return to office. According to WhaleWire’s Jacob King on X, we’re talking about a staggering $9.6 trillion wiped out from the U.S. stock market. That’s not just a dip; it’s a plunge! Is this a temporary blip, or are we witnessing the start of a significant economic downturn ? Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for you and your investments. Decoding the $9.6 Trillion Market Crash: What’s Behind the Numbers? Nine point six trillion dollars. Let that sink in for a moment. That’s a mind-boggling figure, and it represents a substantial erosion of wealth in the U.S. stock market. But what’s causing this dramatic market crash ? While attributing such complex phenomena to a single factor is simplistic, the timing coinciding with a political shift raises eyebrows. Let’s break down some potential contributing factors: Policy Uncertainty: New administrations often bring policy changes, and the return of a former president can amplify this uncertainty. Markets dislike uncertainty, and shifts in trade policy, regulations, or fiscal spending can spook investors. Economic Outlook Concerns: Are there underlying economic concerns that are being exacerbated by the change in administration? Factors like inflation, interest rate hikes, and global economic slowdown could be playing a significant role. A new administration’s perceived approach to these issues can either calm or agitate market sentiments. Investor Sentiment and Reaction: Market psychology is a powerful force. Investor confidence can be swayed by political events. If the market perceives the new administration’s policies as unfavorable for business or economic growth, a negative feedback loop can be triggered, leading to sell-offs and further declines. Comparison to Previous Administrations: The claim highlights this as the “largest market decline recorded under a new president.” This comparative aspect itself can fuel concern and media attention, further impacting market sentiment. It’s crucial to remember that correlation doesn’t equal causation. While the timeline is noteworthy, a multitude of global and domestic economic factors are always at play in market movements. Trump’s Economic Policy: A Deja Vu or a New Chapter of Investment Losses? Donald Trump’s previous presidency was characterized by significant tax cuts and deregulation, initially cheered by many in the business community. However, it also saw trade disputes and increased national debt. So, how might his return influence the current economic policy landscape and contribute to these investment losses ? Here are some key areas to consider: Trade Relations: Trump’s stance on trade, including tariffs and trade agreements, has historically created market volatility. Any perceived shift towards protectionist policies could worry investors about global economic growth and corporate earnings. Fiscal Policy: Proposed changes in tax policy and government spending can have a direct impact on corporate profitability and investor sentiment. Markets will be scrutinizing any signals regarding fiscal stimulus or austerity measures. Regulatory Environment: Deregulation was a hallmark of Trump’s previous term. The extent to which deregulation is pursued again and in which sectors will be closely watched by investors. While some sectors might benefit, others could face increased risks. Geopolitical Impact: Trump’s foreign policy and international relations also play a role. Geopolitical instability or shifts in alliances can create market uncertainty and impact investor confidence. It’s essential for investors to analyze specific policy proposals and their potential sector-by-sector impacts rather than reacting solely to broad political narratives. Navigating the Economic Downturn: Actionable Insights for Crypto and Traditional Investors Whether this economic downturn is a short-term correction or the beginning of a deeper trend remains to be seen. However, for both crypto and traditional investors, this market volatility presents both challenges and opportunities. Here are some actionable insights: Actionable Insight For Crypto Investors For Traditional Stock Investors Diversification: Consider diversifying crypto holdings across different types of assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins, stablecoins) and exploring traditional assets for portfolio balance. Ensure portfolio diversification across different sectors, asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities), and geographic regions. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes. Volatility can be amplified in crypto markets. Review and adjust risk tolerance based on market conditions. Consider hedging strategies or reducing exposure to high-risk assets if necessary. Due Diligence and Research: Stay informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors impacting both crypto and traditional markets. Conduct thorough research on companies and sectors before investing. Understand the potential impact of economic policies on specific industries. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market cycles are inherent. Focus on the long-term potential of crypto and avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term volatility. Maintain a long-term investment perspective. Market corrections can present buying opportunities for fundamentally strong companies. In times of market uncertainty, knowledge is your best weapon. Staying informed, being adaptable, and having a well-thought-out investment strategy are crucial for navigating turbulent economic waters. Conclusion: Weathering the Storm and Seeking Opportunity The reported $9.6 trillion stock market decline is undoubtedly a significant event that demands attention. While the narrative around political factors is prominent, a confluence of economic forces is likely at play. For investors in both crypto and traditional markets, this period underscores the importance of vigilance, diversification, and a disciplined approach to risk management. Market downturns, while concerning, can also present opportunities for strategic investors who are prepared to weather the storm and capitalize on emerging trends. Keep a close watch on economic indicators, policy developments, and market reactions, and position yourself to navigate this evolving landscape with informed decisions.

BTC looked to be on the brink of reclaiming $85,000, but price action turned bearish, with the flagship cryptocurrency dropping to $81,745 before rising above $82,000 and moving to its current level of $82,350. BTC has been marginally up over the past 24 hours, with price action relatively flat after the flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum around $84,500. Genius Group Temporarily Banned From Buying Bitcoin Genius Group, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence firm has announced it has been temporarily banned from buying more Bitcoin after a US court order barred the company from selling shares, raising funds, and using investor funds to buy more of the asset. The preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order (TRO) were issued by a New York District court in connection with a broader dispute regarding its merger with Fatbrain AI. Fatbrain AI and Genius Group completed a merger and purchase agreement in March 2024. However, on October 30, Genius initiated arbitration proceedings to terminate the agreement alleging fraud by Fatbrain AI executives connected to the deal. “Genius Group Limited (NYSE American: GNS) (“Genius Group” or the “Company”), a leading AI-powered, Bitcoin-first education group, today announced that it is being forced to sell its Bitcoin Treasury after having been blocked from selling shares or raising funds, and specifically from using investor funds to buy Bitcoin by the United States District Court Southern District of New York (SDNY).” Fatbrain AI executives Michael Moe and Peter Ritz filed for a TRO and permanent injunction in February, preventing Genius from selling shares, raising funds, and buying more BTC . The injunction forced Genius Group to close divisions, halt marketing activities, and sell 10 BTC from its stash of 440 to fund operations. The firm has not ruled out more sales of Bitcoin. “Genius is taking all necessary measures to minimize Bitcoin sales but anticipates that it will need to downsize its Bitcoin Treasury in the coming months in the event the PI remains in place.” Fatbrain AI shareholders also filed two lawsuits against Fatbrain AI executives, including Moe, Ritz, and Genius, alleging violations of federal securities laws in connection with the merger. However, Genius Group has stated the injunction forced it to break Singapore law by halting employee compensation. “We never dreamed that it was possible that a US court could block the company from being able to issue shares, raise funds, or buy Bitcoin — all actions that would normally be decided by a public company's shareholders or Board rather than a court.” Japanese Gaming Firm Enish Announces Bitcoin Investment Japanese game developer Enish has announced a strategic investment of 100 million yen ($660,000) in Bitcoin . The purchase is set to be completed between April 1 and April 4. The acquisition is part of a broader initiative to deepen the company’s understanding of blockchain technology and enhance its game development capabilities. The game developer plans to integrate crypto assets into its financial strategy while leveraging BTC’s liquidity, market stability, and potential long-term growth. The company also plans to allocate a portion of its liquid funds to Bitcoin, conduct quarterly market valuations of its Bitcoin assets, and include any gains or losses in its financial statement. It has also pledged to disclose any significant market event that could impact its performance. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the red during the ongoing session after giving up most of the day’s gains and trading marginally down at $83,200. BTC attempted a rally during the ongoing session but could only push to the 20-day SMA before losing momentum. BTC’s price action indicates its growing correlation with the traditional markets as governments and major institutions ramp up their interest in the asset. Block CEO Jack Dorsey weighed in on Bitcoin’s popularity with governments and institutional investors, warning about the increasing influence of these institutions over the flagship cryptocurrency. Dorsey stated that while institutional adoption of Bitcoin was bound to happen, it could impact the cryptocurrency’s foundational principles. Dorsey also warned that becoming solely a store of value could reduce Bitcoin's usefulness in regular transactions. BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising to an intraday high of $88,839. However, it lost momentum after encountering selling pressure and volatility. As a result, BTC registered marginal declines on Tuesday and Wednesday, slipping below $87,000 and settling at $86,942. The price registered a marginal increase on Thursday to reclaim $87,000 and settle at $87,236. Bearish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC plunged below the 200-day SMA and $85,000 to settle at $84,422. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC fell over 2% on Saturday and 0.36% on Sunday and settled at $82,404. Source: TradingView The flagship cryptocurrency encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $82,511. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 3%, moving past the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $85,150. The price surged to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified in the leadup to Trump’s Liberation Day speech. However, sentiment turned bearish, and BTC fell over 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $82,535. BTC recovered on Thursday despite overwhelming selling pressure, rising almost 1% to $83,199. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. The RSI is just under the neutral zone, while the MACD has a slight bullish bias, indicating buyers have the upper hand. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42918845,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146505,1743808820,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Significant $25M USDC Transfer: DWF Labs Backs Trump’s DeFi Venture – What’s Next?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dwf-labs-usdc-trump-defi/,"In a move that’s sending ripples through the crypto sphere, prominent digital asset market maker DWF Labs has reportedly transferred a substantial $25 million in USDC to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project linked to the Trump family. This news, initially brought to light by Onchain Lens on X, has sparked intense speculation and debate about the intersection of traditional finance, decentralized finance (DeFi), and political influence within the cryptocurrency landscape. What does this USDC transfer signify, and what could it mean for the future of crypto investments and political engagement in the digital asset space? Why is DWF Labs Making a Bold Crypto Investment in a Trump DeFi Project? DWF Labs is no stranger to making headlines with strategic crypto investments . Known for their active participation in the digital asset market and their support for various blockchain projects, their decision to inject $25 million into World Liberty Financial raises several key questions. Let’s break down what we know about DWF Labs and why this move could be strategically important: Who is DWF Labs? DWF Labs is a global digital asset market maker and multi-stage web3 investment firm. They are known for providing liquidity, market making services, and investment to crypto projects across various sectors. Their portfolio includes investments in numerous well-known crypto platforms and protocols. Strategic Diversification: DWF Labs’ investment in WLFI could be seen as a strategic diversification of their portfolio. Investing in a project with a unique political angle, especially one associated with a prominent figure like the Trump family, could open up new avenues and markets within the DeFi space. High-Growth Potential: DeFi projects, while inherently risky, offer the potential for high growth. DWF Labs might be betting on the potential of WLFI to attract a specific user base or community, leveraging the Trump brand and network. Market Influence: A significant investment like this can have a considerable impact on market sentiment. It signals confidence in the WLFI project and potentially the broader DeFi market, attracting further attention and investment. Understanding World Liberty Financial (WLFI): The Trump Family’s DeFi Venture World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is positioned as a Trump DeFi project , leveraging the name and potentially the network associated with the Trump family. While details about WLFI might still be emerging, here’s what we can infer and consider about this project: Brand Association: The clear association with the Trump name is a significant factor. It brings immediate name recognition and could attract a specific demographic of users who are supporters of the Trump political brand. DeFi Ambitions: As a DeFi project, WLFI likely aims to offer decentralized financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, or yield farming. The specifics of their offerings will be crucial in determining their success and appeal. Community Focus: Projects associated with public figures often aim to build a strong community. WLFI may be targeting a community that aligns with the political and ideological stances often associated with the Trump brand. Potential for Innovation or Niche Market: To stand out in the crowded DeFi space, WLFI will likely need to offer unique features, target a niche market, or innovate in some aspect of decentralized finance. The connection to a political brand could be their unique selling proposition. The Significance of a $25 Million USDC Transfer in the Crypto World A $25 million USDC transfer is a substantial amount in the cryptocurrency world, especially for a DeFi project in its early stages. Let’s examine why this amount is significant and what it could enable for WLFI: Aspect Significance of $25M USDC Liquidity Injection Provides WLFI with significant capital to bootstrap operations, develop their platform, and offer attractive incentives to early users.

Why China’s 34% Tariffs on U.S. Goods Could Propel ETH 250% Ethereum price traded near $1,820 on Friday, rising 1.6% in a muted performance compared to broader market leaders. While Bitcoin ( BTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and XRP all rallied over 3%, ETH lagged behind. However, China’s 34% tariffs on U.S. imports introduce fresh volatility triggers that could accelerate ETH’s upside momentum. BTC/Nasdaq Correlation Hits 37-Day Low Amid Trade War Tensions Markets reacted sharply to China’s unexpected decision to impose 34% tariffs on a broad range of U.S. imports. Equities dipped in early trading, but crypto assets remained largely resilient. According to TradingView data, Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq 100 fell to 0.42, its lowest level since February 25. Bitcoin Price Correlation to NASDAQ 100 | BTCUSD Historically, such divergence signals capital rotation. When equities experience trade-related instability, investors often seek alternative hedges, initially favouring Bitcoin. If momentum continues, ETH price typically follows with steeper gains. Reallocation Accelerates as Macro Risks Intensify The current geopolitical backdrop mirrors 2019, when market turbulence from COVID-19 lockdowns led to increased capital inflows into crypto. With global retaliation measures now escalating following Trump’s tariff rollout, ETH price could soon surpass the $1,900 resistance level and sustain a broader uptrend. US Fed Rate Pause Could Boost Ethereum’s DeFi Ecosystem Following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting, another rate pause now seems likely. If traditional savings and treasury yields remain low, investors may shift capital into DeFi for higher returns. As the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum’s DeFi sector could see rising demand, increasing ETH accumulation. If additional retaliatory trade measures emerge, alternative assets like ETH may gain further traction. ETH Price Forecast: Falling Wedge Pattern Hints at a 250% Rally Ethereum price is forming a falling wedge, a historically bullish pattern suggesting a potential 250% breakout toward $3,200. ETH is testing the wedge’s upper boundary near $1,900, with confirmation requiring a sustained close above this level. The MACD indicator signals early bullish momentum, with an imminent MACD line crossover. If buyers sustain pressure above VWAP at $1,804, ETH could confirm the wedge breakout and accelerate higher. ETH Price Forecast However, rejection at $1,900 could invalidate the bullish outlook, exposing ETH to $1,600 support. A breakdown below this level might send prices toward $1,400, aligning with historical support zones. Ethereum next move depends on Bitcoin’s strength and macroeconomic trends. If ETH breaks out, it could mirror past parabolic rallies, but failure to breach resistance may lead to deeper corrections before a true recovery. Traders should monitor volume and momentum for confirmation.

42919118,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146506,1743809414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Uncertain Path Ahead: Jerome Powell’s Warning on Monetary Policy & Interest Rates,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/powell-uncertain-monetary-policy/,"In a world where every whisper from the U.S. Federal Reserve can send ripples across the cryptocurrency market, Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent speech has sparked both intrigue and anxiety. Crypto enthusiasts and investors are keenly watching every move, trying to decipher the future trajectory of monetary policy. Powell’s message? It’s simply too early to chart a definitive course. Jerome Powell’s Cautious Stance on Monetary Policy Addressing an audience of economists and financial experts, Jerome Powell, the head of the U.S. central bank, delivered a nuanced message that essentially boiled down to ‘wait and see.’ He emphasized that the Federal Reserve is in no rush to commit to a specific direction for monetary policy. This cautious approach comes at a time when the global economic landscape is riddled with uncertainties, from trade tensions to fluctuating inflation rates. Powell’s words suggest a period of careful observation and data analysis before any firm decisions are made about the future of interest rates and the overall monetary environment. Key takeaways from Powell’s speech: Patience is Paramount: The Fed is prepared to take its time before deciding on the appropriate path for monetary policy. This signals a data-dependent approach, where decisions will be guided by incoming economic indicators. Tariff Impact Under Scrutiny: Powell acknowledged that the economic impact of tariffs could be more significant than initially anticipated. This is a crucial point, as trade policies can have a cascading effect on inflation and economic growth. Inflation Vigilance: The Fed is committed to ensuring that price increases do not translate into persistent inflation. This highlights their focus on maintaining price stability, a core mandate of central banks. Presidential Pressure: It’s no secret that President Trump has been vocal in his calls for interest rate cuts. Powell’s remarks come against this backdrop of political pressure, adding another layer of complexity to the Fed’s decision-making process. Decoding the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Dilemma What exactly is behind this ‘wait and see’ approach to monetary policy? Several factors are likely contributing to the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance. The global economic outlook is far from clear-cut. While the U.S. economy has shown resilience, there are concerns about a potential slowdown. Globally, trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and varying growth rates across different regions create a complex and somewhat unpredictable environment. In this context, committing to a definitive monetary policy path could be premature and potentially risky. Factors influencing the Fed’s monetary policy decisions: Global Economic Uncertainty: The interconnected nature of the global economy means that events in one part of the world can have ripple effects elsewhere. The Fed must consider these global dynamics when formulating its monetary policy. Trade Tensions and Tariffs: As Powell explicitly mentioned, the impact of tariffs is a significant concern. Tariffs can disrupt supply chains, increase costs for businesses, and ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers, contributing to inflation. Domestic Economic Data: The Fed closely monitors a range of domestic economic data, including employment figures, inflation metrics, consumer spending, and business investment. These indicators provide crucial insights into the health of the U.S. economy and guide monetary policy decisions. Inflation Expectations: Beyond current inflation, the Fed also pays close attention to inflation expectations. If businesses and consumers expect inflation to rise, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Managing these expectations is a key part of the Fed’s job. Political Pressure: While the Federal Reserve is designed to be independent, it cannot completely ignore political considerations. President Trump’s repeated calls for lower interest rates add a layer of external pressure that the Fed must navigate. Inflation Concerns and the Fed’s Response Powell’s emphasis on ensuring that price increases don’t lead to persistent inflation is particularly noteworthy. Inflation, the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, is a critical economic indicator. While moderate inflation is generally considered healthy, high or runaway inflation can erode purchasing power, destabilize the economy, and negatively impact financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: to promote maximum employment and maintain price stability. Keeping inflation in check is central to fulfilling the latter part of this mandate. How the Fed manages inflation: Interest Rate Adjustments: The primary tool the Fed uses to manage inflation is adjusting the federal funds rate, the target range for the overnight lending rate between banks. Raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, which can cool down economic activity and curb inflationary pressures. Conversely, lowering rates can stimulate borrowing and spending. Open Market Operations: The Fed also conducts open market operations, buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply and interest rates. Forward Guidance: Communicating its intentions and outlook to the public, known as forward guidance, is another important tool. By providing clarity about its future policy plans, the Fed can influence market expectations and shape economic behavior. Powell’s recent speech itself is an example of forward guidance, albeit one emphasizing uncertainty. Monitoring Economic Data: Continuously tracking inflation data, along with other economic indicators, is essential for the Fed to assess inflationary pressures and adjust its policy response as needed. Interest Rates Under Scrutiny: What’s Next for Interest Rates? The question on everyone’s mind is, what will the Federal Reserve do with interest rates? President Trump’s repeated calls for rate cuts add significant weight to this question. Lower interest rates can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. However, they can also fuel inflation and potentially lead to asset bubbles. The Fed must carefully weigh these competing considerations. Powell’s statement that it is “too early to tell” suggests that the Fed is not yet convinced that rate cuts are necessary or appropriate at this juncture. They are likely waiting for more data to clarify the economic outlook and the trajectory of inflation before making any decisive moves on interest rates. Possible scenarios for interest rates: Rate Hikes on Hold: Powell’s remarks strongly suggest that further interest rate hikes are unlikely in the near term. The Fed appears to be in a pause mode, assessing the economic landscape. Potential Rate Cuts: While not explicitly stated, the possibility of future rate cuts cannot be ruled out, especially if economic data weakens or if inflation remains stubbornly low. However, the bar for rate cuts seems to be relatively high at this point. Data-Dependent Approach: The Fed’s future actions on interest rates will be heavily dependent on incoming economic data. Stronger-than-expected growth and rising inflation could prompt a more hawkish stance, while weaker data could lead to a more dovish approach. Balancing Act: The Fed is engaged in a delicate balancing act, trying to support economic growth while keeping inflation under control. Navigating this balance in an uncertain global environment is a significant challenge. Navigating Uncertainty in Monetary Policy: Implications for Crypto For the cryptocurrency market, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions are crucial. Lower interest rates can sometimes be seen as positive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets compared to traditional interest-bearing investments. Conversely, rising interest rates can make safer, yield-generating assets more attractive, potentially dampening enthusiasm for crypto. The current uncertainty surrounding monetary policy creates a period of both risk and opportunity for the crypto space. Impact on the crypto market: Volatility Potential: Uncertainty often leads to volatility. As markets try to interpret the Fed’s signals and anticipate future policy moves, we can expect price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies. Inflation Hedge Narrative: If inflation concerns persist or intensify, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, might be viewed as a potential hedge against inflation, potentially increasing demand. Dollar Strength: Monetary policy decisions can influence the strength of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes be correlated with increased interest in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Institutional Investment: Clarity on monetary policy can provide a more stable macroeconomic backdrop, potentially encouraging institutional investment in the crypto space. Conversely, uncertainty might make institutions more cautious. In conclusion, Jerome Powell’s recent speech underscores the prevailing uncertainty surrounding the future path of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is adopting a patient and data-dependent approach, carefully monitoring economic developments and global risks. For the cryptocurrency market, this period of uncertainty translates into both challenges and opportunities. Staying informed, understanding the nuances of monetary policy, and being prepared for potential volatility will be key for navigating the evolving landscape.

Users can now purchase, transfer, or sell these assets directly from their accounts. This new rollout is expected to happen in the coming few weeks. Once live, it will increase PayPal’s supported digital coins to seven, according to a recent announcement . According to May Zabaneh from PayPal, this new addition would serve PayPal’s goal of increasing its presence in the broader crypto market. It will open PayPal to a larger segment of crypto users including data providers, developers, and retail investors. PayPal seems to be betting on crypto for the long-term. The platform believes that crypto and digital assets will become a major part of digital commerce, despite the temporary volatility in the market. PayPal is racing to adopt crypto While the current CEO of PayPal, Alex Chriss has not said much about PayPal’s plans for crypto adoption, Dan Schulman, the previous CEO has been an open advocate of crypto integration. In 2022, the previous CEO mentioned, “the intersection between digital currencies and the digital wallet is a clear opportunity.” PayPal integrated crypto for the first time in October 2022. At that time, the company allowed US customers to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash directly from the app. Later, PayPal users got a new crypto checkout feature in March, 2021. This new feature made it easier for users to spend their cryptocurrencies at various merchants. The crypto would automatically get converted into fiat currency during a sale.

According to a Bloomberg report , this effort is happening in Washington, where lobbyists for Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc. believe they have their best chance yet to challenge Microsoft Corp.’s dominance in government software. By aligning their message with DOGE’s focus on trimming costs, they hope to persuade policymakers that Microsoft’s contracts lead to overspending and lock agencies into outdated tools. DOGE, which is Musk’s brainchild, has already raised questions about the cost of technology across government agencies. Amazon and Google’s lobbyists, in large part through technology trade groups such as NetChoice, are amplifying those questions. They are calling attention to Microsoft’s contracts, arguing that new solutions could offer better prices and more modern products. These lobbyists have reached out to lawmakers known informally as the “DOGE caucus,” along with DOGE contacts at various federal agencies. Microsoft believes Google and Amazon are using a backdoor approach to gain government contracts Microsoft’s spokesperson, Alex Haurek, said the company is not surprised by these lobbying tactics. In a statement, Haurek described certain industry players as “trying to manipulate decision makers, through shadowy front groups, rather than competing transparently on price and quality.” Google has a clear aim, which is to dislodge the legacy systems on which many government agencies rely, including Microsoft Outlook and Word. Meanwhile, Amazon wants to tilt the playing field in cloud computing, an area where it claims Microsoft has used unfair strategies by bundling software and cloud services together. Some observers believe that Musk’s network of mostly young engineers at DOGE may be open to these changes, given the agency’s stated mission to overhaul how the government spends money. Though these companies have historically relied on inside connections, they now find themselves appealing to a newer group of decision-makers. Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Service Administration, is a former software executive. He has met with trade groups about possible changes in how software licenses are purchased. On March 26, Federal Chief Information Officer Greg Barbaccia directed all federal agencies to compile an inventory of their licenses with the government’s five largest software providers. At the top of that list is Microsoft. Barbaccia once worked for Palantir, a firm founded by Peter Thiel, and he framed this move as part of an effort to stop what he called “wasteful spending.” Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa who founded the DOGE Caucus in the Senate, is championing legislation that would make agencies consolidate their software licenses and adopt updated enterprise license agreements. Ernst has cited estimates that such moves could save about $750 million every year. The House introduced its version of the legislation in late March. NetChoice, whose members include Amazon and Google, has led the charge for new solutions. In a March letter to DOGE, NetChoice called Microsoft’s role in government software a “monopoly” and said it results in excessive prices and “abysmal cybersecurity performance.” A Government Accountability Office report estimated that the government invests over $100 billion every year on IT and cyber-related projects, including licenses. Leading software vendors by total payments reported by agencies in fiscal year 2021. Source: GAO analysis of agency data Microsoft alone accounted for 31% of software-license spending by 24 major federal agencies in fiscal year 2021. This total reached $2.4 billion and was roughly three times as much as its closest competitor. Exact figures for Microsoft’s total government business remain unclear, as the company does not share detailed data. Still, these numbers signal that the stakes are high for any company seeking to challenge Microsoft’s leadership. One tech lobbyist working with Microsoft’s rivals feels hopeful about chances for Google and Amazon in the face of DOGE’s emphasis on cost-cutting. That optimism grows from Musk’s earlier criticism of agencies for buying more software licenses than the number of workers who would actually use them, and for spending too much on those licenses. In an earlier podcast with Senator Ted Cruz, Musk said that in every government department, “there are far too many software licenses and media subscriptions, more than there are humans in the department.” Elon Musk speaking about government software spending in a podcast by Ted Cruz. Source: Verdict with Ted Cruz on YouTube Google spokesperson José Castañeda stated, “We’ve said for ages that government IT needs more competition to save taxpayers money and improve security, so it’s no surprise that legacy players prefer the status quo and criticize those who want change.” Microsoft has come under scrutiny from Musk’s circle for recent breaches and failures In 2023, Chinese state-affiliated hackers compromised Microsoft’s cloud environment, affecting tens of thousands of U.S. government emails, including accounts belonging to then-Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. There was a report in April 2024 from a government-appointed cyber advisory board that studied the hack and criticized Microsoft’s handling of the incident. It noted that the breach occurred just before a meeting between then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Then, in July 2024, a global failure tied to a faulty update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. disrupted Microsoft systems, halting airline flights and business operations worldwide. Critics seized on these events to argue that government reliance on Microsoft poses risks. Chris Mohr, president of the Software Information Industry Association, said in an interview that Microsoft’s dominance “led to systemic risk.” SIIA has Google and Amazon among its members. He believes DOGE is correct to say that software contracts could be handled more effectively to limit cybersecurity threats and cut costs. Some of the technology trade groups have zeroed in on just such solutions in their conversations with DOGE. They urge the agency to encourage competition in software contracts, claiming it can drive down costs and reduce security vulnerabilities. NetChoice, for example, has proposed measures aimed at blocking what it calls Microsoft’s “predatory” licensing deals, which it believes keep agencies from exploring rival offers. According to Amy Bos, NetChoice’s director of state and federal affairs who drafted the March 14 letter, the group was encouraged when DOGE said it was looking for cost-saving measures. She said, “We had something that was perfectly lined up for this.” The letter argues that removing Microsoft’s tight grip on government software would unlock billions in potential contracts for other firms. Microsoft counters that it earns its share by offering better deals and superior products. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

On April 4th alone, this whale purchased 4,100 ETH at a price of $1,785, spending approximately $7.32 million. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Since March 26th, the same wallet has accumulated a total of 33,441 ETH. Let’s break down the numbers: Total ETH Accumulated: 33,441 ETH Total USD Value (Approximate): $65.5 million Average Purchase Price: $1,959 per ETH Recent Purchase (April 4th): 4,100 ETH at $1,785 ($7.32 million) Period of Accumulation: Since March 26th To put this into perspective, $65.5 million is a substantial investment, even in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. This level of whale activity often indicates strong conviction in the asset’s future potential. But what exactly makes this accumulation noteworthy, and what could be driving this whale’s confidence in Ethereum? Why is ETH Accumulation by Whales Significant for the Crypto Market? Whale movements are often considered leading indicators in the crypto market for several reasons: Market Sentiment Indicator: Large accumulations like this can signal a bullish sentiment among major players. When whales, who have significant capital and often sophisticated market insights, start buying heavily, it can be interpreted as a sign that they anticipate price appreciation. Supply Dynamics: Significant ETH accumulation reduces the available supply of ETH on exchanges. If demand remains constant or increases, reduced supply can lead to upward pressure on prices. Trendsetter Behavior: Whale actions can sometimes trigger a herd effect. Observing large players accumulating an asset can instill confidence in smaller investors and traders, encouraging them to also buy, further driving up demand. Institutional Interest Proxy: While not always the case, whale activity can sometimes be a proxy for institutional interest. Large entities often operate through multiple wallets, making it challenging to pinpoint institutional involvement directly, but significant on-chain movements are often scrutinized for such clues. However, it’s crucial to remember that whale activity is just one piece of the puzzle. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. While whale accumulation can be a positive signal, it’s not a guaranteed predictor of price movements. Decoding Whale Strategies: What Can We Learn from This ETH Accumulation? Understanding the ‘why’ behind such massive cryptocurrency investment is crucial. While we can only speculate on the whale’s exact motivations, here are a few possible scenarios: Long-Term Bullish Outlook on Ethereum: The whale may believe in Ethereum’s long-term potential as a leading blockchain platform for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs. This accumulation could be a strategic move to position themselves for future growth in the Ethereum ecosystem. Anticipation of Ethereum Upgrades: Ethereum has been undergoing significant upgrades, including the transition to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge) and ongoing scalability improvements. The whale might be anticipating that these upgrades will enhance Ethereum’s value proposition and drive price appreciation. Diversification and Portfolio Rebalancing: For large investors, diversification is key. This ETH accumulation could be part of a broader portfolio rebalancing strategy, shifting assets towards cryptocurrencies, and specifically Ethereum, based on perceived market opportunities. Strategic Market Timing: The whale may have identified the current price levels as attractive entry points. Accumulating ETH at an average price of $1,959 suggests a belief that Ethereum is undervalued at these levels and has significant upside potential. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain and others to track whale movements and significant transactions. This can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential trends. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t blindly follow whale activity. Always conduct thorough research on projects, understand the underlying technology, and assess the risks involved before making any investment decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies, consider using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price, which can help mitigate the risks of market volatility. Manage Risk: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and always diversify your portfolio across different asset classes. Ethereum’s Potential and Whale Confidence: A Look Ahead Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized web. Its robust ecosystem, active developer community, and ongoing technological advancements position it as a leading platform for innovation. This crypto market analysis of whale accumulation suggests that significant investors recognize this potential and are strategically positioning themselves for future growth. While the future of the crypto market remains uncertain, the actions of this smart whale provide an intriguing glimpse into the sentiment of large players. Whether this accumulation marks the beginning of a new bull run for Ethereum or simply reflects a strategic long-term investment, it underscores the importance of monitoring whale activity and staying informed in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Watching the Whales The recent $65 million ETH accumulation by a single whale serves as a powerful reminder of the significant influence large investors can have on the crypto market. While it’s essential to avoid blindly following any single market signal, understanding whale activity can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. By staying informed, conducting thorough research, and managing risk effectively, crypto enthusiasts can navigate the exciting and often unpredictable world of digital assets with greater confidence.

As traditional markets reeled from the shockwaves of new tariff announcements, the crypto world, particularly Bitcoin, watched with bated breath. Powell’s recent statements offer crucial insights into the Fed’s current thinking and its potential implications for both traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s dive into what Powell’s words mean for the economy and your crypto portfolio. Decoding Powell’s Message: Federal Reserve’s Steady Hand Speaking at the SABEW conference, Jerome Powell addressed the elephant in the room – market volatility spurred by President Trump’s latest tariff initiatives. His message was clear: the Federal Reserve is adopting a wait-and-see approach. Despite the turbulence in the stock market, Powell indicated that the Fed is not yet ready to make immediate adjustments to its monetary policy . This stance suggests a level of confidence within the Fed that current market fluctuations, while significant, do not warrant immediate intervention. Here’s a breakdown of the key takeaways from Powell’s address regarding the Federal Reserve ’s current position: Patience is Paramount: The Fed is prioritizing data analysis and seeking further clarity before making any policy shifts. This signals a cautious approach, avoiding knee-jerk reactions to market fluctuations. Inflation Focus Remains: Powell reiterated the Fed’s primary focus on controlling inflation. He acknowledged the potential for tariff-driven price increases but characterized these as likely to be temporary. Ignoring External Pressure: Despite public calls from President Trump for interest rate cuts, Powell’s comments suggest the Fed remains independent and data-driven in its decision-making process. Monitoring Global Developments: While not explicitly stated in this excerpt, the Fed is undoubtedly keeping a close watch on global economic developments, which are increasingly interconnected with U.S. market stability. Jerome Powell on Inflation and Temporary Price Hikes A central theme in Jerome Powell ‘s remarks was the issue of inflation. He specifically addressed concerns that tariffs could lead to sustained price increases. However, Powell conveyed a sense of optimism, suggesting that the inflationary pressures resulting from tariffs are expected to be transient. This perspective is crucial for understanding the Fed’s reluctance to immediately alter its monetary policy . Powell’s confidence in the temporary nature of tariff-induced inflation likely stems from several factors: Supply Chain Adjustments: Businesses may find ways to mitigate tariff impacts by diversifying supply chains or absorbing some costs. Consumer Demand Elasticity: Increased prices due to tariffs could potentially dampen consumer demand, naturally limiting the extent of price increases. Broader Economic Factors: The Fed’s overall assessment of the economy, beyond tariffs, likely plays a significant role. If underlying economic conditions are deemed stable, temporary price shocks may be viewed as manageable. Navigating Market Turmoil : Powell’s Words as a Stabilizing Force? The timing of Powell’s speech was particularly significant. Coming on the heels of President Trump’s tariff announcement, which triggered a wave of selling in U.S. stocks, his words were closely scrutinized for any hints of reassurance or concern. The market turmoil was palpable, with investors seeking guidance amidst the uncertainty. Did Powell’s address calm the nerves, or did it add to the unease? While U.S. stocks continued their decline even after Powell’s comments, the reaction could have been far more severe. Powell’s steady demeanor and message of patience might have prevented a deeper plunge. In times of market turmoil , clear and consistent communication from central bank leaders is vital. Powell’s emphasis on data-driven decision-making and the Fed’s commitment to its mandate could be interpreted as a stabilizing force, assuring markets that policy responses will be measured and thoughtful, not reactive and impulsive. Monetary Policy Unchanged: What Does it Mean for Crypto? The Fed’s decision to hold steady on monetary policy has ripple effects across various asset classes, and the cryptocurrency market is no exception. While traditional markets reacted negatively to the tariff news and Powell’s non-committal stance on immediate policy changes, Bitcoin displayed a surprising degree of stability. This divergence raises an interesting question: how does the current monetary policy landscape influence the crypto sphere, particularly Bitcoin ? Here are a few potential connections: Factor Impact on Bitcoin Stable Monetary Policy Reduced volatility compared to traditional markets reacting to policy uncertainty. Inflation Concerns (albeit temporary, according to Powell) Potential safe-haven appeal for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, even if perceived as temporary. Continued Low Interest Rate Environment (implied by no immediate policy shift) May encourage investors to seek higher-yield assets, potentially including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Global Economic Uncertainty Increased interest in decentralized and borderless assets like Bitcoin as alternatives to traditional systems. Bitcoin ‘s Resilience: A Digital Safe Haven in Turbulent Times? Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this market episode is Bitcoin ‘s relative stability. While U.S. stocks experienced a notable downturn, Bitcoin remained remarkably steady, hovering around the $83,000 mark. This resilience fuels the ongoing narrative of Bitcoin as a potential ‘digital gold’ or safe-haven asset, particularly in times of economic uncertainty and market turmoil . Why might Bitcoin be showing such resilience? Decentralization Appeal: Bitcoin operates outside the traditional financial system and is not directly influenced by central bank monetary policy decisions in the same way as traditional assets. Global Investor Base: Bitcoin ‘s global nature diversifies its investor base, potentially reducing sensitivity to specific regional economic shocks, such as U.S. tariff announcements. Limited Supply Narrative: The fixed supply of 21 million Bitcoin coins continues to resonate with investors, particularly in inflationary environments or when fiat currencies face potential devaluation. Emerging Asset Class Status: Bitcoin is still considered by many as an emerging asset class with growth potential, attracting investors seeking diversification and higher returns, even amidst market turmoil . Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainty with a Watchful Eye Jerome Powell’s recent address provides a crucial snapshot of the Federal Reserve’s current thinking. His message of patience and focus on data, amidst market turmoil and external pressures, suggests a steady hand at the helm of U.S. monetary policy . For the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin , this period of uncertainty and traditional market volatility could further solidify its narrative as a resilient and potentially safe-haven asset. As we move forward, keeping a close watch on both traditional economic indicators and the evolving crypto landscape will be paramount for navigating the complexities of the global financial system.

China’s trade tariffs fueled a Bitcoin-led crypto rally. Ripple (XRP) sees gains China tariffs sparks crypto market recovery Ripple (XRP) price posted considerable gains on Friday climbing as high as $2.17, as China’s tariffs on the US introduce fresh volatility risks. The global crypto market cap erased losses from Wednesday’s sell-off as China announced retaliatory tariffs on Friday. Investors now fear these measures could impact revenues of U.S. firms worldwide, with concerns mounting as more countries consider retaliatory actions. Crypto market performance, April 4 | Source: Coingecko If the U.S. fails to find a diplomatic solution, equities could slide further, accelerating capital rotation into alternative assets. Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against trade policy risks, prompting fund inflows into the crypto market. According to Coingecko data, the total market cap stabilised around $2.78 trillion, with major assets reclaiming key support levels—Bitcoin at $83,000, Ripple price at $2, and Ethereum breaking above $1,800. XRP Price Forecast: XRP Eyes $2.28 as Bullish Reversal Gains Momentum XRP price surged 12.54% in two days, reclaiming the $2.12 level amid strengthening bullish momentum. The rally coincides with an early MACD crossover and a recovery within the Bollinger Bands’ lower boundary. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential volatility expansion after XRP touched the lower band at $1.98 and rebounded sharply. The mid-band resistance at $2.28 aligns with the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $2.09, reinforcing a crucial test for sustained upside. Ripple (XRP) price analysis | Source: TradingView A breakout above these levels could fuel a rally toward $2.58, where the upper Bollinger Band sits. Meanwhile, MACD lines are narrowing, with the blue line approaching an upward crossover. If confirmed, this would mark a bullish reversal, echoing past rallies from similar levels. However, Bitcoin price forecast remains a critical factor, as BTC’s next move could influence XRP’s trajectory. If Bitcoin maintains bullish sentiment, XRP could benefit from broader market strength. Failure to break the $2.28 resistance could trigger another retest of $1.98 support, risking further declines. However, as long as XRP holds above the VWAP, the technical setup leans bullish, suggesting higher probability for further gains.

Martinez points to the bearish patterns on Ethereum’s monthly ETH/BTC chart, specifically mentioning a double-top or M pattern, signaling a 91% drop. If this happens, Ethereum could drop to as low as 0.0020 BTC from its current price of 0.02205 BTC, which is equivalent to $1,866 at Bitcoin’s $84,600 price, according to the market trends. The absence of whales also shows a drop in confidence, pushing investors to seek alternatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE amid Ethereum’s looming storm. Bitcoin’s Resistance Battle: A Death Cross Threat Martinez also discussed Bitcoin, noting that its recent drop below the 200-day and 50-day moving average, now acting as resistances at $86,200 and $88,300. As of April 04, 2025, Bitcoin trades at $84,600, down by 5% in the past week, with its daily volume around $32 billion, according to web data. Martinez has warned that the failure of the asset to break these levels could trigger a “death cross”, a bearish signal showing a likelihood of a further drop, which could see the asset moving to $80,000, as predicted by Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered. Bitcoin’s $1.6 trillion market cap also shows stability in the market, but its 19 million circulating supply might cause issues. With Bitcoin and Ethereum currently facing uncertainties, investors have been eyeing new opportunities to evade the market’s turbulence. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Breakout Moment: Targeting $1 As Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to battle with the bears, MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as the best option for investors, with the token aiming at $1 by 2025. Its presale raised about $5 million on April 04, with Stage 6 sold out at $0.000266 and a listing price of $0.007 securing the predicted 2,500% ROI. Analysts predict a 14,185% rise to push the asset to $1, which means a $100 investment could return $142,000. The project has also seen the support of its 50,000 supporter base, with about 10,000 joining every week across 30 countries in addition to its audit that was carried out by Hashex. Stage 7 is 90% sold out in days, with posts on X showing that whales’ interest is mirroring that of Ethereum but with higher chances of gain. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s DeFi lending push could ride on Ethereum’s woes, offering a high-growth alternative. ETH’s Crash vs. MAGACOIN’s Rise: A Shifting Tide Ethereum’s potential 91% drop to 0.0020 BTC–in addition to Bitcoin’s resistance at $88,300, paints a bad picture for the crypto giants. The $1.42 billion whale sell-offs in the Ethereum market and Bitcoin’s $32 billion volume have signaled caution, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 million presale in three months presents the best opportunity to investors. Investors fleeing from Ethereum because of its bearish M pattern see MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $1 target as the best opportunity, comparing it to the early 2021 Dogecoin run. While stability has met uncertainty in the BTC and ETH markets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering investors the best opportunity for escape in the current shaky market.

One project making waves is BlockDAG (BDAG). Its ongoing presale has already brought in more than $211.5 million, selling over 19.1 billion coins at just $0.0248 during Batch 27. These numbers reflect strong backing and place BlockDAG among the best crypto projects in 2025 priced under $1. This momentum isn’t based on hype. BlockDAG uses DAG technology, works with both EVM and WASM, runs a live Beta Testnet, and offers a $30 million grant program for developers. These real features show it’s more than a typical altcoin. Built as a complete Layer 1 platform, it has actual use cases and a growing base, appealing to both individual buyers and larger entities. BlockDAG (BDAG): Presale Gem with Huge ROI Potential Among many digital coins, BlockDAG (BDAG) sets itself apart with a solid structure. Unlike older blockchain designs, it uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to handle many transactions at once. This design leads to better speed, quicker confirmations, and lower fees. Developers can also benefit from its EVM and WASM compatibility. This lets them build apps in different languages, making BlockDAG suitable for DeFi, NFTs, AI, and other tools with real-world use. These tech advantages help position it as one of the best crypto projects in 2025. Already, the project has a Beta Testnet running across more than 100 global nodes. Unlike projects that only have plans on paper during presale, BlockDAG is showing real-time network activity, boosting its standing among new digital assets. Why BDAG Attracts Whales in the Presale Phase The presale model used by BlockDAG is open and rewarding. At a current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27, early backers have seen gains of 2,480% from the original price of $0.001 in Batch 1. With each batch climbing slightly in cost, those who joined early have already gained before the coin reaches any exchanges. If BDAG reaches $1 in 2025, as some experts predict after it launches on trading platforms and grows its system, early supporters could see profits of over 3,900%. This potential rise is why it’s often included in lists of the best crypto projects in 2025. Presale details include: Raised: Over $211.5 million Price: $0.0248 (Batch 27) Coins Sold: 19.1 billion+ ROI Since Batch 1: +2,480% Plans for 10 major centralized exchange (CEX) listings are underway. When trading begins, demand could rise quickly, making this one of the last chances to get BDAG before prices move up. These facts help rank BlockDAG among the best crypto projects in 2025. The Graph (GRT): A Key Data Indexing Tool The Graph plays a big role in making blockchain data searchable. Often called the “Google of blockchain,” GRT lets app creators access data across many blockchains, which is critical for building useful platforms. Priced near $0.10 and used by apps like Uniswap, Aave, and Lido, GRT keeps showing strength under $1. As more digital tools need indexed data, GRT is expected to benefit, and it remains among the best crypto projects in 2025. Sei (SEI): Speed-Focused Chain for DeFi Use Sei focuses on speed, ease of use, and large-scale function. Its Twin-Turbo method allows almost instant trades, giving it a clear edge over slower systems. World Liberty Financial’s support of Sei through a large deal has brought it more attention. With a current value of around $0.20, it provides fast tech and cross-chain support, making Sei another pick for those exploring the best crypto projects in 2025. Ethena (ENA): A Stablecoins with USDe Ethena brings something new to stablecoins with its USDe—a secure digital dollar backed by assets. The launch of the Converge blockchain with Securitize and other partnerships adds strength to its base. Its low price and expanding use make it a smart choice for those looking for hidden gems. ENA’s real-use direction helps keep it listed among the best crypto projects in 2025. Summing Up– Best Crypto Projects in 2025 Though The Graph, Sei, and Ethena are all solid options, BlockDAG holds a stronger position. Its active Testnet, scalable DAG tech, big presale returns, and upcoming exchange listings set it apart. Anyone checking out the best crypto projects in 2025 will see BDAG as a strong candidate under $1. With its active growth and strong start, BlockDAG could turn into one of the biggest gainers next year—and early participants are already positioned to benefit.

Official Trump ( TRUMP ) is trading at $9.03 at time of writing and is down more than 13% in the past 24 hours. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that slapped a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods entering the US, effective April 5th, with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. He also issued a proclamation detailing “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of specific countries effective April 9th, with rates totaling up to 54% on China. The tariffs rattled global markets, with the S&P 500 plunging by 4.84% on Thursday and the Nasdaq Composite dropping by 5.97%. Trump’s announcement also battered the crypto sector, with the overall digital asset market cap taking a 6.5% hit. The president launched the Official Trump memecoin in mid-January, days before he took office. The asset has generated controversy in and out of crypto circles. Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

Plume is gaining ground through its AI-based setup for real-world assets (RWAs). Pi Network is moving closer to daily use with its Visa card feature. And BlockDAG is standing out with its strong presale record, working features, and future expansion plans. With $211.5 million raised and 19.1 billion BDAG coins already sold, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the best long-term cryptos to watch for 2025. Let’s look closer at these three best long-term cryptos leading the charts now, showing why BlockDAG is catching more eyes than the rest. BlockDAG (BDAG) Unlike other crypto presales that lean on future goals, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already live with working features and a fast-growing system. In Batch 27, over 19.1 billion coins were sold at $0.0248, drawing interest from thousands of people who have poured in over $211.5 million in record time. A major reason behind BlockDAG’s rise as one of the best long-term cryptos is its core Layer 1 system using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tech. It can handle transactions at the same time instead of one by one like Ethereum. This leads to instant results, no delay, and much lower fees, making it better for regular users, builders, and teams. One more strength lies in its support for both WASM and EVM tools. People building apps can use familiar coding tools while enjoying the speed of DAG-based systems. This mix of ease and fast action has made it popular among DeFi users and app creators. BlockDAG also brings working features like the TG Tap Miner game with over 250,000 players, the X1 Miner App downloaded over 800,000 times, and a full mainnet coming after the testnet in March. These parts are not just ideas—they are working now. There’s more for the community, too. The project has ways for people to earn through staking, referrals, and task rewards. A $30 million grant effort and tie-ups with groups like SpaceDev and HackerEarth are helping to bring in more skilled builders. In an area where many talk big before building anything, BlockDAG has done the opposite—creating first, then spreading the word. This is why BDAG stands as one of the best long term cryptos right now. With exchange listings planned in 2025 and a clear push toward $1, it’s drawing strong interest. Plume (PLUME) Plume is working to become the base for handling real-world asset tokenization. With more than 180 protocols on board and over 18 million wallets linked to its testnet, it’s proving itself as a solid platform for serious financial data and tools. A key edge for Plume is its use of Pond, which adds strong AI tools like credit checks, risk checks, and forecast-based NAV tools into its RWA systems. This setup is not just about blockchain use—it’s helping improve smarter financial planning by using clear, on-chain info. With laws getting clearer around RWAs, tools like Plume might help close the gap between common finance and DeFi. Pi Network (PI) Pi Network is making headlines as it pushes toward real-world function. It recently added Visa card access through Teltlk International, letting people use Pi Coin and USDT for services like Amazon, Apple Pay, and eBay. It’s also adding more features like direct Pi withdrawals, faster access to funds, better KYC steps, and new learning tools through Web3 College. Pi is clearly aiming to be more than just a mining app—it wants to become a full system for payments and learning. Even though Pi still faces hurdles in terms of clear rules and listings, its strong focus on payments may help it reach people outside the usual crypto crowd. Final Thoughts All three—BlockDAG, Plume, and Pi—are building in different directions: one focuses on real payments, one on AI-linked tools for finance, and one on a system that can scale fast. But what sets BlockDAG apart among the best long-term cryptos is how much it has already done—offering DAG-based processing, dApp support, mobile mining, staking, and live tools. Its presale has now passed $211.5 million, and it has sold more than 19.1 billion coins. The testnet is already live, top exchange listings are coming, and there’s a big goal to launch 1,000+ dApps by 2026. For anyone checking the best long term cryptos with real products and early chances for growth, BDAG is clearly worth keeping an eye on.

Forget mundane software updates and integration challenges; the latest headline involves accusations of corporate espionage, secret crypto payments, and a full-blown legal battle between HR giants Rippling and Deel. This isn’t your typical HR Tech Lawsuit ; it’s a high-stakes drama unfolding in Silicon Valley, and it’s captivating the tech industry. Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast is dissecting every twist and turn, and we’re here to bring you up to speed on this explosive saga. The Genesis of the HR Tech Lawsuit: Rippling vs Deel What started as fierce competition in the HR software market has escalated into a dramatic legal showdown. Rippling has publicly accused Deel of engaging in corporate espionage, alleging that Deel paid a Rippling employee to act as an inside mole. The lawsuit claims that Deel orchestrated a scheme involving secret cryptocurrency payments to obtain confidential information from Rippling. According to Rippling’s filing, the employee was allegedly tasked with feeding sensitive data to Deel, painting a picture of calculated infiltration. Deel vehemently denies these accusations, dismissing the lawsuit as a theatrical distraction from Rippling’s own legal woes. Key Allegations in the Rippling vs Deel HR Tech Lawsuit: Corporate Espionage: Rippling accuses Deel of paying a Rippling employee to spy and leak confidential company information. Secret Crypto Payments: The lawsuit details alleged payments made in cryptocurrency to the employee, suggesting an attempt to obscure the transactions. Fake Slack Channel Trap: Rippling claims to have set a trap using a fake Slack channel to catch the alleged mole in action. Smashing the Evidence: Adding a touch of dark comedy to the drama, there’s even an allegation of the employee smashing his corporate espionage phone with an ax at his mother-in-law’s house – described as “the oldest trick in the book” by Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast hosts. Why This Startup Rivalry Exploded into Espionage Claims? The rivalry between Rippling and Deel is no secret. Both companies are major players in the rapidly growing HR tech space, offering comprehensive platforms for payroll, benefits, and HR management, often targeting similar customer segments. This intense startup rivalry in a competitive market can sometimes push boundaries, but the allegations in this HR Tech Lawsuit are unprecedented. The lawsuit highlights the intense pressure and high stakes in the tech industry, where access to competitive intelligence can be perceived as a critical advantage. But is this just aggressive business tactics gone wrong, or a genuine case of corporate espionage? The legal proceedings are likely to be lengthy and revealing. Beyond Rippling Deel: Other Headlines from Bitcoin World’s Equity Podcast While the Rippling Deel saga dominates headlines, Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast also covered other crucial developments in the tech and crypto space this week: Gamifying Tax Filing: A startup is attempting to make tax filing less painful by turning it into a game. However, this innovative approach raises complex copyright questions that the industry is grappling with. Circle’s IPO Ambitions: Stablecoin giant Circle is reportedly moving closer to an IPO. This move is significant for the crypto industry, potentially signaling increased maturity and mainstream acceptance, and could pave the way for other crypto firms to go public. The Relentless AI Race: The AI sector continues its breakneck pace of innovation and investment. Key highlights include OpenAI’s record-breaking funding round, challenges related to GPU availability and performance, Anthropic’s plans to introduce its AI chatbot to colleges, and leadership changes at Google’s Gemini project. The AI race is not just about technological advancements but also about market dominance and ethical considerations. Actionable Insights from the HR Tech Drama and Beyond This Corporate Espionage case, while dramatic, offers some crucial takeaways for businesses and individuals in the tech and crypto space: Insight Description Data Security is Paramount The Rippling Deel lawsuit underscores the critical importance of robust data security measures and employee monitoring to prevent internal threats and data breaches. Competitive Intelligence Ethics While competitive intelligence is a legitimate business practice, this case raises questions about the ethical boundaries and legal ramifications of aggressive tactics, particularly when they cross into espionage. Crypto in Corporate Espionage The alleged use of cryptocurrency for payments in this case highlights the anonymity and potential for misuse of crypto in illicit activities, even in the corporate world. Startup Rivalry Intensity The HR tech sector, and the startup ecosystem in general, is characterized by intense competition. Companies need to be prepared for aggressive tactics from rivals and ensure they operate within legal and ethical boundaries. Conclusion: Spy Games and High Stakes in the Tech World The Rippling vs Deel lawsuit is more than just a legal dispute; it’s a stark reminder of the high stakes and intense competition in the tech industry. The allegations of corporate espionage, secret payments, and dramatic attempts to cover tracks paint a picture of a cutthroat business environment where the lines between aggressive competition and illegal activity can become blurred. As the legal battle unfolds, the tech world will be watching closely, not just for the outcome, but for the lessons it offers about ethics, security, and the true cost of winning in the relentless race for market dominance. The drama in the HR Tech Lawsuit is just beginning, and it promises to be a wild ride.

42920274,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=705788,1743811306,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42920274.jpeg,US Senator Ted Cruz warns about an upcoming bloodbath,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/senator-ted-cruz-warns-bloodbath/,"Republican senator Ted Cruz warned on Friday about a potential “bloodbath” in the 2026 midterm elections if President Donald Trump’s tariffs drag the United States economy into a recession. According to Financial Times , the Texas lawmaker said a long-term trade war could have devastating effects on both the economy and Republican political prospects. Cruz typically aligns with Trump, but his remarks were unusually blunt. He called the possibility of an ongoing conflict with retaliatory tariffs from other nations “a terrible outcome.” In his view, if the tariff standoff leads to a recession, “particularly a bad recession,” voters could turn sharply against the party in power. “2026 in all likelihood politically would be a bloodbath,” Cruz said. The Canada-born Texan added that even the Republican Senate majority, currently 53-47, might not survive if the economy sours and people blame the party leading the country. Republican lawmakers have begun to share these concerns. Their unease intensified when the stock market shed about $5.4 trillion in value after Trump’s so-called “liberation day” levies launched a global market retreat. Observers worry that ongoing trade tensions could hurt U.S. exporters, harm jobs, and worsen inflation if the measures remain in place indefinitely. Democrats want to undo the tariffs On Thursday, Republican senator Chuck Grassley joined forces with a Democrat to introduce a bill that would reassert congressional authority over tariff policy. Under the proposed law, new tariffs would expire in 60 days unless Congress voted to keep them in place. Lawmakers would also have the power to revoke existing levies. By Friday, Republican senators Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnell, Jerry Moran, and Thom Tillis had signed on as co-sponsors. Although the bill may not advance, the growing support suggests that many in the party are wary of the president’s approach and fear potential fallout ahead of the 2026 midterms. Signs of discontent emerged this week when a conservative candidate backed by Elon Musk lost a state supreme court race in Wisconsin to a liberal opponent. Republicans also underperformed their 2024 results in two special House elections in Florida. These setbacks added fuel to doubts that the current trade policy will help the party maintain control of both chambers of Congress. Cruz said that if the U.S. is in the middle of a recession and “people are hurting badly,” they will likely turn on the GOP. “They punish the party in power.” Cruz also disputed Trump’s claim that tariffs will usher in “a booming economy.” He suggested that there would only be “an enormous economic boom” if the U.S. and any retaliating countries lowered duty rates across the board. Otherwise, if tariffs become permanent, he predicted “real damage” to the economy and warned that a full-blown trade war “would destroy jobs here at home.” It would also “have a powerful upward impact on inflation,” the senator cautioned. He warned that further escalation could lock the country into lasting harm. ​ Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

But unlike earlier cycles dominated by hype-only tokens, this quarter’s leading meme coins are backed by real use cases, scarcity-focused tokenomics, and structured roadmaps. Meme coins are maturing—and some are starting to resemble full-scale platforms rather than temporary trends. Among the projects gaining traction, Dragoin ($DDGN) is emerging as one of the most promising. While several meme coins are still finding their footing, Dragoin’s presale model, gaming utility, and decentralization plan are already turning heads. For investors eyeing meme coins with real upside this quarter, Dragoin and a select few others stand out as strong candidates. Dragoin Combines Utility, Scarcity, & Structure Dragoin takes a different approach from the average meme coin. Rather than relying on internet buzz alone, it delivers actual user interaction through a Telegram-based play-to-earn game. Players can hatch dragons, train them, and battle—all while earning $DDGN tokens based on their activity. This kind of gamified utility transforms holders into engaged participants. Its presale adds another layer of strength. Structured into 25 stages, each with a slight price increase, it creates steady upward momentum while rewarding early buyers. Out of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens, 50% are allocated to the presale. Any unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation—a strategy that directly reduces supply over time. This deflationary approach matters. As Dragoin’s game rolls out to a broader audience in Q2 and interest grows, reduced supply paired with rising demand can help support long-term price growth. Unlike many meme coins that rely on sudden virality, Dragoin is strategically building a player base while tightening its token supply. At the end of the presale, ownership of Dragoin’s smart contract will be renounced, making the project fully decentralized. No central figure will hold control. This shift appeals to investors looking for transparency and protection against centralized manipulation. With key features like staking rewards, airdrops, referral bonuses, and listings on major exchanges planned for Q2 and Q3, Dragoin appears well-positioned for sustained momentum. Its combination of meme appeal, gameplay, and token strategy places it among the top new meme coins to buy right now—and potentially throughout 2025. Cheems Attempts a Strategic Pivot in Q2 Cheems remains a well-known meme coin, mostly thanks to its iconic image and lighthearted branding. However, Q2 2025 marks a shift in strategy, as the team introduces charitable initiatives and new staking rewards aimed at rewarding long-term commitment. One of Cheems’ consistent strengths is its strong community. Through regular contests, giveaways, and creator partnerships, the project continues to maintain solid engagement. Still, its deep ties to nostalgia may hold back broader growth, especially in a meme coin space that’s shifting toward functionality. Cheems could still deliver in the short term, but its long-term viability depends on how far it can evolve beyond its meme roots. MEMEX Offers Index-Like Exposure to Meme Coins MEMEX, also known as Meme Index, introduces a fresh way to invest in the meme coin sector. Instead of buying individual tokens, holders get access to a basket of trending meme coins—all bundled into a single asset. This concept is similar to an ETF, giving investors diversified exposure without the need to track multiple charts. With dynamic adjustments and automated tracking of meme coin trends, MEMEX simplifies decision-making. It’s not focused on riding a single project to massive returns. Instead, it spreads risk across the space, allowing holders to benefit from overall momentum in the meme coin market. While MEMEX may lack the viral pull of Dragoin or Cheems, it serves as a lower-risk entry point for those who prefer a more hands-off approach. Why Functional Meme Coins Have the Edge in Q2 Early signs in Q2 suggest a shift in investor priorities. While speculation is still part of the game, many traders are gravitating toward meme coins that offer real engagement, transparent economics, and community ownership. Dragoin represents this shift well. Its focus on utility, paired with a supply-reducing presale and a clear product launch timeline, makes it more than just another meme. The project invites users to play, earn, and contribute—not just buy and hold. From its 25-stage token rollout to its upcoming staking features and decentralization, Dragoin has multiple growth levers in place. Cheems and MEMEX still play meaningful roles—Cheems with its community base and MEMEX with its passive investment model. But it’s Dragoin that offers the full package for investors looking ahead. As capital continues rotating into meme coins with substance, Dragoin’s setup positions it well for a breakout quarter and potentially a standout year.

Filed by plaintiff Andrew Willoughby, the suit alleges Capital One Financial Corporation, Capital One N.A. and Capital One Bank (USA) N.A. entities exposed its customers’ personal identifiable information (PII) due to an employee’s negligence. The suit alleges that because of inadequately protected computer systems, customers’ names, Social Security numbers, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, credit card numbers, transaction history, and other financial information exposed via a data breach. The breach happened between August 11, 2022 and May 22, 2023, when an “unauthorized actor” accessed client PII due to the employee’s “failure to maintain an adequate security system,” according to the lawsuit. The Capital One employee also allegedly delayed informing the plaintiffs of what happened in time to save them from potential identity theft crimes. Says the complaint, “Due to Defendants’ negligence, cybercriminals obtained everything they need to commit identity theft and wreak havoc on the financial and personal lives of thousands of individuals… Defendants were negligent and failed to inform Plaintiff and the Class Members of the data breach in time for them to protect themselves from identity theft.” Now, the suit alleges that “for the rest of their lives,” Capital One customers will have to face the threat of identity thieves possessing or misusing their personal information via the dark web. “The unencrypted PII of Plaintiff and Class Members may end up for sale on the dark web or simply fall into the hands of companies that will use the detailed PII for targeted marketing without the approval of Plaintiff and Class Members. Unauthorized individuals can easily access the PII of Plaintiff and Class Members.” Capital One was also recently accused of engaging in “cancel culture” by President Donald Trump’s son Eric Trump. The bank has $490.1 billion in total assets as of the end of last year.

42920353,https://coingape.com/?p=247399,1743811747,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,US SEC Rules Dollar-Backed Stablecoins Are Not Securities Under Federal Laws,https://coingape.com/us-sec-rules-dollar-backed-stablecoins-are-not-securities-under-federal-laws/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified that certain stablecoins, specifically those backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar, do not qualify as securities under federal laws. This decision helps provide greater regulatory clarity in the growing field of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. US SEC Defines Covered Stablecoins In a recent statement, after the US SEC’s incoming chair got voted in by the Senate committee , the Division of Corporation Finance defined “Covered Stablecoins” as those stablecoins that maintain a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. These tokens are backed by assets held in a reserve, which are low-risk and highly liquid, ensuring that they can always be redeemed for U.S. dollars at a one-to-one ratio. The SEC has noted that such stablecoins are intended to be used for payment, transferring of money and for value storage rather than being investment products. The SEC provided an opinion that the process of minting and redeeming these stablecoins does not fall under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act. Consequently, any parties that engage in the issuance and circulation of these stablecoins are not regulated nor required to abide by the US securities laws or register with the US SEC. Marketing of Stablecoins Clarified The US SEC further detailed that Covered Stablecoins are marketed as a stable and reliable medium of exchange, with no promise of profits or returns. In its statement, the SEC noted that these are not advertised as investments and do not provide holders with any governance rights or financial returns based on the issuer’s performance. By clarifying the marketing strategies surrounding these stablecoins, the SEC aims to prevent any confusion about their classification as securities. This moves comes post the U.S. passing the STABLE Act , establishing a regulatory framework for USD-pegged. The SEC’s statement also addresses the importance of maintaining a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. These stablecoins are not meant to fluctuate in price like other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. As a result, their primary role is to facilitate transactions and act as a stable store of value rather than to generate financial returns for holders. Reserve Requirements for Stablecoins The SEC further elaborated that Covered Stablecoins are presented as a stable store of value and medium of exchange that cannot faithfully fill the role of a security promising profits or returns. The SEC, in its statement, stated that they are not promoted as an investment and they do not give the holders any rights or any type of financial returns on the issuer. In this respect, the mission of the US SEC is to define the marketing strategies concerning them in order to avoid any misunderstanding of their nature. The SEC also gives emphasis on the company maintaining stable price that does not fluctuate with the U.S dollar. These coins are relatively stable compared to other cryptocurrencies like the Bitcoin or the Ethereum because they are designed to have fixed values. Consequently, their main functions are to be used as a medium of exchange and serve as a unit of account instead of producing revenue for owners. SEC’s Application of Reves and Howey Tests According to the findings of the legal analysis, the defends used two legal benchmarks known as Reves and Howey tests to establish if the asset is a security. Under the Reves test, the SEC has held that Covered Stablecoins are akin to traditional commercial instruments as opposed to securities. Another reason is the Howey test that emphasizes that these buyers use these assets for commercial reasons with the expectation of gains other than in the form of profits. Based on its decision, the SEC decided that Covered Stablecoins do not fall under the securities definition under the federal securities laws. This decision is founded on the fact they are mainly used as a medium of exchange, and not as an investment vehicle backed by readily saleable assets. This clarification from the SEC comes as Congress continues to work on cryptocurrency legislation. While the SEC’s stance provides clarity on stablecoins, it does not address other digital assets, such as yield-bearing tokens , which may fall under securities regulations. The move aligns with ongoing efforts in the U.S. government to regulate digital assets and cryptocurrency more comprehensively.

The Wisconsin project would be the latest in a series of large data centers being built in the United States. Meta and Wisconsin struck up a significant project that will bring changes to the AI sector Wisconsin struck an incentive agreement in February with an unidentified business operating under a false identity to build a data center in the state with an anticipated $837 million multiyear investment. Based on a statement retrieved from an individual whose identity was disclosed because the information was confidential stated that Meta was the firm in charge of the project . On the other hand, an official from Meta chose not to comment. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation commented on this topic. It raised discussions based on the unidentified business it struck a project with, stating that after a contract was approved, its practice was to list the businesses with which it collaborates. Notably, in recent years, to meet the demands of cloud computing and increasingly complex artificial intelligence models, major tech companies have hurried to increase the capacity of their data centers. For instance, Meta stated that it intends to invest up to $65 billion this year, concentrating on developing AI-related infrastructure, including a sizable facility in Louisiana. In addition, it is worth noting that it already operates data centers in the Midwest, including DeKalb, a suburb of Chicago, and Iowa. Several companies have also eyed Wisconsin as a data center construction site promoting AI innovation Meta implements AI in all areas of its operations, which impacts how Facebook and Instagram target users with advertisements and arrange content in users’ feeds. Additionally, the company uses it in its consumer hardware, such as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses and Meta Quest headsets. Following the company’s growing interest in AI, CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed investors that he expected Meta to eventually invest hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence in late January. Furthermore, apart from Meta, other companies have also shown interest in building data centers in Wisconsin. For example, hyperscalers recently found Wisconsin a desirable data center construction site. In addition, Microsoft Corp. is building what may be one of its most powerful facilities south of Milwaukee, located in the state of Wisconsin. Another company on this list is OpenAI’s Stargate venture. The firm stated that Wisconsin was one of the states it was considering for growth. However, in light of Microsoft’s pullback, the rise of less expensive AI models, and the possible effects of tariffs, investors have questioned whether the rate of data center construction was sustainable. The Beaver Dam project promises significant benefits to the local community and region In February, a local economic development authority, the Beaver Dam Area Development Corporation, mentioned that future economic benefits from this project could greatly impact the community and region. That month, the city’s economic development entity stated that it was collaborating with Alliant Energy Corp. on the project and had already authorized water and development agreements. However, according to the group, the project is still pending finalization and non-local approvals. Earlier, a representative for Alliant Energy assured people that more details would be released soon, stating that the company was currently in the “exploratory and due diligence phases” of a possible Beaver Dam project.

Pundit Explains What’s Happening,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-next-direction/,"A crypto analyst has shared insights into the recent strength in the XRP price, suggesting that South Korea may be the reason behind it. The analyst noted that the altcoin has been seeing high trading volume on South Korean exchanges, and this localized demand may be holding up its price while other altcoins struggle to gain traction. How South Korea Is Bolstering The Price According to XForceGlobal South Korea is currently one of the major drivers of the XRP price action. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), the analyst disclosed that the engagement and adoption from the crypto users in South Korea was a major contributor to XRP’s bullish performance. Related Reading: Analyst Unveils Extended XRP Price Target To $44, Reveals When To Take Profits Currently, South Korea is one of the most active crypto markets in the world, leading in global trading volume across multiple assets. However, among the numerous cryptocurrencies in the market, XRP stands out the most within the country. The analyst has revealed that even during low trading days, XRP frequently outpaces Bitcoin, underscoring its high demand and adoption in South Korea. XForceGlobal has suggested that South Korea’s notable interest in XRP likely stems from its status as one of the most isolated countries in terms of crypto regulations. The analyst revealed that millions of citizens currently own the altcoin, making up about 20% of the cryptocurrency’s market cap valuation. Moreover, due to a lack of large-scale cross-border payment solutions, most South Koreans opt to use cryptocurrencies like XRP to facilitate transactions. This, in turn, fuels adoption and strengthens the cryptocurrency’s utility, which positively influences its price action. Compared to South Korea, the regulatory uncertainties and legal challenges in the United States (US) have slowed down XRP’s growth. XForceGlobal has stated that the active participation of retail institutions, strong community support, and early adoption in South Korea have helped prop up prices despite the difficulties it faced over the past years. What The Future Holds For XRP In South Korea While discussing the impact of South Korea’s support for XRP on its price action, XForceGlobal offered insights into the cryptocurrency’s future in the country. The analyst revealed that the market is at a pivotal moment where XRP has evolved from a speculative asset to a symbol of Korea’s dominance in the crypto market. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Descending Trendline, Why A Surge To $4 Is Still In The Cards Currently, Upbit, the largest crypto exchange in South Korea, holds the most significant market share of XRP in terms of total supply. The exchange reportedly has about 6 billion XRP, accounting for roughly 5% of the entire supply. XForceGlobal has revealed that the continued demand from retail investors combined with Upbit’s massive XRP reserve will make South Korea a key driver to the cryptocurrency’s global future price action. Moving forward, the analyst has discussed XRP’s price movements on the Korean won chart, suggesting that its current action may be foreshadowing upcoming events. He pointed out that the altcoin has already formed a lower low on the chart, possibly hinting at a more controlled pullback rather than an impulsive decline — an outlook he described as “arguably bearish”. The crypto analyst also noted that XRP may be forming a potential bottom on the Korean won chart, indicating a possible impulse to the upside and a bullish continuation.

For those in the crypto space keeping an eye on technological advancements, understanding the cost and capabilities of AI models like Gemini 2.5 Pro is crucial. Why? Because AI is increasingly intertwined with blockchain and crypto, from enhancing security to predicting market trends. Let’s dive into why Gemini 2.5 Pro is turning heads, and emptying wallets, in the tech world. Gemini 2.5 Pro: Setting New Benchmarks in AI Performance Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro isn’t just another AI model; it’s positioned as a leader, boasting industry-leading performance across several critical benchmarks. These benchmarks are essentially the gold standard for measuring an AI’s prowess in areas like: Coding: Evaluating how well the AI can understand, generate, and debug code. Reasoning: Testing the AI’s ability to solve complex problems and make logical inferences. Math: Assessing the AI’s mathematical and analytical skills. According to Google, Gemini 2.5 Pro excels in these areas, suggesting a significant leap forward in AI capabilities. But with great power comes a great price tag, and in this case, a surprisingly hefty one. Decoding the AI Model Pricing: What Does Gemini 2.5 Pro Cost? Let’s break down the numbers to understand why Gemini 2.5 Pro is being called Google’s most expensive AI model to date. The pricing structure is based on tokens, which are essentially units of text. Here’s the breakdown: Prompt Length Input Tokens (per million) Output Tokens (per million) Up to 200,000 tokens $1.25 $10.00 Greater than 200,000 tokens $2.50 $15.00 To put this into perspective, 200,000 tokens are roughly equivalent to 150,000 words, far exceeding the length of the entire “Lord of The Rings” series. For most standard use cases, the lower pricing tier applies. However, for extremely large inputs, the price doubles for input tokens and increases by 50% for output tokens. This tiered pricing is noteworthy because it caters to a broader range of applications, but at a premium. Google AI Pricing Compared: Gemini 2.5 Pro vs. The Competition When we stack Gemini 2.5 Pro against other AI models, the “expensive” label becomes even clearer. Consider these comparisons: Gemini 2.0 Flash: A more budget-friendly Google offering at $0.10/M input and $0.40/M output tokens. Gemini 2.5 Pro is significantly pricier. OpenAI’s o3-mini: Priced at $1.10/M input and $4.40/M output tokens, still cheaper than Gemini 2.5 Pro. DeepSeek’s R1: An even more affordable option at $0.55/M input and $2.19/M output tokens. Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet: At $3/M input and $15/M output tokens, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is more expensive for input tokens but matches Gemini 2.5 Pro’s output token price at the higher tier. OpenAI’s GPT-4.5: A truly premium model, costing a staggering $75/M input and $150/M output tokens, dwarfing even Gemini 2.5 Pro’s cost. While Gemini 2.5 Pro is indeed expensive compared to many models, it’s positioned in a complex pricing landscape. It’s more costly than some but cheaper than the absolute top-tier models like GPT-4.5 and even Claude 3.7 Sonnet in certain scenarios. Why the High Price Tag? Demand and Computing Costs So, why are we seeing this upward trend in pricing for flagship AI models? Several factors are likely at play: High Demand: According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Gemini 2.5 Pro is their most in-demand AI model. This high demand, reflected in an 80% usage increase in Google’s AI Studio and Gemini API this month alone, naturally drives up prices. Computing Costs: Training and running these advanced AI models require immense computational power, translating to significant infrastructure costs. These costs are inevitably passed down to developers. Performance and Features: Gemini 2.5 Pro offers extended context windows (handling prompts over 200,000 tokens), a feature not widely supported by competitors. This advanced capability justifies a higher price point for users needing to process massive amounts of data. The tech industry’s initial reaction to Gemini 2.5 Pro’s AI model pricing has been surprisingly positive. Developers seem to appreciate the perceived value for money, acknowledging the performance gains justify the cost. However, the broader trend of increasing prices for top-tier models is undeniable. OpenAI’s o1-pro, for instance, is even more expensive than Gemini 2.5 Pro, signaling a potential new normal in AI pricing. Actionable Insights for Developers and Crypto Enthusiasts For developers, especially those in the crypto and blockchain space looking to integrate AI, here are some actionable insights: Evaluate Needs: Carefully assess your project’s requirements. Do you truly need the cutting-edge performance of Gemini 2.5 Pro, or could a more cost-effective model like Gemini 2.0 Flash or DeepSeek’s R1 suffice? Optimize Prompts: Efficient prompt engineering can reduce token usage, thereby lowering costs. Focus on clear, concise prompts to minimize unnecessary token consumption. Monitor Usage: Keep a close eye on your AI usage to avoid unexpected expenses. Utilize Google’s AI Studio or API dashboards to track token consumption. Explore Free Tier: Gemini 2.5 Pro is available for free with strict rate limits. This could be sufficient for initial testing and smaller projects. For crypto enthusiasts, the pricing trend in AI models like Gemini 2.5 Pro highlights the increasing value and cost of advanced computation. As AI becomes more integral to blockchain technology, understanding these cost dynamics will be crucial for future developments and integrations. Conclusion: Is Gemini 2.5 Pro Worth the Investment? Gemini 2.5 Pro is undoubtedly a powerful and advanced Google AI model, setting new standards in various benchmarks. Its expensive AI model pricing reflects its premium capabilities and the high demand it commands. Whether it’s worth the investment depends entirely on your specific needs and budget. For projects requiring top-tier performance and the ability to process massive datasets, Gemini 2.5 Pro could be a game-changer. However, for less demanding tasks, more affordable alternatives might be more practical.

The explosive rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot app, is sending shockwaves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Surging to the top of app store charts, DeepSeek is not just another chatbot; it’s a statement. Trained with groundbreaking compute-efficient techniques, DeepSeek’s AI models are forcing analysts to rethink the AI landscape and the future demand for AI chips. But what exactly is DeepSeek, and why is it suddenly a global phenomenon? Let’s dive into the story of this game-changing AI player. DeepSeek AI Chatbot: From Hedge Fund to AI Frontrunner DeepSeek’s origins are rooted in the world of high finance. Backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund, DeepSeek leverages AI’s power for more than just market predictions. Founded by AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng, High-Flyer Capital Management has been deploying AI algorithms in trading since 2019. In 2023, the company expanded its vision, establishing DeepSeek as a dedicated AI research lab, separate from its core financial operations. This lab then spun off into its own entity, retaining the name DeepSeek, with High-Flyer as a key investor. This unique background gives DeepSeek a financially robust foundation and a deep understanding of leveraging AI for complex problem-solving. From its inception, DeepSeek prioritized infrastructure, building its own data center clusters for model training. However, like other Chinese AI innovators, DeepSeek faces headwinds from US export restrictions on advanced hardware. To train its cutting-edge models, DeepSeek has reportedly utilized Nvidia H800 chips, a less powerful alternative to the H100 chips favored by US companies. Despite these hardware limitations, DeepSeek’s technical team, known for its youth and aggressive recruitment of top doctorate AI researchers from leading Chinese universities, has achieved remarkable progress. Interestingly, DeepSeek also diversifies its talent pool by hiring individuals from non-computer science backgrounds, enriching its tech development with broader perspectives. Unveiling DeepSeek’s Powerful AI Models DeepSeek burst onto the AI scene in November 2023 with its initial suite of models: DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat. However, it was the spring 2024 release of the next-generation DeepSeek-V2 family that truly captured the AI industry’s attention. DeepSeek-V2, a versatile system capable of analyzing both text and images, demonstrated exceptional performance across various AI benchmarks. Crucially, it offered this performance at a significantly lower operational cost than comparable models available at the time. This cost-efficiency sent ripples through the industry, compelling domestic competitors like ByteDance and Alibaba to slash prices for their own models and even offer some for free. The subsequent launch of DeepSeek-V3 in December 2024 only solidified DeepSeek’s growing reputation as a major disruptor. According to DeepSeek’s internal testing, DeepSeek V3 surpasses both open-source models like Meta’s Llama and closed models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o in performance. Further amplifying DeepSeek’s prowess is its R1 “reasoning” model, launched in January. DeepSeek asserts that R1 rivals OpenAI’s o1 model on critical benchmarks. Reasoning models like R1 excel in self-correction, mitigating common errors and enhancing reliability, particularly in complex domains such as physics, science, and mathematics. While reasoning models might take slightly longer to generate solutions, the increased accuracy and dependability they offer are invaluable in fields demanding precision. Here’s a quick comparison of DeepSeek’s key models: Model Description Key Features Release Date DeepSeek Coder Code generation model Efficient code synthesis, supports multiple programming languages November 2023 DeepSeek LLM Large Language Model General-purpose language understanding and generation November 2023 DeepSeek Chat Chatbot application Conversational AI interface, powered by DeepSeek LLM November 2023 DeepSeek-V2 General-purpose text and image analysis Improved performance, cost-efficient operation Spring 2024 DeepSeek-V3 Next-gen general-purpose model Outperforms Llama and GPT-4o in internal benchmarks December 2024 DeepSeek R1 Reasoning Model Self-correcting, high reliability in complex domains, rivals OpenAI’s o1 January 2025 The Shadow of Regulation: Navigating Chinese AI Benchmarks Despite its technical achievements, DeepSeek, as a Chinese-developed AI, operates within a unique regulatory landscape. Its models are subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure alignment with “core socialist values.” This oversight manifests in DeepSeek’s chatbot app, where certain politically sensitive topics, such as Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy, are off-limits. This content filtering is a crucial aspect to understand when evaluating DeepSeek’s capabilities and potential applications in a global context. DeepSeek’s Market Impact and Disruptive Approach DeepSeek’s rapid ascent is undeniable. In March, it recorded over 16.5 million website visits, positioning it as a significant player in the AI arena, second only to ChatGPT, although still trailing far behind in user engagement. What’s particularly intriguing is DeepSeek’s business model, or rather, the apparent lack thereof. The company offers its products and services at prices significantly below market averages, with some even provided for free. Adding to the mystery, DeepSeek is reportedly not actively seeking investor funding, despite considerable VC interest. DeepSeek attributes its extreme cost competitiveness to efficiency breakthroughs, although some experts have questioned the validity of these claims. Regardless, developers are flocking to DeepSeek’s models, which, while not fully open-source, are available under permissive licenses allowing commercial use. Hugging Face CEO Clem Delangue reports over 500 derivative models of R1 created by developers on their platform, amassing over 2.5 million downloads. DeepSeek: An AI Revolution or Overhyped Threat? DeepSeek’s impact is undeniable. Its success has been described as both “upending AI” and “over-hyped,” highlighting the polarized opinions surrounding its rapid rise. Notably, DeepSeek’s momentum contributed to an 18% drop in Nvidia’s stock price in January and even prompted a public statement from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The US government is also taking notice, with the Commerce Department reportedly banning DeepSeek on government devices. Conversely, Microsoft has embraced DeepSeek, integrating it into its Azure AI Foundry service. Even Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged DeepSeek’s influence, stating that AI infrastructure spending remains a “strategic advantage” for Meta. OpenAI has labeled DeepSeek as “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” advocating for a potential US ban on DeepSeek models. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” recognizing the computational demands of reasoning models as beneficial for Nvidia’s hardware. Despite endorsements from some quarters, DeepSeek also faces bans from individual companies, entire countries like South Korea, and US states like New York. The Future of DeepSeek and the Global AI Race The future trajectory of DeepSeek remains uncertain. Continued advancements in its AI models are expected. However, growing wariness from the US government regarding potential foreign influence poses a significant challenge. The reported impending US ban on DeepSeek for government devices underscores this concern. Whether DeepSeek can navigate these geopolitical complexities and sustain its disruptive momentum will be crucial in determining its long-term impact on the global AI landscape. One thing is clear: DeepSeek has undeniably injected a new level of competition and innovation into the AI race, forcing established players to adapt and reassess their strategies.

Pi Network aims to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-hungry mining, Pi uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which is efficient and eco-friendly. Users earn rewards not just for daily check-ins but also for growing their trusted circles and running full nodes. With its focus on decentralization and fair access, Pi could be a game-changer in the crypto space. As it plans to move from its “enclosed” Mainnet phase to an open network, Pi might become an attractive option in the market, especially for those looking to participate without significant investment in hardware. Cardano’s ADA: The Eco-Friendly Crypto Ready to Shine Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a platform that lets developers build apps, tokens, and games without harming the environment. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, Cardano uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. This means it needs much less energy to operate compared to traditional methods. Its native coin, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and earn rewards by staking. What sets Cardano apart is its unique two-layer design. One layer handles transactions, while the other manages smart contracts. This setup could allow Cardano to process up to a million transactions per second in the future. With the introduction of native tokens in 2021, Cardano has become more efficient and scalable. In the current market, ADA looks attractive, especially for those interested in sustainable and scalable blockchain solutions. As Ethereum faces challenges with scaling and energy use, Cardano’s ADA might be the alternative that investors and developers are looking for. Conclusion PI, ADA, and XYZ are promising, with XYZVerse uniting sports fans in a community-driven memecoin aiming for significant growth and cultural impact.

Bullish signals are back, and three standout tokens are making serious noise. Between massive supply burns, breakout chart setups, and surging presales, there’s a lot more than hype in the air—it’s a window of opportunity. Leading the surge is Dragoin ($DDGN) , a new Ethereum-based meme coin that’s combining gaming and deflation into a formula with explosive potential. Alongside it, Pepe Coin is looking sharp with a projected 50% price breakout, and Shiba Inu is turning heads with an 8,470% spike in burn rate. All three offer something different—but Dragoin is emerging as the most complete play this month. Pepe Coin Bulls Hold the Line as Charts Signal 50% Upside Pepe Coin (PEPE) is showing clear signs of strength as buyers defend key support zones. Analysis from Brave New Coin points out that PEPE is holding firm near $0.0000068, with a potential move toward $0.0000105—a 50% price jump—on the table. Technicals are lining up in its favor. The RSI is sitting in bullish territory, and Bollinger Bands are narrowing—classic signs that price action could soon explode. Current volume trends show accumulation, not selloffs, adding fuel to the bullish case. Although PEPE still lacks major utility, it thrives on culture, momentum, and trader sentiment. If Bitcoin can maintain levels above $85K, meme coins like PEPE could benefit from a wider wave. But for those aiming for stronger returns and lasting utility, Dragoin is pulling ahead of the pack. Dragoin Stands Out With Scarcity, Gameplay, and 100x ROI Promise Among the top meme coins to join this month, Dragoin ($DDGN) is getting serious attention—and for good reason. Built on Ethereum, it powers a play-to-earn game hosted directly on Telegram, where users hatch dragons, train them, and battle to earn $DDGN tokens. It’s more than just a meme—it’s an ecosystem. The project’s 25-stage presale structure encourages early buying by raising the price at each level. Half of the total 200 billion tokens are allocated to presale, and any unsold tokens are permanently burned—cutting down supply and boosting value for participants. With a current price of $0.0000292 and a launch price set at $0.002, the 100x potential isn’t a stretch—it’s math. But Dragoin’s appeal doesn’t stop at numbers. The team plans to renounce smart contract ownership after the presale ends, ensuring the token becomes fully decentralized. This hands-off model is rare among meme coins and is one reason Dragoin’s community is growing fast. Looking ahead, Q2 brings the game’s official launch, staking features, and a marketing campaign led by influencers. Q3 will introduce CEX listings, more game content, and community-driven governance. With airdrops, referral programs, and ongoing staking incentives already live, Dragoin is clearly aiming far beyond the meme coin mold. SHIB’s Massive Token Burn Reignites Market Buzz Shiba Inu (SHIB), long seen as a staple of meme coin culture, has stirred up excitement again after a dramatic rise in burn activity. As reported by the Hindustan Times, SHIB removed over 82.24 million tokens from circulation in 24 hours, pushing its burn rate up by a staggering 8,470%. While the price hasn’t moved much, the burn is sparking speculation about a possible rally. SHIB has often used burns to keep interest alive, and with meme coins gaining traction again, some expect another leg up in price action. Still, SHIB’s challenge remains the same—it needs to evolve. Without new interactive features or added utility, its growth strategy relies heavily on reducing supply. That’s a stark contrast to Dragoin, which is already rolling out new mechanics, rewarding its users, and expanding rapidly. Which Meme Coin Should You Watch Closely This Month? All three tokens—Dragoin, PEPE, and SHIB—are bringing something to the table. PEPE offers short-term trading setups, SHIB continues to draw power from its legacy and burn strategy, but Dragoin offers the most compelling mix: scarcity, interactivity, decentralization, and real upside. The presale is more than just hype—it’s a system built to reward early adopters and grow the community organically. With 100x ROI potential and a unique play-to-earn structure, Dragoin is offering more than speculation—it’s offering substance. At its current price, it’s still early for those who want in before the public launch. When meme coin momentum hits, timing is everything. Dragoin isn’t just reacting to the market—it’s building ahead of it. And that’s why it tops the list of top meme coins to join this month .

As the payment behemoth increases its crypto footprint, PayPal and Venmo users can buy, sell, and hold LINK and SOL in their accounts. PayPal Expands Crypto Offering With SOL and LINK According to an official press release , PayPal has announced the expansion of its suite of cryptocurrencies with two new tokens. The payment giant confirmed the addition of Chainlink and Solana to its offerings, signaling increased confidence in Web 3 solutions. Per the statement, the offering will extend beyond PayPal and include its subsidiary Venmo. Users of Venmo and PayPal in the US will be able to purchase, hold, transfer, and sell both SOL and LINK with their accounts. May Zabaneh, Paypal’s VP for Digital Currencies revealed that expanding its cryptocurrency offerings was an obvious choice for the company. Zabaneh disclosed that feedback from users confirmed the need to allow consumers to interact with SOL and LINK. “Offering more tokens on PayPal and Venmo provides users with greater flexibility, choice, and access to digital currencies,” said Zabaneh. With the addition of SOL and LINK, PayPal supports seven cryptocurrencies on its platform. The firm waded into cryptocurrencies back in 2020 starting with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) offerings for consumers. Early successes saw it expand to Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) before launching its stablecoin PayPal USD(PYUSD). Institutional adoption for SOL is rising with Polymarket integrating Solana by enabling SOL deposits. Chainlink is riding its wave of partnerships and integrations with institutional and enterprise utility at the core. Why Did The Payment Giant Choose SOL and LINK? PayPal’s decision to expand to SOL and LINK flows from their inherent capabilities and massive adoption figures. According to the statement, PayPal sees Chainlink as a key player in cross-chain interoperability while describing Solana as a “leading blockchain platform.” Both SOL and LINK are in the top 11 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization with a combined valuation of over $80 billion. Chainlink’s ADGM partnership to build tokenization frameworks in the UAE is the latest high-profile play for the Web 3 infrastructure platform. Furthermore, the company says the decision underscores the company’s cryptocurrency-facing ambitions in recent years. PYUSD has its sights on challenging USDT and USDC dominance with PayPal neck-deep in cryptocurrencies. “The addition of LINK and SOL reflects the company’s dedication to the evolving digital currency landscape and fostering greater accessibility and engagement in the cryptocurrency market,” read the statement. Apart from PayPal and Polymarket, BlackRock’s BUIDL has launched on Solana in a strong case for institutional adoption. Both SOL and LINK have reacted positively to the announcement, rising 5.42% and 1.37 respectively.

42922363,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146530,1743815407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark Recognition: U.S. Treasury Secretary Declares Bitcoin a Growing Store of Value,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/landmark-bitcoin-store-value/,"In a potentially landmark moment for the cryptocurrency world, the U.S. Treasury Secretary has publicly acknowledged Bitcoin as a “growing store of value.” This statement, initially reported by Watcher Guru on X, signifies a possible sea change in the official stance towards digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. For years, Bitcoin has navigated a complex landscape of skepticism and regulatory uncertainty. But could this declaration from a key figure in U.S. financial policy be the turning point Bitcoin enthusiasts have been eagerly awaiting? Let’s delve into the implications of this exciting development and explore what it means for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Why is Bitcoin Being Recognized as a Store of Value? The concept of Bitcoin as a store of value has been a cornerstone argument within the crypto community since its inception. But what exactly does it mean for Bitcoin to be considered a store of value, and why is this recognition from the U.S. Treasury Secretary so significant? Traditionally, assets like gold and real estate have been viewed as stores of value – assets that maintain or increase their worth over time, acting as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, limited supply of 21 million coins, and increasing global adoption, is increasingly fitting this description. Here are key factors contributing to Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a store of value: Scarcity: Just like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply. This scarcity is hardcoded into its protocol, ensuring that no more than 21 million Bitcoins will ever be created. This inherent scarcity contrasts sharply with fiat currencies, which central banks can print, potentially leading to inflation. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates outside the control of governments and financial institutions. This decentralization is a major draw for those seeking an alternative to traditional financial systems, particularly in times of economic instability or geopolitical tension. Increasing Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions and corporations are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This institutional interest lends further legitimacy to Bitcoin as a viable asset class and store of value. Growing Acceptance as Digital Gold: Many investors are starting to view Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a modern alternative to precious metals for wealth preservation. This narrative is gaining traction as Bitcoin matures and its resilience is tested through various economic cycles. The Significance of Treasury Bitcoin Acknowledgment The U.S. Treasury Secretary’s statement carries immense weight. It’s not just another endorsement from a tech enthusiast or crypto advocate; it’s a signal from one of the most influential financial authorities in the world. This acknowledgment could pave the way for: Reduced Regulatory Headwinds: Official recognition as a store of value might lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in the United States. It could soften the stance of regulatory bodies that have previously viewed Bitcoin primarily as a speculative asset or a tool for illicit activities. Increased Mainstream Adoption: When a figure as prominent as the Treasury Secretary acknowledges Bitcoin’s value proposition, it lends credibility to the asset in the eyes of the general public and institutional investors who might have been hesitant to enter the space before. This could accelerate Bitcoin adoption across various sectors. Legitimization of Crypto as an Asset Class: This statement can be seen as a step towards the broader legitimization of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, moving beyond the fringes of finance and into mainstream investment portfolios. Potential for Further Policy Shifts: This initial acknowledgment could be the first step in a series of policy shifts that are more accommodating and supportive of cryptocurrency innovation in the U.S. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Crypto Regulation While the Treasury Secretary’s comments are undoubtedly positive, the landscape of crypto regulation remains complex and evolving. It’s crucial to remember that this is just one statement, and regulatory frameworks are shaped by multiple agencies and political considerations. Here are some key aspects to consider regarding the regulatory future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies: Global Regulatory Divergence: Different countries are taking vastly different approaches to crypto regulation. Some are embracing innovation, while others are imposing strict restrictions. This global divergence creates challenges for the industry and necessitates international cooperation. Balancing Innovation and Consumer Protection: Regulators are tasked with balancing the need to foster innovation in the digital asset space with the crucial responsibility of protecting consumers from fraud and illicit activities. Finding this balance is a delicate act. The Role of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): The rise of CBDCs presents both opportunities and challenges for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. CBDCs could compete with or complement existing digital assets, and their regulatory frameworks will likely influence the broader crypto ecosystem. Continued Scrutiny on Compliance: Despite growing acceptance, the crypto industry will remain under scrutiny regarding compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Projects and exchanges must prioritize robust compliance frameworks to operate within legal boundaries. What Does This Mean for Digital Assets Beyond Bitcoin? While the statement specifically references Bitcoin, the implications extend to the broader world of digital assets . If Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, gains further legitimacy as a store of value in the eyes of regulators, it could have a ripple effect, benefiting the entire digital asset class. This could lead to: Increased Investor Confidence in Crypto: Positive sentiment towards Bitcoin often translates to increased confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market. This could attract more investors to explore other digital assets beyond Bitcoin. Greater Acceptance of Blockchain Technology: Recognition of Bitcoin indirectly validates the underlying blockchain technology that powers it and many other cryptocurrencies. This could accelerate the adoption of blockchain in various industries beyond finance. Innovation in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): A more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin could also foster innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, allowing for the development of new financial products and services built on blockchain technology. Growth of the Digital Economy: Ultimately, greater acceptance of digital assets can contribute to the growth of the broader digital economy, fostering innovation, creating new economic opportunities, and transforming how we interact with finance and technology. Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Bitcoin Landscape So, what should investors and crypto enthusiasts take away from this significant development? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape is constantly changing. Keep abreast of the latest news and policy updates related to cryptocurrencies in your region and globally. Diversify Your Crypto Portfolio: While Bitcoin is gaining recognition, diversification remains a prudent strategy in the volatile crypto market. Explore other promising digital assets and allocate your investments strategically. Educate Yourself on Crypto Fundamentals: Understanding the technology, economics, and regulatory aspects of cryptocurrencies is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Continuously learn and expand your knowledge base. Consider Long-Term Investment in Bitcoin: If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin as a store of value, consider adopting a long-term investment strategy, potentially through dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Mainstream Bitcoin? The U.S. Treasury Secretary’s acknowledgment of Bitcoin as a “growing store of value” is more than just a headline; it’s a potential shift in the narrative surrounding digital currencies. While challenges and regulatory complexities remain, this statement signals a maturing perception of Bitcoin within influential financial circles. It opens doors for greater mainstream adoption, reduced regulatory friction, and a more robust future for Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, this landmark moment could be remembered as a pivotal step towards the full integration of Bitcoin into the global financial landscape.

Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice (STJ) has unanimously decided that judges may now notify crypto exchanges of their intent to seize a debtor’s crypto assets to repay outstanding debts, local media has reported. The decision, from the court’s Third Panel, examined a case brought by a creditor trying to get repayment. “Although they are not legal tender, crypto assets can be used as a form of payment and as a store of value,” the STJ wrote in a translated statement published on its website, confirming the decision. Crypto now treated like bank accounts in legal disputes Under Brazilian law, judges are empowered to freeze bank accounts and authorize fund withdrawals without notifying the debtor. Following the new ruling, crypto assets will now be treated similarly and may be frozen or confiscated to satisfy legal obligations. Minister Ricardo Villas Bôas Cueva, one of the five-panel members, acknowledged that while Brazil still lacks comprehensive regulation for cryptocurrencies, several legislative proposals already define them as a “digital representation of value.” Despite the regulatory gap, Brazil has emerged as one of the leading countries in Latin America for crypto adoption. An October report from Chainalysis ranked Brazil second in the region based on the volume of crypto value received, highlighting the nation’s growing engagement with digital assets. In a notable move earlier this year, Binance received regulatory approval to operate in Brazil after acquiring a São Paulo-based investment firm. At the time, a Binance executive told Cointelegraph that Brazil was making “significant strides” toward crypto regulation and predicted that a comprehensive legal framework would be introduced “by mid-year.” Stablecoin ban sparks debate in growing market Still, not all developments have been favorable to the industry. In December, Brazil’s central bank proposed a controversial ban on stablecoin transactions via self-custodial wallets—an increasingly popular method for Brazilians to protect their wealth against real devaluation. Critics argued that such a ban would be hard to enforce. “Governments can regulate centralized exchanges, but P2P transactions and decentralized platforms are much harder to control,” said Trezor analyst Lucien Bourdon. “That means the ban would likely only affect part of the ecosystem.” Brazil’s largest bank, Itaú Unibanco, is presently considering the launch of its own stablecoin, making it the latest major traditional financial institution to announce these plans. Local media reported that the bank’s decision will depend on how Brazil’s regulatory framework evolves and how similar initiatives by major international institutions perform. The move follows a wave of recent announcements by TradFi institutions regarding plans to launch or develop stablecoins. Bank of America signals readiness for stablecoin launch In the U.S., Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently confirmed that the bank is prepared to launch a dollar-backed stablecoin if Congress establishes a clear legal framework. The announcement places the U.S. lender among a growing number of systemically important banks planning entry into the stablecoin sector. These developments have come in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s formal rejection of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and endorsements for stablecoins, which has shifted attention away from state-issued digital money and toward private-sector alternatives. As Brazil continues its regulatory evolution, the court’s latest ruling reinforces the perception of crypto assets as integral to the country’s financial system—even as broader legal frameworks are still in development.

42922698,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146532,1743816001,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Revelation: OpenAI’s GPT-4 ‘Memorization’ of Copyrighted Content Sparks AI Debate,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-gpt4-copyright-memorization/,"The cryptocurrency world thrives on transparency and verifiable truth. But what happens when the very AI tools we’re starting to rely on for information and innovation are built on potentially murky foundations? A groundbreaking new study is sending shockwaves through the tech world, suggesting that OpenAI’s powerful models, including the much-hyped GPT-4, may have ‘memorized’ copyrighted material during their training process. This explosive claim reignites the fierce debate surrounding OpenAI Copyright practices and raises serious questions about the ethical and legal implications of AI development. Does OpenAI’s GPT-4 Exhibit Alarming AI Model Memorization? For months, whispers and accusations have circulated, alleging that OpenAI trained its cutting-edge AI models on a vast ocean of data that included copyrighted works. Now, a rigorous study from researchers at leading universities like Washington, Copenhagen, and Stanford seems to lend significant weight to these allegations. This research introduces a novel method to detect data ‘memorization’ within API-driven models like OpenAI’s. But what exactly does ‘memorization’ mean in the context of AI? AI models as prediction engines: Think of AI models as incredibly sophisticated prediction machines. They are trained on massive datasets to identify patterns and relationships within the data. This learning process is what enables them to generate human-like text, images, and more. The inevitability of memorization: While most AI outputs are original creations, the very nature of how these models learn means some degree of verbatim reproduction from the training data is unavoidable. Imagine learning a language – you’ll naturally repeat phrases you’ve heard frequently. Prior instances of regurgitation: We’ve already seen examples of this ‘memorization’ in action. Image models have been caught spitting out exact screenshots from movies they were trained on, and language models have been observed essentially plagiarizing news articles. Unveiling the Method: High-Surprisal Words and Copyrighted Content Detection The study’s ingenious approach hinges on identifying what the researchers term “high-surprisal” words. These are words that are statistically uncommon within a given context. Consider the example: “Jack and I sat perfectly still with the radar humming.” “Radar” is a high-surprisal word here because, in the context of things that hum, words like “engine” or “radio” are far more probable. To test for AI Model Memorization , the researchers cleverly masked these high-surprisal words from snippets of copyrighted fiction books and New York Times articles. They then challenged OpenAI’s models, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, to guess the missing words. The logic is compelling: if the model accurately guesses the high-surprisal word, it strongly suggests the model ‘memorized’ that specific snippet during its training phase. An example of the model guessing a high-surprisal word: “Jack and I sat perfectly still with the [MASK] humming.” – Model correctly guesses “radar”. Image Credits: OpenAI Shocking Findings: GPT-4 and the Memorization of Copyrighted Material The study’s results are nothing short of startling. GPT-4 demonstrated clear signs of having memorized portions of popular fiction books, notably including books from BookMIA, a dataset known to contain copyrighted ebooks. Furthermore, the research indicated that GPT-4 had also memorized segments of New York Times articles, although at a lower frequency compared to the fiction books. This raises critical concerns about the source material used to train these powerful AI models and whether Copyrighted Content was utilized without proper authorization. Abhilasha Ravichander, a University of Washington doctoral student and study co-author, emphasized the significance of these findings in a statement to Bitcoin World. She highlighted that the research sheds light on the potentially “contentious data” used in training these models. “For large language models to be truly trustworthy, we need the ability to probe, audit, and scientifically examine them,” Ravichander stated. “Our work provides a tool for this probing, but there’s a pressing need for greater data transparency across the entire ecosystem.” The Looming Legal Battle Over AI Training Data OpenAI is already facing a barrage of lawsuits from authors, programmers, and copyright holders. These plaintiffs accuse the company of illegally using their Copyrighted Content – books, code, and more – to train its AI models. OpenAI has consistently defended its actions under the “fair use” doctrine of copyright law. However, the plaintiffs argue that fair use doesn’t extend to the wholesale ingestion of copyrighted material for AI training purposes. This legal battle could redefine the landscape of AI development and intellectual property rights. Adding fuel to the fire, OpenAI has actively lobbied for more lenient regulations regarding the use of copyrighted data in AI training. While they have established some content licensing agreements and offer opt-out mechanisms for copyright owners, their push for broader “fair use” rules suggests a desire to continue utilizing vast datasets, even those potentially containing copyrighted material. The question remains: Can innovation thrive without respecting creators’ rights and ensuring data transparency? Key Takeaways and the Path Forward for AI Ethics This study is a wake-up call, underscoring the urgent need for greater transparency and ethical considerations in the development of AI. Here are some crucial points to consider: Transparency is paramount: The AI industry must move towards greater transparency regarding training datasets. Understanding what data is used to build these powerful models is essential for accountability and ethical development. Copyright and AI: A Legal Grey Area: The legal framework surrounding AI Training Data and copyright is still murky. This study adds weight to the argument that current “fair use” interpretations may be insufficient to address the scale and nature of AI training. Ethical AI Development: Beyond legalities, there’s an ethical imperative. Building AI that respects intellectual property rights and operates with transparency is crucial for fostering trust and long-term sustainability in the AI ecosystem. The Need for Robust Auditing Tools: Ravichander’s study highlights the necessity for tools that can effectively probe and audit large language models. This is crucial for identifying potential copyright infringement and ensuring responsible AI development. The Future of AI and Content Creation: The outcome of the legal battles and the evolution of ethical standards will significantly shape the future of AI and its relationship with content creators. Finding a balance that fosters innovation while respecting creators’ rights is paramount. The implications of this study are profound. As the cryptocurrency and blockchain space increasingly intersects with AI, understanding the ethical and legal underpinnings of these technologies becomes ever more critical.

42923056,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146533,1743816657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Bakkt Lawsuit: Investors Allege Securities Law Violation in Class Action,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bakkt-investor-class-action/,"The cryptocurrency world is once again witnessing turbulence as Bakkt, a prominent cryptocurrency platform backed by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), finds itself at the center of a storm. Recent reports reveal that Bakkt is facing a class action lawsuit, sending ripples of concern through the crypto investment community. Investors are alleging significant losses due to what they claim is a failure in transparency and potential securities law violation. Let’s dive into the details of this developing situation and understand what it means for Bakkt and the broader crypto landscape. What Sparked the Bakkt Lawsuit? Allegations of Non-Disclosure The core of the Bakkt lawsuit revolves around accusations of non-disclosure of critical information to investors. According to court documents filed in the Southern District Court of New York and reported by Cointelegraph, the plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit are primarily investors who claim to have suffered financial setbacks. They allege that Bakkt did not adequately disclose details about crucial business contracts with major clients, namely Bank of America (BofA) and Webull. These contracts, as per the allegations, were not just any partnerships; they were cornerstones of Bakkt’s revenue generation. The investors argue that the recent discontinuation of these agreements was a significant event that should have been disclosed earlier and more transparently. The lack of this information, they claim, led to investment decisions made without a full understanding of Bakkt’s financial health and future prospects, ultimately resulting in investor losses . To break it down simply: The Claim: Bakkt investors are alleging non-disclosure of material information. Key Contracts: The contracts in question are with Bank of America and Webull. Revenue Impact: These contracts reportedly constituted a significant portion of Bakkt’s revenue stream. Investor Grievance: Investors argue they were not informed about the potential risks associated with these contracts and their subsequent termination. Investor Losses and the Claim of Securities Law Violation The lawsuit doesn’t stop at just non-disclosure. It escalates to accusations of securities law violation . Investors are contending that the alleged lack of transparency and the withholding of information constitute a breach of securities laws. These laws are in place to protect investors by ensuring companies provide accurate and complete information about their business operations and financial status, especially when it could influence investment decisions. If these allegations are proven true, Bakkt could face serious repercussions, including financial penalties and reputational damage. The lawsuit highlights the critical importance of transparency and regulatory compliance within the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for platforms that handle significant volumes of digital assets and investor funds. Consider these points regarding the securities law violation aspect: Legal Framework: Securities laws are designed to ensure fair and transparent markets. Investor Protection: These laws aim to protect investors from fraudulent or misleading information. Alleged Breach: Investors claim Bakkt’s actions or inactions violated these laws through non-disclosure. Potential Consequences: If found guilty, Bakkt could face fines, legal injunctions, and damage to investor trust. Bakkt: A Cryptocurrency Platform Under Scrutiny Bakkt’s position as a leading cryptocurrency platform makes this lawsuit particularly noteworthy. Launched with considerable fanfare and the backing of ICE, a giant in the traditional financial world, Bakkt was envisioned to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset market. It offers services including cryptocurrency trading, custody solutions, and institutional on-ramps to the crypto space. The platform’s credibility and reputation are now under a cloud of uncertainty due to this legal challenge. For users and observers of the crypto market, this situation serves as a stark reminder that even platforms with strong institutional backing are not immune to legal and regulatory scrutiny. It underscores the inherent risks associated with investing in the volatile cryptocurrency market and the importance of due diligence. Key takeaways about Bakkt as a platform in this context: Institutional Backing: Owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a major stock exchange group. Service Range: Offers trading, custody, and institutional crypto solutions. Market Position: A prominent player aiming to connect traditional finance with crypto. Reputation at Stake: The lawsuit poses a significant threat to Bakkt’s reputation and future growth. Class Action Lawsuit: What Does it Mean for Bakkt and Investors? A class action lawsuit is a legal procedure that allows a large group of people with similar grievances to collectively bring a claim against a defendant. In this case, it means that numerous Bakkt investors who believe they suffered losses due to the alleged non-disclosure have joined forces to sue the company. For Bakkt, a class action lawsuit can be a protracted and expensive legal battle. It also amplifies the negative publicity and could further erode investor confidence. For the investors involved, it provides a way to pool resources and potentially recover losses that might be too small to pursue individually. However, class action lawsuits can be lengthy, and the outcome is never guaranteed. Let’s understand the implications of a class action: Collective Action: Many investors unite to file a single lawsuit. Efficiency: More efficient than individual lawsuits for similar claims. Potential Impact on Bakkt: Significant legal costs, reputational damage, and potential financial payouts if they lose. Investor Opportunity: Allows investors to seek collective redress for alleged wrongdoing. Navigating the Crypto Landscape: Transparency and Due Diligence The Bakkt lawsuit serves as a critical reminder of the importance of transparency and due diligence in the cryptocurrency space. For investors, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research and understand the risks associated with any cryptocurrency platform or investment. For platforms like Bakkt, maintaining open communication and adhering to regulatory standards is paramount for building and retaining investor trust. As the legal proceedings unfold, the crypto community will be closely watching the developments. The outcome of this class action lawsuit could set precedents for transparency and disclosure expectations within the cryptocurrency industry and further shape the regulatory landscape. It highlights the ongoing maturation of the crypto market and the increasing demand for accountability and investor protection. Key takeaways for moving forward: Investor Vigilance: Always perform due diligence before investing in crypto platforms. Transparency is Key: Platforms must prioritize clear and timely communication with investors. Regulatory Scrutiny: The crypto industry is facing increasing regulatory attention, demanding compliance and accountability. Market Evolution: Incidents like this lawsuit contribute to the maturing and regulation of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Bakkt and Crypto Transparency? The Bakkt lawsuit is more than just a legal challenge for a single company; it’s a potential watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the growing pains of a rapidly evolving market grappling with issues of transparency, regulation, and investor protection. The allegations of securities law violation and non-disclosure are serious and demand careful consideration from all stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem. Whether this lawsuit will result in significant changes at Bakkt and across the broader crypto space remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the demand for transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency market is only going to intensify. Investors are becoming more discerning, and regulatory bodies are paying closer attention. The Bakkt case serves as a powerful reminder that in the world of digital assets, trust and transparency are not just desirable – they are essential for long-term sustainability and growth.

Cryptocurrency markets are often seen as a hedge against traditional finance, but they’re not immune to broader economic trends. New data from Kalshi, a prediction market platform, is sending ripples through financial circles. Let’s dive into why their latest forecast is particularly concerning for 2025 and what it could mean for your investments. What’s Behind the Rising Fear of a US Recession in 2025? Kalshi, known for its real-time prediction markets on various events, has recently updated its data regarding the likelihood of a US recession . According to their platform, the probability of an economic recession hitting the United States in 2025 has surged to a sobering 62%. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s the highest level observed in recent months, signaling a potentially significant shift in economic sentiment. This figure alone should raise eyebrows, prompting investors and the general public alike to consider the implications. But what exactly does this 62% probability mean? It signifies that based on market activity and predictive modeling on Kalshi, the prevailing sentiment points towards a more than likely economic downturn within the next couple of years. While not a certainty, a 62% chance is far from negligible and warrants serious attention. It suggests that a majority of participants in these prediction markets are betting on economic headwinds becoming stronger. Kalshi’s Market Prediction: A Reliable Indicator? You might be wondering, why should we pay attention to Kalshi? Kalshi operates as a regulated prediction market, allowing users to trade on the probability of specific events. The collective wisdom of the crowd, reflected in these markets, can often provide valuable insights. Here’s why Kalshi’s data is noteworthy: Real-time Sentiment: Kalshi’s data reflects up-to-the-minute market sentiment, offering a dynamic view of expectations compared to lagging economic indicators. Crowdsourced Predictions: It aggregates predictions from a diverse group of users, potentially mitigating individual biases. Track Record: Prediction markets have, in some instances, shown surprising accuracy in forecasting events. However, it’s crucial to remember that Kalshi’s data is not a crystal ball. It’s a reflection of market sentiment and probabilities, not a guarantee. It’s one piece of the puzzle in understanding the complex economic landscape. Think of it as a sophisticated weather vane for the economic climate – it points in a certain direction, but the actual weather can still surprise you. Decoding the 62% Recession Probability: What Does it Imply? Let’s break down what a 62% probability of a recession 2025 actually suggests: Increased Economic Uncertainty: This figure highlights a significant level of uncertainty and pessimism regarding the future health of the U.S. economy. Potential for Market Volatility: Heightened recession fears can lead to increased volatility in financial markets, including cryptocurrency. Business and Consumer Impact: A recession can impact businesses through reduced demand and consumers through job losses and decreased spending power. Investment Strategy Adjustments: Investors might need to reassess their strategies, considering more defensive positions or hedging against potential downturns. It’s not time to panic, but it is certainly time to pay attention and prepare. Understanding the potential implications is the first step in navigating uncertain economic waters. Navigating the Potential Economic Downturn: Is Your Portfolio Ready? So, with a 62% probability of a market prediction pointing towards a recession, what should you do? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across asset classes, including potentially recession-resistant assets, can be beneficial. Review Risk Tolerance: Assess your comfort level with risk and adjust your portfolio accordingly. A potential recession might warrant a more conservative approach for some. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic news and indicators. Understanding the evolving economic narrative is crucial for making informed decisions. Consider Long-Term Strategy: Recessions are often cyclical. Maintain a long-term perspective and avoid making rash decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. While the crypto market can be volatile, it also presents opportunities. Some argue that during traditional financial downturns, cryptocurrencies could act as alternative assets. However, this is still a developing narrative, and thorough research and caution are always advised. Beyond Kalshi: Broader Economic Indicators and Recession Signals While Kalshi’s data provides a valuable perspective, it’s essential to look at a range of economic indicators to form a comprehensive view of the potential for a US recession . Consider these factors: Indicator Relevance to Recession Prediction Inflation Rates Persistent high inflation can prompt central banks to aggressively raise interest rates, potentially slowing economic growth. Interest Rate Hikes Aggressive rate hikes can cool down the economy, but also risk triggering a recession if they become too restrictive. GDP Growth Slowing or negative GDP growth is a primary indicator of economic contraction and recession. Unemployment Rate Rising unemployment is a lagging indicator but signifies economic distress and reduced consumer spending. Consumer Confidence Declining consumer confidence can foreshadow reduced spending and economic slowdown. Analyzing these indicators in conjunction with market sentiment, like that reflected on Kalshi, offers a more robust understanding of the economic outlook. Conclusion: Heeding the Warning Signs of a Potential Recession Kalshi’s 62% probability for a recession 2025 is a stark reminder of the economic uncertainties that lie ahead. While predictions are not guarantees, this data point, combined with other economic indicators, suggests a heightened need for vigilance and preparedness. For cryptocurrency investors and anyone engaged in financial markets, staying informed, diversifying portfolios, and understanding risk tolerance are crucial steps in navigating potential economic turbulence. The key takeaway is not to be paralyzed by fear, but to be proactive and informed. The economic landscape is constantly evolving, and adaptability is your greatest asset.

42923651,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146538,1743817848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Yuan Power Surge: Dalio Predicts US-China Trade Talks Could Unleash Tariff Relief,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/yuan-power-surge-trade-talks/,"Are you watching the global financial chessboard closely? For those in the crypto space, understanding macro trends is crucial, and right now, all eyes are on the potential shifts in the US-China relationship. Legendary investor Ray Dalio suggests that ongoing US-China discussions could trigger significant changes, potentially leading to a stronger Chinese Yuan and a welcome wave of tariff relief . Let’s dive into what this could mean for the global economy and your crypto portfolio. Decoding Dalio: Why US-China Talks Matter for the Chinese Yuan Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, isn’t just any investor; he’s a macroeconomics guru whose insights are closely followed by financial professionals worldwide. When Dalio speaks about US-China trade talks , it’s time to listen. He posits that constructive dialogues between the world’s two largest economies could have profound implications, particularly for the Chinese Yuan . But why should crypto enthusiasts care about the Yuan? Here’s the connection: Global Economic Ripple Effects: The strength of the Yuan is a barometer for the health of the Chinese economy, which in turn significantly influences the global economy. A stronger Yuan can indicate increased economic confidence and stability in China, impacting global trade and investment flows. Currency Market Dynamics: Fluctuations in major currencies like the Yuan can affect broader currency markets, including those relevant to cryptocurrency trading pairs. Changes in the Yuan’s value can create arbitrage opportunities and influence trading strategies. Geopolitical Stability: Positive US-China trade talks can signal reduced geopolitical tensions, fostering a more stable global economic environment. Stability is generally seen as favorable for investment markets, including the crypto market. Dalio’s perspective is rooted in understanding historical patterns and economic cycles. He believes that nations often go through periods of cooperation and competition. Currently, a move towards cooperation, even incrementally, could be beneficial. Tariff Relief on the Horizon? Unpacking the Potential Benefits One of the most keenly anticipated outcomes of improved US-China relations is tariff relief . Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, have been a major point of contention between the two nations. Easing these tariffs could unlock a cascade of positive economic effects: Potential Benefits of Tariff Relief: Benefit Description Impact Reduced Costs for Businesses Lower tariffs mean cheaper imported goods for businesses in both countries. Increased profitability, potentially leading to business expansion and investment. Lower Consumer Prices Cost savings for businesses can be passed on to consumers through lower prices. Increased consumer spending and purchasing power. Boosted Trade Activity Reduced trade barriers encourage greater volumes of imports and exports. Stimulates economic growth in both nations and globally. Improved Investor Sentiment Signs of easing trade tensions create a more optimistic outlook for investors. Increased investment in various asset classes, including potentially crypto. For the cryptocurrency market, improved investor sentiment and a healthier global economy are generally positive catalysts. When traditional markets thrive, there’s often a spillover effect into alternative investments like crypto. Navigating the Challenges: Are Smooth US-China Talks Guaranteed? While the prospect of a stronger Yuan and tariff relief is enticing, it’s crucial to maintain a realistic perspective. US-China trade talks are complex and fraught with challenges. Here are some potential hurdles: Geopolitical Tensions: Beyond trade, numerous geopolitical issues still strain US-China relations. These include disagreements on technology, human rights, and regional influence. These tensions can easily derail trade progress. Domestic Political Pressures: Political considerations within both the US and China can influence the negotiation positions and willingness to compromise. Domestic agendas might take precedence over trade agreements. Implementation Hurdles: Even if agreements are reached, implementing and enforcing them can be complex. Disagreements over compliance can resurface and create new friction. Economic Competition: At their core, the US and China are economic competitors. This fundamental competition will continue to shape their relationship, even with efforts to improve trade ties. Therefore, while Dalio’s perspective offers a hopeful scenario, it’s essential to recognize that the path to smoother US-China trade talks is not guaranteed. Expect potential setbacks and volatility along the way. Ray Dalio’s Actionable Insights: What Can Crypto Investors Learn? So, how can crypto investors translate Dalio’s analysis into actionable strategies? Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Monitor Yuan Strength: Keep an eye on the Chinese Yuan’s performance. A consistent strengthening trend could signal positive developments in US-China relations and a healthier Chinese economy. Track Trade Talk News: Stay informed about the progress (or lack thereof) in US-China trade talks . News of breakthroughs or setbacks can create short-term market fluctuations. Diversify Globally: A stronger Yuan and improved global trade could benefit economies beyond just China and the US. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio to include assets that might benefit from broader global economic growth. Manage Risk: Remember that geopolitical and economic events can introduce volatility. Implement robust risk management strategies, such as position sizing and stop-loss orders, to protect your capital. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term fluctuations are possible, focus on the long-term implications. Improved US-China relations, if sustained, could contribute to a more stable and prosperous global economy , which is generally beneficial for all asset classes over time. The Powerful Takeaway: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Global Finance Ray Dalio’s analysis serves as a crucial reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the potential impact of US-China trade talks . The prospect of a stronger Chinese Yuan and tariff relief offers a glimmer of optimism in a complex global landscape. For crypto investors, understanding these macro trends is not just academic; it’s essential for informed decision-making and navigating the ever-evolving financial markets. While challenges remain and the path forward may be bumpy, the potential rewards of improved US-China relations are significant. By staying informed, adaptable, and focused on long-term trends, crypto investors can position themselves to capitalize on the opportunities that arise from these global shifts.

42923953,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=725238,1743818404,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42923953.jpeg,Is The Solana Bottom In? Experts Answer,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/is-the-solana-bottom-in-experts-answer/,"In a new technical analysis shared via X, crypto analyst Scott Melker aka The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) highlighted a critical support-resistance setup for Solana (SOL), emphasizing what he views as a textbook bounce off of a key technical level. “Picture perfect bounce off of $112 support. Double bottom would confirm with a break above $147, the swing high between the two bottoms. Don’t let anyone call it a double bottom until that happens. Regardless, nice bounce off of support with defined resistance to watch,” Melker stated. The analyst’s chart shows SOL rebounding from near $112, reinforcing that zone as significant short-term support. For a bullish double-bottom pattern to validate, Melker points to a breakout above the downtrend line (currently around $130). If SOL breaks this resistance, $147 will be the critical level that would need to be breached. Until then, he advises caution about prematurely labeling the formation as a confirmed double bottom. Solana Bottom In? Notably, these remarks come on the heels of unlocks. According to a post by on-chain intelligence firm Arkham on Thursday, “$200M OF SOL UNLOCKING TOMORROW. Tomorrow (4th April) marks the largest single-day unlock of staked SOL until 2028. These 4 accounts staked a total of $37.7M of SOL in April 2021, and are up 5.5x at current prices.” The scale of these unlocks has generated considerable discussion on social media. Related Reading: Solana Bearish Continuation: $118 Support, The Last Barricade Against Deeper Another trader, NooNe0x, took a more optimistic stance, remarking, “SOL unlocks. Looking at the bright side, today’s unlock was the last large block. Today alone is as much as 40% of everything that is still left. It is 78% done, May, June and only large-ish blocks left. Ripping the bandaid off.” In other words, with the bulk of significant unlocks possibly behind it, the supply overhang from locked tokens might be dissipating. Historically, major token unlock events—whether for Solana or other projects—have often been anticipated well in advance by traders and investors. Markets “price in” that large holders sell their old tokens, sometimes driving prices lower ahead of the actual unlock. Once the unlock date arrives, if the anticipated sell-off does not materialize as severely as feared (or if much of the unlocked stake remains off the market), prices have tended to stabilize and often recover in the days or weeks that follow. Related Reading: Solana Leads The Bull Case For Crypto, Says Multicoin’s Samani This pattern emerges because many holders, especially larger or early investors, may opt to restake or hold onto their tokens if they maintain a strong fundamental outlook. Meanwhile, short-term traders who had been betting on unlock-related volatility might close positions once the event passes. This “buy the rumor, sell the news” (or vice versa) dynamic can lead to price whipsaws around unlock periods, but no single outcome is guaranteed; much depends on how much actual selling pressure surfaces and broader market sentiment at the time. Meanwhile, Awawat, a trader and angel investor at APG Capital, cautioned that Solana could be in a precarious position despite holding above $100. “SOL absolutely shrekt – broke 170 range low, bounced at 120 a few times – now holding above 100 but the ice is thin – last big unlock tomorrow – will bid sub-100 if given but this looks rough given the state of the trenches,” he wrote. At press time, SOL traded at $115.

42924010,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146539,1743818444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Plunge: NFT Sales Crash 12% as Marketplaces Vanish – Is the Digital Collectibles Dream Over?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nft-sales-crash-marketplaces-vanish/,"Hold onto your digital wallets, NFT enthusiasts! The once-booming world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is experiencing a significant chill. March 2025 witnessed a surprising downturn, with overall NFT sales taking a noticeable dip. Let’s dive into the numbers and explore what this means for the future of digital collectibles. What’s Behind the Shocking Drop in NFT Sales? Recent research from Binance, highlighted by BeInCrypto, paints a stark picture. Across the top 10 blockchains, NFT sales plummeted by a substantial 12.4% in March 2025. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signals a considerable shift in market sentiment. Perhaps even more concerning is the dramatic 59.3% nosedive in sales specifically for Ethereum-based NFTs. Ethereum, traditionally the kingpin of the NFT space, is clearly feeling the heat. Adding fuel to the fire, buyer activity has slumped to its lowest point since October 2023, indicating a cooling interest from investors and collectors alike. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key takeaways: Overall NFT Sales Decline: A significant 12.4% drop across major blockchains in March 2025. Ethereum NFTs Hit Hard: A massive 59.3% decrease in sales for Ethereum-based NFTs. Buyer Activity Dries Up: Lowest buyer engagement since October 2023. Marketplace Meltdown: Why are NFT Marketplaces Shutting Down? Adding to the market woes, several prominent NFT marketplaces are throwing in the towel. Major platforms like Bybit and X2Y2 have recently announced closures, a clear sign of the mounting pressure in the NFT sector. These closures aren’t just isolated incidents; they reflect a broader struggle for survival in a less exuberant market. The shrinking sales volumes and reduced trading activity are likely making it unsustainable for some platforms to operate. This consolidation could reshape the landscape of NFT marketplaces , potentially leading to a more centralized ecosystem. Why are these closures significant? Market Contraction: Platform closures indicate a shrinking market and reduced overall activity. Platform Sustainability Issues: Lower sales volumes make it harder for marketplaces to remain profitable. Ecosystem Reshaping: Consolidation could lead to fewer, larger marketplaces dominating the NFT space. Ethereum NFTs: Is the Dominance Dwindling in the Crypto Downturn? The substantial drop in Ethereum NFTs sales raises questions about the platform’s continued dominance in the digital art and collectibles arena. Adding to the concern, Ethereum’s fee revenue has plummeted by a staggering 95% since the heady days of 2021. This dramatic decrease in fees directly reflects the diminished activity within the Ethereum NFT ecosystem. While Ethereum remains a foundational blockchain, the data suggests that its grip on the NFT market may be loosening amidst the broader crypto downturn . The rise of competing blockchains and changing investor preferences could be contributing to this shift. Key points regarding Ethereum and NFTs: Dramatic Fee Revenue Drop: Ethereum’s NFT fee revenue is down 95% since 2021. Reduced Ecosystem Activity: Lower fees directly correlate with decreased NFT trading and activity on Ethereum. Shifting Market Dynamics: Competition from other blockchains and evolving investor interests may be impacting Ethereum’s dominance. Bright Spots in the Bleakness: Are Any NFT Sectors Thriving? Despite the overall gloom, there are glimmers of hope within the NFT landscape. While most blockchains experienced declines, Immutable and Panini bucked the trend, showcasing positive growth. Panini, in particular, witnessed an astounding 259.2% surge in sales! This suggests that certain niches within the digital collectibles market are still resonating with audiences. Panini’s success likely stems from its focus on sports-related NFTs, indicating that collectibles with real-world connections and established brands may hold stronger appeal during market corrections. Immutable’s growth also points towards the potential of gaming-focused NFTs, a sector that continues to attract interest. Positive trends amidst the downturn: Immutable’s Growth: Demonstrates resilience in specific NFT sectors. Panini’s Explosive Surge: 259.2% sales increase, highlighting the strength of sports collectibles. Niche Market Resilience: Collectibles with real-world links and gaming NFTs show continued potential. Is This the End of the Digital Collectibles Dream? Actionable Insights for NFT Enthusiasts While the current crypto downturn and the decline in NFT sales might seem alarming, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. Market corrections are a natural part of any evolving financial space, and the NFT market is no exception. This period could be viewed as a necessary recalibration, weeding out unsustainable projects and platforms, and paving the way for more robust and mature growth in the future. The long-term potential of digital collectibles remains significant, especially as metaverse adoption and blockchain technology continue to advance. Actionable Insights: Diversify your NFT Portfolio: Explore NFTs beyond Ethereum, considering emerging blockchains and niche markets. Focus on Utility and Value: Prioritize NFTs with real-world utility or strong community backing, rather than purely speculative assets. Stay Informed and Adapt: Keep abreast of market trends and be prepared to adjust your NFT strategies as the landscape evolves. Long-Term Vision: Consider the long-term potential of NFTs in gaming, metaverse, and digital ownership, rather than short-term price fluctuations. Conclusion: Navigating the NFT Market Correction The recent dip in NFT sales and the closure of some NFT marketplaces serve as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the crypto world. While the headlines might scream ‘crash,’ it’s more accurate to view this as a significant market correction. The enthusiasm surrounding digital collectibles might have cooled from its peak, but the underlying technology and the potential for NFTs remain compelling. As the market matures, we can expect to see a greater focus on quality, utility, and sustainable growth. For savvy investors and collectors, this period of recalibration could present new opportunities to acquire valuable assets and position themselves for the next wave of NFT innovation.

After dedicating four and a half years to Paradigm’s research endeavors, Samczsun is now poised to channel his expertise and passion into Security Alliance (SEAL), a non-profit entity he has founded. This move marks a significant shift in the landscape of crypto security , prompting discussions across the industry about the future of proactive security measures in the digital asset space. Who is Samczsun and What Was His Role at Paradigm? For those deeply entrenched in the world of cryptocurrency, the name Samczsun resonates with trust and expertise. Known for his sharp insights and proactive approach to identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities, Samczsun has become a pivotal figure in the often turbulent waters of crypto security. His work at Paradigm, a leading investment firm focused on crypto and Web3 companies, involved in-depth research aimed at understanding and enhancing the security of blockchain technologies and decentralized applications. During his tenure at Paradigm, Samczsun wasn’t just another researcher. He was a key contributor to the firm’s understanding of the intricate security challenges facing the crypto ecosystem. His work likely involved: Vulnerability Research: Proactively identifying potential weaknesses in smart contracts, blockchain protocols, and decentralized applications before they could be exploited. Security Audits: Analyzing the security architecture of projects Paradigm was considering investing in, ensuring a robust and secure foundation. Incident Response: Potentially assisting portfolio companies in responding to security incidents and breaches. Community Engagement: Sharing his knowledge and insights with the broader crypto community, contributing to a more secure ecosystem for everyone. His departure from Paradigm therefore isn’t just a personnel change; it’s a noteworthy event for the crypto space, given his established reputation and the critical nature of his work. Why Focus on Crypto Security and the Birth of SEAL? The cryptocurrency world, while brimming with innovation and potential, is also a hotbed for cyber threats. From smart contract exploits to rug pulls and exchange hacks, the risks are ever-present. This inherent vulnerability underscores the critical need for robust crypto security measures. Samczsun’s move to dedicate himself fully to Security Alliance (SEAL) highlights this pressing need. SEAL is envisioned as a non-profit organization focused on bolstering security across the crypto ecosystem. This initiative is particularly timely as the industry continues to grapple with increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. SEAL’s mission is deeply rooted in proactive security and community support. It aims to: Provide Resources and Tools: Develop and distribute tools and resources that empower developers and users to build and interact with crypto platforms more securely. Foster Collaboration: Create a collaborative environment where security researchers, developers, and projects can work together to address security challenges collectively. Emergency Response: Offer rapid response mechanisms to assist projects and users facing security emergencies, such as vulnerability disclosures or active exploits. Education and Awareness: Raise awareness about common security threats and best practices within the crypto space through educational content and outreach programs. By focusing on these key areas, SEAL aims to be a vital support system for the entire crypto community, strengthening its defenses against malicious actors. Spotlight on SEAL 911: A Direct Line to Crypto Security Assistance At the heart of SEAL’s operations is SEAL 911 , a Telegram bot designed to provide immediate access to a trusted security community during critical moments. Imagine a scenario: a project discovers a critical vulnerability, or users suspect a rug pull. In such high-pressure situations, swift and reliable communication is paramount. This is precisely where SEAL 911 steps in. Here’s how SEAL 911 works and its key benefits: Feature Description Benefit Telegram Bot Interface Users interact with SEAL 911 through the familiar Telegram messaging app. Easy accessibility and user-friendliness, especially during emergencies when time is critical. Direct Connection to Security Team Messages sent to the bot are immediately forwarded to the SEAL security team. Ensures rapid response and direct communication with security experts. Emergency Support Network Connects users with a community of trusted security professionals ready to assist. Provides a safety net and expert guidance during security incidents. Vulnerability Disclosure Assistance Facilitates responsible vulnerability disclosure processes. Helps projects address vulnerabilities ethically and efficiently, minimizing potential damage. Rug Pull Emergency Support Offers guidance and resources for users affected by potential rug pulls. Provides support and potential avenues for recourse in cases of malicious scams. SEAL 911 isn’t just a bot; it’s a lifeline in the fast-paced and often risky world of cryptocurrency. It provides a crucial service by bridging the gap between those who need security assistance and those who can provide it, especially in time-sensitive emergencies. What Does Samczsun’s Departure Mean for Paradigm and the Future of Cybersecurity Researchers? Paradigm , while losing a valuable asset in Samczsun, will undoubtedly continue its commitment to crypto security. Investment firms in the crypto space are increasingly recognizing the importance of robust security practices, both for their own operations and for the projects they support. Paradigm’s future strategy in research and security might evolve, potentially focusing on building in-house teams, collaborating with SEAL, or adopting other innovative approaches. Samczsun’s move could also signal a broader trend. The increasing focus on non-profit initiatives like SEAL could represent a maturing of the crypto security landscape. Cybersecurity researchers like Samczsun are crucial for the industry’s growth and sustainability. Their expertise is not just about protecting individual projects or firms; it’s about building trust and resilience into the entire ecosystem. By dedicating himself to SEAL, Samczsun is amplifying his impact, potentially benefiting a wider range of projects and users than he could within a single firm. This transition could inspire other security experts to explore similar paths, creating a stronger, more decentralized, and community-driven approach to crypto security. The industry needs more dedicated cybersecurity researcher talent, and initiatives like SEAL may play a critical role in attracting, nurturing, and deploying this talent effectively. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Security Samczsun’s departure from Paradigm to focus on Security Alliance is more than just a career change; it’s a significant moment for the crypto industry. It underscores the paramount importance of proactive and community-driven crypto security . SEAL, with its flagship initiative SEAL 911, is poised to become a crucial resource for projects and users navigating the complex security landscape of digital assets. As Samczsun embarks on this new chapter, the crypto community watches with anticipation and support, hopeful that SEAL will indeed become a powerful force for enhanced security and resilience across the entire ecosystem. His dedication exemplifies the spirit of collaboration and proactive defense that is essential for the continued growth and trust in cryptocurrencies.

Tether, the issuer of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, is signaling a significant strategic pivot. Could we be seeing a future where USDT isn’t readily available in the U.S. and Europe? Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it means for the cryptocurrency landscape. Why is Tether Considering a Market Shift? The core reason behind Tether’s potential market realignment boils down to evolving regulations in the United States and the European Union. According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, Tether is proactively preparing for a scenario where USDT might not be able to operate within these major economic zones due to increasingly stringent regulatory frameworks. This isn’t about abandoning ship, but rather a strategic maneuver to ensure long-term viability and compliance. Here’s a breakdown of the key drivers: Stringent Regulatory Landscape: Both the U.S. and EU are tightening the reins on crypto assets, particularly stablecoins. New regulations are emerging that demand greater transparency, reserve management, and operational compliance. Cost of Compliance: Adapting USDT to fully comply with every new regulation in each jurisdiction could be complex and resource-intensive. Tether seems to be weighing the benefits against the costs of such extensive modifications. Focus on Emerging Markets: Tether has witnessed substantial growth and adoption of USDT in emerging markets . These regions often present less restrictive regulatory environments and a strong appetite for stablecoins as a bridge to digital finance. EU Regulations and Binance Delisting: Recent EU rules have already had a tangible impact, leading Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, to delist USDT in Europe. This event underscores the immediate regulatory pressure in the region. The Strategic Play: A New Compliant Stablecoin Instead of overhauling USDT to meet the specific demands of U.S. stablecoin regulations, Tether is exploring a more strategic approach: launching a separate, fully compliant stablecoin specifically designed for the U.S. market. This is a significant move, indicating a willingness to adapt to regulatory pressures while maintaining the core functionality of USDT for its primary user base. Key Aspects of this Strategy: Targeted Compliance: A new stablecoin can be built from the ground up to adhere to all U.S. regulatory requirements, ensuring smooth operation within the American financial system. USDT Focus Remains: This allows USDT to continue its current trajectory, catering to the global market , especially emerging economies, without being encumbered by U.S.-specific regulatory constraints. Regional Compliance: Tether is also reportedly backing other regionally compliant stablecoins in both the U.S. and EU. This suggests a broader strategy of fostering a network of compliant stablecoins tailored to different jurisdictions. What Does This Mean for USDT and the Crypto Market? The potential shift raises several important questions about the future of USDT and its role in the wider cryptocurrency market . While CEO Ardoino expresses optimism about USDT remaining available on U.S. secondary markets, the long-term implications are worth considering. Potential Impacts: Impact Area Potential Consequence US Market Access to USDT Reduced availability on primary exchanges, potentially impacting liquidity and trading pairs directly involving USD. However, secondary market presence might mitigate this. Stablecoin Competition The launch of a new U.S.-compliant stablecoin by Tether could intensify competition in the U.S. stablecoin market , potentially challenging existing players. Global USDT Adoption USDT’s focus on emerging markets could further solidify its dominance in these regions, driving wider crypto adoption in areas with less stringent regulations . Regulatory Scrutiny Tether’s strategic moves will likely be closely watched by regulators globally, potentially influencing future regulatory approaches to stablecoins. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users So, what should crypto users and investors take away from this news? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on regulatory developments in your region and how they might affect stablecoin availability and usage. Diversify Stablecoin Holdings: Consider diversifying your stablecoin portfolio beyond just USDT to mitigate potential risks associated with regulatory changes. Explore other compliant stablecoins available in your jurisdiction. Understand Regional Differences: Recognize that the crypto landscape is becoming increasingly fragmented by regional regulations . Strategies and available assets may vary significantly depending on your location. Monitor Tether’s Announcements: Pay attention to official announcements from Tether regarding their new stablecoin and any changes to USDT’s availability in different markets . Conclusion: A Bold Step into a Regulated Future Tether’s proactive approach to potentially bifurcating its stablecoin strategy – maintaining USDT’s global focus while introducing a new U.S.-compliant option – is a bold move in the face of increasing regulatory complexity. It signals a pragmatic understanding of the evolving crypto landscape and a willingness to adapt to ensure long-term sustainability. The coming months will be crucial in observing how these strategies unfold and reshape the stablecoin market .

Since they don't require machines to secure ledgers, Proof-of-Stake Digital Assets might theoretically be immune from tariff considerations since they don't physically exist. Concerns remain in Ethereum's spot ETF capital flows. Where despite positive year to date net flows through April 3rd, there is a relative lack of demand compared to BTC ETFs. We can see this specifically through ETHE's share of total spot ETH ETF supply - which still stands at 38% and makes ETHE the largest fund. April 4th brings another session of turmoil and panic in global markets. Equities, commodities, and precious metals are all experiencing another day of deep, across-the-board losses. Of all markets, it is cryptocurrencies that are actually holding up well, with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) both green during April 4th trading as of article submission. Frankly, this is a somewhat perplexing development, but I'll get into why I believe there is perhaps a signal in the apparent 'crypto immunity' from global tariff concerns. In this Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHE ) article, we'll get into ETH's correlation with tech stocks, holder data, and recent capital flows. Digital Asset Tariff Immunity? Let's start with the obvious; cryptocurrencies and digital assets don't actually exist. Shocker, I know. But it happens to be true. Thus, in a world with trade-war escalation, assets that are not bound by physics or geographic borders have perhaps understandably shown little regard for tariff concerns since 'Liberation Day.' 5 Day Performance (Seeking Alpha) The chart above shows BTC and ETH against proxies for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 as well as Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) and Crude Oil ( CL1:COM ). Through 2pm on April 4th BTC and ETH are holding up while virtually every other major asset or index is down by at least 3%. Digital assets theoretically being immune from jurisdiction risk regarding tariffs is really only one part of this, however. What I still find very perplexing about the action for BTC and ETH is that during stock market panics like the one we're seeing in real time, we often see everything down together as market participants raise liquidity any way they can. For instance, it's not out of the realm of possibility that profitable Gold positions could be sold by speculators who are de-risking while equities fall apart. One would think BTC and ETH would be getting dragged down in sympathy with the rest of the market due to possible margin calls. But that is not happening as the week of March 31st draws to a close. IntoTheBlock It's hard to truly express how bizarre this is because these assets are typically tightly correlated with US equities, particularly tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven. Between mid-March and today, only Tesla ( TSLA ) has seen correlation with ETH dip below 65%. Most of the stocks shown in the chart above had correlations with ETH in excess of 80%. Could it truly be that tariffs don't impact cryptos? I'm actually much less sold on that possibility; especially for Bitcoin, which has a US mining footprint that requires machines produced overseas for hashing. This is not a concern for ETH, since Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake network. Perhaps more likely? Down nearly 60% since mid-December, ETH has already sold off so bad that it's possible that there is simply nobody left who is willing to sell - even raising liquidity could alleviate problems elsewhere. ETH Holders (IntoTheBlock) At 53% of holders currently 'out of the money,' this level of token holders hanging onto losing positions hasn't been seen in ETH in about 5 years. So what do we do with this information? I've been more cautious about Ethereum in recent months on what I view to be a weakening fundamental story, given the network's lack of fees and scaling through secondary layers that don't require nearly as much ETH for gas payment. Given that, it's hard for me to say 'buy ETH' based on any fundamental improvement in the market. But there are other considerations to keep in mind. Seasonality and Capital Flows ETH Seasonality (TrendSpider) I think we have to take some of the seasonality information with a grain of salt because it flat out did not work in January, February, or March. That said, April and May have historically been the best two months of the year for ETH based on mean change. That figure is 23% for April (2025 is included here) and 31% for May. For me, the bigger thing to pay attention to is whether capital is flowing in or out of ETH-based financial products. Asset (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin -$826 $1,519 $114,475 Ethereum -$370 $316 $9,565 Multi-asset -$206 -$137 $6,366 Solana $27 $86 $1,194 XRP $15 $168 $957 Source: CoinShares, as of March 28th We know that capital exited ETH products during the last full month of March. However, year to date flow for ETH was still positive at $316 million at the end of the month. ETH ETF Flows (Farside Investors) Even though we've seen a little under $60 million come out of Ethereum ETFs so far through three full days in April, the majority of that outflow is from a $31 million single day decline in ETHE on April 2nd. On that same day, an additional $20.2 million came out of the iShares Ethereum ETF ( ETHA ). The problem ultimately is that ETHE's outflow on the 2nd isn't indicative of Grayscale 'fee flight' continuation: ETH ETF Supply Share (TheBlock) In fact, ETH ETF share of on-chain supply still favors ETHE which commands over a third of the total market at 38.3%. Importantly, ETHE holding firm in supply share for most of 2025 is probably more indicative of a lack of demand for other funds. For instance, it took a little over 4 months for the iShares product to become the largest ETF holder of Bitcoin in the US spot ETF market. We're 8 months into ETH ETFs in the US market, and ETHE still has a 43% supply edge over ETHA. I read this primarily as a lack of investment demand for Ethereum more broadly. Closing Takeaways To answer the question from the headline from the title, I do think ETH is sending a signal. On a day filled with motivated sellers, ETH holders were not among them. Ultimately though, I see more than just one signal in the data. While it's quite encouraging that ETH didn't fall apart with the rest of the market on April 4th, it's perhaps more of an indication that ETH isn't actually as far along with traditional investors as digital asset holders might have hoped. Perhaps the reason ETH isn't getting slammed with the rest of the market is because there just aren't enough people holding it to begin with? Bottom pickers may find the $1,800 per coin level to be an interesting enough area to make a contrarian trade attempt. I'll re-share something I said in March about how I still currently view ETH technicals: I see $2,100 per coin serving as support on weekly closes going back to late 2023. That level was breached on a close the week of March 3rd, failed a back test the week of March 10th, and is currently still under that key level as of article submission on March 20th. I, personally, would not entertain taking a stab at that trade from the long side until we see the coin take back $2,100 on a weekly close. The lack of demand for products like ETHA and similarly lower-priced spot ETFs might remain a headwind of Ethereum bulls should holders keep selling out of ETHE positions. In spite of real problems with ETH's network activity, you could still talk me into holding spot ETH ETFs, but ETHE isn't one of them.",ETH-USD|ETHE,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-05 02:36:06

However, many in the crypto industry see the SEC’s decision as a step in the right direction. In an April 4 statement, Crenshaw, who is widely known for opposing the spot Bitcoin ETFs, said that the SEC's statement on stablecoins contained ""legal and factual errors that paint a distorted picture of the USD-stablecoin market that drastically understates its risks."" Crenshaw disagrees, crypto industry applauds Under the new SEC guidelines, stablecoins that meet certain criteria are now considered ""non-securities"" and are exempt from transaction reporting requirements. Crenshaw disputed the accuracy of the analysis made by the SEC in arriving at that decision. She pushed back on the SEC for reiterating issuer actions ""that supposedly stabilize price, ensure redeemability, and otherwise reduce risk."" Source: David Sacks The SEC said that ""albeit briefly, that some USD-stablecoins are available to retail purchasers only through an intermediary and not directly from the issuer."" Crenshaw argued this was misleading. She said: ""It is the general rule, not the exception, that these coins are available to the retail public only through intermediaries who sell them on the secondary market, such as crypto trading platforms."" ""Over 90% of USD-stablecoins in circulation are distributed in this way,"" Crenshaw added. Meanwhile, many in the crypto industry expressed optimism over the decision. Token Metrics founder Ian Ballina said it “feels like a clear step in focusing on what really matters in the crypto space.” Crypto industry says positive step, just late Vemanti CEO Tan Tran said he wished the SEC reached this point three years ago, while Midnight Network’s head of partnerships Ian Kane said it “feels like progress for crypto folks trying to play by the rules.” Crenshaw said it is ""also grossly inaccurate"" for the SEC to reassure users that an issuer can handle unlimited redemptions just because its reserves match or exceed the value of the supply. Related: Stablecoins' in bull market'; Solana sputters: VanEck ""The issuer's overall financial health and solvency cannot be judged by the value of its reserve, which tells us nothing about its liabilities, risk from proprietary financial activities, and so forth,"" Crenshaw said. She explained that stablecoins always carry some risk, particularly during market downturns. It comes only weeks after stablecoin issuer Tether was reportedly engaging with a Big Four accounting firm to audit its assets reserve and verify that its USDT stablecoin is backed at a 1:1 ratio. On March 22, Cointelegraph reported that Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the audit process would be more straightforward under pro-crypto US President Donald Trump.

Russian Central Bank: Crypto Must Be Kept Out of Economy The Governor, a key ally of President Vladimir Putin and the chief architect of Moscow’s digital ruble (CBDC) project, was speaking in the State Duma on April 3, RBC reported. Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina addressing lawmakers in April 2025. (Source: DumaTV/Screenshot) Nabiullina, a long-time crypto skeptic, says Moscow also needs to “increase the liability” for people who make “settlements with cryptocurrencies in Russia.” She said that crypto must be kept out of “domestic settlements,” although she conceded that tokens could be used in international trade “within the framework of” the sandbox. Nabiullina said: “Our position is unchanged. We cannot allow crypto to penetrate into domestic monetary circulation; into settlements within the country. We propose to simultaneously pursue [crypto] investment opportunities and increase liability for the use of crypto in settlements within the country.” Russia has agreed to provide arms and military training to a newly formed joint force between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso https://t.co/zkp0MxIgXH — Bloomberg (@business) April 3, 2025 Criminal Liability for Traders? Russian lawmakers outlawed the use of crypto in payments back in 2020 . More recently, they have also legalized crypto mining. But Moscow is yet to pass any laws that govern the status of crypto trading. Lawmakers have also yet to rule on crypto’s legal status. Moscow is also still undecided on how it should police crypto exchanges . And while the use of crypto as a “domestic settlement tool” is illegal, enforcement is thought to be rare. Offenders do not currently face criminal liability. But Nabiullina, it appears, wants to change this. Russian dissident Gorinov fails in appeal against sentence for 'justifying terrorism' https://t.co/j3Qz0VNCdJ pic.twitter.com/hfL1RbDVSw — Reuters (@Reuters) April 3, 2025 The Central Bank Governor said the Russian government “really must protect retail investors from investing in crypto.” She explained: “Crypto is very volatile. Retail investors do not understand the risks involved with crypto. And it is unclear who is responsible for these coins.” However, it appears Nabiullina has accepted that despite her well-document wishes to keep crypto “out of the Russian economy,” she has also made many concessions to pro-industry forces.

(Source: Pyerviy Kanal/Screenshot) ‘Highly Qualified Investors’ Nabiullina again gave her blessing to plans to allow “highly qualified investors” to invest in crypto. However, she said this should be done “within the framework” of the sandbox. She even suggested that “ordinary qualified investors” could be given permission to invest in crypto derivatives “even outside” the sandbox. Nabiullina said: “We propose allowing highly qualified investors to invest in Russian crypto infrastructure. The criteria can be discussed.” Nearly 50% of Polymarket bettors predict that a recession is coming in 2025, a new poll on the decentralized betting market's website shows. #Polymarket #Tariffs https://t.co/oSxvLpnCOk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 3, 2025 Nabiullina dismissed notions that her stance was unreasonable. She noted that the Central Bank “has an absolutely normal approach” to the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign economic activity. She added that “several” companies were working in the sandbox. These companies are using crypto as a sanctions-evading tool for cross-border payments with overseas partners, she suggested. However, Nabiullina said she would not reveal the details of the firms involved “for obvious reasons.” Under existing proposals, only citizens who have already invested over 100 million rubles (around $1.2 million) in securities and deposits will be allowed to obtain the “super-qualified” investor status required to trade crypto in the sandbox. A further exception will be made for people whose yearly income “amounts to more than 50 million rubles ($587,000).” Russian bailiffs say they have developed new methods to help them convert Bitcoin (BTC) seized in criminal cases into cash for the state’s treasury. #Russia #Bitcoin https://t.co/a8ZnK7uvIX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 3, 2025 Russian Central Bank Crypto Stance: Lawmakers Divided After the Central Bank Governor had finished her address, the Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets Anatoly Aksakov suggested Moscow remains divided on the matter of crypto regulation. Vyacheslav Volodin, Chairman of the State Duma. (Source: Duma.gov.ru [CC BY 4.0]) Aksakov said that lower house lawmakers are “showing significant interest in the topic of cryptocurrencies.” He said that MPs are now either “attacking crypto,” or “are interested in the industry themselves.” Interfax , meanwhile, reported that Vyacheslav Volodin, the State Duma’s long-serving Chairman, urged lawmakers to step up their regulatory efforts on April 3. Volodin said: “Let’s think about what other rules we could make in this sector. Please don’t stop.

Saylor shared this view on X, telling his 4.2 million followers about Bitcoin’s unique position compared to physical goods. Related Reading: XRP Breakout Alert!

According to reports, many investors worried about how Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” plans would affect crypto prices. But these concerns haven’t caused major price drops so far. Asian Countries Face Highest Import Taxes Based on information from Trump’s announcement, several Asian nations will face steep tariffs on their goods entering the United States. China will see a 34% tax rate, while Japan faces 24%. Taiwan’s imports will be charged at 32%, and Vietnam tops the list with a 46% tariff.

Even American allies must pay more to sell their products in the US market. The UK will face a 10% tax on imports, Israel 17%, European Union countries 20%, and India 26%. China has already threatened to respond with its own tariffs if Trump doesn’t reverse his decision. The back-and-forth raises questions about broader economic impacts. Bitcoin Price Holds Strong Despite Economic Uncertainty Although Trump’s tariff announcements caused market jitters, Bitcoin prices have remained relatively stable. The cryptocurrency was trading at $83,105 when this article was written, with only a 1% drop over the last 24 hours. Some market analysts opine that physical goods carry the brunt of tariff effects, while digital assets may escape direct effects. Related Reading: Solana Slammed By Whale Dump—Can It Recover Or Is More Pain Ahead? The tariff impasse serves to emphasize Bitcoin’s odd position in global commerce. Unlike oil, gold, or manufactured goods that need to physically traverse borders, Bitcoin transactions occur electronically. This aspect may make cryptocurrencies a winner in trade conflicts since they cannot be halted or taxed at border points. Several investors are worrying that Bitcoin could still be indirectly affected by increased tariffs. If the costlier imports reduce the income of companies and consumers, they might invest less money into cryptocurrency, which might end up reducing funding to the cryptocurrency market. For now, it’s still above the $80,000 mark while the market watches the tariff development. Trump labeled his tariff proposal as “reciprocal,” adding that it reflects what other nations are charging on American products. As countries react to these new trade policies, cryptocurrency markets appear less impacted than other commodity markets.

Major holders of popular digital assets are now shifting their focus towards five emerging altcoins. The attention that these tokens are getting shows that there is belief in these smaller tokens. What are these altcoins, and why are they attracting interest from the big players? The answer could unveil the next big opportunity in the crypto industry. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The attention around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is attracting both fans in the sports world and crypto enthusiasts, creating a nice integration that is gaining serious attention. With a strong presale and the engagement of its community, some investors are already eyeing major gains from the project. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that rely on trends without substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. The project is blending the energy in the sports world with the viral nature of the meme culture, and it is working. The presale has been moving fast, with early buyers purchasing tokens at a fraction of what most consider would be the price of the asset in the future. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but the demand has been high. The price has already increased from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to about $0.003333 in Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million target already raised. Investors who got in early have already enjoyed a nice discount, and with the final presale target of $0.1, those numbers are attracting the attention of investors. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse has already earned a feature on CoinMarketCap, with the community showing a bullish mood on the coin–95% of the voters predict that $XYZ would grow. XYZ has also seen the attention of reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCpitalMaster, who has about 800,000 followers recently expressed his support for the project, noting that it has the best opportunity to reach the top. While nothing is sure in the crypto industry, the excitement cannot be denied. Aside from the hype, the tokenomics model of XYZVerse is aimed at enabling long-term sustainability. The developers said that 15% will be used for liquidity, in order to create a good market foundation. The project has also put aside 10% to reward its loyal followers via airdrops and bonuses. In addition, about 17.13% has been put aside for burns, which would reduce the supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing that makes XYZVerse appealing is its focus on its community. The team recently announced its Ambassador Program, where users get the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that is just the start, as the project is already in talks with sports celebrities to increase visibility. By integrating sports fans and the crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different using entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With its presale still growing fast, a strong community, and a good roadmap, XYZVerse has what it takes to get to the top in the crypto market. While the crypto market remains unpredictable, many investors are seeing this as an opportunity to enter a big project. The presale won’t last forever, so if you’re interested, now might be the best time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity HBAR: The Green Alternative Shaping the Future of Digital Transactions Hedera Hashgraph has been catching attention with its approach to decentralized networks. Unlike traditional blockchains, it uses hashgraph technology for its ledger. This method is efficient and environmentally friendly since it does not rely on mining. As a result of this, transactions are faster, costs are lower, and energy footprints are reduced. HBAR, the native token of the project, helps the network by covering transaction fees and ensuring security through its proof-of-stake system. This makes it the best option for quick, secure transactions, as well as smart contract applications in finance and other aspects. In the blockchain industry where there is competition among projects, Hedera Hashgraph faces the challenges of standing out. While its technology offers speed, security, and efficiency, it lacks community engagement compared to other open-source projects. However, with support from big projects in the sector, there is hope for the future. In this current market, where traders prefer sustainability and performance, HBAR presents the better alternative. Its special features could appeal to investors seeking solutions that go beyond traditional blockchains, suggesting a bright future for this project. Stellar (XLM): Connecting Currencies for a Global Money Revolution Stellar (XLM) is changing the way we think about how money moves across borders. Since its launch in 2014, the decentralized network has made it possible to transfer money easily across the border regardless of the currency. Whether it’s dollars, euros, or even bitcoin, this system allows fast transactions without favoring any currency. The platform is supported by the Stellar Developments Foundation, with initial support from Stripe. It has also processed billions of transactions and partnered with several companies in the world, proving its value in the real world. In today’s market, Stellar’s technology gives traders an edge. Unlike many projects that aim to push out traditional financial systems, Stellar aims to make them better through collaborations. This approach allows individuals to send money using its app and businesses to build blockchain applications or handle payments and conversions without issues. With the growing interest in the digital finance sector, Stellar’s ability to carry out transactions in any currency, including digital assets, makes it one of the best options in the market. Its focus on partnerships and integrations also makes the project an attractive option in global finance. NEAR Protocol: Sharding the Way to a Scalable Decentralized Future NEAR Protocol is making a name for itself in the blockchain industry. The project helps developers to create and launch their apps more easily. NEAR uses a technology called sharding to improve scalability and efficiency, meaning that transactions can be cheaper and faster. The platform has raised about $20 million from venture firms since its launch by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin. The platform is on a distributed network, which is similar to centralized data storage but without a single point of control. What makes NEAR one of the best in the industry is its technology stack. The Nightshade sharding solution ensures the network can divide transactions, handling more than one at a time. The Rainbow Bridge also allows easy token transfers from Ethereum, increasing interoperability. Aurora, the platform’s Layer 2 solution, uses Ethereum’s technology for its performance and lower fees. In the current market, where scalability and low costs are important, NEAR stands out. Compared to most platforms, it has better developer support and user accessibility, making it an attractive option. As the demand for efficient dApps continues to grow, NEAR’s approach could put it in the best position in the market. Pi Network: The Cryptocurrency You Can Mine on Your Phone Imagine earning digital assets on your mobile without any expensive hardware or draining the battery. That is what Pi Network, a mobile-first crypto-mining community started in 2019 by Stanford graduates promises. Pi allows you to mine its digital assets by checking in daily on the app. By adding trusted contacts, users can build a team of verified members, creating a global trust graph that secures the network without the need for massive computing power. Pi Network aims to make digital assets accessible to everyone. Unlike Bitcoin which needs energy for mining, Pi uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol due to its efficiency and eco-friendly nature. Users earn rewards for increasing their trust circle, daily check-ins and running full nodes. With a focus on decentralization and fair access, Pi could become one of the biggest projects in the crypto market. With a plan to move from enclosed mainnet to open network, Pi might become the best option in the market, especially for traders looking to enter the market without much investment in hardware. Conclusion While HBAR, XLM, NEAR, and PI are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its sports-meme ecosystem, aiming for 20,000% growth and becoming the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

This time the vulnerability was discovered in a widely used ‘elliptic library.’ What makes matters worse – its exploitation could lead to hackers taking control of users’ private keys and draining wallets. All through a simple fraudulent message signed by a user. Is this a critical issue? The first thing to consider is the fact that libraries like elliptic provide developers with ready-made code components. This means that instead of writing the code from scratch and checking it as they go, developers just borrow the elements they need. While it’s considered to be a safer practice, since the libraries are continuously used and tested, this also increases the risks if one vulnerability gets through. Elliptic library is used extensively across the JavaScript ecosystem. It powers cryptographic functions in many well-known blockchain projects, web applications and security systems. According to NPM statistics, the package containing the error is downloaded approximately 12–13 million times weekly, with over 3,000 projects directly listing it as a dependency. This broad usage implies that the vulnerability potentially affects a vast number of applications – especially cryptocurrency wallets, blockchain nodes and electronic signature systems – as well as any service relying on ECDSA signatures through elliptic, especially when handling externally provided input. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to fully compromise sensitive data without proper authorization. That’s why the issue received an extremely high severity rating – approximately nine out of 10 on the CVSS scale. It’s important to point out that exploiting this vulnerability requires a very specific sequence of actions and the victim must sign arbitrary data provided by the attacker. That means that some projects may remain safe, for example, if an application only signs predetermined internal messages. Still, many users don’t pay as much attention when signing messages via crypto wallets as they do when signing a transaction. Whenever a Web 3.0 site asks users to sign terms of service, users often neglect to read them. Similarly, users might quickly sign a message for an airdrop without fully understanding the implications. Technical details The problem comes from not handling errors properly during the creation of ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures. ECDSA is commonly used to confirm that messages, like blockchain transactions, are genuine. To create a signature, you need a secret key – only the owner knows it – and a unique random number called a ‘nonce.’ If the same nonce is used more than once for different messages, someone could figure out the secret key using math. Normally, attackers can’t figure out the private key from one or two signatures because each one uses a unique random number (nonce). But the elliptic library has a flaw – i f it gets an odd type of input (like a special string instead of the expected format), it could create two signatures with the same nonce for different messages. This mistake could reveal the private key, which should never happen in proper ECDSA use. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs two things. A valid message and its signature from the user – for instance, from any previous interactions The user to sign a second message explicitly created to exploit the vulnerability With these two signatures, the attacker can compute the user’s private key, gaining full access to funds and actions associated with it. Detailed information is available in the GitHub Security Advisory . Exploitation scenarios Attackers may exploit this vulnerability through various methods, including the following. Phishing attacks that direct users to fake websites and request message signatures Malicious DApps (decentralized applications) disguised as harmless services, such as signing terms of use or participating in airdrops Social engineering convincing users to sign seemingly harmless messages Compromising servers’ private keys that sign messages from users A particularly concerning aspect is users’ generally lax attitude toward signing messages compared to transactions. Crypto projects frequently ask users to sign terms of service or airdrop participation messages, potentially making exploitation easier. So, think about it – would you sign a message to claim free tokens? What if that signature could cost you your entire crypto balance? Recommendations Users must promptly update all applications and wallets that utilize the elliptic library for signatures to the latest secure version. Exercise caution when signing messages, particularly from unfamiliar or suspicious sources. Developers of wallets and applications should verify their elliptic library version. If any users could be affected by the vulnerable version, developers must inform them about the urgent need for updating. Gleb Zykov is the co-founder and CTO of HashEx Blockchain Security .

While many coins show potential, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making waves with its unique presale structure and deflationary token burn mechanism. Meanwhile, Near Protocol is making headlines with its latest blockchain advancements, and Bitcoin Cash is seeing renewed interest due to network upgrades. Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is progressing rapidly, with the current phase at Glacial Glade, offering investors a limited window to secure tokens at $0.000087. This article will cover the developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, Near Protocol, and Bitcoin Cash. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Model: Token Burns & Scarcity Boost A powerful force in the meme coin sector, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is setting itself apart with a robust token burn mechanism designed to enhance scarcity and drive value. The project permanently removes unsold tokens every week during the presale, ensuring a deflationary supply model. Furthermore, all remaining tokens after the presale will be burned, creating an environment that continuously increases the coin’s rarity. Operating on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo Coin, the best crypto to join in April 2025 , maintains full transparency in its burn transactions. This unique approach aligns perfectly with its presale journey, where demand continues to surge. With over $2 million raised and a launch price set at $0.008, early investors at the current Glacial Glade phase ($0.000087) stand to gain an astonishing 9,084.48% ROI by the time of listing. Glacial Glade Presale Phase – The Most Anticipated Crypto Sale? The meme coin presale of Arctic Pablo has now reached Glacial Glade, the 17th phase of its ambitious journey. As this unique location-based presale progresses, the entry price remains at an attractive $0.000087, offering immense potential before the launch price of $0.008. The presale structure eliminates traditional stages, instead allowing Arctic Pablo to “travel” across different locations, making each phase increasingly exclusive. With the price set to rise as new locations unlock, this might be the last opportunity to invest at such a low entry point. Once Glacial Glade ends, the cost per APC will increase again, and the ROI potential for new buyers will diminish. Investors keen on maximizing returns should act now before Arctic Pablo reaches its next destination. What Experts Are Saying About Arctic Pablo Coin’s Future Market experts are highly optimistic about the future of Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), with many predicting that it could reach $0.10 after its initial listing at $0.008. To put this into perspective, a $100 investment today would yield approximately 1,149,425 APC tokens. At the current listing price of $0.008, those tokens would be worth $9,195. However, if the price rises to $0.10, that same $100 investment could skyrocket to $114,942. With such significant potential returns, it’s no surprise that investors are eager to buy now before the price climbs even higher. Near Protocol’s Innovation: Revolutionizing Web3 Development Near Protocol continues to push boundaries in the blockchain space, recently announcing its groundbreaking Chain Signatures feature. This innovation aims to enhance cross-chain interoperability, allowing seamless transactions between Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Near’s ecosystem. The development positions Near as a leader in Web3 infrastructure, enabling developers to build more efficient decentralized applications (dApps). With growing institutional interest and a rising adoption rate, Near Protocol is solidifying its place in the crypto industry. Bitcoin Cash’s Surge: Major Upgrade Enhances Network Efficiency Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is gaining traction after its latest network upgrade focused on improving transaction efficiency and reducing fees. The upgrade enhances scalability and security, making BCH a more attractive option for peer-to-peer transactions. With increased adoption by merchants and a strengthening market position, Bitcoin Cash is proving to be a resilient contender in the digital payments space. Final Words With Arctic Pablo Coin ’s presale nearing a crucial turning point at Glacial Glade, investors have a limited window to lock in early-stage gains before the price climbs further. Meanwhile, Near Protocol’s advancements in Web3 technology and Bitcoin Cash’s enhanced efficiency are drawing attention. However, the most urgent opportunity remains with Arctic Pablo Coin, as its presale’s deflationary structure and high ROI potential make it the Best Crypto to Join in April 2025. Don’t miss out—secure APC tokens before the next price jump!

BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as one of those projects—gathering momentum with a growing user base, sharp buyer interest, and a rapidly evolving roadmap. With $211.5 million already raised and 19.1 billion BDAG tokens sold, BlockDAG’s presale is among the fastest-moving in recent memory. Early adopters have already gained a 2,380% return on their entry, and with 10 centralized exchange (CEX) listings coming soon, the level of anticipation is rising. As the token price increases with each batch, industry observers are starting to question just how far BDAG can go. Presale Demand Builds as Early Buyers Lock in Strong Returns BlockDAG’s presale momentum offers insight into growing market confidence. With over $211.5 million raised and 19.1 billion BDAG sold, the numbers speak for themselves. This isn’t just hype—it’s a sign that the project is being closely watched by both retail and institutional participants. For those who got in early, the reward has already been substantial. Initial buyers have seen up to 2,380% ROI, a figure that continues to drive urgency around remaining batches. Each stage of the presale brings a price increase, encouraging earlier entry and further accelerating demand. As more buyers enter, supply becomes tighter and the sense of opportunity becomes more immediate. The project’s forward momentum is evident, and its strong presale performance suggests BlockDAG is entering a new phase—where sustained interest could become long-term adoption. BDAG’s Current Batch Price Rises—Is This the Last Entry Point Below $0.03? With the presale now in Batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248—far above its starting point of $0.001. Each batch has sold out quickly, and the current rate of sales indicates that the final stages may arrive sooner than expected. For those looking to enter, this may be one of the last opportunities to buy BDAG at what is still considered a low price point. The projected return has drawn attention as well. If BDAG hits its target price of $1 after launch, current batch buyers could see a 3,932% return. That type of upside potential is rare—and it’s a key reason analysts continue to highlight BDAG’s market potential. With demand holding steady and 19.1 billion coins already sold, the remaining batches are likely to draw heavy interest. If BDAG continues on its current path, future access may come with a much higher entry price. What Exchange Listings Could Mean for BDAG’s Next Chapter BlockDAG is preparing for its move to the next level with 10 CEX listings lined up. For presale coins, listing on major exchanges often marks a turning point—bringing increased liquidity, broader exposure, and a new wave of buyer attention. But beyond the initial excitement, these listings represent something more lasting: easier access for global users and increased credibility in the eyes of the broader crypto market. When a project that’s already gained strong presale traction becomes available to a much larger audience, demand often spikes—and so does price activity. Add in the upcoming Mainnet launch, and BDAG has all the makings of a project entering its most critical phase. It’s not just about launch day gains—it’s about building a foundation that supports real, long-term growth in the crypto ecosystem. Summing Up! BlockDAG’s presale success has made it one of the most talked-about launches in crypto this year. With 19.1 billion BDAG sold and each batch bringing a new price hike, the window for lower entry is closing. Momentum is strong—and that momentum is being backed by meaningful metrics. With 10 centralized exchange listings approaching and a highly anticipated Mainnet debut on the way, BlockDAG is positioned to move beyond presale headlines into lasting market presence. As buzz builds and access expands, BDAG may soon prove to be not just a fast mover—but one of the defining crypto projects of the next cycle.

Analysts Say Price Could Moon After 25 Presale Stages,https://thecoinrise.com/why-buy-dragoin-early-at-0-0000292-analysts-say-price-could-moon-after-25-presale-stages/,"Picture getting into a rising meme coin before the crowd notices—and at its cheapest rate. Dragoin ($DDGN) has crafted that very setup. Its presale spans 25 themed stages inspired by legendary dragon fights. Each new phase brings fewer tokens and a higher price, making early access the key to potential future profits. The earlier you buy, the lower the price—and the better the chance to make more once Dragoin hits exchanges. As each phase closes, the token supply thins and prices increase. Right now, early buyers can grab Dragoin at a massive discount. Waiting too long, though, could mean paying a lot more for far fewer tokens. Dragoin isn’t just another token with a funny name. It delivers real benefits, including a Telegram-based game where players can train dragons, compete, and earn rewards. Early supporters get the dual advantage of cheap tokens and the chance to shape the growing community. Token Price Rises Stage by Stage Dragoin’s presale breaks the usual mold. It invites buyers into 25 unique stages, each one themed around a classic dragon showdown. Every stage offers a limited number of $DDGN at a fixed price. Once the tokens from one stage are gone, the next begins instantly—with a price hike. Buyers entering at Stage 1 secure the best deal. With every stage, token availability drops, and the cost rises fast. Early stages offer more tokens at attractive rates, urging users to act quickly. Later stages release fewer tokens, increasing their value but making them costlier. Plus, unsold tokens are burned after each stage, reducing the total supply and putting upward pressure on value right away. Scarce Supply Makes Early Moves Matter At the start of the Dragoin presale, it’s all about access: plenty of tokens, lowest possible price. But this window narrows fast. After each stage, available tokens vanish, leaving less on the market and pushing prices up. Those who buy early gain a clear edge—more tokens for less money. This setup builds urgency. By the halfway mark, prices will already be climbing sharply. Those who delay will end up with fewer tokens for more money—and lower profit potential. Early participants grab the most favorable pricing, filling their wallets before Dragoin hits public exchanges. Those who wait might miss the best returns or get priced out altogether. Meme Coin Status with Real-World Function Dragoin goes beyond the typical meme coin template. It introduces a Telegram-based play-to-earn experience where users hatch, train, and battle dragons for $DDGN rewards. This gives the coin true utility, offering more than just speculative value. The game is simple and fun, open to players of all experience levels. Early buyers don’t just score better prices—they can also be among the first to dive into the gameplay and earn real rewards. These early users will influence how the game and the broader Dragoin ecosystem develop, giving them a voice in shaping its direction. It’s a two-part win: low-cost tokens now and early entry into an expanding community. Clear and Fair Token Structure Dragoin’s tokenomics are built on simplicity and openness. Out of a total of 200 billion $DDGN, 50% goes to the presale. The rest is allocated for ecosystem development, liquidity, and team support. The focus is long-term success, not short-term hype or manipulation. DDGN is priced at just $0.0000292 and will hit the $0.002 at launch after its 25 stages. Fairness matters. After the presale, the Dragoin team plans to renounce contract ownership. This hands control to the community and reduces risks tied to central authority. All smart contracts tied to Dragoin are also independently audited, adding a layer of protection for buyers. Early participants can feel confident that while they’re getting in at the best prices, they’re also buying into a secure and professionally vetted system. Early Entry Delivers Maximum Value Getting in early on Dragoin’s presale is a strategic move. Early buyers secure more tokens for a lower price—putting them in a strong position for gains after launch. As each stage closes, leftover tokens are burned, supply tightens, and prices increase. Delays could mean missing this prime window or paying far more. Dragoin offers more than a crypto purchase—it invites users into an engaging, rewards-based community built around gaming. With a shrinking supply and token prices starting at rock-bottom, smart investors will recognize the value of moving quickly. The best token rates are available now. Those who hesitate might pay extra or miss out entirely. Don’t wait—lock in your early advantage by joining the Dragoin presale today.

This is a big shift and adds to the list of crypto areas the SEC is slowly letting go of, like memecoins and mining. Not Every Stablecoin is a Security NEW: The @SECGov Division of Corporation Finance has just put out guidance on stablecoins. The agency has minted a new term — ‘Covered Stablecoins’ which describe stablecoins that “maintain a stable value relative to the United States Dollar, on a one-for-one basis, can be… pic.twitter.com/g3HjCc7mHa — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 4, 2025 According to a post by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the SEC has introduced a new category called “Covered Stablecoins.” These digital coins are always equal in value to the U.S. dollar — one coin equals one dollar. To qualify, these coins must be backed by safe, easy-to-sell assets that match or exceed the amount of coins in circulation. This means they’re considered stable, safe, and easily redeemable for real dollars at any time. The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance made it clear that these kinds of stablecoins are not being treated as investments. Because of that, they do not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction — which is a big deal for projects trying to stay compliant while offering dollar-backed crypto. However, this doesn’t apply to all stablecoins. The SEC says this guidance doesn’t include algorithmic stablecoins (which use code to keep their value stable), stablecoins that offer yield or interest, or coins tied to other assets like gold or foreign currencies. These other types might still be considered securities or face other regulations. This new update is a positive step for regulated, dollar-backed stablecoins like USDC or PayPal’s PYUSD, giving them a bit more breathing room and clarity. But the rest of the stablecoin space still sits in a gray area. But No Interest for Users But there is something else that is very important to note: Even though stablecoin companies can make money (like through interest on their reserves), they’re not allowed to share that money with users. So, users won’t earn interest from holding these covered stablecoins. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong isn’t happy about that. He said he wants Congress to change the rules so users can earn interest without the coins being considered securities. Circle Applauds, Congress Pushes Ahead Circle President Heath Tarbert praised the SEC for its decision, saying that only stablecoins with real backing, like USDC, qualify. At the same time, Congress is working on stablecoin rules. Bills are moving through both the House and Senate with strong support from both parties. As political discussions grow, with Trump supporters pushing their own crypto plans, everyone’s attention is on the SEC’s upcoming crypto summit, where trading will be a major focus.",News|Crypto Regulations|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 04:23:24

While Ripple’s executives have confirmed the case is over, there’s been no official statement from the SEC, leaving many in the XRP community wondering what’s really going on. To add to the mystery, an unexpected filing popped up in the court case. A guy named Justin W. Keener sent an emergency request, claiming he has “decisive evidence” that could help Ripple and support freedom for Americans. But no one knows exactly what this evidence is. Keener says it has something to do with investment contracts he’s been collecting.

Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel said it’s basically like spam getting through the court’s system and will likely be thrown out quickly. He explained that Keener isn’t part of the case and doesn’t have the right to submit evidence. Some people asked if Judge Analisa Torres might change her decision about Ripple’s liability.

After briefly climbing past the $87,000 mark earlier this week, the cryptocurrency experienced a significant pullback, declining to $81,332 earlier today. As of the latest data, Bitcoin is trading at around $82,600, reflecting a weekly decrease of about 7.6%. This downward momentum indicates ongoing market uncertainty, influencing investor strategies and market sentiment. With frequent retracements and short-lived surges, the current pattern highlights persistent volatility in the cryptocurrency space. This instability has prompted some analysts to explore more profound insights into investor behavior to predict potential market directions. Related Reading: Bitcoin On High Alert: US Recession Odds Top 50% On Kalshi Analyzing Binance User Activity for BTC Market Signals CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn recently provided a perspective on Bitcoin market dynamics through an analysis of user activity on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Maartunn’s investigation into Binance user retention patterns offered some interesting insights into trading behavior that could influence Bitcoin’s market performance. According to the analyst’s findings, over half of returning Binance users make their second deposit within 16 days following their initial transaction. Nearly 10% of users perform their second deposit within just one day, indicating active trading behavior rather than passive investment strategies. Furthermore, approximately one-third of returning users reload their accounts by day seven, reinforcing the notion that Binance predominantly attracts traders engaging in frequent transactions. Over 50% of Returning Binance Users Make a Second Deposit Within 16 Days “Some interesting takeaways: 🔹 Nearly 10% return on Day 1, showing immediate trading interest. 🔹 By Day 7, one-third of users have already reloaded. 🔹 By Day 16, over 50% of returning users have made a… pic.twitter.com/OG6d6BKUdt — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 4, 2025 What Does This Mean for Bitcoin? This high frequency of early deposits by returning users highlights a pattern of short-term trading rather than long-term holding. Such active engagement on Binance can directly impact Bitcoin’s price volatility, as rapid buying and selling contribute significantly to market fluctuations. Increased trading activity shortly after initial deposits often implies speculative market behavior, potentially leading to quick price movements in both directions. Overall, the behavioral trends observed on Binance suggest that Bitcoin might continue to experience sharp volatility in the near term. The quick return rate of traders to deposit funds signals a market where trading volume spikes are frequent, influencing Bitcoin’s price stability.

Investors have lost hope for the Pi Coin price recovery amid expectations of another 60% fall to $0.1. Despite a few developments, the overall market sentiment for the altcoin has turned extremely bearish. Pi Network Has Been On A Freefall The Pi Network price has been respecting no support levels and has been facing strong selling pressure with daily trading volumes shooting to $500 million. This massive dumping comes as investors have been losing faith in the project amid delays in mainnet launch, KYC process, etc. As a result, several top crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have distanced themselves from Pi Coin listing on their platforms. On the other hand, PiDaoSwap has raised concerns over prolonged delays in receiving Know Your Business (KYB) approvals. As a temporary workaround, PiDaoSwap has opted to launch its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Binance Chain to maintain project momentum while awaiting regulatory clearance. Additionally, other developments like the Banxa integration are also not working in Pi Network’s favor at the moment. Four Reasons Pi Coin Price Could Drop to $0.1 Amid the very poor performance and 85% drop from its February high of $3.0, experts are now speculating that the Pi Coin price could drop to $0.1. The four main factors that can contribute to this are: Mass Sell-Off Risk: With a community exceeding 60 million users, concerns are mounting over what could happen once unverified holders complete KYC. If a significant portion decides to cash out, the resulting supply flood could overwhelm the market. Currently, Pi Network has 6.79 billion tokens in circulation, with a max supply of 100 billion—leaving ample room for dilution. Lack of Major Exchange Listings: Without listings on top-tier platforms like Binance or Coinbase, market confidence could falter. Pi may remain confined to mid-tier exchanges such as OKX and Gate.io, limiting liquidity and price stability. Macro Market Weakness: A broader crypto market downturn—especially if Bitcoin drops below the $70K level—could trigger widespread altcoin selloffs. As a highly speculative asset, Pi would likely be among the hardest hit. Stagnant Utility Growth: Projects like Zito Realty and PiFest have been cited as real-world applications, but if such initiatives fail to scale meaningfully, the ecosystem may lose momentum, driving Pi closer to penny-coin status. Our Pi Coin price prediction shows the altcoin will be trading under $0.40 level over the next month. Looking at the current free fall, the Pi core team needs to step up to arrest the further downside, and regain trust within the community.

He clarified that his country will not pursue retaliatory measures, claiming he is willing to work together with the US president. Milei even commented , “Argentina is going to move forward to readjust the regulations so that we meet the requirements of the reciprocal tariffs proposal developed.” Milei said he’s fulfilled 9 of 16 requirements of Trump’s new tariffs The United States has imposed a 10% tariff on Argentine goods entering the country. However, Milei has argued that he’s willing to compromise and introduce legislative reforms to meet the requirements of Trump’s new tariffs. According to Milei, they’ve already taken care of 9 out of 16 requirements. He’s even asked his country’s Foreign Ministry and Commerce Secretariat to cater to the remaining requirements. He also pledged to address all other outstanding issues with the United States promptly. He believes all the changes his country will make will bring it closer to securing a free trade agreement with the US, anticipating a time without tariffs or trade restrictions. A while back, he even said he would withdraw from the Mercosur regional trade bloc should the need arise. He remains convinced that for Argentina to be great again, it will need to partner with the United States, and he is clearly ready to do what it takes to ensure a peaceful relationship between the two nations. So far, the Argentine government is planning to harmonize tariffs on about 50 products. However, it said it would start with about 10 products. Milei has consistently sought the favor of President Trump, hoping to protect Argentine interests Milei had flown overnight to receive an award on Thursday at a right-wing gala at Mar-a-Lago. He had hoped to meet Trump, but, to his disappointment, the two did not meet. Milei has always publicly shown his adoration for Trump, praising him as a great leader, thus cultivating a somewhat smooth relationship with the American President. He’s even tried to mimic some of Trump’s actions. Sometime after Trump declared that he would pull the United States from the World Health Organization, Milei ordered his country’s withdrawal from the agency. Moreover, after Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, he argued that he would do so too. His efforts may not have gone to waste with some of his ministers believing their president gained Trump’s favor. For starters, Gerardo Werthein, Argentina’s new foreign minister, claimed that every time Trump meets Milei, he always says, “I like this guy.” Furthermore, in some of his public appearances, Trump has acknowledged the Argentine leader, commending him for reducing inflation and enhancing economic growth in his country. Some have suggested that Milei’s curried favor with the President is why Argentina only received 10% tariffs instead of the higher tariff rates applied to countries like China and India. In 2024, Argentina’s exports to the US surged by over 13% year on year, culminating in almost $6.5 billion total. The growth even resulted in the country’s first trade surplus with the U.S. in nearly two decades, with a positive trade balance of $232 million. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The price has jumped above the $2.11 mark and is now aiming to break higher levels. This rebound signals renewed bullish momentum, with traders watching closely to see if XRP can maintain this upward trend and target new resistance levels. The market’s positive sentiment is fueled by growing interest in XRP, especially in regions like South Korea, where it continues to dominate trading volumes. Has XRP Outpaced BTC And ETH? XRP is one of the top-traded cryptocurrencies in South Korea, especially on Upbit, the country’s leading exchange. According to Kaiko Research, XRP-KRW has held the top spot for trading volume 70 times this year, even outpacing Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in popularity. Unlike global markets where BTC and ETH dominate, South Korea’s crypto scene is more diverse, with altcoins like XRP, STX, DOGE, and SOL frequently topping trading charts. XRP’s strong demand reflects its active community and liquidity in the region. “Upbit, on the other hand, has had more than 40 different instruments grab the top spot on at least one day. XRP-KRW has the most days on top at 70, followed by BTC-KRW at 64. After that, it’s chaotic. Tokens like T (yes, just T), HIVE, PUNDIX, and STEEM have all spent at least a day at the top,” a research by Kaiko said. South Korea’s strict crypto regulations, requiring exchanges to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), have helped create a stable trading environment. Despite global attention often focusing on the U.S. or Europe, South Korea’s vibrant crypto market—especially XRP’s performance—shows just how dynamic and unique it truly is.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 05:35:41

Have you been keeping an eye on the latest projects? The next few months could be the turning point for some of these coins, with presales and developments making waves in the crypto world. For those looking to dive in, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin are creating excitement like never before. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin, and why Arctic Pablo is currently one to watch. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Meme Coin Phenomenon If you haven’t heard of Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), you might want to sit up and pay attention. APC’s presale is nothing short of electrifying, offering investors an opportunity to get in early at an unbeatable price of $0.000087. With a staggering 9084.48% ROI projected from the 17th phase, Glacial Glade, to the final listing price of $0.008, the potential for massive returns is hard to ignore. What’s driving this buzz? For one, the project’s token burn mechanism boosts scarcity and value by eliminating unsold tokens weekly during the presale. Plus, as tokens are burned, the deflationary environment increases the appeal for investors who want to get in early. Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale structure is also unique, with no stages – instead, the presale is divided by locations, marking a new chapter in its journey as it “travels” through different phases. As of now, APC has raised over $2 million, and there’s still time to join the early investors who stand to reap the rewards of this rapidly growing project. With the price increasing as the coin moves through new locations, including the current location of Glacial Glade, it’s an exciting time to invest at such an affordable price. Arctic Pablo Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity By investing early, you can potentially see a return of 9084.48% by the time the coin reaches its listing price of $0.008. The meme coin presale is divided by locations, so as Arctic Pablo progresses, the price will inevitably rise. Don’t miss the chance to secure your share of APC at this remarkable price before it’s too late. The token burn mechanism ensures that the coin’s scarcity increases over time, increasing its potential value. As a result, those who are lucky enough to enter at this stage will be positioned for incredible rewards when the presale concludes. Shiba Inu: The Resilient Meme Coin Continues to Shine Shiba Inu has been a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts for a while now, and it continues to show resilience in the face of market challenges. Recently, Shiba Inu made headlines with its ShibaSwap 2.0 launch, a major upgrade that enhances the functionality of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. With Shiba Inu NFTs gaining more traction and the community’s unwavering support, Shiba Inu has proven it’s not just a passing trend. The coin has maintained a loyal following and continues offering new opportunities for seasoned investors and newcomers alike. As Shiba Inu expands its ecosystem, it remains a crucial player in the meme coin market and a coin worth watching. Pepe Coin: A Rising Star in the Meme Coin Space Pepe Coin, another fan favorite, has gained attention for its unique branding and meme-based appeal. Pepe Coin’s market activity has recently been impressive, with new partnerships and integrations expanding its use cases. The coin is gaining popularity within meme communities, and the market buzz suggests Pepe Coin’s future could be brighter than ever. With its highly engaged community, Pepe Coin is positioning itself to become a strong contender in the meme coin race, even as other coins like Shiba Inu and Arctic Pablo continue to gain momentum. Epilogue: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge As we move deeper into April 2025, it’s clear that Arctic Pablo Coin is making a bold statement in the meme coin market. While Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin remain strong contenders, Arctic Pablo’s presale excitement, ROI potential, and deflationary token burn mechanism set it apart.

42931338,https://nulltx.com/?p=147757,1743832243,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Remittix Could 100x If OKX & Binance Listings Happen & Is Now The Time To Buy Cardano Or Solana While Prices Are Down?,https://nulltx.com/remittix-could-100x-if-okx-binance-listings-happen-is-now-the-time-to-buy-cardano-or-solana-while-prices-are-down/,"With the market entering a cooling phase, investors are weighing opportunities beyond just the big names. Cardano and Solana are both trading at discounted levels, sparking debate over whether this is the dip to buy. But the real buzz surrounds Remittix , a rising star in the PayFi space that has already raised over $14.3 million. If listings on OKX or Binance materialize, analysts say a 100x surge isn’t just hype—it’s a realistic scenario taking shape fast. Cardano Price Action Stays Flat as Investors Wait for Confirmation Cardano (ADA) is feeling the weight of market fatigue, shedding 11% this past week and sliding to around $0.64. While it’s been a sluggish stretch for Cardano blockchain, some analysts like Jonathan Carter aren’t throwing in the towel just yet. His recent forecast points to a potential dip below $0.60, but he sees this as a possible setup for a rebound, with ADA eventually making a push back toward the $1 mark in the coming months. The current support zone at $0.59 is where Carter believes things could turn. If buying activity picks up around that level, it could lay the groundwork for a strong recovery rally. Still, Cardano’s price action hasn’t done much to inspire confidence lately. It’s been mostly sideways, lacking serious momentum, and the Relative Strength Index hovering around 39 suggests it’s approaching oversold territory—but not quite there yet. As of April 4, ADA trades at $0.6457 , showing mild movement between $0.65006 and $0.65054. That tight range reflects investor caution. Sentiment is muted, and any decisive move upward will require more than just speculative optimism. The fundamentals need to come into play—and that’s where many investors are shifting focus toward newer, utility-rich tokens with clearer growth paths. Solana Faces Pressure But Fibonacci Support Could Trigger Reversal The Solana price has slid to $115.12 after an 11.62% daily drop. The sharp decline comes amid global market chaos following sweeping tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump . While the broader market felt the shock, Solana’s sell-off was particularly brutal, raising fresh concerns over whether SOL can maintain its footing or if further losses are on the horizon. Still, not everyone is throwing in the towel. Veteran crypto analyst Patel notes that Solana is now resting within the 0.382 Fibonacci support zone, sitting between $100 and $115—a range that’s historically sparked strong accumulation and upside reversals. If SOL can hold this line, a gradual bounce-back could be in play. But if it dips lower, the next major support zone hovers between $50 and $72, near the 0.618 Fib level that triggered a legendary 2,100% rally in 2020. The key question now is whether buyers will step in at this zone or wait for a deeper dip. Solana’s fundamentals—scalability, DeFi traction, and consistent developer activity—haven’t disappeared. But the market wants confirmation, not speculation. Timing the entry is crucial, and some investors are exploring alternative plays with clearer upside triggers. Businesses Embrace Remittix For Instant Fiat Settlement Remittix (RTX) has caught the attention of serious investors by doing what most tokens only talk about—solving a real problem with real utility. Aimed squarely at the $190 trillion cross-border payments market, Remittix offers a fast and low-cost alternative to sluggish wire transfers and high remittance fees. With over $14.3 million raised and more than 526 million tokens sold at a presale price of just $0.0734, momentum is building fast—and it’s not hype driving it, it’s function. Imagine a remote worker in Kenya or a digital agency in Brazil receiving USDT from a European client. With Remittix, those funds can be converted to local currency and land in their bank account within hours—no bloated fees, no middlemen, no drama. That kind of utility is rare in crypto, and it’s why this PayFi project is being called one of the most grounded opportunities of 2025. The platform’s crypto-to-fiat API gives businesses the ability to accept digital payments without exposing themselves to price swings. Merchants get stability, users get speed, and the blockchain records it all with transparent accountability. As exchanges like OKX and Binance reportedly consider listings, market watchers are already tossing around 100x predictions. That might sound steep, but for a platform solving a $190T pain point, it’s not outrageous. Especially when many top altcoins are still banking on vague roadmaps and long-delayed rollouts. Analysts Say Remittix Could Outperform Cardano And Solana with 50x Gains Cardano blockchain and Solana remain valuable long-term plays, and investors are right to eye their recent dips as entry points. ADA continues to refine its architecture, while SOL brings blazing speed to DeFi and NFTs. But unlike them, Remittix is building where user demand is immediate. It’s not about what the project might deliver—Remittix is already delivering. With listings expected soon and demand surging across freelancing, global business, and remittance markets, Remittix offers a uniquely tangible use case. For those positioning for the next breakout story, this isn’t a moment to sit on the sidelines. Remittix isn’t just another token—it’s a bridge between crypto and the cash people actually use.

The coin that saw massive hype is now turning out to be a nightmare for investors and traders who rooted for the success of the project. The main issue lies in the long delays in approving “Know Your Business” (KYB) applications, which are required for projects to officially build on the Pi mainnet. This has left many developers feeling stuck, and some are now turning to other blockchains to keep things moving. PiDaoSwap Shifts to Binance Chain One of the latest examples is PiDaoSwap, a decentralized exchange that had been waiting over two weeks for KYB approval from the PiCoreTeam (PCT). Tired of waiting, the team decided to launch their NFT project on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) instead. They described the delay as “agonizing” and said they didn’t want to sit idle while waiting for approval. PiDaoSwap clarified that they still want to build on the Pi Network, but until they get the green light from the PCT, they’re choosing to move forward on BSC as a temporary step. This decision also highlights a bigger concern as Binance continues to ignore Pi Network in its “Vote to List” campaigns, instead focusing on more active BSC projects. We officially submitted the KYB application 15 working days ago, but the KYB review process has been excessively prolonged. Currently, the foundational framework of PiDaoSwap has been fully developed. We have chosen to launch community NFTs on BSC as an interim solution rather… https://t.co/EaqtjdpiQ9 — PiDaoSwap (@PidaoSwap_) April 4, 2025 Community Voices Speak Out Moreover, the PiCoreTeam is catching serious heat from well-known figures in the community. Dr Altcoin, a prominent community member, didn’t hold back. He said PiDaoSwap’s experience isn’t unique; other centralized exchanges (CEXs) are also waiting on KYB approvals. According to him, these delays are preventing Pi Coin from being listed on major platforms like Bybit. He also accused the PCT of not being transparent about important token mechanics like locking and burning, which could be further holding back listings and partnerships. Pi Coin Price Dips, But Interest Remains As a result of all this uncertainty, Pi Coin’s price has crashed another 20% in just 24 hours and slipped to $0.44, now out of the top 30 crypto rankings. Investor confidence has collapsed, with many fearing a further 60% drop to $0.10. Despite a few positive developments, the overall sentiment around Pi Coin has turned sharply bearish, and hopes for a recovery are fading fast. Hopes of seeing the token reach $1 have taken a hit. Still, the community believes things could turn around if the PiCoreTeam can speed up approvals and land a big exchange listing. Interestingly, despite the backlash, the PCT is still moving ahead with its domain auction, reporting over 200,000 bids, a sign that enthusiasm for Pi is still alive, even if tensions are rising.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 05:51:13

Analysts consider cautious optimism, as both Cardano and Ethereum have room for explosive growth. Some analysts also suggest that potential future sanctions on former President Trump may restart crypto mania, driving Ethereum’s price higher. In the background, newer altcoins like Remittix (RTX) predict even greater gains. Here, we examine Cardano’s role in these predictions and how Remittix is different. Cardano News: The Next Big Upswing? Current Cardano news suggests renewed bullishness, but skeptics point to the possibility of a fall below $0.40. Cardano’s methodical approach earns praise for its security, but impatient traders often look for faster ROI. If macro forces remain volatile, a short-term drop may happen. At $0.6457—a 3.11% increase— ADA’s market cap stands at $29.05 billion, and its daily volume remains at $839.97 million, declining 29.31%. However, Cardano news also points to ADA’s broader potential. True believers celebrate each network milestone, looking forward to real-world dApps and more DeFi adoption. If these expansions catch on, ADA can bounce back from any short-term correction. In the meantime, analysts note that some ADA holders diversify with tokens like Remittix, hedging volatile markets for a possible chance at massive profit. Ethereum Price Set to Skyrocket on Trump Sanctions? Speculation that Ethereum could blow up is fueled partly by leaked Trump sanctions that were said to spur crypto adoption. Some view the policy landscape as a low-probability catalyst for altcoin rallies, with Ethereum poised to gain as the leading DeFi platform. Should authorities introduce fresh restrictions on fiat channels, risk capital may surge into digital assets. Ethereum is currently trading at approximately $1,801.49, up by 1.61%. Although this is a modest gain, its daily trading volume is at $16.84 billion, a huge drop of 30.97%. Despite this, Ethereum maintains a robust market cap of $216.98 billion, underlining its status as a major player in the decentralized finance industry. Such a scenario would mean Ethereum price may leapfrog ahead, overtaking slower currencies. But critics argue the Trump factor is overblown. They cite that Ethereum’s real driver is a successful developer ecosystem and upcoming protocol enhancements. However, any move that brings institutional players into crypto may, in theory, drive Ethereum price ahead of typical cyclical increases. Remittix: A Leap Beyond Ordinary Hype Remittix gained popularity with its focus on real cross-border payments in the real world. Priced at $0.0734, it raised over $14.3 million and over 526 million tokens. Unlike coins based on speculation or mere brand names, Remittix seeks to capture a $190 trillion remittance market burdened by multi-day wires and excessive fees. Consider a Southeast Asian freelancer who is employed by European clients. Instead of wading through tiresome banking protocols, he or she can utilize Remittix to realize near-instant currency exchange into the local fiat. This streamlined process melds the speed of blockchain functionality with the rails of local banks, registering all transfers on a public record for tracking. Early adopters have in mind that significant partnerships would drive Remittix’s presale price exponentially higher. Security adds credibility to the project. Rigorously audited contracts and liquidity locks reduce the risk of scams, welcome to investors who are sick of hype-coins. Merchants benefit as well with Remittix’s pay API, in which they can accept crypto but, as a default, settle in fiat. This mass market appeal is in complete contrast to meme coins or non-incremental networks. If Remittix could penetrate significant remittance corridors, user growth can potentially explode, giving substantial returns to early investors. Where ADA, Ethereum, and Remittix Intersect Seasoned traders weigh Cardano news and Ethereum’s rumored boom against Remittix’s everyday usability. ADA’s gradual growth might still prove worthwhile, especially if DeFi is a hit on its chain. Ethereum, meanwhile, could take off if global political shifts funnel more capital into crypto. But Remittix speaks to real-time applications that tap an immense potential audience. A balanced strategy would be a mix: hold ADA for stable, academically oriented growth, hold some Ethereum for DeFi dominance, and trade Remittix for short-term utility. The strategy has the best of both worlds, hedging macro volatility and taking advantage of innovations that mainstream users actually need. Regardless of whether cardano news falls under $0.40, or Ethereum takes the Trump policy tide, one thing is sure: utility tokens such as those pegged on use cases like Remittix have the potential to capture attention when top coins top out. By solving a world pain point in finance, Remittix is the best choice for those looking for more than usual altcoin hype. Learn more about Remittix’s borderless revolution.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing Annual Conference , emphasized that the Fed is not yet ready to change interest rates. He noted that they are waiting for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to the policy stance and that it’s too soon to determine the right course of action for monetary policy. Tariffs To Cause More Inflation The fed noted that the economic impact of higher tariffs remains hard to predict due to ongoing uncertainties. Higher tariffs will likely cause bigger-than-expected inflation and slower growth. While the full impact is uncertain, the key is keeping long-term inflation expectations stable. Their goal is to ensure that any one-time price increases don’t evolve into persistent inflation. Trump’s tariffs hit harder than expected, sparking a global stock sell-off. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a global recession if the tariffs stay. Bitcoin (BTC) slipped back below $83,000, staying flat over the past 24 hours, despite hopes for a more dovish stance from Powell.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart was surprised by Bitcoin’s strength, noting that it stayed above $80,000 despite a sell-off in risk assets and a drop in gold.

Ramaswamy gave his sentiments on the crypto in a reply to a late Friday X post by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. “This is becoming increasingly clear,” wrote the Ohio Gubernatorial seat aspirant. Although an investor could argue that Gold currently has better returns, as the crypto market is also in a bloodbath, BTC holds more value in a long-term comparison. If an investor had allocated $1,000 equally into Bitcoin, gold, and the S&P 500 five years ago, the latter would have doubled the initial investment to approximately $2,040. Gold could have yielded a slightly below 90% return, but Bitcoin has gone up 11 times in value since, bringing the same $1,000 investment to $12,210. Stock market plunges down, crypto investments go up A two-day post-Liberation Day market rout erased $6.6 trillion in shareholder value from the US stock market, according to Dow Jones data. Thursday and Friday marked the worst two-day loss in US equity market history, with $3.25 trillion of that value vanishing on Friday alone. At the same time, as reported by multiple sources, the crypto market absorbed $5.4 billion in new capital. The selloff came as a result of new tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, which rattled investors and raised fears of economic isolation. The S&P 500 fell by nearly 6% over the two-day stretch, surpassing early-term losses seen under former President George W. Bush, whose first office days had a low-point market performance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 11.9% since Inauguration Day, while the S&P 500 has declined 15.4% in the same period, according to data through Friday’s close. The Russell 2000 index, focused on small-cap stocks, experienced its most turbulent start to a new administration on record, falling more than 25% from its November high and entering bear market territory. The Nasdaq Composite, which closed at an all-time high of 20,056.25 in February, has since plunged more than 22%. On the flip side, the BTC/SPX ratio, an indicator comparing Bitcoin’s performance to the S&P 500, recently completed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, typically a bullish signal in asset comparison charts. BTCUSD/SPX chart. Source: TradingView The pattern, seen in the chart above, has broken above a neckline at the 15 mark. After a standard pullback to retest the breakout point, the ratio rebounded and could lead to a renewed upward momentum for Bitcoin. It also corresponds with Bitcoin’s 2021 peak relative to the S&P 500, a zone that traders now view as the crypto’s support level. Adding to the bullish signal, the monthly chart displayed a green candle following the rebound, an indication that Bitcoin bulls have successfully defended this critical zone. Analysts noted that the demand range between 13 and 15 on the BTC/SPX ratio, marked by multiple support lines, has become a battleground now tilting in Bitcoin’s favor. “ It seems like it has found a support/range, now that it has somewhat serious hodlers backing and interest like the Institutions and U.S govt SBR ,” One market analyst on X commented . They backed the claim for two more reasons: Bitcoin faces no earnings compression and cannot be targeted by international tariffs. According to market data trackers, Bitcoin is consolidating well above $80,000, as tech stocks like Apple and Meta both shed over 2% of their valuations on Friday’s market close. Overall, BTC had the least negative price movement compared to all the Magnificent 7 tech stocks, closely followed by Microsoft. At the time of this publication, it was trading around $83,000, seeking a route past $85,000 that, if breached, could push the coin towards its 30-day high of values above $90,000.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $72 billion, recorded a 24 percent growth in its 24-hour average traded volume to about $5 billion on Saturday during the early European trading session. As the dust for the U.S. reciprocal tariffs gradually settles, it is clear that Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider altcoin market are a better hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. Moreover, Wall Street experts – led by J.P Morgan research that lowered U.S. growth estimate in 2025 by 1.6 percent – forecast a possible global recession. Solana Network Growth The Solana network has experienced explosive growth in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) led by stablecoins in the recent past. With a total value locked of about $6.6 billion at the time of this writing, the Solana network has added over $8 billion in stablecoins minted since the re-election of U.S. President Donald Trump, late last year.

Since then, the digital asset has experienced diminished bullish activity and steady downward pressure, reflected by its latest price of approximately $82,000, marking a marginal weekly drop of about 0.6%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Sentiment Worsens as Bull Score Index Drops to 10 Market Implications of Volume Ratio Trends Amid these market conditions, Crypto Dan, an analyst contributing to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, has provided insights highlighting a notable market trend. According to Dan, Bitcoin’s trading volume over six to twelve months acts as an indicator of the amount of capital entering the cryptocurrency market during specific market cycles. As highlighted in the chart shared, the metric typically undergoes two distinct phases of decline: the first signals the conclusion of the early bull cycle phase, while the second, lower drop, traditionally marks the peak and subsequent end of the cycle. The volume ratio trend outlined by Crypto Dan provides insights into investor behavior and market sentiment. Essentially, as this ratio decreases for the second time, historical patterns suggest that investor interest and speculative activity may begin to taper, potentially signaling the culmination of the ongoing bull run. Investors typically interpret such movements cautiously, as similar past events often preceded significant corrections in the market Technical Analysts View on Bitcoin Technical analysts add additional perspectives on Bitcoin’s current status. Analyst RektCapital recently pointed out significant developments in Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI)—a momentum oscillator measuring the speed and magnitude of recent price movements to assess overbought or oversold conditions. RektCapital highlighted that the Monthly RSI level of 60 previously represented resistance levels during Bitcoin’s dominance peaks in August 2019 and December 2020. #BTC Dominance The Monthly RSI 60 (green) represented the peak for Bitcoin Dominance in August 2019 & December 2020 In previous cycles, Monthly RSI 60 was the ceiling In this cycle, Monthly RSI 60 is the floor$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/G47KSa33ZR — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 4, 2025 Notably, this cycle differs, with the Monthly RSI 60 acting as a support floor rather than resistance. This change could suggest ongoing strength and potential resilience in Bitcoin’s price.

The black line, representing XRP’s network activity, shows a steep upward trajectory beginning in early 2025, culminating in a 490% increase. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network activity, represented by an orange line, remains relatively flat, reflecting only a 10% increase. The rapid growth in XRP’s active addresses suggests increased engagement with the XRPL. This may be attributed to various factors, including rising adoption, new use cases, or speculation in anticipation of potential market developments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reactions and Market Sentiment Derek John, an X user who commented on the post, referenced the data while acknowledging the increasing interest in XRP. He stated , “We have followed the breadcrumb trail, I got here late but better than how it will be for most. Congrats to the people that bought under 50 cents for sure tho, respect.” His comment implies that early investors in XRP, particularly those who accumulated when prices were below $0.50, are now in a strong position. The sentiment surrounding XRP has been notably positive among its supporters, with many pointing to increased on-chain activity as an indicator of long-term adoption. While the broader cryptocurrency market remains volatile, some analysts consider rising network activity a potential precursor to increased asset value. Implications of XRP’s Rising Activity The significant increase in active addresses on XRPL could suggest growing institutional or retail interest in the asset. The XRPL has been widely recognized for its efficiency in cross-border payments and decentralized finance applications. Its recent uptick in network engagement may signal expanding use cases or strategic partnerships that are yet to be fully realized. Despite maintaining its position as the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin has not exhibited the same level of network growth as XRP in this timeframe. The contrast in activity changes raises questions about the evolving utility of different blockchain networks.

This bounce suggests the market might be starting to recover from the recent downturn. If the buying pressure continues, the market could soon see a relief rally. According to analyst Egrag Crypto, XRP is currently forming an Ascending Broadening Wedge pattern, suggesting two possible price targets: a decline to $0.65 or a rise to $17. For a bullish breakout, XRP must first close above $3.50. If it reaches the $5 level but fails to sustain above it, this could signal a higher probability of the pattern playing out.

However, investors still remains hopeful of $90K BTC breakout from here. Experts Have Mixed Opinion on BTC Bitcoin appears to be showing signs of decoupling from traditional financial markets, according to prominent Bitcoin contributor and Blockstream CEO Adam Back. In a recent post on X, Back suggested that the long-observed correlation between Bitcoin and traditional equities may have been artificially maintained. He speculated that market makers could be using Bitcoin’s liquidity conditions—particularly the shortage of fiat liquidity—to create an automatic correlation during U.S. market hours. However, Jeff Dorman, CIO of Arca institutional investment said: “Everyone is talking about BTC strength in the face of a 2-day, 10%+ stock sell-off, even as gold falls. But this has nothing to do with stocks Bitcoin is NOT, & never has been, a market hedge. It is a gov’t/bank hedge. This selloff is due to a loss of trust in global gov’t”. Where’s BTC Heading Next?

The ADA price is holding steady near a key support level of $0.635, keeping it in a make-or-break zone. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.657 and has recorded a modest 0.50% uptick over the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume jumped by 10%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Cardano (ADA) Price Action and Upcoming Levels With its ongoing consolidation between $0.635 and $0.682, ADA’s price remains near the key support level of $0.635, where it has held for the past week. According to expert technical analysis, the price is expected to remain in this narrow range until it breaks out or breaks down from the consolidation. Source: Trading View Based on historical patterns, if the ADA price breaches the upper boundary of the zone and closes a daily candle above $0.69, it could soar by 20% to reach the $0.85 mark in the future. On the other hand, if ADA breaches the lower boundary of the zone, its price could crash, potentially dropping by 25% to 28% and reaching its key support at $0.45. This price analysis of ADA shows that the current consolidation is playing a key role in determining ADA’s upcoming levels.

With concerns over trade wars escalating, the total crypto market capitalisation had fallen nearly 7% to $2.75 trillion by late Asian trading hours on Friday. In line with this, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index slipped into extreme fear territory at 28, down sharply from 44 the previous week. Trader hesitation was also evident across the altcoin market, with low trading volumes and only single-digit gains among the top 99 tokens. Why was Bitcoin down this week? Several macroeconomic catalysts kept Bitcoin muted Early in the week, sentiment took a hit as traders reacted to mounting geopolitical tension. US President Donald Trump announced a fresh round of 25% tariffs on imported cars, stoking fears of a renewed trade war. The economic backdrop further shook investor confidence. The latest PCE report showed inflation rising faster than expected, while March data from the Conference Board revealed that US consumer confidence had slumped to its lowest level in 12 years. This one-two punch of inflation and weakening sentiment pushed traders to de-risk, dragging down spot demand and futures activity. By midweek, those fears had only grown. The market was jittery ahead of the April 2 tariff rollout, which many feared would act as a bearish trigger for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Although intended to protect US manufacturing, the proposed measures risked inflaming trade tensions. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell another 3.5% after the open on tariff news, with analysts dubbing the move the start of a new “World War 3” of trade wars. Even stronger-than-expected US jobs data failed to offset the gloom, as investors remained focused on the deteriorating macro environment. Still, market bets on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut continued to climb, with expectations inching higher despite the mixed signals. When writing, the CME Fed watch tool showed chances of a May rate cut at 41.3%. Will Bitcoin crash again? The current scenario around Bitcoin remains largely bearish. Market analyst Sergei Gorev, head of risk at bitcoin and crypto platform YouHodler, warned that a break below March’s low of $77,186 could open the door to what one described as a “crisis scenario” heading into 2025. The outlook for equities and crypto alike has darkened in the wake of escalating trade tensions, with sentiment weakening across the board. Yet, Bitcoin has continued to trade within a relatively tight range between $80,000 and $90,000. According to XBTO’s Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, this range could act as a trigger zone, with any decisive breakout potentially fuelling a larger move in either direction. “With attention turning to how these reciprocal tariffs will be enforced in the coming weeks, investors should closely monitor key macroeconomic indicators and prudently manage position sizes, particularly by restricting leverage,” Rodriguez added. Nevertheless, some remained optimistic and suggested that the benchmark cryptocurrency may have bottomed and an upward rally may be looming. One such signal came from market analyst Cas Abbé, who pointed to a potential falling wedge pattern forming on Bitcoin’s daily chart. He noted that BTC didn’t print a new low even as traditional markets suffered their worst session in five years, which could suggest relative strength. Abbé added that Bitcoin often bottoms before the broader market, speculating that the $76,500 level may have marked the cycle low. For further upside confirmation, he advised watching for a breakout and reclaim above the $86,500 mark. Crypto commentator Lana Queen chimed in with a similar sentiment, noting that Bitcoin’s outperforming traditional markets was “bullish.” See below.

Source: Rekt Capital Another technical setup was highlighted by fellow trader Merlijin The Trader. In an April 4 X post, he pointed out that Bitcoin had just completed what he called the “perfect AMD setup,” a bullish pattern that follows a cycle of accumulation, manipulation, and finally distribution. According to Merlijin, Bitcoin appears to have already passed through the manipulation phase and is now entering distribution. If the pattern plays out, it could signal the beginning of a major upward continuation, with the next leg targeting price levels above $100,000. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering above $83,000, down 1.3% over the past 7 days. Altcoin markets cool off Most high-cap altcoins gave up the gains accrued over the previous week. However, the total market capitalisation dipped only slightly, holding near the $1.1 trillion mark seen last week. The Altcoin Season Index dropped by four points from the previous week, firmly confirming “Bitcoin Season.” The top gainers were as follows: EOS EOS (EOS) rallied 40% over the past week to $0.8161 as of press time, while its market cap rebounded to over $1.27 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap Its price gains came with an increase in its trading volume from $200 million to nearly $1 billion yesterday before settling at $489 million. The EOS rally builds on its recent rebrand to Vaulta as it shifts gears toward building a blockchain-powered banking system. The EOS team also introduced four main “pillars” of Vaulta’s Web3 banking setup this week, which include wealth management, consumer payments, portfolio investment, and insurance. These will be backed by partners like CEFFU, SPIRIT Blockchain, and Blockchain Insurance Inc., each bringing real-world use cases to the Vaulta network. Pendle Over the last 7 days, Pendle (PENDLE) rose 14.5%, exchanging hands at $3.07 when writing. Source: CoinMarketCap Its market cap was seated at $495.72 million, while its daily trading volume was still hovering over $129 million after falling from its weekly peak of nearly $190 million. Pendle gains this week were accompanied by a sharp rise in open interest on Binance. The bullish bets from investors were largely driven by Binance whales who have recently begun accumulating PENDLE following its recent listing on Coinbase and expansion to Berachain. The project has also announced plans to expand to Sonic. These developments have pushed Pendle to exhibit some of the highest positive funding rates among DeFi-related tokens. Positive funding means that traders holding long positions are paying those with short positions, which typically reflects a bullish market sentiment. Zcash Zcash (ZEC) was up 12% over the past 7 days, priced at $40.49 at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap Its market cap was standing at over $643.3 million, with a daily trading volume of $73.58 million. Zcash saw most of its recent gains after breaking above the descending trendline that started forming after its December highs, with the altcoin moving past the $35 resistance level and ending the downtrend. Zcash’s price also got a boost after Brave Wallet added support for shielded transactions in a recent desktop update, letting users buy, send, and receive the privacy-focused crypto right in the browser. The feature will be expanded to Android and iOS soon.

Speculators have already started talking of an “XRP 2.0” scenario in which the token can relaunch itself once legal clarity is achieved. TRON (TRX), on the other hand, is fighting to restore confidence after reaching the heights of approximately $0.245, with pundits arguing if further downward movement is likely. Against this backdrop, Remittix—a relatively new DeFi entrant—has created a stir by shattering presale records. Below, we break down the latest on XRP, TRON, and Remittix’s meteoric ascent. XRP: Legal Wrangles and a Futures Boost April 3 saw XRP hold a 1.96% gain, recovering from a 5.42% decline on the previous day. Hope arrived in the shape of an unsolicited filing from Justin W. Keener, in which he asserted possession of “game-changing” information in Ripple’s SEC litigation. Caution, nevertheless, is not in short supply, with Keener boasting a record of unregistered penny stock activity and no apparent credible connection to Ripple’s lawyers. Chart 1, Analyzed by Alokkp0608, published on April 4th, 2025 The actual turning point is if the SEC is going to do anything about recent news. Traders were hoping for guidance after an April 3 closed-door SEC meeting, but nothing was announced. In the meantime, Coinbase Derivatives is listing XRP futures on April 21, which may bring additional liquidity to the token. Most see this as a move towards “XRP 2.0,” with the implication of a future where robust derivatives markets are the source of both liquidity and stability. Still, the near-term destiny of the coin hangs on whether or not any new announcements shift the suit in Ripple’s favor. If the SEC appeals previous rulings or forever holds its silence, doubt might squeeze buying pressure. Conservative holders now eye $2.50 as an absolute floor and chartists indicate $2.84 for another resistance test. TRON: Rebound or Further Downside? TRON (TRX) is still torn between bull and bear possibilities. A falling channel terminated at $0.20 in February, which initiated a bounce that reached $0.245—the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. That point has relentlessly rejected TRX’s attempts at recovery, with a strong resistance above. TRX Price Chart Analysis Technical indicators are mixed. The RSI has broken a hidden bullish divergence, and a support trendline has been rising since the February low. However, the price has yet to break convincingly above the 0.618 Fib zone, and some analysts are cautious that a final Y wave down will develop if bullish momentum is not imminent. TRX’s mid-term trajectory may be beholden to the general market sentiment, especially if there is unfavorable news about platform development or ecosystem expansion. Presently, TRX holders await further definitive signals to see if the token can retrace to higher grounds or falls back to its recent lows at about $0.20. Remittix: The Surging Altcoin Breaking Records As XRP grapples with legal turns and TRX probes key Fibonacci levels, Remittix has taken the limelight by taking over the DeFi narrative. It’s a novel cross-border payment network that enables users to exchange more than 40 cryptocurrencies for fiat and transfer money to bank accounts worldwide, minus the typical hidden fees. This real-world use case is appealing to investors tired of sluggish bank wires and complicated bridging services. Having sold over 526 million tokens and raised $14.3 million, Remittix’s presale soared in a flight exceeding expectations. Early holders, who had bought at just $0.0734, witnessed over 1000% gains, even when the larger crypto markets appeared uncertain. Analysts peg momentum to continue through March, with a potential 200% rally in the near term. Why the hype? Remittix solves a real pain point by combining domestic payment rails with blockchain efficiency, reducing the time for transactions to hours or minutes from days. Merchants can access the Remittix pay API, accepting crypto from consumers but settling in fiat. The platform also has a strong security layer—public ledgers that record each transaction, reducing fraud risks. These attributes have placed Remittix on the radar screens of industry observers, who attribute its simplicity and ease of use. Who Stands Poised for 2025 Glory? XRP’s modest gain and mention of “XRP 2.0” highlight the token’s potential should Ripple win its case against the SEC. Most are hopeful derivatives listings on major exchanges will be the foundation for long-term stability. Meanwhile, TRX clings to the hope its bullish divergences are followed by long-term upside, but skepticism lingers. In hindsight from the mid-2025 vantage point, crypto success follows actual utility, community trust, and tireless development. XRP might surge once more if the legal overhang is removed. TRX might still confirm a bull breakout. But Remittix, by solving a $190 trillion cross-border remittance puzzle, might offer the more direct path to mainstream adoption—and the sort of consistent growth that truly defines the next big thing in crypto.

In a new post, Tapiero tells his 127,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may outperform equities as US President Donald Trump’s announced tariffs have ignited a massive stock sell-off. “‘Moment of realization’ for BTC. Tariffs crushing analog markets and fears rampant with VIX (Volatility Index) at 40. Authorities and co. sitting by watching NDX (Nasdaq-100 Index) in free fall. Rates will adjust lower but it is a process. Chart below is BTC/SPX. About to explode up.” Source: Dan Tapiero/X Tapiero suggests that Bitcoin’s performance may be decoupling from traditional finance, which is reeling from Trump’s tariffs. “Tariffs represent battle ongoing in the old analog world. In an attempt to solve old problems: excess govt spending, FX (foreign exchange) manipulation, weak growth, geopolitics, etc. So much manipulation and interference. Can it be fixed? Bitcoin stands outside this world. Free of legacy burdens.” Lastly, he says that Trump’s massive increase in US tariffs may slow economic growth and create market uncertainty. However, he says that gold and Bitcoin may work as a hedge against recessionary pressures. “Unfortunately, this chart means lower growth in the US and uncertainty to remain high for now. Interest rates are definitely coming down a lot now. Gold and Bitcoin as havens.” Source: Dan Tapiero/X Bitcoin is trading for $83,805 at time of writing, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

VET emphasized that for RLUSD adoption to increase, users must engage more with the XRPL. The statement highlighted the importance of both retail and institutional users in driving the ecosystem forward by utilizing the ledger’s capabilities and providing feedback to builders. VET’s post underlined a fundamental aspect of blockchain ecosystems: growth is driven by usage. The validator pointed out that relying on others to increase adoption while remaining inactive is not sustainable. Instead, users should communicate their needs to developers, support new applications, and continuously engage with the network. Honestly folks, if we want more $RLUSD on the XRP Ledger then we have to use the XRPL more. Tell builders what you want, let them build it, use it – repeat. Ecosystems need retail and institutional to bootstrap. Can't expect others to use the XRPL if you don’t use it yourself. — Vet (@Vet_X0) April 2, 2025 Addressing Smart Contract Deployment on XRPL In response to VET’s remarks, an X user, DOQ, inquired about the best approach for developing smart contracts related to the XRPL. The user asked whether developers should wait for the XRPL to implement native smart contract functionality or proceed with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain. VET acknowledged the complexity of the situation, noting that deciding where to allocate development resources is difficult given the evolving nature of the XRPL. The validator stated that if compliance requirements allow a given use case to operate within the XRPL while handling automated logic off-chain in a centralized manner, then utilizing the XRPL directly would be a viable option. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, VET also pointed out that there are no guarantees when full smart contract functionality will be integrated natively into the ledger. Due to this uncertainty, using the EVM sidechain remains a legitimate alternative for those looking to build applications in the near term. Implications for the XRPL Ecosystem VET’s comments reflect broader discussions within the XRPL community about network adoption and developer engagement. The remarks reinforce that an ecosystem thrives when participants actively use its infrastructure rather than wait for external factors to drive adoption. Furthermore, the conversation regarding smart contract deployment highlights the strategic decisions that developers must make when working within the XRPL environment.

Trading activity picked up, with total volume rising 10.35% to reach $98.18 billion. Despite the recovery, the Fear & Greed Index dropped to 27, placing the market in the “Fear” zone. Fed Chair Powell Flags Economic Concerns In a policy statement, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell addressed the economic impact of tariffs proposed by Donald Trump. Powell warned that these tariffs could lead to increased inflation and unemployment, along with slowing overall economic growth. He emphasized that it’s still “too soon” to consider altering U.S. monetary policy. This hints that interest rate cuts are not on the horizon just yet, as the Fed maintains its stance to steer inflation back to its 2% target. The current benchmark interest rate remains between 4.25% and 4.50%. Bitcoin Grips $83k, Altcoins Show Mixed Signals Bitcoin continues to exhibit strength, hovering above the $83,000 mark and contributing to a market dominance of over 60%.

Automation | Opinion,https://crypto.news/the-secret-to-a-high-performing-portfolio-automation/,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. People engage in “risky” situations almost daily. For some, a risk could be only giving yourself two hours at the airport instead of the instructed three hours before departure time. For others, risk could be associated with a physical threat like skydiving. You might also like: Overlooked crypto trends that could define 2025 | Opinion While these examples highlight personal risks, financial risks operate on a completely separate scale, impacting entire markets and economies. Risk has been closely associated with the crypto market as volatility remains one of its most defining characteristics. Crypto’s volatility means that while its surges can be dramatic, the downturns are often even steeper. Take, for example, this Bitcoin ( BTC ) price chart, which outlines its intense peaks and dips in just 24 hours. A single remark or action by an influential person can trigger an instantaneous response in the current digital landscape, which can eventually affect the entire market. Since Trump’s re-election in November, while many markets have been sensitive to his actions and statements, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in particular, have faced increased volatility. A post on X or his policy stance has been enough to spark a sharp rise or fall in prices. The power of such moments was evident last week when Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price fell significantly following a comment from Eric Trump , son of the US President. He told his followers on X that it was an excellent time to add Ethereum to their portfolios, a remark that caused the cryptocurrency’s value to drop nearly instantly. Some say that the tweet was fueled by his ties to World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto venture inspired by Trump that holds Ethereum assets. The market’s overall skepticism and often volatile influences have made it difficult for investors to maneuver, particularly for those new to the game. New traders are typically filled with excitement during a bull run, only to see the price drop, and then face the panic of potential and often immediate losses. Historically, traders depended on their intuition and previous patterns to forecast price shifts. However, traders now have access to tools that use algorithms to understand market conditions and trends, allowing them to execute data-driven decisions. This shift has been seen in traditional finance, where “ robo-advisors ” have surfaced as automated services that use analytics and algorithms to provide personalized wealth management advice. As a result, manual portfolio oversight is no longer an absolute necessity, and in crypto, bots can now execute trades on behalf of users. While investors set specific parameters, the algorithm acts accordingly, even in the absence of the user, ensuring that no trade is missed. Several automated trading platforms exist, each providing tools to streamline the trading process. Intellectia.ai, for example, uses AI to analyze market data and make predictions, optimizing trading strategies based on market conditions. It can summarize large amounts of data according to market trends, financial reports, and news articles and turn those into actionable insights. While it’s a powerful tool, its advanced features could appear overwhelming for beginners, especially for those who are not as familiar with AI-trading strategies. 3Commas is another trading platform that uses always-on automated bots to execute trades based on pre-determined strategies, facilitating more favorable outcomes for investors. It provides a variety of trading bots, from DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) to GRID trading bots, all of which can be altered for newcomers and experienced traders. However, compared to other platforms, 3Commas is suited for more professional traders with prior knowledge of the market, offering advanced features designed for those interested in crypto. While oversight is helpful in many situations, allowing algorithms and machine learning technologies to take the lead in trading has become a promising advantage for investors. By reducing human error and emotion-driven decisions, automated trading allows for more consistent and positive outcomes, making it a valuable and indispensable tool in the risky world of crypto.

With millions of tokens at stake, the investors are eyeing this permissionless interoperability protocol TGE plus airdrop, especially as the crypto market’s downtrend continues. Hyperlane Airdrop Listing Details & Tokenomics The Hyperlane airdrop is one of the biggest crypto airdrops for April and is all set for the token launch on April 22, just two weeks from today. The team has allocated 57% of its total supply (1 billion tokens) for the community user, 25% with a 12-month lock period for the core team, 10.9% with a similar 12-month lock for investors, 7.1% for the foundation treasury, and much more. This HYPER token distribution could affect its price significantly. Interestingly, out of the community allocation, 7.5% of the total HYPER supply is allocated to the airdrop, whose registration is live. Interested investors can participate in this event from April 3 to April 14, 2025 (3:59 AM UTC), and the claims will be made between April 20 and May 6, 2025 (3:59 AM UTC). Hyperlane Airdrop Eligibility Criteria & Process According to the official HYPER airdrop announcement, users who are in the top 37% of fee-spending users and are the most active users of the platform are eligible for HYPER tokens. In addition, the developers who have deployed contracts and applications with at least $5.00 USD notional in fees using apps are eligible. Although the HYPER airdrop is available globally, there are restrictions on regions like Cuba, Iraq, Russia, North Korea, and many other countries, but it is available in America. The eligibility checking process is as follows: Head to Eligibility checker claim.hyperlane.foundation Click on “Enter Address” and put EVM or SVM wallet inputs Eligibility outcome will appear on screen If eligible, investors must hit “Save Registration” or “Register Now” to lock in their upcoming claims. What Will be HYPER Token Price at Launch? The HYPER token price is unknown as the TGE and the Hyperlane airdrop is days away. Based on previous token launches and the tokenomics detail, the crypto community anticipates a price between $0.50 to $2 while considering the fully diluted valuation and circulating supply. However, this is just an anticipation and may differ depending on various parameters like top crypto exchange listing, airdrop claims, investors’ demand, and much more. Now, the eyes are on the TGE and airdrop for millions of token distributions.

The guidance introduces the term “covered stablecoins,” defining a specific category deemed not to be securities under federal law. Defining ‘Covered Stablecoins’ & Legal Implications According to the SEC staff guidance, “covered stablecoins” meet three criteria: they maintain a one-to-one value with the U.S. dollar, are redeemable for USD on demand at par, and are backed by low-risk, highly liquid assets. Crucially, the guidance determines that these specific stablecoins do not qualify as securities.

While no one knows who Nakamoto truly is, the date is taken from his old P2P Foundation profile and has become a symbolic day in crypto history. Despite several people claiming to be Satoshi, no one knows if he is still alive or dead. Satoshi Nakoto the infamous creator of Bitcoin. Not much is known about him.. But he listed his birthday as April 5th on his P2P foundation profile It is the only personal information we have about him Tomorrow makes it his 50th birthday… pic.twitter.com/mQvbo2Dx5C — Yugi (@yugicrypt_oh) April 4, 2025 Interestingly, April 5 wasn’t chosen randomly. It’s the same date the U.S. government banned private gold ownership back in 1933 an act that many believe inspired Bitcoin’s design as a decentralized alternative to state-controlled money. And in a quirky twist, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks an inversion of the number 6102 from that 1933 order. Despite Bitcoin’s massive success, Nakamoto’s fortune, believed to be around 1.096 million BTC, has never been touched. That stash is now worth over $91 billion, and it’s just been sitting there since 2010. Occasionally, people still send small amounts of BTC to those addresses, either as a tribute or to cloud the trail, but there’s been no movement from the original owner. A Fortune Untouched and a Mystery Unsolved Over the years, many have tried to uncover who Nakamoto really is. In 2024, a UK court dismissed claims by Australian Craig Wright, calling his case “deliberately false.” A few months later, an HBO documentary raised eyebrows by suggesting Canadian developer Peter Todd—who quickly denied it. Some even tossed Jack Dorsey’s name into the mix, though there’s no real evidence behind that. Bitcoin’s journey began with a powerful message buried in its very first block: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” a newspaper headline from the 2009 financial crisis. That message set the tone for what Bitcoin stood for: financial freedom and independence from traditional banking systems. Today, Bitcoin stands tall with a $1.6 trillion market cap and a rock-solid network still running on Nakamoto’s original framework. While the person behind it remains a mystery, the technology he (or they) left behind continues to shape the future of finance.

This mixed forecast comes as Bitcoin and most altcoins teeter from macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the ongoing trade war between China and the US. Wedge Pattern Places XRP Price At a Crossroads According to analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, XRP price had formed an ascending broadening wedge pattern. However, the direction of the wedge breakout remains uncertain. In his analysis, EGRAG noted that for a solid bullish breakout from this wedge pattern, XRP needed to close above the $3.50 price level. Doing so would kickstart the surge towards the $5 range, where it will likely face rejection. If Ripple price eyes gains and makes a decisive close above $5, it could spark a rally to double digits within weeks. Per the analysis, this altcoin will post a 700%l surge to 417. However, despite this bullish thesis, headwinds still lie ahead. Analyst EGRAG noted there was only a 30% chance for this breakout to occur. Meanwhile, there is a 70% chance that XRP might make a bearish breakout from this pattern, which will fuel a 70% crash to $0.65. XRP Price Chart This mixed XRP price prediction shows that XRP is at a crossroads with no clear direction for a breakout. However, if there is a bullish catalyst like a spot ETF filing by BlackRock and the US Treasury mentioning XRP as part of a digital asset stockpile, it will support the upward momentum to $17. XRP Short Liquidations Hit 2-Week High XRP price trades at $2.13 with a slight 3.3% gain in 24 hours. These gains have triggered a surge in short liquidations. Data from Coinglass shows that in the last 24 hours, XRP short liquidations have surged to $7.3M, which is the highest in more than two weeks. When short sellers are liquidated, their positions are closed by buying the asset. Therefore, these short liquidations are behind the gains in Ripple price and could accelerate the uptrend, which will push the altcoin higher. These liquidations have also caused a shift in funding rates. In the last two days, XRP funding rates have been deeply negative, indicating that traders opened short positions after the price approached the critical support level of $2. However, after the recent gains, these traders are now going long on XRP, showing optimism towards a price recovery. XRP Funding Rate To sum up, XRP price seems to be at a pivotal point. A spike in buying pressure and Ripple whale activity might push Ripple toward $17. However, failure to hold levels above $2 might cause a crash to $0.65.

42935117,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=705862,1743839342,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42935117.jpeg,"Microsoft embraces ‘off-frontier’ AI strategy, prioritizes practicality",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/microsoft-embraces-off-frontier-ai-strategy/,"Microsoft is shifting its artificial intelligence (AI) approach to focus on practical applications rather than pursuing the most advanced models. Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, outlined this ‘off-frontier’ strategy during the company’s 50th-anniversary event. This approach emphasizes developing AI solutions that are slightly behind the cutting edge but more cost-effective and tailored to specific uses. ​ Unlike firms competing to create the world’s most powerful models, Microsoft intentionally pulls back from the cutting edge. Instead of immediately building the most advanced systems, it takes three to six months to do anything after the latest models are released. “After you’ve let the frontier go first for the first three months , th e first six months, it’s cheaper to give a specific answer then,” Suleyman said in an interview. “We call that off-frontier.” T his strategy enables the tech firm to sidestep the vast expense of being a first mover while at the same time establishing powerful, useful AI systems. It also allows the company to concentrate on creating artificial intelligence tools that the world needs rather than trying to ride the hype wave. Suleyman said they had never attempted to win any leaderboard; instead, they focused on solving real people’s real problems. Microsoft is adding personalized features to empower Copilot Copilot (Microsoft’s AI assistant for Windows, Office, and other apps) is one of the best examples of the practical AI vision the firm tries to achieve. At its anniversary event, Microsoft revealed that it will soon be adding “memory” to Copilot, allowing it to retain key details about users as time goes on. That means the assistant can provide more intelligent, customized assistance — like remembering the names of people you frequently email, how you usually format documents in Word, or which tasks you do most often in Excel. Those features were originally introduced in OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which Microsoft deeply embeds. Now, comparable powers are coming to the firm’s products. OpenAI released the “o1” model in September — a system focused on reasoning that takes longer to create considered answers. Then, a few weeks later, Microsoft announced “Think Deeper,” a similar capability for Copilot. Instead of racing to b e fi rst, the company is repackaging ideas that work in ways that match its ecosystem. Copilot’s improvements prove the tech company is interested in usability rather than Flash . This is about tools that work and feel like magic — AI that helps people do their work better. Microsoft balances partnerships with in-house development Microsoft’s close relationship with OpenAI has spurred its speedy advancement in AI in the past two years. The firm has poured over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2023, embedded its models in Bing, Word, Teams, and Windows, and powered everything from generative tools like image generation to AI-powered search. But that relationship is beginning to change. Microsoft targeted OpenAI in July 2024, just a few months after it targeted Google. In January 2025, OpenAI struck a significant deal with Oracle to help power the $500 billion Stargate AI project — a deal that raised the possibility that the startup was seeking partners beyond Microsoft’s Azure cloud. Still, Suleyman said the partnership with OpenAI remained strong, stating that they had been deeply partnered with the company until at least 2030 and that OpenAI had enjoyed an enormously successful relationship with Microsoft. It’s worth noting that the company is not resting on its laurels; it is now leaning into developing its proprietary AI capabilities, too. Suleyman added that it is mission-critical for the company to develop its own long-term AI. He said that Microsoft had “thousands” of Nvidia GPUs, critical hardware for AI training, and is also developing a separate class of smaller and open-source models that can run on machines without cloud access. These models avoid being expensive and resource-intensive, and they can be a nice option for businesses that don’t need to own and operate AI at a massive scale but do want powerful tools.

Pepe faces declines but eyes potential rebound Pepe (PEPE) has been volatile, trading between $0.000006054 and $0.000008528. This past week, the price dropped by 15.64%, marking a significant short-term decline. Over the month, the change is slight at -0.32%, indicating some stability. However, the six-month decrease of 23.42% highlights a prolonged downtrend. Despite recent drops, PEPE has potential to recover. The RSI is at 43.52 — below neutral but not oversold — suggesting room for upward movement if buying pressure increases. The nearest support level is $0.000005176. A fall to this point could mean a decline of about 14-20%. The nearest resistance is at $0.000010126. Climbing to this level could yield gains of 20-60% from current prices. Given the data, PEPE may continue to face pressure. Yet, proximity to support could prompt a bounce. Breaking above resistance could lead to significant gains. Market sentiment and buying activity will be key factors. Conclusion Though coins like PEPE have soared in the past, their short-term potential seems limited.

Amid its current performance, an analyst has warned investors the cryptocurrency risks dropping to 17-month lows if it fails to reclaim key resistance levels. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Ready For A Breakout? Analysts Eye 20% Rally If This Level Is Reclaimed Ethereum Could See Drop To $1,550 Ethereum has been trading below a key support zone for the past two days, hovering between $1,750-$1,840 after failing to recover the $1,900 mark on Wednesday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization lost its 15-month range in early March, dropping below $2,100 for the first time since December 2023. Since losing this level, ETH has seen its worst performance in seven years, recording a negative monthly close for the fourth consecutive month. Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that this performance validated Ethereum’s double top formation that developed within its $2,196-$3,904 Macro Range. After breaking down from this range, Ethereum trades within a historical liquidity pool, between the $1,640-$1,930 range, and “effectively has positioned itself for a bearish retest” of the range’s top with its monthly close within this area, which could turn this level into a new resistance. As the analyst explains, turning this level into resistance has historically seen ETH’s price drop to the current range’s lower zone. “In other words, turning the red level into resistance (red circle) has historically preceded a drop into the support at the bottom of the light blue historical demand area (orange circle),” he detailed. As such, Ethereum must reclaim the top of this demand area “to challenge a move to the old Macro Range Low of $2,196.” Meanwhile, a rejection from the $1,930 mark, which it has been unable to reclaim over the past week, would see ETH risk a 15% drop to the $1,550 area. Is A 20% Rally Coming? Rekt Capital also pointed out that since June 2023, ETH’s Dominance has dropped from 20% to 8%, historically a reverse area for the cryptocurrency. When Ethereum’s Dominance touched the $7.5%-8.25% range, it reversed “to become more market-dominant,” which could signal a reversal for the King of Altcoins. Several analysts consider that the key levels to watch are the $1,750 support and the $2,100 resistance, as a break above or below these levels will determine ETH’s next significant move. Related Reading: Solana Slammed By Whale Dump—Can It Recover Or Is More Pain Ahead? Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems suggested that Ethereum could eye a 20% rally based on a Power of 3 setup in ETH’s lower timeframe chart. The analyst highlighted that the cryptocurrency had an accumulation phase after dropping below the $2,150 support, hovering within the $1,840 and $2,100 levels since March 10. After dipping below the $1,840 mark, the cryptocurrency has been in the manipulation phase, the chart shows, which could trigger a push to the $2,150 resistance if ETH breaks out and starts the distribution phase. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $1,808, a 2.2% surge in the daily timeframe.

On Friday, China retaliated against the U.S. tariffs, thus further weakening major stock indexes led by the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq composite. However, Bitcoin price teased $84k, as its 24-hour average trading volume surged over 22 percent to hover at about $42 billion on Saturday, during the mid-London session. Recession Looms The ongoing global trade war is expected to significantly disrupt international supply chains. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it expects the U.S. economy to fall into a recession this year. “We now expect real GDP to contract under the weight of the tariffs, and for the full year we now look for real GDP growth of -0.3 percent, down from 1.3 percent previously,” Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan noted. Bitcoin Whales on the Hunt Bitcoin has been identified as a hedge against ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. Moreover, gold was exempted from the ongoing tariffs, and BTC is widely regarded as the modern digital gold. Consequently, long-term whale investors have accelerated their BTC accumulation in anticipation of a bullish breakout ahead. According to on-chain data analysis by Intotheblock, the volume of large transactions has increased by $136 billion in the past seven days. Meanwhile, the overall supply of BTC on centralized exchanges has declined from 2.22 million on March 18 to around 2.19 million on April 5. What Next?

Crypto researcher SMQKE highlighted the report’s findings, emphasizing that XRPL and Stellar offer significant advantages over traditional payment systems. The report details how RippleNet facilitates the use of XRP for liquidity in cross-border payments, while Stellar leverages blockchain technology to enhance accessibility and affordability in international transactions. “Ripplenet enables financial institutions to use XRP FOR LIQUIDITY to handle cross border payments” + “Stellar leverages blockchain to make international payments more accessible and affordable” XRP + XLM —> several advantages over traditional payment systems Documented. https://t.co/DYEV0ruEEG pic.twitter.com/0BxYvQAipA — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 3, 2025 XRP Ledger’s Role in Cross-Border Payments The report underscores how RippleNet efficiently enables financial institutions to process business-to-business (B2B) cross-border payments by utilizing XRP for liquidity. This allows institutions to settle transactions faster and at lower costs compared to traditional banking infrastructure. The report also references competitors in this sector, such as Visa’s B2B Connect and IBM’s Blockchain World Wire, which offer alternative blockchain-based solutions for cross-border payments. Furthermore, the report highlights the broader capabilities of XRPL in enhancing financial security and reducing fraud risk. By leveraging a decentralized and immutable ledger system, XRPL supports near-instant, transparent settlements, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs. This positions XRP as a key liquidity solution for financial institutions seeking to optimize payment efficiency. Stellar’s Impact on Financial Inclusion Stellar is recognized in the report for its role in making international payments more accessible and affordable, particularly in underserved regions. By utilizing blockchain technology, Stellar facilitates low-cost cross-border remittances, which benefit migrant workers and individuals in developing economies. The report specifically notes Stellar’s collaboration with IBM on World Wire, a project designed to enable seamless cross-border transfers. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The ability of Stellar’s network to process transactions quickly and at minimal cost makes it an appealing option for financial institutions and payment service providers. By reducing reliance on traditional banking infrastructure, Stellar broadens financial inclusion, providing an alternative for individuals who may not have access to conventional banking services. Blockchain’s Advantages Over Traditional Payment Systems The Advanced Payments and Fintech Report states that blockchain technology offers multiple benefits over traditional payment systems, particularly in terms of security, efficiency, and cost reduction. By removing intermediaries, blockchain streamlines financial transactions, lowering fees and reducing settlement times. Additionally, blockchain’s transparency enhances security, mitigating fraud risks and ensuring accountability in financial transactions. The report also acknowledges that financial institutions and regulatory bodies are adapting to blockchain’s growing influence. While blockchain provides significant advantages, compliance with regulatory frameworks such as the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation and financial crime prevention measures remains a key consideration. The findings of the March 2025 Advanced Payments and Fintech Report reinforce the growing role of XRPL and Stellar in modernizing global payments. RippleNet’s use of XRP for liquidity and Stellar’s blockchain-based remittance solutions offer compelling alternatives to traditional banking infrastructure. With documented advantages in speed, cost-efficiency, and financial accessibility, XRPL and Stellar continue to drive innovation in cross-border payments.

And if early 2025 signals are to be believed, that pattern may already be unfolding. This time, while meme coin staples like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin dominate headlines, many sharp-eyed traders are turning to a different candidate— Dragoin ($DDGN) . Quietly gaining ground, this Game of Thrones-inspired token is entering the spotlight with not just narrative hype, but utility, structure, and early-stage potential few others can match. With deflationary tokenomics, engaging play-to-earn mechanics, and a presale price designed for maximum upside, Dragoin is shaping up to be more than just a meme coin—it’s emerging as a well-positioned crypto with kingmaker potential. Meme Coins Heating Up—And Dragoin Is Leading the Fresh Wave Bitcoin is holding its ground above $83,000, and altcoin activity is surging. In past cycles, this combination has signaled the start of explosive meme coin momentum. Traders often rotate profits from majors like BTC and ETH into higher-risk, high-reward tokens—creating rapid pumps across meme markets. This month alone, the meme coin market cap jumped 16%, with DOGE and SHIB making notable moves. But while legacy tokens still draw attention, Dragoin stands out with a new storyline, community traction, and genuine use case—something that’s been missing in many meme coins that rely solely on social media waves. Crypto influencers, Telegram analysts, and meme veterans are already buzzing. Dragoin is gaining momentum early—and momentum matters. Dragoin’s Play-to-Earn Game Is a Real Differentiator Where most meme coins run on speculation and meme energy alone, Dragoin introduces something tangible: a fully integrated play-to-earn (P2E) gaming model that rewards engagement with real token rewards. Centered around a Telegram-based dragon training and battle game, players hatch, evolve, and compete with dragons, earning $DDGN tokens as they interact. This is more than novelty—it’s utility built into the token economy. Rather than hoping for external hype to generate demand, Dragoin is generating demand organically. The more users play, the more they earn, and the more demand grows—fueling activity without the need for constant social buzz. It’s a mechanism that could bring gamers, traders, and first-time meme coin buyers together inside one ecosystem—something previous cycles lacked. Deflationary Supply + Presale Advantage = 100x Potential Dragoin’s tokenomics have been carefully engineered to favor scarcity and reward early entry. The token has a hard-capped supply of 200 billion, with half available during a 25-stage presale. Each stage comes with a slightly higher price point—ensuring those who get in early enjoy the most favorable returns. At the time of writing, Dragoin’s presale is in Stage 1, priced at just $0.0000292. Its confirmed launch price? $0.002. That’s a potential 100x upside for initial backers. But Dragoin adds another clever layer: any unsold tokens from each presale stage are automatically burned, reducing supply and increasing scarcity as the token progresses toward launch. Tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu succeeded without this kind of built-in scarcity. Dragoin, by comparison, is starting with deflationary mechanics hard-coded into its foundation. Community Ownership Through Full Decentralization One of the strongest features of Dragoin is its commitment to transparency. After the presale, ownership of the smart contract will be renounced, making it fully decentralized—an important safeguard in a market often rocked by developer-controlled exploits. That means no dev wallets, no insider control, and no backdoor minting risks—a rarity in the meme coin world. Combined with upcoming staking rewards, airdrop campaigns, and a detailed roadmap that includes CEX listings and influencer marketing, Dragoin is setting up for long-term credibility and mainstream attention. In a time when trust is often the missing piece, Dragoin is aiming to restore it. Could Dragoin Be 2025’s Meme Coin Giant? Dragoin checks all the boxes that made past meme coins explode—but adds the structure that many of those tokens lacked. It offers: A live, playable P2E mini-game Deflationary tokenomics with presale burns Transparent, decentralized launch An early-stage price of just $0.0000292 A realistic path to 100x gains As meme coins rise again in 2025, the market will ask: “Which project combines hype with real value?” Dragoin looks ready to answer that call. With early interest accelerating, an engaged community forming, and a unique game already in development, Dragoin isn’t just riding a trend—it’s building its own.

42935578,https://coinpedia.org/?p=440735,1743840446,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,JPMorgan Predicts 2025 US Recession Amid Trump’s Aggressive Tariff Hikes,https://coinpedia.org/news/us-recession-looms-by-2025-trumps-tariffs-wreak-havoc-on-markets-crypto-bitcoins-resilience-tested/,"The post JPMorgan Predicts 2025 US Recession Amid Trump’s Aggressive Tariff Hikes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The US economy is entering rough territory, with JPMorgan warning of a possible recession by the end of 2025. The main reason? President Trump’s aggressive new reciprocal tariffs. These tariffs are aimed at fixing long-standing trade imbalances by targeting countries with large trade surpluses against the US, including India. More tariff hikes are reportedly on the way. JPMorgan has predicted that the US economy will contract in 2025. Michael Feroli, the bank’s chief US economist, warned that the pressure from these new tariffs could push the country into recession, with unemployment expected to rise to 5.3%. Fed Chair Cautions on Growth and Inflation Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also expressed concern, saying the tariffs could impact the economy more than expected. He warned that larger tariffs would likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth. JPMorgan expects inflation to reach 4.4% by the end of the year, up from 2.8% in February. The bank believes the Fed will start cutting interest rates in June and continue gradually until January 2026, eventually lowering rates to 2.75%-3%. However, Powell has suggested a cautious approach, saying there’s no need to rush despite the growing pressure. Global Ripple Effects: Trade War Escalates The global economy is now feeling the pressure of America’s trade war. China has already responded by imposing a 34% tax on US goods, and other countries are either threatening to retaliate or preparing for tough negotiations. China’s move shook the markets, triggering a major sell-off. Trump’s trade war has already wiped out more than $5 trillion from the US stock market. And JPMorgan isn’t alone in sounding the alarm—Barclays expects a downturn next year, Citi sees just 0.1% growth, and UBS has cut its forecast to 0.4%. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney criticized the US for backing away from its global leadership role. “The world economy is different today than it was yesterday,” he said while announcing new countermeasures from Canada. Crypto Market Takes a Hit The crypto market dropped sharply after Trump’s tariff announcement, as investors looked for safer options like gold. Bitcoin briefly hit $88,500 before falling below key support levels. Major altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin dropped as much as 4.5%. US crypto-related stocks also fell due to the sweeping tariff policy. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) are growing in the crypto market. Since February 1, Bitcoin has dropped 10%, and Ethereum is down 20%, as worries about the impact of tariffs on blockchain growth and adoption continue. XRP, however, has held up well, gaining 2% after the SEC officially dropped its case against Ripple. This has brought some relief to investors and ended years of regulatory uncertainty. Will Bitcoin Stand the Test? The market is divided on how Bitcoin will perform in this environment. Some see it as “digital gold,” a hedge against inflation and instability. If the Fed cuts interest rates, Bitcoin could benefit from increased liquidity. With more financial risk in the system, many investors may turn to Bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin’s Future Hinges On Key Factors Bitcoin’s next moves depend largely on how the Fed handles inflation and the broader economy. While rate cuts could boost Bitcoin by adding liquidity, worsening economic data could pull prices down. Analyst Alex Krüger says Bitcoin’s future will be shaped by monetary policy decisions and signs of a recession, with market volatility expected as traders respond to new data. During a recession, consumer spending and liquidity tend to fall—two key drivers for crypto growth. While Bitcoin has strong support from ETF approvals and institutional interest, it still needs fresh capital to move higher. What Investors Should Look At To understand where Bitcoin is headed next, investors are watching two main factors: the stock market and global liquidity. If stocks continue to fall, Bitcoin is likely to follow. But if equity markets stabilize, Bitcoin might get the push it needs to climb back toward its all-time highs. Investors are also tracking liquidity indicators like the Fed’s balance sheet (WALCL) and the M2 money velocity (M2V), which show how much money is moving through the economy. With the Fed’s current Quantitative Tightening (QT), it’s harder for riskier assets like Bitcoin to grow. However, if liquidity increases, the crypto market could see a strong rally. Saylor and Kiyosaki Issue Warnings Michael Saylor recently tweeted that tariffs are just the start. He said inflation is only one of several risks—capital is also exposed to taxes, regulations, and unexpected events. He pointed to Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of these hidden threats. Today’s market reaction to tariffs is a reminder: inflation is just the tip of the iceberg. Capital faces dilution from taxes, regulation, competition, obsolescence, and unforeseen events. Bitcoin offers resilience in a world full of hidden risks. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 4, 2025 Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , went even further. He claimed the biggest stock market crash has already hit, pushing the US into a recession—or even a depression. He advised Baby Boomers to move away from traditional investments and into real assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, which he says will hold their value as the dollar weakens. He urged his followers to protect their wealth before the situation worsens. I SHOULD NOT SAY THIS….because it’s not COOL….to say….I TOLD YOU SO…. Yet I did tell you so. In my book RICH DAD’s PROPHECY I warned the biggest stock market crash in history was going to wipe out the financial security of millions of investors….especially my generation….… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 4, 2025 The lines between policy, panic, and price charts are blurring fast – can Bitcoin save investors?",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 08:07:26

The Bitcoin price rose significantly and tried hard to surpass the pivotal resistance at $83,800, but the bears quickly dragged the levels lower, compelling the price to remain consolidated below the range. In the meantime, top altcoins like Cardano, Solana, Chainlink, & XRP are gearing up, suggesting a major price action is on the horizon. The spot markets suggest the markets continue to possess a massive bearish trajectory and as a result, the lower targets remain activated. The funding rates or the fees exchanged between the long and short positions in the perpetual future contracts, may soon rise. The rates across the exchanges are expected to coil up specifically for ADA, SOL, LINK, and XRP. Source: X The rise in the volatility among these altcoins suggests a major breakout is fast approaching, and hence, investors are currently optimistic. This also suggests that the markets are hinting before the surge, which could keep the market participants highly vigilant. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price is facing equal bullish and bearish pressures with a drop in the volume in the spot market. On the other hand, the prices of XRP, SOL, and ADA have been recovering significantly, hinting towards a potential altseason soon. On the other hand, the USDT dominance within the market has reached a crucial support. A drop from the range may confirm the beginning of an altseason as the short-term price action of stablecoins hints towards a drop in the stablecoin dominance, which suggests the capital may flow into the risk assets. In the times when the memecoin has been attracting significant liquidity, the upcoming season could be a little diverse with the rise in the fundamentally strong tokens.

Pi Network Pi Network’s cryptocurrency, PI, has faced significant price declines recently. In the past week, the price dropped by 19.58%, and over the past month, it plummeted by 61.48%. However, over six months, the decrease was a milder 9.10%. The current price fluctuates between $0.69 and $0.93, reflecting ongoing volatility. Technical indicators hint at a potential rebound. The Relative Strength Index is at 28.88, suggesting that PI is oversold. The stochastic value is low at 4.49, reinforcing this view. The 10-day Simple Moving Average stands at $0.65, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.71. The MACD level is negative at -0.0126, but a shift could signal upward momentum. If PI breaks above the nearest resistance level of $1.08, it could aim for the second resistance at $1.32, representing a potential gain of over 40%. Conversely, falling below the support level of $0.60 might lead to a drop toward the second support at $0.36. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge PI’s next moves. Cardano Cardano (ADA) has seen significant fluctuations recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 11.11%, and in the last month, it dropped by 24.30%. However, looking back six months, ADA’s price surged by 84.09%. Currently, it trades within the $0.62 to $0.74 range. Technical indicators reflect this volatility. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are close, at $0.65 and $0.67, respectively, suggesting a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index stands at 38.65, indicating that ADA is approaching oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator is at 19.82, also hinting at potential overselling. The MACD level is -0.0075, which shows bearish momentum. Considering these factors, ADA may face immediate resistance at $0.82, with a second resistance level at $0.94. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.57, and further support is at $0.45. If the price rebounds, breaking above $0.82 could imply a potential increase of around 20%. Conversely, a drop below $0.57 could lead to a decrease of approximately 8%. Traders should watch these key levels for signs of ADA’s next move. Conclusion PI and ADA are strong, but XYZVerse uniquely blends sports and memes, targets 20,000% growth, and offers community rewards, making it even more promising in the current bull run.

Many altcoins experienced similar volatility lately. Now, though, PI has finally bounced off while TON has plunged hard. BTC Stabilizes at $83.5K It was a wild week in terms of price actions for the primary cryptocurrency, mostly influenced by global economic developments. It started with a price slump to $81,200, but the asset reacted well and jumped almost immediately. The peak came on Wednesday after reports that Elon Musk would leave President Trump’s inner circle, and bitcoin skyrocketed to over $88,000. However, then came the so-called ‘Liberation Day’, and the latest tariffs imposed by the POTUS resulted in an immediate price slump of over six grand. More volatility ensued by the end of the weekend as other countries responded similarly. BTC was stopped at $85,000 on a couple of occasions, while the $81,000 support held its price from breaking further below. As of now, the cryptocurrency trades at around $83,500. Its market capitalization remains still at $1.660 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has declined slightly to just under 60% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView PI on the Rebound After weeks and weeks of continuous price declines, Pi Network’s native token has finally bounced off in the past 24 hours. The asset, which marked an all-time low yesterday, is up by 9% now and sits at $0.6. Still, its performance on a monthly scale is quite underwhelming as it’s down by 69%. OKB is the other notable gainer from the larger-cap alts, having surged by a similar percentage to over $51. In contrast, TON has plunged the most (-7%), followed by LEO and ICP. SOL, XRP, and DOGE are with minor gains, while BNB, ADA, and TRX are with insignificant losses over the past 24 hours. The total crypto market cap has added around $60 billion since yesterday’s low and is up to $2.780 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

The PI token, which saw the light of day on February 20 when it became available for trading on numerous exchanges, slumped hard after reaching a new all-time high on February 26. At the time, the peak at $3 was short-lived and the asset started to lose value painfully quickly . This culminated yesterday when it slumped to an all-time low of $0.54 (CoinGecko data), an 82% drop from the aforementioned positive record in just over a month. Such a massive decline turned even previous proponents into critics, as one claimed that the project was actually a slow rug pull. The past 24 hours have finally brought some relief to the Pi Network community as PI jumped by over 9% and now sits at $0.6. Perhaps one of the reasons behind this increase is PI’s growing popularity among certain investors, as CoinGecko informed. The token entered the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of the most trending coins in the period between March 29 and April 4. Thus, it surpassed the market leader Bitcoin as well as other bigger altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Ripple. $PI Trends #7 Globally on CoinGecko! Pi Network ($PI) surges into the Top 10, ranking 7th with a staggering $3.7B market cap—outshining major cryptocurrencies! The rise is real. Are you holding? #PiNetwork #Crypto pic.twitter.com/wJbGmRqM4s — Pi News (@PiNewsMedia) April 5, 2025 Or, another possible reason for today’s price surge is a termin known as ‘dead cat bounce.’ It refers to a temporary recovery in an asset’s price after a substantial and continuous decline, caused by speculators buying in order to cover their positions. It usually doesn’t end well. But that’s just a speculation, of course.

His sentiments came on the same day US stock markets experienced a $3.5 trillion wiped off, after China issued retaliatory tariffs in response to President Donald Trump’s April 2 trade policy changes. Buffett says it is a bad idea to sell when stock prices fall According to CNBC market data , the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 2,231 points, a 5.5% drop, pushing the index into correction territory, defined as a decline of 10% or more from its most recent peak. The S&P 500 shed nearly 6% and lost more than $6 trillion in market value over the past two trading days, its worst two-day performance since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Nasdaq Composite was also bearish, falling more than 20% from its December high and closing below that threshold for the first time since 2022. On global markets, MSCI’s global index of equities dropped 5.37%, posting its largest weekly decline since 2020. Oil markets also took a beating, with Brent crude futures down 6.5% to $65.58 per barrel, and U.S. crude falling 7.4% to $61.99, both hitting their lowest levels in over three years. The downturn followed a job report showing that the US economy added 228,000 jobs in March, well above the 135,000 market prediction. Still, this positive labor news failed to offset investor fears around a foreseeable economic fallout from President Trump’s tariffs. But Buffett, known for his long-term value investing approach, wants investors to view stock ownership as a stake in a business. He advised equity investors to not tap out when daily price swings lean towards the negatives. “ If you buy your house at $20,000 and somebody comes along the next day and says, I’ll pay you $15,000, you don’t sell it because of that ,” he explained. “ You look at the house or whatever it may be. But some people are not emotionally or psychologically fit to own stocks. ” He further explained that the longer someone holds stocks, the less risky they become, and bonds grow riskier as their maturity extends. Berkshire Hathaway shares, much like the rest of the stock market, closed Friday’s session down by over 6%. However, the company, which last year sold a net $134.1 billion in equities and boosted its cash reserves to $334.2 billion, has experienced a 9.41% share price uptick year-to-date. No recession possibility, Fed chair Powell insists During his speech at a conference in Arlington, Virginia, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Trump’s tariffs are likely to fuel higher inflation and slower economic growth. “These new tariffs are larger than expected,” Powell said. “The economic fallout, including higher inflation and slower growth, likely will be as well.” The Fed official admitted that several private-sector forecasts are leaning towards the possibility of a US recession. Investment bank JP Morgan recently increased its probability of a global recession by year-end to 60%, up from 40%. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, said Powell’s comments likely disappointed investors hoping for near-term central bank intervention. “ I think his comments will be disappointing for those who believe that the Fed is going to step in anytime soon ,” Cardillo said. Yet, the US dollar regained some strength following Thursday’s decline, with the dollar index rising 0.6% on Friday. The euro slipped 0.63% to $1.10976, reversing much of its 1.8% gain a day earlier, its largest single-day increase since November 2022. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 0.58% to 146.9.

While there are multiple speculations about the Ripple lawsuit’s potential developments, ex-SEC lawyer Marc Fagel suggested that Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling could stand. Notably, the former SEC lawyer’s comments come amidst a mysterious twist in the XRP lawsuit. Let’s dive into the basis of Marc Fagel’s assertions and his response to the new turn in the XRP lawsuit. Will Judge Torres Revoke the XRP Lawsuit Ruling? Despite both the US SEC and Ripple taking steps that could lead to a conclusion in the XRP lawsuit, uncertainty still surrounds the outcome. There are numerous rumors and speculations about the case’s potential developments. One such scenario is the possibility of Judge Analisa Torres revoking the existing judgment on Ripple’s liability. However, ex-SEC lawyer Marc Fagel dismissed the possibility of such a development. According to Fagel, Judge Torres will not revoke her ruling. Instead, the parties involved in XRP lawsuit will focus on modifying the remedies. The SEC lawyer’s comments have drawn significant attention, with many focusing on the potential shift in emphasis to penalties and remedies. Ex-SEC Lawyer Dismisses Unusual Filing as Spam In a surprising twist, a mysterious filing in the XRP lawsuit has raised concerns and speculations. An individual named Justin W. Keener submitted a request to present “decisive evidence” in the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. He posited that the critical information favors both Ripple and Americans, sparking much attention. The ambiguous nature of the filing has invoked further intrigue as the mentioned evidence remains unclear. While prominent figures came forward commenting on the unusual filing, Marc Fagel dismissed it as a spam. He wrote on an X post, It’s not really that. It’s a filing by someone not authorized to appear in the case. It’s the equivalent of spam getting through the court’s filter, and will be deleted. Is the XRP Lawsuit Settlement Imminent? As Ripple has dropped its cross-appeal in response to the SEC’s appeal withdrawal, the community remains confident that the conclusion is imminent. However, citing possible reasons, experts point out a potential delay in the settlement with a few steps pending. As per legal expert Fred Rispoli, the Ripple vs SEC case could be concluded within two months . Despite these anticipations, it needs to be seen how the Ripple lawsuit would ultimately end.

When these major players start selling or reducing their holdings, it often hints at changing market trends. Lately, whales have been offloading Uniswap (UNI), Chainlink (LINK), and Ondo Finance (ONDO), raising concerns about possible price drops. Uniswap (UNI): Whale Losing Interest Uniswap, one of the top decentralized exchanges, is seeing a decline in interest from large investors. Wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 UNI have dropped, showing a lack of confidence among key players. This trend began before Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs and has continued, with the number of these wallets falling from 825 to 821 in just one day. Currently, UNI is in a downtrend, and if this continues, it could slide toward $5.50. However, if buying pressure returns, the token might bounce back to $5.97 and even aim for $6.23. Chainlink (LINK): Whales Show Uncertainty Chainlink, a major player in blockchain oracles, is also seeing fluctuations in whale activity. Before Trump’s Liberation Day, whales were accumulating LINK, increasing their holdings from 2,852 to 2,860. However, post-event, the number of wallets holding 10,000 to 100,000 LINK slightly declined to 2,855. While this change is small, it could mean that some large investors are taking profits or becoming cautious. Looking at the Chainlink (LINK) price, it is trading around $12.87 . Experts believe it is trying to establish strong support at $12. If it fails to hold this level, the price could drop further to around $10. On the other hand, if LINK breaks above resistance, it could climb to $13 and even reach $15. ONDO Finance (ONDO): Investor Confidence Drops Ondo Finance, a rising project in decentralized finance, saw strong interest from large investors between March 26 and March 29. During this time, the number of whale wallets increased from 376 to 390. However, after reaching its peak, the number dropped slightly from 374 to 371 following Trump’s Liberation Day. This suggests that some big investors might be stepping back to rethink their positions. As of now, the ONDO price is trading at around $0.80 , reflecting a drop of 2.5% in the last 24 hours. If buyers push the price higher, it could break past $0.82 and potentially reach $0.90 or even $0.95. But if the selling pressure continues, the key support levels to watch are $0.76 and $0.73.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|LINK|TRADING|UNI|ONDO,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 08:36:54

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s value struggled throughout February, enduring significant downturns. On February 27, the cryptocurrency dropped steeply, falling below $78,000 for the first time in more than three months. Analysis of on-chain data suggests that the decrease was largely driven by sell-offs from “Bitcoin tourists”—newcomers to the trading scene. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $83,575 Market cap $1,238,914,422,643 Trading volume $22,318,495,561 Circulating supply 19,719,062 All-time high $108,268, December 17, 2024 All-time low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $84,154 24-hour low $83,774 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $83,575 Price Prediction $ 116,112 (38.22%) Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 2.97% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 89,357 200-Day SMA $ 84,704 14-Day RSI 45.26 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that BTC is aiming for a recovery rally toward $84K Resistance for BTC is at $84,842 Support for BTC/USD is at $81,130 The BTC price analysis for 5 April confirms that BTC faces a surge in buying demand as it triggers a recovery rally toward $84K. Buyers are attempting to send the price above $85K but bears are strongly defending a surge. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price aims for a recovery rally toward $84K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faces a buying demand toward the high of $84K. Currently, the price of BTC is facing a strong battle between buyers and sellers in validating a clear trend. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $2.56 billion, showing low interest in trading today. BTC is trading at $83,575, surging by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades around the buying region at 46, hinting that bearish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the EMA trend lines. However, bulls maintain buying confidence as the BTC price corrects upwards. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.17, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $84,842, it will fuel a bullish rally to $88,234. BTC Price Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $81,130, beginning a bearish trend to $78,425. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bulls gained control after Bitcoin reached the low of $82K. As a result, they triggered a rebound, pushing the BTC price toward $84K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price currently aims to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are set to expand the Trump family’s cryptocurrency business portfolio by investing in Bitcoin mining-focused Hut 8. Hut 8, based in Miami, announced the launch of its majority-owned subsidiary, American Bitcoin, dedicated to Bitcoin mining and strategic reserve development. Bitcoin price prediction April 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance is notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. Will the BTC price recover in April 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $89,000 and be pushed further, at least $95,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $72,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction April 2025 $72,000 $89,000 $95,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. We expect Bitcoin price to reach a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-05 08:50:00

JPMorgan Answers,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-us-enter-recession-this-year-jpmorgan-answers/,"JPMorgan Chase issued a dire warning about the direction of the U.S. economy, predicting a recession this year due to the impact of sweeping tariffs announced by President Donald Trump earlier this week. JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli said in a note to clients that the bank now expects the U.S. economy to shrink and revised its full-year GDP forecast to a 0.3% contraction from 1.3% growth. “We now expect real GDP to contract under the weight of tariffs,” Feroli said. “The projected contraction in economic activity is expected to suppress hiring and raise the unemployment rate to 5.3% over time.” Markets reacted strongly to Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs targeting U.S. trading partners on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 plunging to an 11-month low, wiping out $5.4 trillion in market value in two trading sessions.

Barclays said on Thursday it expects a recession in 2025, while Citi economists on Friday cut their 2025 growth forecast to just 0.1%. Feroli also said the Fed will start cutting interest rates in June and continue through January. Even as inflation is forecast to rise, he expects the benchmark interest rate to fall to a range of 2.75% to 3% from the current 4.25% to 4.5%. JPMorgan projects core inflation will rise to 4.4% by year-end from the current 2.8%. Feroli described that outlook as “stagflationary,” a rare combination of slowing growth and rising prices that could pose a policy dilemma for the Fed. “If true, our stagflationary forecast would pose a dilemma for Fed policymakers,” Feroli said. “We believe significant labor market weakness will eventually play out, particularly if it results in weaker wage growth.” Despite the mounting pressures, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank was in no rush to change its policy stance. “It doesn’t feel like there’s any need to rush,” Powell said after the release of March employment data that showed strong job growth and a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 4.2%. *This is not investment advice.

42937720,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=705880,1743844217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42937720.jpeg,"Polymarket surges up fee generation charts with $7M day, Tether maintains lead",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polymarket-surges-fee-generation-tether-lead/,"According to data available on DeFiLlama’s fees page, which tracks fees across various DeFi protocols, there was a huge spike in fees on the Polymarket platform. The surge in fee generation could be attributed to a rise in user activity or transaction volume on the platform. Historically, the Polymarket prediction market platform records increased engagement during high-profile events, such as elections, major sports outcomes, or significant global developments, as punters scramble to place bets or speculate on outcomes. Polymarket was the second-highest fee-generating protocol on DeFiLlama’s fees & revenue dashboard. Source: DeFiLlama Polymarket goes off in April On a monthly scale, the DefiLlama data shows that April has been Polymarket’s most profitable month in terms of fees. This is just the fifth day in the month, but the platform appears to have already amassed more than half of its all-time fees. It sounds ridiculous, but it’s true. The data appears even more interesting on the weekly and daily fee charts. The weekly data shows that there was only average activity on the platform between January and March, but that changed in April, which is still in its first week at the time of this publication. The daily fee data revealed even more. It showed that Polymarket fees did not really spike until April 3, when it recorded $7.33M. It has since maintained a value above $7M on a daily basis, reinforcing the platform’s recent spike. Polymaket may be one of the rare winners of the “Liberation Day” tariff announcements by Donald Trump on April 2, 2025. The announcement saw him unveil a sweeping tariff plan targeting goods from nearly all countries, and it sent shockwaves through the traditional financial markets. The Dow reflected this, reportedly dropping 3,700 points between April 2 and 3, while Polymarket’s recession odds jumped from 51% to 60% by April 4. This reflects a frenzy of activity from punters who scrambled to wager on the economic outcomes directly tied to the tariff news. Public sentiments on X from April 3 align with this, showing Polymarket’s recession odds rose from 33% to 47% and inflation bets above 4% jumped from 17% to 48% within 48 hours, alongside a $2 trillion wipeout in US stock market value. The spike in activity and fees aligns with Polymarket’s historical pattern of fee spikes during high-stakes events—like the 2024 US presidential election, which saw election bets push fees to notable heights. The tariff announcement is expected to drive economic chaos with traders flooding markets like “US recession in 2025?” or “Will the NYSE hit a circuit-breaker?”—both of which saw sharp probability shifts on Polymarket. US recession odds shot up during the week on Polymarket. Source: Polymarket An increased amount of trades equates to more USDC flowing into the platform, pumping the fee totals tracked by DeFiLlama, even if Polymarket has stated that it doesn’t pocket them directly. Another rationale for the spike is a change in Polymarket’s operations—for example, a change in its fee structure. However, the platform claims it has not changed its fee structure in a significant way that introduces trading, deposit, or withdrawal fees as a primary revenue model. Polymarket has always operated with a no-fee model. Its official documentation and statements from CEO Shayne Coplan highlight the platform’s focus on growth over monetization, so while it may charge fees in the future, there is no timeline of when they may be implemented yet. The platform has, in the past, generated revenue indirectly through spreads on trading and liquidity provision rather than directly imposing fees on users. Why does Tether lead Circle so much in profit margin? Even though Polymarket saw a huge spike in income, according to DefiLlama, it still falls behind Tether with its cumulative revenue. Tether’s rival, Circle took the final top-three spot in terms of cumulative fees and revenue. Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) are stablecoin issuers whose incomes are linked mainly to the interest earned on the reserves backing their stablecoins, even though some additional revenue comes from redemption or issuance fees. Both companies operate identical business models, and their primary revenue comes from investing their reserves in interest-bearing instruments, such as US Treasury bills, which have yielded 3.5%-5% annually in recent years thanks to elevated interest rates. Nevertheless, data shows that Tether makes more profit than Circle, with recent estimates suggesting the USDT issuer earned over $18 million in revenue in the last 24 hours, while Circle reported $6.35 million. This is even though USDT’s circulating supply is only about 2.3 times greater than USDC’s. In fact, on a per-unit basis, Tether reportedly generates roughly 20 times more profit per stablecoin than Circle. Tether is a perennial leader in the revenue generation chart. Source: DefiLlama Another reason for this huge difference could be Tether’s affinity for taking on riskier or higher-yield investments. Meanwhile, Circle, regulated as it is, has said its reserves are held in safe assets like Treasuries and cash, which yield a predictable but modest return. Tether is less transparent about its reserves only listing “secured loans” and other non-transparent assets which suggests it could be chasing higher returns not minding the added risk. There is also the fact that Circle is at a structural disadvantage because of its inability to keep more of its revenue in-house. This is because of its deal with Coinbase, which gives it a cut of USDC’s economics, diluting Circle’s per-unit profit. Tether has no such major partner and retains full control over its issuance and redemption process, which allows it to keep more of its revenue in-house. It also charges a 0.1% redemption fee for converting USDT back to fiat, providing a small but steady revenue stream, especially with high-volume users. Circle, on the other hand, offers users fee-free redemptions, leading to what has been tagged “vampire attacks,” an arbitrage process where users swap USDT for USDC to cash out cheaper. Overall, Tether has more market dominance than Circle, which allows its reserves to grow faster, thereby compounding interest earnings.

The decision reflects the country’s growing acceptance of digital assets as legitimate financial instruments. The unanimous ruling, delivered by the court’s Third Panel , allows judges to notify cryptocurrency exchanges of their intent to confiscate a debtor’s holdings in order to repay outstanding debts. Brazil Court Grants Crypto Same Legal Status as Bank Accounts in Debt Cases The move brings crypto assets under the same legal treatment as traditional bank accounts, which courts in Brazil can already freeze or seize without prior notice to the account holder. “Although they are not legal tender, crypto assets can be used as a form of payment and as a store of value,” stated a translated excerpt from the court’s official memo. The ruling emerged from a specific case presented by a creditor, and was supported by all five judges on the panel. Minister Ricardo Villas Bôas Cueva, one of the panel members, acknowledged that while Brazil still lacks comprehensive regulations governing cryptocurrencies, several legislative proposals have already defined crypto as a “digital representation of value.” Crypto usage has been rising steadily in Brazil. According to an October report by Chainalysis, Brazil ranks second in Latin America for total crypto value received—a key indicator of adoption. O STJ decidiu que, se o devedor não paga a dívida reconhecida na sentença judicial, o juiz pode enviar ofício às corretoras de criptomoedas com a finalidade de achar e penhorar ativos digitais em seu nome.

Despite progress, regulatory developments remain mixed. In December, Brazil’s central bank proposed restrictions on stablecoin usage in self-custodial wallets, sparking concerns among users who rely on dollar-pegged tokens to protect against the devaluation of the Brazilian real. Brazil Warming Towards Digital Assets Brazil has been moving toward digital assets and innovative technologies like blockchain. In 2023, the country announced it is set to issue digital identification documents for its more than 214 million citizens using blockchain technology. The decision to leverage blockchain technology for digital identity stems from its inherent properties of immutability and decentralization. In addition to the digital identity project, Brazil is also making strides in the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In August, the government provided more details about the project, which has been rebranded as Drex. The CBDC aims to expand business access to capital through a tokenization system associated with the Drex. More recently, the central bank of Brazil vowed to tighten rules and strengthen its oversight of crypto platforms amid growing crypto adoption in the country.

The big names like Ethereum and Bitcoin have already made their mark—but the next wave of growth is coming from smaller, utility-driven tokens still in their early stages. One of the most talked-about among these is MUTM, the native token of Mutuum Finance, which is currently priced at just $0.025. For those paying attention, this might not just be another addition to the portfolio—it could be the one that redefines it entirely. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized ecosystem around lending and borrowing—offering users full control over their assets through smart contracts. It provides an alternative to traditional lending protocols by giving users access to liquidity without having to exit their positions, and also rewarding those who supply assets to the protocol with yield that adjusts based on demand. This structure enables both active and passive users to benefit, whether they’re looking to earn consistent income or deploy capital for flexible borrowing. But what’s capturing attention right now isn’t just the platform’s design—it’s the price of MUTM and the upside it presents. Sitting at $0.025 during its presale, MUTM is entering the market at a valuation that leaves significant room for growth. The launch price is set at $0.06, which already positions early buyers for more than double returns. But analysts and investors tracking the project are looking well beyond that. Based on projected adoption, platform expansion, and token utility, there are growing expectations that MUTM could reach up to $7 by the end of 2025. That’s a staggering 28,000% increase from the current presale price—a surge that, while ambitious, is not unheard of in the DeFi space when a project combines timing, traction, and strong tokenomics. As crypto re-enters a growth phase, capital is increasingly flowing into early-stage projects that offer real functionality and long-term potential. Mutuum Finance stands out in this trend. With over $6.1 million raised and more than 7,750 holders already involved during the presale, the numbers reflect more than just initial excitement—they show strategic interest from investors who know how to spot value early. What makes this even more compelling is the way the token model is designed to benefit its users. A portion of the protocol’s revenue is allocated to buying MUTM from the market, which helps reduce circulating supply. Those purchased tokens are then redistributed to participants who contribute to the ecosystem, encouraging both long-term holding and ongoing engagement. Beyond its smart tokenomics, Mutuum is solving a practical challenge in decentralized finance: giving users access to liquidity and yield without requiring them to give up control of their assets. As more individuals and institutions look for alternatives to traditional financial systems, tools that allow transparent borrowing and sustainable passive income are seeing greater demand—and Mutuum is building directly for that use case. The upcoming CertiK audit adds another layer of credibility. As one of the most recognized names in blockchain security, CertiK’s involvement signals that the protocol is preparing for broader visibility and larger-scale participation. This is often a turning point for newer projects—when institutional players start paying attention. For investors looking to add a new token to their portfolio, the numbers speak for themselves. A $1,000 investment at $0.025 would give you 40,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $7, that investment turns into $280,000—all based on a structured system with real yield and a growing user base. Opportunities like this don’t stay quiet for long. MUTM is still early, still affordable, and still under the radar—but the momentum is building fast. With its strong foundation, planned token mechanisms, and massive upside potential, this $0.025 token will be the one that transforms your portfolio for good.

STHs are defined as wallets that have held their coins for 155 days or less. “The first signal that Bitcoin is ready to resume its bull run is reclaiming the short-term holder realized price at $90,570!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading at $83,300 at time of writing.

Long-term holders are entities that have kept their coins inactive for more than 155 days.

Source: Ali Charts, X Despite the broader market turmoil caused by Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs , investors anticipate a bullish future for Bitcoin, Ether, and other crypto. The data also signals that investors are securing funds by investing in stablecoins rather than stocks as global markets are facing pressure amid trade war tensions. Bitcoin Decouples From S&P 500 On the other hand, an X post by DataDash revealed that Bitcoin is decoupling from the S&P 500. BTC and S&P 500 have shown correlated action, and following the Elliott Wave Theory, the assets reached their wave 5 highs earlier this month. However, a recent shift in the market sentiment since April 2 has ignited a massive tide of speculations. The S&P 500 witnessed a steep decline of over 10%, breaking key support at 5500 and yet to show signs of a clear reversal to date. Meanwhile, BTC price is down slightly over 5% from its high and is still holding above support levels. This dynamic further underlines signs of capital rotation wherein funds flow out of equities and move to the crypto market. Source: DataDash, X Additionally, this metric also indicates that a paradigm shift in market sentiment could occur shortly ahead despite the ongoing turbulence. The robust stablecoin inflows have only added to the chances of a bull market ahead. Now, market participants are eagerly awaiting risk assets to digest trade war tensions. BTC Price Stays Strong, Crypto Market To Follow? Meanwhile, despite the bloodbath on Wall Street, BTC price maintained trading above $85K and prevented any major losses. The flagship crypto consolidated within the $81K to $84K range over the past day. Bitcoin’s resilient action in comparison to equities has left investors scratching their heads. Many experts even believe that the alt sector could mimic such a movement. A recent X post by attorney John E Deaton further shows intriguing data that underlines investors’ shift of interest towards risk assets. The post indicated that while $3.25 trillion was erased from the U.S. stock market in just a day, $5.4 billion was added to the cryptocurrency sector.

42937791,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146625,1743844835,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: SEC Commissioner Unveils Hidden Stablecoin Risks in Scathing Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-unveils-stablecoin-risks/,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to regulatory scrutiny, and the latest salvo comes from within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) itself. Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw has ignited a debate by publicly criticizing her own agency’s analysis of stablecoins. Are stablecoins really as ‘stable’ and safe as they seem? Crenshaw’s recent statement suggests otherwise, pointing to potentially overlooked vulnerabilities within the seemingly steady world of USD-pegged digital currencies. Let’s dive into why she believes the SEC’s current approach to stablecoin risks is dangerously inadequate. The Core of the Controversy: SEC Regulation and Stablecoin Risks Commissioner Crenshaw’s critique centers on the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance and their approach to classifying certain stablecoins. She argues that their analysis contains significant flaws – both legally and factually – that ultimately misrepresent the true nature of the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin market. At the heart of her argument is the assertion that the SEC is substantially downplaying the inherent stablecoin risks present in this rapidly growing sector. Crenshaw doesn’t mince words. She believes the Division’s analysis fails to properly acknowledge the risks associated with how most USD stablecoins are distributed and redeemed. This isn’t just about the issuers themselves, but about the web of intermediaries that play a crucial role in the stablecoin ecosystem. Why Intermediaries are Key to Understanding Stablecoin Vulnerabilities According to Commissioner Crenshaw, the reliance on intermediaries is where a significant portion of the stablecoin risks lies. Consider these points to understand her concern: Dominant Role of Intermediaries: A staggering over 90% of USD stablecoins rely on intermediaries for their distribution and redemption. This means that instead of directly interacting with the stablecoin issuer, most users go through third parties. Unregistered Entities: Many of these crucial intermediaries operate without being registered with regulatory bodies. This lack of oversight raises red flags, as it means they are not necessarily subject to the same compliance standards and scrutiny as registered financial institutions. Undermining Issuer Safeguards: Stablecoin issuers often implement measures to mitigate risks. However, Crenshaw argues that the reliance on unregistered intermediaries can effectively nullify these efforts. If these intermediaries falter, the issuer’s risk management strategies become less impactful. Holder Recourse at Risk: Perhaps the most concerning point is the potential lack of recourse for stablecoin holders. If an intermediary fails to redeem the coins as promised, holders may find themselves without a clear path to recover their funds. This directly contradicts the very premise of a ‘stable’ coin pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. In essence, Crenshaw is highlighting a critical point: the strength of a stablecoin system is only as good as its weakest link. If the intermediaries – the gatekeepers to accessing and redeeming these digital dollars – are not properly regulated and pose operational or financial risks, the entire cryptocurrency regulation framework around stablecoins becomes shaky. The SEC’s Stance and the Path Forward for Cryptocurrency Regulation Commissioner Crenshaw’s public disagreement with her own agency’s division underscores the ongoing debate within regulatory bodies about how to effectively oversee the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Her statement can be interpreted as a call for a more rigorous and comprehensive approach to cryptocurrency regulation , particularly concerning stablecoins. Here’s a breakdown of the potential implications and questions raised by Crenshaw’s critique: Aspect Implication of Crenshaw’s Argument Questions Raised SEC’s Analysis Re-evaluation May prompt the SEC to revisit and revise its analysis of stablecoin risks, potentially leading to a more cautious and stringent regulatory stance. Will the SEC take Crenshaw’s concerns seriously and conduct a more thorough review of stablecoin intermediaries? Increased Regulatory Scrutiny Could lead to increased scrutiny of stablecoin intermediaries, potentially resulting in new regulations or enforcement actions targeting unregistered entities. What specific regulatory measures might be implemented to address the risks posed by stablecoin intermediaries? Will these measures stifle innovation or effectively protect consumers? Market Confidence Impact While intended to highlight risks and protect investors, such public disagreements within the SEC could temporarily impact market confidence in stablecoins. How will the market react to this internal debate within the SEC? Will it lead to greater demand for regulated stablecoins or increased skepticism towards the entire asset class? Broader Regulatory Framework May contribute to the ongoing development of a more comprehensive and robust regulatory framework for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Will this incident accelerate the development of clearer and more effective regulations for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole? Caroline Crenshaw’s Perspective: A Voice for Investor Protection It’s important to note that Caroline Crenshaw has consistently advocated for strong investor protection within the SEC. Her background as counsel to SEC Commissioners and her focus on enforcement actions reflect a commitment to safeguarding investors in complex financial markets. Her criticism of the stablecoin analysis aligns with this broader perspective. Her argument isn’t necessarily against stablecoins themselves, but rather against a potentially inadequate assessment of their risks. By highlighting the crucial role and potential vulnerabilities of stablecoin intermediaries , she is pushing for a more realistic and comprehensive understanding of the stablecoin ecosystem within the SEC and among market participants. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users and Stakeholders So, what does this mean for you, whether you’re a crypto investor, a stablecoin user, or involved in the industry? Increased Awareness is Key: Be aware of the risks associated with stablecoins, particularly those related to intermediaries. Don’t assume that ‘stable’ automatically means ‘risk-free.’ Due Diligence Matters: When using stablecoins, understand the entities involved in their distribution and redemption. Are they regulated? What are their risk management practices? Regulatory Developments are Crucial: Pay close attention to regulatory developments in the stablecoin space. Increased scrutiny and potential regulations could significantly impact the market. Advocate for Transparency: Support initiatives that promote transparency and accountability within the stablecoin ecosystem, including clearer regulatory frameworks for intermediaries. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Stablecoin Market? Commissioner Crenshaw’s outspoken critique serves as a potent wake-up call. It underscores that even within seemingly ‘stable’ corners of the cryptocurrency market, significant risks can lurk beneath the surface. Her focus on the often-overlooked role of intermediaries is particularly insightful and demands attention from regulators, industry players, and users alike. As the debate around stablecoin risks and regulation intensifies, one thing is clear: the path forward for stablecoins will be heavily influenced by how effectively these hidden vulnerabilities are addressed and mitigated.

In a post on X, she explained how RLUSD contributes to the XRP ecosystem through transaction fees, liquidity improvements, and its function in cross-border payments. Saldana’s comments were accompanied by a video featuring Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, who provided further insights into how RLUSD benefits the XRPL. This is why RLUSD helps XRP RLUSD transactions on the XRP Ledger require XRP to pay gas fees, which are burned. This reduces XRP supply. More RLUSD usage means more XRP burned.

(@AngelofYHVH) April 2, 2025 RLUSD Transactions Burn XRP Saldana highlighted that RLUSD transactions on the XRP Ledger require XRP for gas fees, which are burned in the process. This mechanism reduces the total supply of XRP over time. Since burning XRP decreases the circulating supply, it introduces a deflationary aspect that could affect the asset’s long-term dynamics. She emphasized that increased usage of RLUSD would lead to higher XRP burn rates, reinforcing the idea that the introduction of a stablecoin on XRPL has direct implications for XRP itself. By linking RLUSD’s activity to XRP supply reduction , Saldana suggested that the stablecoin’s adoption could influence XRP’s broader economic model. Liquidity and Cross-Border Payments Saldana also points out that RLUSD enhances liquidity for cross-border payments and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on XRPL. By providing a stable digital asset within the ecosystem, RLUSD facilitates smoother transactions, particularly for businesses and financial institutions looking for price stability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to her, this added liquidity strengthens the XRPL’s role in global payments by offering a reliable stablecoin alternative that complements XRP’s function as a bridge currency. She noted that when users convert RLUSD into other assets, XRP often serves as the intermediary, increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. David Schwartz on RLUSD’s Impact In the attached video, David Schwartz elaborated on the benefits RLUSD brings to the XRP Ledger. He described the stablecoin as a tool for expanding use cases and opportunities for developers. While reaffirming XRP’s position as the native currency of the ledger, he explained that XRPL was designed to support multiple asset types, including stablecoins and fiat-backed tokens. Schwartz outlined how RLUSD enhances the XRPL decentralized exchange (DEX) by increasing trading volume. He explained that the DEX’s auto-bridging feature relies on XRP to facilitate trades between different assets, making XRP a key component in improving trading efficiency. He states that the addition of RLUSD to the ecosystem strengthens this mechanism by introducing another widely accepted asset. He also highlighted that RLUSD and XRP serve different purposes within the ecosystem. While XRP remains a bridge currency for Ripple’s payment solutions, RLUSD supports the expansion of new blockchain-based financial applications. Schwartz mentioned that RLUSD’s introduction aligns with the growth of real-world asset tokenization, foreign exchange markets, and trade finance, areas expected to see increased adoption. The Future of RLUSD and XRP Saldana’s post emphasized the interdependence of RLUSD and XRP, describing the stablecoin as a factor that can increase both the usability and demand for XRP. Schwartz echoed this sentiment, noting that RLUSD’s presence on the XRP Ledger contributes to the broader adoption of on-chain applications. RLUSD’s role within the XRPL ecosystem may evolve as the stablecoin market expands. Its impact on liquidity, transaction efficiency, and asset conversion mechanisms highlights the stablecoin’s significance beyond its immediate function.

Kiyosaki urges investors to consider gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Financial author Robert Kiyosaki declared Friday’s sharp market downturn confirms the financial collapse he has predicted for decades, stating the U.S. is now in a recession and potentially a depression. His comments came as global stock markets shed trillions, driven by new U.S. tariffs and swift Chinese retaliation.

The flagship cryptocurrency couldn’t sustain this blistering momentum, dropping below $84,000 in the late hours of Friday, April 4. However, the BTC price has been relatively stable compared to the altcoin market and the US equities market following the announcement of new trade tariffs by United States President Donald Trump. This show of resilience has reinforced the idea that the bull cycle might not be over just yet. Why Bitcoin Price Must Remain Above $69,000 In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci analyzed the Bitcoin market relative to the downturn affecting the broader financial markets. The analyst offered insight on the most critical support level should the premier cryptocurrency witness a similar decline. Related Reading: PEPE Price Breaks Ascending Triangle To Target Another 20% Crash Kesmeci pinpointed the “Bitcoin Spot ETF Realized Price” as a crucial metric to watch if the price of BTC succumbs to bearish pressure. As its name suggests, the Bitcoin Spot ETF Realized Price indicator measures the average price at which each Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was acquired. According to Kesmeci, the average purchase price of the BTC ETFs has acted as a formidable support area since the exchange-traded funds launched in early 2024. As observed in the chart below, the flagship cryptocurrency has tested the Bitcoin ETF’s realized price multiple times in the past 15 months. Kesmeci highlighted that the ETF realized price and Bitcoin’s most critical support level currently stand at around $69,000. The community analyst noted that the premier cryptocurrency is less likely to witness any severe correction so long as it does not slip beneath this price level. When Will BTC Resume Bull Run? While the Bitcoin ETF’s realized price is a crucial support level that could prevent a deep correction, the short-term holder (STH) realized price could prove pivotal to the resumption of the bull run. Ali Martinez said in a post on X that the first signal that BTC is ready to resume its bull run is reclaiming the short-term holder realized price at $90,570. As seen in the chart above, the STH realized price is acting as a major resistance to the premier cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin price has tested the on-chain indicator twice since falling beneath it in late February. As of this writing, the market leader is valued at around $83,900, reflecting an over 1% price leap in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of BTC is down by nearly 1% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Chainlink Whales Dump Over 170 Million LINK In Three Weeks – Selling Pressure Ahead?

The latest readings from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggest a slight easing of negative sentiment, but we’re not out of the woods yet. As of April 5th, the index sits at 30, a modest two-point increase from the previous day. While any upward movement might seem encouraging, it’s crucial to note that we remain firmly entrenched in the ‘Fear’ zone. What does this mean for your crypto investments, and how should you interpret these signals? Let’s dive into the details. Decoding Crypto Sentiment: Understanding the Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a valuable tool designed to gauge the overall market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. It’s provided by Alternative , a software development platform, and it operates on a scale from 0 to 100. Think of it as a thermometer for the crypto market’s emotional temperature. A score of 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’, suggesting investors are overly worried and potentially leading to a market bottom. Conversely, a score of 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed’, implying excessive optimism which could signal a market top or bubble. Currently, with a reading of 30, we are still in the ‘Fear’ zone, suggesting prevailing crypto sentiment is cautious and potentially pessimistic. What Factors Influence the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index? The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index , and its broader crypto counterpart, isn’t based on guesswork. It’s calculated using a weighted average of several key market indicators. Understanding these factors is crucial to interpreting the index effectively. Here’s a breakdown: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its 30-day and 90-day averages. Unusually high volatility often signals fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Examines Bitcoin’s market momentum and trading volume relative to its 30-day and 90-day averages. High buying volume and positive momentum can suggest growing greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags and keywords. A high volume of negative posts typically reflects fear. Surveys (15%): Conducts weekly crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. While currently paused, these surveys previously provided direct insights into fear and greed levels. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s dominance in the overall crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ during fearful times, as investors move away from riskier altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. A spike in searches like “Bitcoin crash” or “Bitcoin price prediction” might indicate heightened fear. By combining these diverse data points, the index provides a comprehensive snapshot of the prevailing market sentiment . Navigating the ‘Fear’ Zone: What Does a Reading of 30 Imply? Being in the ‘Fear’ zone, as indicated by the current index reading of 30, suggests that investors are currently apprehensive about the crypto market. This fear can stem from various factors, including: Market Uncertainty: Economic headwinds, regulatory uncertainties, and geopolitical events can all contribute to market fear. Price Corrections: Significant price drops in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies naturally induce fear among investors. Negative News Cycles: Bearish news headlines, exchange hacks, or project failures can amplify negative sentiment. However, it’s crucial to remember that ‘Fear’ can also present opportunities. Historically, periods of high fear have often preceded market rebounds. Savvy investors often view ‘Fear’ as a potential buying opportunity, adhering to the principle of “buy when there’s blood in the streets.” Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ can be warning signs of an overheated market, potentially signaling a time to take profits. Actionable Insights: Leveraging Crypto Sentiment for Informed Decisions So, how can you use the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to make more informed decisions in the volatile crypto market? Use it as a Contrarian Indicator: Consider using the index as a contrarian tool. High ‘Fear’ readings might suggest potential buying opportunities, while ‘Extreme Greed’ could indicate a time to be cautious. Combine it with Other Analysis: Don’t rely solely on the Fear & Greed Index. Integrate it with other forms of analysis, such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and on-chain metrics, for a holistic view. Understand the Trend: Pay attention to the trend of the index over time. Is fear increasing or decreasing? A sustained upward trend from ‘Extreme Fear’ can be a positive sign, even if the index is still in the ‘Fear’ zone. Manage Risk: The index can help you gauge overall market risk appetite. During periods of high fear, consider reducing your risk exposure or diversifying your portfolio. Stay Informed: Keep track of the daily Fear & Greed Index readings and understand the factors driving sentiment. This will help you contextualize market movements and make more rational decisions. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto Market Cycles with Sentiment Analysis The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a valuable compass for navigating the often turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market. While the recent slight uptick to 30 offers a glimmer of hope, the continued presence in the ‘Fear’ zone serves as a reminder of the prevailing caution. By understanding how this index works, what factors influence it, and how to interpret its readings, you can gain a significant edge in making informed investment decisions. Remember, market sentiment is a powerful force, and tools like the Fear & Greed Index can help you decode its signals and potentially capitalize on market cycles. Always conduct thorough research and consider your own risk tolerance when making investment choices in the dynamic world of crypto.

Researchers at the Queen Mary University of London have revealed the behind-the-scenes details behind one of the biggest collapses in the crypto world, the fall of TerraUSD and its associate currency, LUNA. The Terra ecosystem suffered a big collapse in May 2022, with its LUNA native token dropping from $87 to $0.0005. As if that was not bad news enough, the platform’s stablecoin, UST also depegged, falling from its 1:1 peg with the dollar to about 0.03:1, causing panic which led to the 2022 bear run, triggering the sale of several digital assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to reports , the researchers deployed advanced mathematical techniques and cutting-edge software and identified suspicious trading patterns. The patterns pointed to a coordinated attack on the ecosystem, leading to a big loss of $3.5 billion in value overnight. The study was led by Dr Richard Clegg and his team of researchers employed temporal graph analysis, a sophisticated method for examining complex, interconnected systems over time. Queen Mary University researchers reveal details behind the Terra ecosystem collapse According to the researchers, the approach allowed them to map the relationship between the different tokens that were traded on the Ethereum blockchain. It also revealed how the TerraUSD stablecoin was destabilized by a series of deliberate, large-scale trades. According to Dr Clegg, stablecoins like TerraUSD are typically designed to maintain their steady value by being pegged to a fiat, which is usually the US dollar. The collapse in May 2022, was catastrophic, with the crash affecting TerraUSD and its sister token, LUNA. In his research, Dr Clegg sheds light on how this happened, mentioning that they were a group of traders who carried out a coordinated attack, betting against the system in a practice known as “shorting.” He mentioned that what his team of researchers discovered was unbelievable. “On the days leading up to the collapse, we observed highly unnatural trading patterns. Instead of the usual spread of transactions across hundreds of traders, we saw a handful of individuals controlling almost the entire market. These patterns are the smoking gun evidence of a deliberate attempt to destabilize the system,” he said. According to the team’s analysis, on specific dates, only about five or six traders accounted for nearly all the trading activities. The analysis highlighted that each of those traders controlled the exact share of the market on those days. This level of coordination is nearly impossible on a normal trading day or environment. It shows that the individuals involved in the trades were working together to trigger the collapse. Research unveils new tool to analyze patterns in the crypto market The research not only provides insights into the TerraUSD collapse but also introduces a powerful tool to analyze the crypto market via graph network analysis to visualize and interpret complex data. It could be very useful for regulators, researchers, investors, and anybody willing to understand trading data and mitigate risks in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. “Cryptocurrencies are often seen as the Wild West of finance, with little oversight and even less accountability,” Dr Clegg said. He added that the research shows that by applying complex mathematical techniques, anybody can uncover the hidden patterns and behaviors that drive the activities in the crypto market. Dr Clegg also mentioned that the tool is not just to provide insight into what went wrong in the past, it is also to provide a safer and more transparent financial system for the future. Also, the implications of this research extend way beyond the world of cryptocurrencies, as other sectors could use this tool.

Price is oscillating between resistance at $0.665–$0.670 and support at $0.640–$0.645, with lower highs signaling weakening bullish momentum. This suggests potential distribution and a further bearish move. Despite an attempt to break resistance, the price was rejected and now sits at $0.6557, below the 50-period DEMA. This failure to hold above the mid-range hints at underlying bearish pressure. Indicator Analysis: Bearish Momentum 50-period DEMA (green): Price is struggling to maintain above it, reflecting indecision and a lack of short-term bullish control. 200-period EMA (red): Positioned well above, reinforcing the broader bearish trend. Rallies toward this level will likely face resistance. This EMA alignment indicates continued bearish momentum unless there’s a significant shift in market sentiment. Support and Resistance Levels Resistance: $0.665–$0.670 (supply zone with repeated rejections) Support: $0.640–$0.645 (key demand zone) Major Support: $0.5925 (historical demand level, a potential downside target) These levels will be key in determining the next move. Price Outlook: Bearish Continuation Likely Given the rejection near $0.66 and the formation of lower highs, a bearish continuation is likely if the price breaks below $0.640. A clean breakdown could target $0.62, then $0.5925. For a bullish reversal, the price must reclaim $0.670 with strong volume, opening a potential move toward the 200 EMA around $0.70–$0.72, though this seems unlikely without a significant shift in momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Actionable Insights Bearish Setup: A close below $0.640 likely targets $0.62 and $0.5925. Bullish Setup: A reclaim of $0.66 with volume could lead to a retest of $0.670 and possibly $0.68. Avoid Long Positions within the current range as price action is choppy and lacks clear direction. ADA remains in a bearish consolidation, with lower highs and rejections at resistance indicating weakness. A break below $0.640 confirms further downside, while a move above $0.670 with strong volume could shift the bias upward. Monitor key levels and manage risk accordingly.

Even as global economies brace for potential aftershocks from policies like Trump tariffs , the leading cryptocurrency continues to demonstrate its unique ability to weather storms. This isn’t just wishful thinking from crypto enthusiasts; it’s the informed perspective of figures like Max Keiser, a prominent crypto advisor to the El Salvador government. Why Bitcoin’s Resilience Matters Now More Than Ever? In a recent report by Bitcoin.com, Keiser boldly stated that Bitcoin resilience remains strong despite the economic uncertainties spurred by former U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. His core argument? Traditional financial approaches are failing to deliver sustainable improvements in living standards, especially in the U.S. For Keiser, accumulating Bitcoin isn’t just about chasing profits; it’s presented as the most viable path toward genuine and substantial economic betterment. Let’s unpack why this perspective is gaining traction and what it means for you. The Trump Tariffs Effect: A Ripple in the Economic Pond? Trump tariffs , a signature policy during his presidency, aimed to reshape international trade relationships. While intended to protect domestic industries, these tariffs have often been criticized for triggering retaliatory measures and causing economic friction. The consequences can be far-reaching, potentially leading to: Increased costs for consumers: Tariffs often translate to higher prices for imported goods, impacting everyday consumers. Trade disputes and uncertainty: They can escalate into trade wars, creating instability and unpredictability in global markets. Economic slowdown: Disrupted supply chains and reduced trade volumes can dampen economic growth. Against this backdrop of potential economic shocks stemming from tariff policies, the question arises: how does Bitcoin stand its ground? Bitcoin Resilience: A Digital Fortress Against Economic Turmoil? Keiser’s assertion of Bitcoin resilience isn’t just based on hope. It stems from the fundamental characteristics of cryptocurrency itself. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin operates outside the direct control of governments and central banks. This decentralized nature offers several key advantages in times of economic uncertainty: Decentralization: Bitcoin’s distributed network makes it less susceptible to manipulation or censorship by any single entity. Limited Supply: With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, contrasting with fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin transactions are borderless, facilitating capital flow and offering an alternative in regions facing economic instability. Transparency: All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger (blockchain), enhancing transparency and security. These features contribute to Bitcoin resilience , positioning it as a potential safe haven asset during times of economic turbulence. But is it truly a viable alternative to traditional investments? Max Keiser’s Bold Claim: Bitcoin as the Ultimate Economic Solution? Max Keiser’s perspective goes beyond simply highlighting Bitcoin resilience . He advocates for Bitcoin accumulation as the “only real way” to achieve substantial improvements in quality of life. This is a bold statement, challenging the efficacy of conventional economic tools and policies. Why does he believe so strongly in crypto investment , specifically Bitcoin? Keiser’s argument hinges on the perceived limitations of traditional financial systems. He suggests that measures like quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus, often employed to combat economic shocks , are merely temporary fixes that don’t address the root causes of economic stagnation or inequality. He proposes that these systems are inherently flawed and unsustainable in the long run. In contrast, he positions Bitcoin as a revolutionary alternative – a decentralized, transparent, and finite asset that empowers individuals and offers a pathway to genuine economic empowerment. For Keiser, crypto investment in Bitcoin is not just about wealth accumulation; it’s about opting out of a system he views as broken and embracing a more equitable financial future. Is Crypto Investment in Bitcoin Right for You? Navigating the Landscape While the narrative of Bitcoin resilience and its potential as an economic solution is compelling, it’s crucial to approach crypto investment with informed caution. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and investing in Bitcoin carries risks. Here’s a balanced perspective to consider: Aspect Bitcoin & Crypto Investment Traditional Investments (Stocks, Bonds, etc.) Volatility High – Prices can fluctuate significantly and rapidly. Moderate – Generally less volatile than crypto, but still subject to market risks. Regulation Evolving – Regulatory landscape is still developing globally, creating some uncertainty. Established – Well-defined regulatory frameworks in most jurisdictions. Accessibility High – Relatively easy to access through crypto exchanges and platforms. Moderate – Requires brokerage accounts and understanding of financial markets. Potential Returns High – Potential for significant gains, but also substantial losses. Moderate – Generally lower potential returns, but also lower risk (depending on investment choices). Risk Factors Market volatility, security risks (exchange hacks, wallet security), regulatory uncertainty. Market risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk, company-specific risks. Before diving into crypto investment , consider these key steps: Do Your Research: Understand Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and the crypto market. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Determine how much risk you are comfortable taking. Start Small: Begin with a small investment amount you can afford to lose. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying your investment portfolio. Secure Your Investments: Use reputable exchanges and secure wallets to protect your crypto assets. Conclusion: Bitcoin Resilience in a World of Economic Uncertainty Max Keiser’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin resilience and its potential to counter economic shocks stemming from policies like Trump tariffs presents a compelling narrative. While the claim that Bitcoin is the “only real way” to improve quality of life is certainly debatable, the underlying message about the limitations of traditional financial systems and the potential of decentralized alternatives resonates with many. Crypto investment , particularly in Bitcoin, offers a unique proposition – a hedge against economic uncertainty and a potential pathway to financial empowerment in a rapidly changing world. Whether you are a seasoned investor or just beginning to explore the world of cryptocurrencies, understanding Bitcoin resilience and its role in the face of global economic shifts is crucial. As discussions around trade policies and economic stability continue to dominate headlines, Bitcoin’s unique characteristics position it as a noteworthy asset in the evolving financial landscape.

Get ready to understand how a recent ruling is set to dramatically change the landscape for crypto seizure Brazil , putting digital assets squarely in the crosshairs of legal proceedings. If you’re invested in cryptocurrency, especially in Brazil, this is critical news you can’t afford to ignore. Landmark Decision: Crypto Assets Now Fair Game in Brazil The core of this development revolves around a decision from Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice, as reported by Cointelegraph, granting judges the power to seize cryptocurrency assets from debtors. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a significant shift that places cryptocurrencies on par with traditional bank deposits in the eyes of the law. Imagine your digital wallets being treated just like your bank account when it comes to debt recovery – that’s the new reality in Brazil. Here’s a breakdown of what this ruling entails: Equal Footing: Cryptocurrencies are now legally recognized as having similar status to traditional assets for seizure purposes. Broker Notification: Judges are authorized to directly notify crypto brokers to execute asset seizure orders. This streamlines the process, making it more efficient for creditors to recover debts. Store of Value Acknowledged: The court’s memo explicitly states that “crypto assets can be used as a form of payment and as a store of value,” despite not being legal tender. This formal acknowledgment is a major step in legitimizing crypto within the Brazilian legal framework. This ruling underscores a growing global trend of legal systems grappling with the integration of digital assets into established financial and legal frameworks. But what exactly does this mean for crypto holders in Brazil, and why is this decision so noteworthy? Decoding Brazil Crypto Regulation : A Step Towards Mainstream Acceptance? For years, the legal status of cryptocurrencies has been a gray area in many jurisdictions. Brazil’s latest move can be interpreted as a significant stride towards clarifying and integrating crypto within its regulatory environment. While some might see this as a clampdown, others view it as a necessary step for mainstream acceptance. Why? Because clear regulations, even those that involve potential seizures, can bring legitimacy and reduce the Wild West perception sometimes associated with the crypto market. Consider these points in the context of broader Brazil crypto regulation : Aspect Implication of the Ruling Potential Long-Term Effect Legitimacy Court recognition as ‘store of value’ enhances crypto’s legitimacy. Increased institutional interest and adoption in Brazil. Investor Confidence Clearer legal framework, even for seizures, can build confidence by reducing uncertainty. Attraction of more risk-averse investors who seek regulatory clarity. Enforcement Streamlined seizure process makes crypto a more viable asset in legal proceedings. Improved creditor rights and potentially fairer financial system. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that increased regulation also comes with its set of challenges. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the New Legal Terrain for Crypto Assets Legal Status While the Brazilian court’s decision provides clarity, it also introduces new complexities and challenges for crypto users and the broader industry. Understanding these challenges is vital for anyone operating within the Brazilian crypto space. Privacy Concerns: The ease of seizing crypto assets might raise privacy alarms. How will the process ensure due diligence and prevent unwarranted seizures? Operational Hurdles for Brokers: Crypto brokers will need to adapt quickly to these new legal requirements. Implementing efficient systems for responding to seizure orders will be crucial. Potential for Misinterpretation: There’s always a risk of misinterpretation or overreach in the application of new regulations. Clear guidelines and oversight are essential to prevent abuse. Impact on DeFi: The ruling primarily targets centralized crypto brokers. The implications for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which operate outside traditional brokerage frameworks, remain less clear and could be a future area of legal focus. Despite these challenges, the move towards recognizing crypto assets legal standing is undeniable. It reflects a global trend as governments and legal systems worldwide are increasingly forced to address the realities of digital currencies. Impact on Debtors and Creditors: What Does This Mean for Debtor Crypto Assets ? For debtors in Brazil holding cryptocurrency, this ruling is a game-changer. It means your crypto holdings are no longer shielded from creditors. Just as traditional assets can be seized to settle debts, so too can your Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies. Here’s a look at the implications for both debtors and creditors concerning debtor crypto assets : Stakeholder Impact of the Ruling Actionable Insight Debtors Crypto assets are now vulnerable to seizure in debt recovery proceedings. Be mindful of debt obligations and consider the visibility of crypto holdings in legal contexts. Creditors Gains a new avenue for debt recovery, potentially improving recovery rates. Explore crypto assets as part of asset tracing and recovery strategies in legal cases. This shift necessitates a greater awareness among crypto holders about the legal ramifications of their digital assets, especially concerning financial obligations. Court Crypto Seizure : Examples and Future Outlook While this ruling is new, the concept of court crypto seizure isn’t entirely unprecedented globally. Several jurisdictions have already seen instances of courts ordering the seizure of cryptocurrencies in various legal contexts, including criminal cases, tax evasion, and now, debt recovery. Brazil is now joining this growing list, signaling a broader global movement. Examples from other countries include: USA: US authorities have seized vast amounts of cryptocurrency in cases related to illegal activities, demonstrating the feasibility of such seizures. UK: UK courts have also issued orders for the seizure of crypto assets, particularly in fraud and money laundering cases. South Korea: South Korea has been proactive in regulating and seizing crypto assets in tax evasion and criminal investigations. Looking ahead, this Brazilian ruling could set a precedent for other Latin American countries and beyond. As crypto adoption grows, legal systems worldwide will likely continue to adapt and refine their approaches to regulating and, when necessary, seizing digital assets. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Legal Landscape in Brazil Brazil’s decision to authorize the seizure of crypto assets is a watershed moment. It underscores the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream legal and financial systems. While this development brings both opportunities and challenges, one thing is clear: the legal landscape for crypto is evolving rapidly. For crypto holders in Brazil, staying informed and understanding these changes is no longer optional—it’s essential. This ruling serves as a powerful reminder that as digital assets become more mainstream, they are also becoming subject to the same legal frameworks as traditional assets. Embrace this new reality, stay compliant, and navigate the future of crypto in Brazil with knowledge and caution.

The video suggested that Trump’s tariffs would force the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, making stocks more accessible to middle-class Americans. According to several sources, the clip was originally shared by a user named “AmericanPapaBear,” a self-described “Trumper to the end.” It claimed that Buffett had praised the president’s economic policies, stating that Trump was “making the best economic moves he’s seen in 50 years.” Trump is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers. pic.twitter.com/fvThLx82Ev — AmericanPapaBear (@AmericaPapaBear) April 4, 2025 By the end of yesterday, the video had been shared over 2,000 times on Truth Social and nearly 10,000 times on X. However, through a company press statement, Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway quickly disavowed its claims, vehemently denying any endorsement of Trump’s trade policies Berkshire Hathaway denies praising Trump In its press release, Berkshire Hathaway called the video’s assertions “false,” clarifying that Buffett had never endorsed Trump’s economic policies, especially with regard to tariffs. “ There are reports currently circulating on social media regarding comments allegedly made by Warren E. Buffett. All such reports are false ,” the company said. Berkshire Hathaway also explained that Buffett had not commented on the current state of the economy, the stock market, or tariffs and would not do so until the Berkshire Hathaway scheduled annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 3. Buffett himself appeared on CNBC in an interview to set the record straight, asserting that it was important for him to immediately address the misinformation. He told CNBC that he had not spoken to anyone about the economy or tariffs. The 94-year-old CEO seemingly doesn’t want anything to do with Trump’s tariffs, which caused a bloodbath in the stock market in the last two days of this business week. Friday’s US market session close saw the S&P 500 drop by almost 6%, the Nasdaq 5.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average by over 2,200 points. The market lost $6.6 trillion in the two days. Economists believe the tariffs, announced late Wednesday, were more aggressive than many in the business community had anticipated. Investors are now bracing for potential long-term economic pain, including reduced consumer income, a rise in inflation, and a US-based recession. Warren Buffett has always opposed tariffs While Buffett has not directly commented on the tariffs imposed this week, he has been a vocal critic of Trump’s way of handling international trade, calling the US president’s policies “detrimental to global trade and economic growth.” In early March, the billionaire coined the tariffs as “an act of war,” reiterating that they ultimately act as a tax on consumers. “ The tooth fairy doesn’t pay ’em! ” Buffett surmised with a laugh during his interview with CNBC. “ And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, ‘And then what? ’” In 2019, during the POTUS’s first term, Buffett warned that Trump’s aggressive trade policies and a full-scale trade war could negatively impact the global economy. “ If we actually have a trade war, it will be bad for the whole world… everything intersects in the world ,” He advised the administration to consider free trade, arguing that it leads to better outcomes for consumers and businesses alike. Recent market declines haven’t affected Buffett’s personal wealth, as his net worth has climbed by $12 billion year-to-date, reaching a total of $155 billion. His portfolio value growth stands out among the top 10 world most wealthiest individuals, with many of them counting losses by the month. In 2025 alone, Tesla CEO and the biggest loser in the bunch, Elon Musk’s worth, dropped by over $110 billion, while Jeff Bezos has lost $45 billion. Meta head Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune has also fallen by over $25 billion in the same period. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This is due to the high volatility of the first cryptocurrency and the rest of the market. Bitcoin managed to rise from $81,800 to $84,700 on Friday, but collapsed back to its original values after China announced retaliatory duties against the United States. Since the ”liberation day” bitcoin has tried several times to overcome the lost $85,000 level to no avail. During the day, digital gold gradually recovered, but then again reacted with a drawdown to the publication of labor market data in the United States. The subsequent speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell added to the negativity. Despite calling for US President Donald Trump to cut the key rate, Powell limited himself to restrained rhetoric. At the same time, he pointed out that trade tariffs are likely to have a negative impact on inflation. ”Our responsibility is to keep long-term inflation expectations on track and to make sure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become a permanent inflation problem,” the Fed chief emphasized. Bitcoin is trading around $83,000 at the time of writing. Other cryptocurrencies from the top in terms of capitalization show high correlation with the leading asset. In parallel, the digital gold dominance index approached 63% . The index has been increasing since January 2023. Expert Opinions Analyst and founder of MN Trading Michael van de Poppe noted that bitcoin is ”still holding up.” However, he did not rule out a drawdown below $80,000. The analyst Ali Martinez also pointed to the risk of further correction on the back of slowing onchain activity. The opposite opinion was expressed by trader Cass Abber. He found a pattern ”falling wedge”, which indicates a possible rebound of bitcoin. To realize the upward scenario, the asset must overcome the level of $86,500. ”Bitcoin did not hit a new low yesterday, despite the stock market experiencing its worst day in five years.

While traditional equities in the U.S. stock market experienced a massive downturn, shedding trillions in value, the crypto market painted a contrasting picture of resilience and growth. Are we seeing a significant shift in investor sentiment and capital allocation? Let’s delve into the details of this intriguing market divergence. What Sparked the Dramatic Stock Market Losses? The U.S. stock market’s staggering $3.25 trillion loss in a single day sent shockwaves through the financial world. Several factors likely contributed to this dramatic plunge, reflecting broader economic anxieties and investor reactions. Understanding these triggers is crucial to grasp the context of the concurrent crypto market gains . Economic Data Disappointments: Weaker-than-expected economic data releases can fuel fears of a slowdown or recession. This can trigger sell-offs in the stock market as investors anticipate reduced corporate earnings. Inflationary Pressures: Persistent inflation worries can lead to concerns about rising interest rates and their impact on borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. This often negatively impacts stock valuations. Geopolitical Instability: Uncertainty stemming from global events, such as geopolitical tensions or conflicts, can increase market volatility and drive investors towards safer assets, away from equities. Profit Taking and Market Correction: After periods of sustained gains, stock markets are prone to corrections as investors take profits. This can sometimes snowball into larger sell-offs, especially if triggered by negative news. It’s important to note that market corrections are a normal part of the economic cycle. However, the scale of this particular downturn highlights the sensitivity of the current financial markets to economic and global uncertainties. Crypto Market Defies Gravity: A $5.4B Influx In stark contrast to the sea of red in the stock market, the crypto market experienced a notable influx of $5.4 billion in investments on the same day. This surge suggests a potential shift in investor strategy, with some seemingly viewing cryptocurrencies as an alternative or even a safe haven amidst traditional market turmoil. What factors are driving these crypto market gains ? Decentralization Appeal: Cryptocurrencies, being decentralized and operating outside traditional financial systems, can appear attractive during times of economic uncertainty. Investors seeking refuge from traditional market volatility may turn to crypto assets. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Bitcoin, in particular, is often touted as a potential hedge against inflation due to its limited supply. During periods of inflationary concerns, this narrative can gain traction, driving investment into the crypto space. Growing Institutional Adoption: Increased institutional interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies provide a foundation for market growth. Institutional investors bringing in larger capital flows can significantly impact market dynamics. Technological Advancements and Innovation: Ongoing developments in blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other crypto-related innovations continue to attract investors who see long-term potential in the space. The influx of capital into the crypto market gains signals a growing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate asset class and potentially a hedge against traditional market risks. Market Divergence: Stock Market Losses vs. Crypto Market Gains The simultaneous occurrence of significant stock market losses and substantial crypto market gains points towards a fascinating market divergence . This divergence raises several critical questions for investors and market analysts: Key Differences: Stock Market vs. Crypto Market Performance (April 4th) Market Change in Value Key Drivers Investor Sentiment U.S. Stock Market -$3.25 Trillion Economic data, inflation fears, geopolitical risks, profit-taking Cautious, Risk-Off Crypto Market +$5.4 Billion Decentralization appeal, inflation hedge narrative, institutional adoption, innovation Optimistic, Risk-On (within crypto) This table highlights the contrasting fortunes of the two markets on the same day. While the stock market reacted negatively to prevailing economic uncertainties, the crypto market seemed to benefit, potentially as investors sought alternative avenues for capital deployment. Investment Shift: Is Capital Flowing from Stocks to Crypto? The observed market divergence naturally leads to the question: Is there an investment shift underway? Is capital moving away from traditional equities and towards cryptocurrencies? While it’s premature to declare a definitive trend based on a single day’s data, the events of April 4th suggest a potential reallocation of assets. Several factors could be contributing to a potential investment shift : Portfolio Diversification: Investors are increasingly looking to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional assets. Cryptocurrencies offer a different risk-reward profile and can act as a diversifier. Seeking Higher Growth Potential: The crypto market, despite its volatility, is perceived by many as having higher growth potential compared to mature stock markets, especially in the long term. Frustration with Traditional Finance: Some investors may be disillusioned with traditional financial systems and seeking alternatives offered by decentralized technologies and crypto assets. Technological Disruption Theme: Investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is seen by some as investing in the future of finance and technology, aligning with a broader trend of technological disruption. It’s crucial to remember that both the stock market and the crypto market are subject to volatility and risk. Investment decisions should always be based on thorough research, risk assessment, and individual financial goals. Navigating the Evolving Financial Markets Landscape The events of April 4th serve as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and interconnected nature of financial markets . The contrasting performance of the stock market and the crypto market underscores the importance of: Staying Informed: Keeping abreast of economic news, market trends, and developments in both traditional and crypto finance is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Diversification: A well-diversified portfolio across different asset classes can help mitigate risk and potentially enhance returns in the long run. Understanding Risk Tolerance: Investors need to carefully assess their risk tolerance and align their investment strategies accordingly. Both stock and crypto markets carry inherent risks. Long-Term Perspective: Adopting a long-term investment perspective can help navigate short-term market fluctuations and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in both traditional and crypto markets. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Finance? The dramatic market divergence witnessed on April 4th, with stock market losses juxtaposed against crypto market gains , presents a compelling narrative. It suggests a potential shift in investor sentiment and capital allocation, possibly indicating a growing role for cryptocurrencies in the broader financial markets landscape.

Its presale is live at an unbelievably low $0.0000001781 per token—a price that’s a golden ticket, but one that’s slipping away fast as it climbs through 60 stages. This isn’t just another top meme coin riding the Pepe wave—it’s the first cryptocurrency designed as the official payment method for influencers and brands in the influencer economy, a $25 billion titan today, set to explode to $48 billion by 2027. With a 100X surge on the horizon, Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) isn’t just a good meme coin play—it’s the best crypto to buy right now before it reshapes the payment landscape for creators and corporations alike. Don’t wait—jump in before it’s too late! The Powerhouse Behind the Surge INPEPE’s got the numbers to back its bold claim. With a total supply of 380 trillion tokens, its presale allocates 104.5 trillion (27.5%) to early investors at that razor-sharp $0.0000001781 starting price—meaning a modest $100 buy nets you 561 million INPEPE tokens today. A 100X leap to $0.00001781 pushes the market cap to $6.77 billion—a hefty sum that signals massive potential. But the ceiling’s higher: a 200X surge to $0.00003562 hits $13.54 billion, and if INPEPE captures just 10% of the $48 billion influencer economy by 2027 ($4.7 billion in transactions), you’re looking at $0.00005—a 280X rocket to a $19 billion market cap, making it the best cryptos to buy. Staking at an eye-popping 1200% APY also locks up supply, potentially slashing circulation as holders pile in for massive returns, while 20% (76 trillion INPEPE) is dedicated to marketing and partnerships—fueling a relentless push with influencers and brands. INPEPE: The Official Payment Game-Changer What sets INPEPE apart? It’s the first crypto tailored for the $25 billion influencer economy, growing to $48 billion by 2027, and it’s stepping up as the official payment method for influencers and brands. Picture this: X creators cashing in INPEPE for live stream tips, TikTok stars selling branded merchandise for tokens, or Instagram influencers sealing six-figure brand deals with INPEPE payments—all seamless, instant, and borderless. No more PayPal fees or bank delays—INPEPE’s cutting the fat and delivering value straight to creators and companies. With 15% of the supply (57 trillion INPEPE) reserved for liquidity pools to keep trading smooth and 10% (38 trillion) for development to build Web3 integrations—like brand-sponsored NFT drops or tipping platforms—INPEPE’s got the infrastructure to make it stick. The 100X Surge Blueprint That Makes Influencer Pepe the Best Crypto To Buy Let’s break it down: that $100 presale buy at $0.0000001781 turns into $10,000 at 100X ($0.00001781)—a windfall by late 2025 if the Q3/Q4 launch ignites as expected. This places INPEPE as a top crypto presale token. Push it to 200X ($0.00003562), and it’s $20,000; at 280X ($0.00005), you’re pocketing $28,000—all from a $100 bet today. This potential growth reveals why INPEPE is one of the best cryptos to buy. The $48 billion influencer economy by 2027 is the rocket fuel—INPEPE could power millions of transactions, from micro-tips (think $0.0000001781 per like scaling across millions of fans) to major brand campaigns. Act Now—Don’t Let 100X Slip Away Time’s running out—INPEPE’s presale is live, and $0.0000001781 is fading with every stage pushing prices higher. The $48 billion influencer economy needs an official payment method—INPEPE’s claiming the role, and influencers and brands are ready to make it happen. The presale widget is your entry—ETH, BNB, USDT, or card, your choice—but the clock’s ticking. Don’t watch this surge from the sidelines—hit it now and lock in your 100X potential before it’s too late. INPEPE’s the best crypto to buy—grab it and own the payment future for influencers and brands! Buy INPEPE for potential 100X gains.

In a recent X post, the author has labeled Bitcoin, among others, as a potential solution amid soaring concerns over a potential market crash. Besides, he also warned about an incoming recession, which might further weigh on the broader market sentiment. Robert Kiyosaki Labels Bitcoin As a Safe Haven In a recent X post, Robert Kiyosaki reiterated his prediction from his book Rich Dad’s Prophecy. He stated that the biggest stock “market crash in history” has already begun. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author emphasized that Baby Boomers, in particular, may not have time left to recover from traditional investments. In addition, he noted that the financial future of millions, especially those nearing retirement, is under threat. Traditional assets like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs, he warned, may no longer be viable. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author advised the traders to shift focus toward what he calls “real money.” According to him, investors should avoid relying solely on Wall Street. He recommends assets like physical gold, silver, and Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and the ongoing dollar debasement. These assets, he believes, could rise as the value of fiat currency declines due to aggressive money printing by the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, Robert Kiyosaki emphasized that the prices of these assets do not necessarily rise on their own. Instead, it’s the purchasing power of the dollar that’s dropping, making everything from food to energy more expensive. “You may want to save real money which are gold, silver, and Bitcoin,” he suggested. Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Recession Ahead Apart from calling Bitcoin, gold, and silver a safer haven, he also addressed the current market situation. He noted that the US has not just slipped into a recession but may already be entering a depression. He said that the current downturn could expose millions of investors to significant losses if they continue relying on fiat-based paper assets. His message was particularly directed at older generations who are running out of runways to recover losses. Instead of traditional long-term strategies, he suggests immediate action through alternative assets like Bitcoin, gold, or silver accumulation. Silver Likely To Outpace Bitcoin & Gold Robert Kiyosaki has repeatedly voiced his concern against fiat currency. He claims central banks and the government steal wealth through inflation, driven by excessive money printing. As fiat currencies lose value, Kiyosaki predicts a strong rise in real assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. However, while bullish on Bitcoin, Kiyosaki recently said silver might outperform both Bitcoin and gold . He cited silver’s industrial demand and limited supply as key drivers for future price growth. Meanwhile, BTC price today was down around 1% and exchanged hands at $83,801, while its one-day volume rose 8% to $39 billion. Notably, the recent dip in the financial market comes after the recent US Job data showed that the labor market is resilient and remained strong despite the higher rates.

In the past 24 hours, we’ve witnessed a significant wave of liquidations across major cryptocurrencies. Let’s dive into the crucial details of this crypto liquidation event, specifically focusing on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), to understand where the market winds are blowing. What Exactly is Crypto Liquidation in Perpetual Futures? Before we delve into the specifics, it’s essential to understand what crypto liquidation in perpetual futures actually means. In simple terms, when you trade perpetual futures with leverage, you’re borrowing funds to amplify your potential gains (and losses). A liquidation occurs when the market moves against your position to the point where your margin balance can no longer support your losses. At this point, the exchange automatically closes your position to prevent further losses. This can happen rapidly, especially in the volatile crypto market. Perpetual futures contracts are popular in the crypto space because they allow traders to bet on the future price of an asset without an expiration date, unlike traditional futures. However, this also means they carry a higher risk of liquidation if not managed carefully. The 24-Hour Crypto Liquidation Breakdown: A Closer Look Over the last 24 hours, the crypto market has seen a substantial amount of liquidations. Let’s break down the numbers for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana: Cryptocurrency Liquidation Amount (USD) Long/Short Percentage BTC $91.89 million Long 50.78% ETH $44.21 million Short 53.35% SOL $18.16 million Short 57.69% As you can see from the table, Bitcoin experienced the largest total crypto liquidation amount at $91.89 million. Interestingly, a slight majority of these liquidations were from long positions (50.78%). This suggests that a downward price movement in Bitcoin caught many traders who were betting on price increases off guard. Ethereum and Solana, while experiencing lower total liquidation amounts, saw a different trend. For both ETH and SOL, short positions were liquidated more significantly (53.35% and 57.69% respectively). This indicates that upward price movements in ETH and SOL triggered liquidations for traders who were anticipating price declines. Why Did This Crypto Liquidation Event Happen? Several factors could contribute to these perpetual futures liquidations. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and even minor price fluctuations can trigger cascading liquidations, especially when high leverage is involved. Here are a few potential reasons: Market Volatility: Sudden price swings are common in the crypto market. News events, regulatory announcements, or even large whale transactions can trigger rapid price changes, leading to liquidations. Leverage Levels: High leverage trading amplifies both gains and losses. While it can increase potential profits, it also dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. Many exchanges offer very high leverage, which can be tempting but also dangerous for inexperienced traders. Market Sentiment Shifts: Changes in overall market sentiment can quickly shift the price direction. If market sentiment turns bearish, for example, traders holding long positions might face liquidation as prices drop. Conversely, bullish shifts can liquidate short positions. Cascading Effects: Liquidations themselves can trigger further liquidations. As large positions are forcefully closed, they can exacerbate price movements, leading to a domino effect of liquidations across the market. BTC Liquidation: Longs Feeling the Pain? The significant BTC liquidation volume, primarily in long positions, suggests that Bitcoin may have experienced a downward price correction in the past 24 hours. Traders who were overly optimistic about Bitcoin’s short-term price movement and entered long positions with high leverage might have been caught out by this price dip. It serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with leveraged trading, especially in a volatile asset like Bitcoin. ETH and SOL Liquidation: Shorts Squeezed? On the other hand, the higher percentage of short liquidations in ETH liquidation and SOL liquidation suggests that both Ethereum and Solana may have seen some upward price pressure. Traders who were betting against ETH and SOL by opening short positions might have been squeezed as prices rose, leading to their positions being liquidated. This highlights the importance of carefully analyzing market trends and momentum before taking a position, whether long or short. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Perils of Crypto Perpetual Futures What can traders learn from this 24-hour crypto liquidation breakdown? Here are some actionable insights: Manage Your Leverage Wisely: High leverage is a double-edged sword. While it can amplify gains, it also magnifies losses and significantly increases liquidation risk. Consider using lower leverage, especially if you are new to perpetual futures trading. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Stop-loss orders are crucial risk management tools. They automatically close your position if the price reaches a predefined level, limiting your potential losses and preventing unexpected liquidations. Stay Informed and Monitor the Market: Keep abreast of market news, trends, and potential volatility triggers. Regularly monitor your positions and be prepared to adjust your strategy if market conditions change. Understand Market Sentiment: Gauging overall market sentiment can provide valuable clues about potential price movements. Pay attention to indicators of bullish or bearish sentiment and adjust your trading accordingly. Diversify Your Trading Strategies: Don’t rely solely on high-leverage perpetual futures trading. Explore other trading strategies and asset classes to diversify your risk. Conclusion: The Unpredictable Nature of Crypto Markets The latest 24-hour crypto liquidation data serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and volatility within the cryptocurrency market. While perpetual futures offer exciting opportunities for profit, they also demand careful risk management and a deep understanding of market dynamics. By learning from these events and adopting prudent trading strategies, you can navigate the crypto markets more effectively and minimize the chances of unexpected liquidations. Staying informed, managing risk, and understanding market sentiment are your best defenses in the ever-evolving world of crypto trading.

The interest in digital assets is soaring as the stock market turmoil intensifies with the recent advancement in U.S. tariffs. Although not all are booming with gains, some showed great signs of recovery. Here’s what to buy right now. Stock Market Loses $3.25M Today; Consider This Crypto to Buy The recent Liberation Day resulted in the stock market crash . Santiments report claims the investors are in the worst trading days, where the market is down nearly 5%. Although the impact was also in the crypto market as Bitcoin’s price crashed to $82k, it settled soon. Today, the cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant capital flow with the recovery of digital assets, and analysts anticipated further with the Fed’s rate cut decision . Interestingly, amid millions of cryptos, XRP is the best crypto to buy right now. Although its regulatory issues remained maintained, its growing adoption, clarity on SEC vs Ripple, blockchain development, and other technical factors hint at a bullish recovery. Recently, Coinbase filed for the XRP future , influencing the Ripple token’s early recovery in the market. In addition, the US Senate Banking Committee has nominated the crypto-friendly candidate Paul Atkins for the SEC Chair, influencing investors’ sentiments. With that, it currently trades at $2.13 after a 1.5% surge today and a market capitalization of $124.05B. However, the market’s uncertainties persist, so even the best crypto picks may feel turbulence. Can XRP Price Hit New ATH Amid Crypto Market Recovery? XRP has been the choice of many top experts in crypto to buy for years. However, ever since its 2024 end rally, the anticipation has increased with the token, especially if Atkins becomes the SEC Chair. Amid these odds, the altcoin is on an exciting juncture , as the charts show the formation of the ascending broadening wedge, which could result either in the XRP price rally to new ATH or a crash. However, the crypto analyst Egrag crypto reveals there’s a certain set of rules from the Ripple token to attain the ATH, more importantly, the $17.50 milestone. If the crypto to buy token closed above $3.50, hits the $5 but not close above it, retest $1.9 and do another attempt to close above $5 before hitting $6, then the XRP can hit $17.50 in the next 2-3 weeks. However, if this does not happen, there is a higher chance that the XRP price could crash to $0.65. This is because EGRAG’s prediction states a 70% probability of the decline and only 30% probability of the breakout. Despite the risk, investors can consider this altcoin to buy while the stock market downtrend persists.

Shiba Inu’s recent 15% surge signals bullish momentum, while Cardano’s institutional backing fuels predictions of an 800% rally. However, Mutuum Finance’s presale performance is stealing attention, with Phase 4 progressing rapidly and early buyers positioned for a 140% return at launch. As Dogecoin struggles to match these dynamics, these three tokens are shaping narratives around affordability, utility, and explosive growth potential. Shiba Inu Riding Technical Momentum Shiba Inu is gaining momentum after breaking out of a descending channel, a move analysts say could trigger a 415% surge to $0.000081. The token’s 15% single-day jump recently outperformed Bitcoin, reflecting renewed investor confidence. On-chain data reveals over $2.57 billion in SHIB holdings are now profitable, suggesting accumulation by strategic buyers. A developing cup-and-handle pattern further hints at a 1,200% rally to $0.0001833 if key resistance levels crumble. While Dogecoin’s gains remain tethered to social media trends, Shiba Inu’s technical foundations and expanding use cases position it as a more calculated bet for 2025. Cardano’s Institutional Endorsement Sparks Optimism Cardano is drawing institutional interest after being included in U.S. digital asset reserves, a move experts claim could propel its price to $5. Currently trading at $0.62, ADA requires an 800% climb to meet this target—a steep but plausible trajectory given its history of hitting $3.09 in 2021. Analyst Alex Becker attributes this optimism to Cardano’s upgrades and partnerships, which are streamlining its blockchain for enterprise adoption. Unlike Dogecoin, which lacks developmental roadmaps, Cardano’s methodical approach and regulatory alignment offer stability in a volatile market. With Trump-era policies favoring compliant projects, ADA’s blend of innovation and political tailwinds could redefine its 2025 prospects. Mutuum Finance Presale Demand Highlights Strategic Advantage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is witnessing unprecedented presale demand, with Phase 4 advancing swiftly at $0.025 per token. Over 7,900 holders have joined since the presale began, contributing to a $6.3 million raise. The project’s tokenomics guarantee a 20% price hike to $0.03 in Phase 5, offering current investors immediate gains before the listing price settles at $0.06—a 140% leap from today’s entry point. Post-launch projections suggest a climb between $1 and $5, fueled by Mutuum Finance’s revenue-driven buyback system and decentralized lending utilities. The platform’s mtTokens—interest-bearing assets representing user deposits—create passive income streams while maintaining liquidity. A peer-to-peer lending feature for meme coins like SHIB and DOGE further diversifies its appeal. Security remains a priority, with a Certik audit nearing completion; results will soon be shared across Mutuum Finance’s social channels. Timing the Market Shift As Dogecoin grapples with speculative volatility, Shiba Inu, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance are leveraging technical milestones, regulatory alignment, and DeFi innovation to carve sustainable paths. Mutuum Finance’s presale structure—particularly the 20% inter-phase ROI—provides a rare low-risk entry ahead of projected triple-digit gains. With Phase 4 selling fast, the window for securing tokens at $0.025 is narrowing. Mutuum Finance’s roadmap emphasizes transparency and utility, distancing it from meme-driven hype. Early participants not only secure instant returns as the presale advances but also position themselves for a potential 2,400% post-listing surge. For investors targeting 2025’s breakout stars, this trifecta of affordability, innovation, and calculated growth offers a strategic edge over fading trends. Act Before Phase 5 Begins The crypto market rewards early movers, and Mutuum Finance’s trajectory underscores this truth. With Phase 4 underway and a 20% price increase imminent, delaying risks missing the lowest available entry. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official channels to join the presale and capitalize on a project built for long-term demand—not fleeting speculation.

Evidence Filed, But SEC Expert Calls It “Spam”",https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-lawsuit-could-this-odd-filing-change-everything-ex-sec-lawyer-weighs-in/,"The post New Twist in XRP Lawsuit? Evidence Filed, But SEC Expert Calls It “Spam” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP lawsuit has been full of unexpected twists, keeping the crypto world on its toes. Just when things seemed to be settling, a surprise filing has sparked fresh debate—and confusion. Someone has stepped in, claiming to have “decisive evidence” that could support Ripple’s case. But is it the game-changer it sounds like, or just noise? Here’s what actually happened—and why it may not matter as much as it seems. Will Judge Torres Change The Verdict? Despite the sudden buzz, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel has made it clear that the court’s ruling is unlikely to change. He stated that Judge Analisa Torres’ earlier decision on XRP will not be reversed. His comments come as many people in the crypto world are still trying to figure out whether this new filing could lead to a major shift in the case. Judge Torres will not be asked to, nor will she, ""revoke"" her ruling on liability. The parties will be seeking to modify the remedies. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) April 4, 2025 According to Fagel, the case has moved past the question of whether XRP is a security. Now, the focus is on what penalties and remedies should be applied. That means the main ruling is expected to remain the same, even though the legal process isn’t completely over. This has helped settle some of the speculation and suggests that both sides are now working on final steps rather than challenging past decisions. The Mysterious Filing That Got Everyone Talking Adding more drama to the case, a man named Justin W. Keener recently submitted a filing to the court. He claimed to have “decisive evidence” that could help Ripple and benefit American citizens. However, he didn’t include any actual details about this evidence. The filing quickly became a topic of discussion, with some wondering if it could change the direction of the lawsuit. But Marc Fagel dismissed it entirely. He called the filing “spam” and explained that Keener has no legal role in the case, meaning the court is unlikely to even consider it. Impact On XRP Price Even without any major legal changes, the news that the lawsuit is moving toward its conclusion has had a positive effect on XRP’s price. It recently jumped nearly 5% , reaching around $2.15. Right now, XRP is trying to stay above the key $2 support level. If it holds, the price could rise to the $2.50–$3.00 range. But if it falls below $2, there’s a risk it could drop further to around $1.20. Although the lawsuit still has some steps left, it seems unlikely there will be any major surprises—despite unusual filings like Keener’s. With the core ruling likely to stay in place and both parties focusing on final penalties, the end of the case appears to be getting closer.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 11:00:28

The ever-watchful eyes of the blockchain have spotted something rather intriguing. A crypto whale, dormant for two whole months, has suddenly sprung back to life and made a significant move that has the Solana (SOL) community buzzing. This isn’t just pocket change we’re talking about – we’re diving into a massive $4.96 million worth of SOL that just landed on Binance. Let’s unpack this developing story and see what ripples this whale deposit could create in the crypto sea. What Does a $4.96M Whale Deposit Mean for SOL? When we talk about ‘whales’ in the crypto world, we’re referring to those big players, the entities holding substantial amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Their movements can sometimes act as a market signal , offering clues about potential price shifts or broader market sentiment. This particular whale address, after a two-month period of inactivity, decided to unstake and transfer a hefty 40,790 SOL tokens – valued at a cool $4.96 million – to the popular crypto exchange , Binance. Here’s a quick breakdown of what we know: The Whale’s Wake-Up Call: After two months of dormancy, this address became active again. Dormancy in whale addresses often piques interest as it precedes significant transactions. Massive SOL Movement: A whopping 40,790 SOL tokens were unstaked and then deposited. This is a substantial amount, especially when concentrated in a single transaction. Destination Binance: The tokens were sent to Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Exchange deposits are often interpreted as a precursor to selling. Timing is Everything: This activity was spotted just three hours ago by on-chain analyst Onchain Lens, making this a fresh, developing story. To put this into perspective, consider the sheer volume. $4.96 million isn’t just a number; it represents a significant stake in the SOL market. When such large amounts are moved, it naturally raises questions. Is this whale preparing to sell off their holdings? Or is there another strategy at play? Solana’s Price Reaction: Will SOL Feel the Pressure? The immediate question on everyone’s mind is: what does this mean for Solana ( SOL ) price? Typically, when large deposits are made to exchanges, the crypto community often anticipates a potential sell-off. Why? Because depositing assets onto an exchange is a necessary step before they can be traded for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency. However, it’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. Here’s a balanced view: Scenario Potential Impact on SOL Price Sell-Off Intent: Whale deposits with the intention to sell a large portion of their SOL . Could exert downward pressure on the price of SOL due to increased supply in the market. The extent of the pressure depends on the market’s absorption capacity and overall sentiment. Strategic Repositioning: Whale moving SOL to Binance for reasons other than immediate selling, such as accessing specific trading pairs, participating in new offerings on the exchange, or preparing for future trading strategies. Minimal to no immediate negative impact. Could even be seen as a sign of confidence in exchange liquidity and future opportunities. Market Manipulation (Less Likely but Possible): In rare cases, large deposits could be part of more complex trading strategies, potentially including attempts to influence market prices. Unpredictable short-term volatility. Regulatory scrutiny makes blatant manipulation increasingly risky. Currently, the market’s reaction to this whale deposit is still unfolding. Savvy traders and investors will be closely monitoring SOL price charts and order books to detect any immediate selling pressure. It’s also important to remember that the broader crypto market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price action can significantly influence SOL , regardless of individual whale activities. Why Binance? Exploring the Exchange Choice The choice of Binance as the destination crypto exchange for this substantial SOL deposit is noteworthy. Binance is not just any exchange; it’s the world’s largest by trading volume, boasting deep liquidity and a vast array of trading pairs. For a whale looking to move large amounts of cryptocurrency, Binance offers several advantages: High Liquidity: Binance’s massive trading volume ensures that large sell orders can be executed with minimal slippage, meaning whales can sell significant amounts without drastically impacting the price. Variety of Trading Pairs: Binance offers numerous trading pairs for SOL , including pairings with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and stablecoins like USDT and BUSD. This provides flexibility for whales to diversify or convert their holdings as desired. Institutional Services: Binance provides services tailored to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, including OTC (Over-the-Counter) trading desks, which facilitate large-volume trades outside of the open market, potentially minimizing market impact. Global Reach and Accessibility: Binance’s global presence and accessibility make it a convenient choice for whales operating internationally. Therefore, depositing SOL to Binance suggests a strategic move towards leveraging the exchange’s robust infrastructure and market depth, regardless of the ultimate intent – whether it’s selling, trading, or repositioning assets. Crypto Exchange Deposits: Sell Signal or Strategic Move? While the common interpretation of deposits to a crypto exchange leans towards a potential intent to sell, it’s crucial to understand that this isn’t always the case. The crypto market is complex, and whale actions can be driven by various factors. Here are some alternative reasons why a whale might deposit SOL into Binance: Trading Opportunities: Whales might deposit funds to take advantage of specific trading opportunities on the exchange, such as arbitrage, margin trading, or participating in newly listed token sales. Staking or Lending: While this whale unstaked before depositing, other whales might move assets to exchanges to access specific staking or lending programs offered on the platform, although this is less likely for such a large deposit intended for an exchange like Binance, known more for trading. Custodial Convenience: Exchanges offer custodial services, which can be appealing for whales seeking secure and readily accessible storage for their digital assets, although hardware wallets are typically preferred for long-term cold storage. Preparation for Swaps: The whale might intend to swap SOL for other cryptocurrencies. Binance offers a wide range of crypto pairs, making it a convenient platform for portfolio diversification. OTC Trading: As mentioned earlier, whales might deposit to facilitate over-the-counter (OTC) trades, which are private, large-volume trades conducted directly between parties, often facilitated by the exchange. It’s important not to immediately equate a crypto exchange deposit with a guaranteed sell-off. Analyzing additional on-chain data, market conditions, and the whale’s past behavior can provide a more nuanced understanding of their intentions. Decoding the Market Signal: What Can We Learn from This Whale’s Move? So, what actionable insights can we glean from this market signal ? While the exact intentions of the whale remain shrouded in mystery for now, this event serves as a potent reminder of the influence large holders can have on the crypto market, particularly for assets like SOL . Here are some key takeaways and actionable steps: Monitor Price Action: Keep a close eye on Solana’s ( SOL ) price movements in the coming hours and days. Increased selling volume or downward price pressure could indicate that the whale’s deposit is indeed leading to a sell-off. Track On-Chain Data: Continue to monitor on-chain analytics platforms for further movements from this whale address and other significant SOL holders. Tracking wallet activity can provide additional clues. Assess Market Sentiment: Gauge the overall market sentiment towards SOL and the broader crypto market. External factors, such as Bitcoin’s performance and macroeconomic news, will also play a role. Stay Informed, Not Fearful: Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on this single whale transaction. Use this event as an opportunity to learn more about market dynamics and risk management in crypto trading. In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, information is power. Whale movements, like this $4.96M SOL deposit , are significant data points that can offer valuable insights into market trends and potential future price actions. By staying informed, analyzing data, and maintaining a balanced perspective, you can navigate the crypto markets with greater confidence. This whale’s move is a developing story, and the crypto community will be watching closely to see what unfolds next. Will this deposit translate into selling pressure for SOL , or is there another strategic play in motion? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the crypto seas are never dull.

With global financial conditions growing increasingly fragile, volatility continues to dominate across risk assets. Geopolitical tensions and sweeping tariffs imposed by world leaders — including recent moves by US President Donald Trump — have only added to the uncertainty, shaking investor confidence and stalling bullish momentum in crypto. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Buy the Dip – Over 130K ETH Added In A Single Day Amid this backdrop, Chainlink has struggled to reclaim higher ground, instead consolidating around a key support zone. According to on-chain data, LINK’s most critical demand wall sits at $6.26. This concentration of buying interest marks a potentially strong support area that bulls must defend to avoid a deeper correction. As markets react to shifting macroeconomic signals, Chainlink’s ability to hold this demand zone could determine its next move. If this level fails, additional downside may follow. But if it holds, it could serve as the base for a potential rebound once sentiment improves. For now, all eyes remain on LINK’s price action as it tests one of the most important accumulation zones on its chart. Chainlink Consolidates As Next Demand Level Lies Below Despite broader market uncertainty, Chainlink remains one of the most prominent players in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization narrative — a sector expected to see substantial growth in the coming years. As traditional finance continues exploring blockchain infrastructure, Chainlink’s oracle technology and decentralized data feeds remain essential to bridging off-chain assets with on-chain applications. However, in the short term, LINK’s price action has mirrored the broader crypto market downturn. Chainlink is down 17% since March 26, with current price action showing continued uncertainty. LINK is consolidating just above a key demand level, and although bulls have struggled to regain momentum, some analysts believe the worst may be behind. Fears of ongoing selling pressure persist, but overall market conditions suggest that the sharpest drawdowns could be over. Supporting this view, Ali Martinez shared on-chain data revealing that the most critical demand wall for Chainlink sits at $6.26, where nearly 90,000 investors accumulated approximately 376 million LINK tokens. This strong accumulation zone may provide the foundation needed for price stabilization and a potential reversal, especially if broader market sentiment begins to recover. While analysts still warn of a possible deeper correction, the fading intensity of selling and the presence of strong support indicate growing resilience. Chainlink’s long-term fundamentals, particularly its leadership in the RWA space, continue to attract attention — even during times of market stress. If the $6.26 level holds, LINK could be well-positioned for a rebound once bullish momentum returns across the crypto landscape.

LINK Holds Solid Ground As Bulls Eye Recovery Confirmation Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $12.8 after enduring several days of heavy selling pressure. Despite the recent downside, bulls have managed to defend the crucial $12.3 support level, which has so far acted as a solid demand zone. This hold is a key short-term victory, but the broader trend remains fragile as LINK struggles to regain upward momentum. To confirm a potential recovery rally, bulls must push LINK above the $14.6 level — a critical resistance zone that aligns with both the 4-hour 200-day moving average (MA) and the exponential moving average (EMA). A decisive breakout above this area would signal renewed strength and potentially attract more buyers back into the market.

If LINK loses its grip on the $12.3 demand zone, the next logical support could lie near the $10 mark, a psychological level that hasn’t been tested since early Q4 2023. With the broader crypto market still under pressure and sentiment cautious, LINK remains at a crossroads. The coming days will be pivotal as bulls attempt to reclaim momentum and avoid slipping deeper into correction territory.

The worst-case scenario, though, sees the asset dropping to $1.3. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView The renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has outlined multiple times the importance of the $2 support for XRP’s future price movements. The asset tested it on a couple of occasions in the past month, dipping below it twice since March 11. However, it ultimately withstood the pressure and helped XRP remain among the top performers since the US elections in early November. Moreover, Ripple’s token bounced off quite impressively after the March 11 crash and shot up to $2.6 within the next week. That price surge transpired after Brad Garlinghouse, the company’s CEO, announced that the lawsuit against the SEC had effectively ended. Since then, though, XPR has failed to recapture its momentum and slipped below $2 earlier this week, charting a 24% decline amid the escalating Trade War. As mentioned above, the $2 support remained strong, and XRP now trades at $2.15. Martinez believes holding that level could serve as a propeller for the next leg up, which could push its price north by 30%.

On the technical front, XRP is trading at $2.15, up 4.37% on the day, with a market cap of $125.25 billion. The 4-hour chart shows a confirmed breakout from a descending parallel channel. Price has reclaimed the 50-period EMA at $2.14, now acting as dynamic support. Momentum indicators are constructive. RSI at 55 signals growing bullish strength without breaching overbought levels. A sustained move above $2.15 could trigger a rally toward $2.23, followed by $2.31. On the downside, initial support is seen at $2.02, with stronger demand expected around $1.96. Breakout above descending channel confirmed. Key resistance levels: $2.23, $2.31 Support levels: $2.02, $1.96 If XRP holds above the 50-EMA, bullish momentum could extend toward $2.58.

On Saturday, the Federal Minister of Labour and Economy of Austria, Wolfgang Hattmannsdorfer, emphasized that a totally different framework should be used to assess the Mercosur agreement . He also mentioned that they urgently required this agreement. Austria views the EU-Mercosur trade deal as a remedy to regain economic stability Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay are the five full members of Mercosur, a regional economic market created in 1991. Venezuela has been denied full membership since 2016. Additionally, associate members include seven additional South and Central American nations. Hattmannsdorfer has shown Austria’s interest in the EU-Mercosur trade agreement. To illustrate this, Hattmannsdorfer pressed the European Commission to draft a final agreement and ratification procedure for the free-trade agreement signed in December to create an integrated market of 780 million consumers in Europe and Latin America. However, based on sources, after 20 years of negotiations, there is now one less European country opposing the agreement. Some European nations, such as France and Poland, have stated that they will not accept it because of its possible effects on farmers. Based on the argument of 45-year-old Hattmannsdorfer, who started his job in March, stated that it made sense that there were objections to the initial agreement. He, however, highlighted that the benefits and prospects for Austria as an exporter will exceed these concerns. Europe and Austria’s governments have actively worked to mitigate the impact of Trump’s policies The EU-Mercosur trade agreement demonstrates how Trump’s attacks on the international economic system are forcing countries to quickly change their trading patterns and adopt new ones even though they did not prefer them previously. For instance, some countries have established new trade partnerships and are looking for export markets that might no longer be accessible to the U.S. On Monday, EU trade ministers are scheduled to meet to talk about the U.S. measures. In addition to promising an appropriate response, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that the EU would rather avoid conflict and work out a negotiated solution in the upcoming weeks. Moreover, in addition to reducing a budget deficit and supporting an industrial sector damaged due to the impacts of the set tariffs and high energy prices, Austria’s government is trying to lift the country out of what is expected to be a third year of recession. It is worth noting that, in light of the far-right Freedom Party’s growing popularity, Hattmannsdorfer’s remarks are all the more noteworthy because they come from a conservative People’s Party-appointed minister who has strong ties to rural Austria and has been cautious about hurting farmers. Austria’s shift toward supporting the EU-Mercosur trade agreement reflects the growing pressure of global trade dynamics, exacerbated by Trump’s tariffs .

42941202,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146680,1743851438,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Surprising $2.1M Inflow Ignites Hope in US Spot Ethereum ETFs,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/spot-ethereum-etf-inflow-surprise/,"Just when market sentiments were leaning towards caution, a spark of optimism ignited the U.S. spot Ethereum ETF landscape. After three consecutive days of net outflows, April 4th witnessed a surprising turnaround. Financial data from Farside Investors reveals a total net inflow of $2.1 million into these investment vehicles. But what does this mean for the future of Ethereum and the broader crypto market? Let’s dive into the details. What Sparked the $2.1M Inflow into Spot Ethereum ETFs? The crypto world is known for its volatility and rapid shifts in momentum. After a period of net outflows from Spot Ethereum ETFs , the sudden $2.1 million inflow raises eyebrows and prompts questions. Was this a sign of renewed investor confidence? Or just a temporary blip? Interestingly, the data points to a concentrated source of this inflow. Here’s a breakdown of what happened on April 4th: Total Net Inflow: $2.1 million Driving Force: Franklin Templeton’s EZET ETF was the sole contributor, registering a $2.1 million inflow. Rest of the Pack: All other U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs reported no change in holdings on the same day. This paints a picture of a very specific event rather than a broad market trend. While any inflow is positive news after outflows, the fact that it was solely attributed to one ETF, Franklin Templeton’s EZET, suggests a unique factor at play. Perhaps a large institutional investor allocated funds specifically to EZET, or maybe it was a strategic portfolio rebalancing. Why is the Focus on Spot Ethereum ETFs Important? The emergence of Spot Ethereum ETFs is a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. Unlike futures-based ETFs, spot ETFs directly hold Ether, the underlying cryptocurrency. This distinction is crucial because: Direct Exposure: Spot ETFs offer investors direct exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without the complexities of managing digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. Accessibility: They make Ethereum investment accessible to a broader range of investors, including institutional players and retail investors who prefer traditional investment vehicles. Legitimacy: The approval and launch of spot ETFs by regulatory bodies like the SEC in the U.S. adds a layer of legitimacy and maturity to the crypto market. What are the Potential Benefits of ETF Inflows? Positive ETF inflows , even if concentrated like the recent $2.1 million, can have several beneficial effects on the Ethereum market and investor sentiment: Price Support: Increased demand through ETF inflows can provide buying pressure for Ethereum, potentially supporting or driving up its price. Market Confidence: Inflows signal growing investor confidence in Ethereum as an asset class, which can attract further investment. Liquidity Boost: Higher ETF trading volumes and asset under management (AUM) can improve market liquidity for Ethereum. Mainstream Adoption: Consistent inflows can be seen as a sign of increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies through regulated and familiar investment products. Are There Challenges for Continued ETF Inflows? While the $2.1 million inflow is encouraging, the path to sustained and significant ETF inflows isn’t without its hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Any negative regulatory developments could dampen investor enthusiasm and impact inflows. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can deter some investors, leading to potential outflows during downturns. Competition: Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been available for longer and have garnered significant inflows. Ethereum ETFs need to demonstrate their own value proposition to attract comparable investment. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rates, and inflation can influence investor risk appetite and impact investment decisions across all asset classes, including crypto ETFs. Examples of ETF Impact on Crypto Markets Looking at the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. provides valuable insights. Their debut in January 2024 was met with considerable excitement and substantial inflows. This event demonstrably impacted the Bitcoin price and overall market sentiment. While Ethereum Investment via ETFs is still in its early stages, the Bitcoin ETF experience highlights the potential for these products to influence crypto markets. Consider these points from the Bitcoin ETF launch: Factor Bitcoin ETF Launch Impact Price of Bitcoin Significant price appreciation observed post-launch. Market Sentiment Boosted overall positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies. Institutional Interest Increased institutional participation in the crypto space. Mainstream Awareness Enhanced mainstream awareness and understanding of Bitcoin. While Ethereum’s trajectory may differ, the Bitcoin example underscores the potential transformative effect of spot crypto ETFs. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors take away from this recent ETF inflows news? Monitor ETF Flows: Keep an eye on daily and weekly inflow/outflow data for spot Ethereum ETFs. This can provide insights into investor sentiment and potential market direction. Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider Ethereum ETFs as part of a diversified crypto investment strategy, alongside holding ETH directly and exploring other crypto assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, and news related to Ethereum and the broader crypto market. Manage Risk: Understand the risks associated with crypto investments, including volatility, and invest according to your risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or a False Dawn? The $2.1 million net inflow into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on April 4th is undoubtedly a positive sign, especially after a period of outflows. Whether this single day represents a sustained trend reversal or just a temporary anomaly remains to be seen. The fact that Franklin Templeton’s EZET was the sole recipient highlights the need for further observation to determine if broader market confidence is returning to Ethereum Investment through ETFs. For now, it’s a glimmer of hope in the evolving story of spot Ethereum ETFs, reminding us that in the crypto world, things can change in a heartbeat. Keep watching the flows, stay informed, and navigate the market with cautious optimism.

The identity of Nakamoto remains one of the biggest mysteries in crypto, with speculation ranging from cryptographers like Adam Back and Nick Szabo to broader theories involving government intelligence agencies. While Nakamoto’s identity remains anonymous, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) creator is believed to have turned 50 on April 5 based on details shared in the past. According to archived data from his P2P Foundation profile, Nakamoto once claimed to be a 37-year-old man living in Japan and listed his birthdate as April 5, 1975. Source: Web.archive.org Nakamoto’s anonymity has played a vital role in maintaining the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network, which has no central authority or leadership. The Bitcoin wallet associated with Nakamoto, which holds over 1 million BTC, has laid dormant for more than 16 years despite BTC rising from $0 to an all-time high above $109,000 in January. Satoshi Nakamoto statue in Lugano, Switzerland. Source: Cointelegraph Nakamoto’s 50th birthday comes nearly a month after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, marking the first major step toward integrating Bitcoin into the US financial system . Related: Bitcoin at 16: From experiment to trillion-dollar asset Nakamoto’s legacy: a “cornerstone of economic sovereignty” “ At 50, Nakamoto’s legacy is no longer just code; it’s a cornerstone of economic sovereignty,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert. “Bitcoin’s reserve status signals trust in its scarcity and resilience,” Lian told Cointelegraph, adding: “What’s fascinating is the timing. Fifty feels symbolic — half a century of life, mirrored by Bitcoin’s journey from a white paper to a trillion-dollar asset. Nakamoto’s vision of trustless, peer-to-peer money has outgrown its cypherpunk roots, entering the halls of power.” However, lingering questions about Nakamoto remain unanswered, including whether they still hold the keys to their wallet, which is “a fortune now tied to US policy,” Lian said. Related: Bitcoin’s next catalyst: End of $36T US debt ceiling suspension Is Satoshi Nakamoto wealthier than Bill Gates?

Source: Conor Grogan If accurate, this would make Nakamoto the world’s 16th richest person. Despite the growing interest in Nakamoto’s identity and holdings, his early decision to remain anonymous and inactive has helped preserve Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos — a principle that continues to define the cryptocurrency to this day.

A Crypto Skeptic Crenshaw, a vocal critic of spot Bitcoin ETFs, released a statement on April 4 in which she said the SEC’s characterization of the stablecoin market is replete with “legal and factual errors.” She contended that the agency’s claim — that stablecoins are generally directly accessible through issuers — is inaccurate. “Over 90% of outstanding USD-stablecoins are distributed. through intermediaries,” she said. Industry Responds with Enthusiasm While Crenshaw rang alarm, the remainder of the crypto industry was more open to the guidelines, which exclude some stablecoins from being regulated as securities. Token Metrics founder Ian Balina called it a “clear step” towards making decisions based on real issues in crypto. Midnight Network’s Ian Kane said it “feels like progress for crypto people trying to play by the rules.” Problems Surrounding Financial Health Crenshaw also called into question the SEC’s guarantees around stablecoin redemption. She argued that reserve matching is insufficient in determining the issuer’s financial health. “The overall financial condition and solvency of the issuer cannot be ascertained from the value of its reserve,” she said. Tether and Transparency Crenshaw’s comments come as Tether will engage a Big Four accounting firm to audit its reserves, endeavoring to prove its USDT token is 1:1 fully backed. Earlier this month, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino suggested that with a pro-crypto administration like Trump’s, audits could be more streamlined.

This has fueled debates, with some users questioning the authenticity of the data, citing discrepancies between Pi’s total supply. The Controversy: Some users argue that the total supply of Pi is 100 billion, while the screenshot suggests a figure of 900 billion. “Don’t post fake scripts here,” one user commented, pointing out the inconsistencies. However, another user quickly countered, showing that the data aligns with tests conducted on the Pi Network blockchain, as seen on PiScan.io.

Key Observations: No Real Transfers: No actual Pi was moved between wallets; the transactions exist solely as on-chain structured data. Zero Balances: The involved wallets have balances near zero (less than 10 π), suggesting they are likely test accounts controlled by the Pi Core Team or developers. Claimable Balances: Some transactions featured Claimable Balances with ultra-short lock-up periods of just 20 or 30 seconds, hinting at experimental features or stress tests.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has increased by 5.91% in 24 hours to $2.15. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Coming to the expenses, which Ripple will be bearing, the case will be settled with a $50 Million payout to the SEC. That being said, we can expect the process to expedite, as Paul Atkins has given a positive statement in a recent speech about cryptocurrencies. Talking about the XRP price, it is currently up a nominal 5.91% to $2.15. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.206. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $1.9920 Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction.

There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). The exchange inflow vs outflow graph below shows 646k outflows in comparison to 290k inflows. This signals a spike in strong investor interest, which is a big thumbs-up for XRP. XRP Exchange Inflow vs Outflow If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89.

There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility.

BlackRock CEO Pushes BTC as Uncorrelated Asset,https://coingape.com/markets/did-bitcoin-price-decouple-from-sp500-blackrock-ceo-pushes-btc-as-uncorrelated-asset/,"Over the past three days, the S&P500 crashed 12%, losing 2,797 points. However, Bitcoin price is down only 5.51% and is already recovering. This shift in dynamics between the highly correlated risk-on assets has caused investors to speculate if this a decorrelation or if BTC is lagging. If the former is true, then cryptocurrency markets are likely going to enjoy massive gains in the upcoming days. If the latter comes pass next week, then investors await more pain, potentially crashing the king crypto below $80K. Let’s explore this potential shift in paradigm between US stock and cryptocurrencies along with Bitcoin price prediction and key levels to watch. BlackRock’s Decorrelated Asset for Bitcoin Price Comes True as BTC Decouples From S&P500 The below chart clearly shows the disparity between Bitcoin price and S&P500, the two risk-on assets that are being shaped by macroeconomic and Trump’s policies. While S&P500 is down -10.74% since Wednesday, BTC’s value hovers around -3.15%. BTC vs. S&P500 Price Performance Did Bitcoin price decorrelate from the stock markets and behaving as an uncorrelated asset that investors can flock to in times of market turmoils? A popular crypto analyst, with username fewseethis, noted after recent Bitcoin price crash, “​​an uncoupling of this magnitude would be quite historic if it holds.” A popular crypto influencer Pete Rizzo confirmed that the Wall Street is realizing that “ Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset backed by energy.” To add credence to this outlook, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has always considered Bitcoin as an “uncorrelated asset.” In an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, Larry Fink said, “Bitcoin is legitimate financial instrument that allows you to have uncorrelated returns.” The CEO also added that BTC is an instrument that you invest in “when you are frightened and countries are debasing their currencies by excess deficit.” Is Bitcoin Actually Decorrelating From S&P500 and US Stock Market? While some are optimistic, others are skpetical about this “decoupling.” Collie, another crypto analyst added that this isn’t decorrelation but lag. “This looks like the most obvious lagging situation. Happy to be wrong and buy higher but glhf to those longing into the weekend” Dom, a crypto trader posted his observation of Bitcoin price strength against Nasdaq100. While BTC is up 1.8% NDX is down 9.77%. BTC vs. NDX Price Performance “Considering the high correlation of these over the last few years, this is surprising The floor fell out on stocks this week, but not on BTC.” The trader further went on to suggest this weekly divergence has happened six times and over the course of the next three months, Bitcoin price has almost always produced positive gains. BTC Price Gains After Weekly Divergence In conclusion, if Bitcoin is decorrelating from the US stock market, this could be a bullish sign that hints at massive gains in the near future. In such a case, investors can expect a sweep of the $80K key psychological level to kickstart a bull run to first critical resistance level at $90K followed by $100K and the ATH at $110K. However, if BTC is not decoupling but lagging, then a breakdown of $80K and a flip of this key support into a resistance level will be the next bearish signal. Such a development could see Bitcoin price crash down to $70K or $69K support levels. The post Did Bitcoin Price Decouple From S&P500?

42941832,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146685,1743852632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Alert: BitMEX Co-founder Arthur Hayes Urges Accumulating Gold and Bitcoin Amid Dollar Fears,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitmex-co-founder-gold-bitcoin-advice/,"In a bold market prediction, Arthur Hayes, the influential co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, has once again stirred the financial waters. This time, Hayes is not just talking crypto; he’s advocating for a dual-asset strategy, urging investors to accumulate both Bitcoin and gold. His rationale? A potentially seismic shift in the global economic landscape driven by the escalating U.S. national debt and changing geopolitical winds. Let’s dive into Hayes’s insights and explore why he believes these two seemingly disparate assets could be your best bet in the coming years. Why Arthur Hayes Recommends Accumulating Bitcoin and Gold Now? Hayes took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his perspective, highlighting a stark reality: the outstanding U.S. Treasury debt has ballooned 85 times since the gold standard was abandoned in 1971. This exponential increase, as Hayes points out, was initially necessary to fuel global economic growth. The U.S. dollar, backed by the nation’s economic might and stability, became the world’s reserve currency. However, Hayes suggests this era of unchecked dollar dominance might be nearing its end, especially with the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House. Here’s a breakdown of Hayes’s core arguments: Debt Explosion: The sheer magnitude of the U.S. national debt is unsustainable in the long run. Hayes emphasizes the 85-fold increase since 1971 as a critical inflection point. Trump’s Trade Policies: Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policies, particularly his focus on reducing trade deficits, could disrupt the flow of dollars globally. If the U.S. becomes less willing to run trade deficits, it might curtail the creation of new dollars needed to lubricate the global economy. Dollar Dilemma: Countries holding vast amounts of U.S. bonds and stocks may start to question the dollar’s unwavering strength, especially if Trump’s policies lead to a decrease in dollar supply. This could trigger a sell-off of these dollar-denominated assets. Geopolitical Risk: Nations that have experienced the impact of Trump’s tariff policies may be hesitant to rely heavily on the U.S. dollar, seeking alternative assets to diversify their reserves and reduce their dependence on a single currency. In essence, Hayes paints a picture of a potential dollar shortage and a shift away from dollar hegemony. He posits that investors and nations alike will seek refuge in tangible assets, and that’s where gold and Bitcoin come into play. The Strategic Case for Gold in a Changing World Gold has historically been a safe-haven asset, a store of value during times of economic uncertainty and currency devaluation. Hayes believes that the move away from the gold standard in 1971, while initially necessary for economic expansion, has created an environment where currencies are increasingly susceptible to inflation and manipulation. A return to a world where gold plays a more prominent role in international finance is, according to Hayes, a plausible scenario. Consider these points regarding gold’s resurgence: Benefit of Gold Explanation Hedge Against Inflation: Gold tends to maintain or increase its value during periods of inflation, preserving purchasing power when fiat currencies erode. Safe Haven Asset: In times of geopolitical instability, economic crises, or market crashes, investors flock to gold as a safe store of value. Diversification: Gold’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it an excellent portfolio diversifier, reducing overall risk. Tangible Asset: Unlike digital or fiat currencies, gold is a physical asset with intrinsic value, offering a sense of security and permanence. Hayes suggests that as countries seek to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar for international payments, they will naturally increase their gold reserves. This increased demand, coupled with gold’s limited supply, could drive its price significantly higher. Bitcoin: The Modern Gold? While gold is the traditional safe haven, Bitcoin has emerged as a digital alternative, often dubbed ‘digital gold.’ Hayes is a long-time proponent of Bitcoin , and his current recommendation to accumulate both gold and Bitcoin underscores his belief in the unique value proposition of cryptocurrencies. Why Bitcoin alongside gold? Decentralization: Bitcoin is decentralized and not controlled by any government or central bank, making it immune to political and monetary policy whims. Limited Supply: Like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, creating scarcity and potentially driving up its value as demand increases. Accessibility and Transferability: Bitcoin is easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection and can be transferred globally, quickly and efficiently. Growth Potential: As a relatively new asset class, Bitcoin has significant growth potential as adoption increases and the cryptocurrency market matures. Hayes sees Bitcoin as complementing gold, offering a modern, technologically advanced store of value for a new generation of investors. He believes that in a world grappling with monetary uncertainty and digital transformation, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and scarcity make it an attractive alternative asset. Actionable Investment Strategy: Gold, Gold Miners, and Bitcoin Hayes doesn’t just broadly recommend gold and Bitcoin ; he provides specific actionable advice. He suggests investors consider not only physical gold but also gold miners. Gold mining companies can offer leveraged exposure to the price of gold. When the price of gold rises, mining companies’ profits can increase disproportionately, potentially leading to higher returns. Here’s Hayes’s recommended investment basket: Physical Gold: Allocate a portion of your portfolio to physical gold as a foundational safe-haven asset. Gold Miners: Consider investing in gold mining stocks or ETFs for leveraged exposure to gold price movements. Bitcoin ($BTC): Accumulate Bitcoin as a digital store of value with significant long-term growth potential. Hayes’s strategy is rooted in the anticipation of a shift in global monetary policy and trade relationships. He believes that these assets are poised to benefit from the potential turmoil and uncertainty that may arise. Is This Investment Advice for Everyone? While Arthur Hayes’s insights are compelling, it’s crucial to remember that investment decisions should always be made based on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and thorough research. Investing in Bitcoin and gold, like any investment, carries risks. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Both Bitcoin and gold can experience price volatility. Bitcoin, in particular, is known for its dramatic price swings. Market Risks: Global economic conditions, regulatory changes, and unforeseen events can impact the prices of both gold and Bitcoin. Storage and Security: Storing physical gold requires secure storage solutions. Bitcoin requires secure digital wallets and understanding of cybersecurity best practices. Investment Horizon: Hayes’s analysis points towards long-term trends. These investments may require a longer-term investment horizon to realize their full potential. Before making any investment decisions based on Hayes’s recommendations, conduct your own due diligence, understand the risks involved, and consider consulting with a financial advisor. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift Towards Hard Assets? Arthur Hayes’s call to accumulate gold and Bitcoin is a powerful statement about the potential future of the global financial system. He foresees a world where the U.S. dollar’s dominance may wane, and tangible, scarce assets like gold and digital scarcity like Bitcoin will become increasingly valuable. Whether his predictions fully materialize remains to be seen, but his analysis provides a thought-provoking perspective on navigating the complexities of the modern financial landscape. For investors seeking to adapt to a potentially shifting world order and protect their wealth, Hayes’s strategy of embracing gold , gold miners, and Bitcoin offers a compelling roadmap.

As the United States is establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the US dollar is under a huge threat. In a risky bet, Hayes suggests to invest in Bitcoin and Gold as a hedge against the devaluing Dollar. Gold & Bitcoin To Boost US Economy, Says Arthur Hayes In his latest X post, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted the potential debacle awaiting the US Dollar. With the US’ adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the Dollar is facing a risk of devaluation. Significantly, Hayes shed light on the exponential growth of US treasury debt since 1971, when the country abandoned the gold standard. Hayes advises investors who search for a possible shift back to pre-1971 trade dynamics to invest in Bitcoin, gold, and gold miners. The BitMEX founder believes that these assets could provide a hedge against the dollar’s depreciation. The Return of Gold as a Neutral Reserve Asset Moreover, Arthur Hayes suggests that gold could return to its status as a neutral reserve. He argues that if nations hold gold in reserves, it would facilitate the free and affordable flow of gold in the emerging global monetary system. Given gold’s tariff-exempt status, Trump hinted at its potential use as a reserve asset. Recently, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” praised silver over gold and Bitcoin. He believes that silver is poised to hit $70 per ounce in the near-term and $200 in two years. He noted, “Silver for the next two months is the best of the three, gold, silver, and Bitcoin.” Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin’s Surge To $1M In an ambitious prediction, Arthur Hayes asserted that the Bitcoin price could reach $1 million. He bases his prediction on the growing adoption of Bitcoin and its inclusion in national reserves. He hopes that Trump’s policies could fuel this crypto’s growth as a store of value. This development follows Donald Trump’s pardon of Arthur Hayes and BitMEX’s three executives. While they pleaded guilty to breaching anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws, the Trump government granted pardon to them.

Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Friday, Ferguson said expectations of multiple rate cuts this year are ill-placed because inflationary pressures are still high. CNBC mentioned that Fed futures markets heavily bet on five rate cuts in 2025, with traders pricing in a 99% likelihood of a rate reduction in June. “ I do not think that’s going to happen ,” Ferguson said in response to the futures market projections. “ I think that’s a market in wishful thinking, hoping the Fed bails them out .” No cuts should be in sight, says Ferguson The Former Fed Vice chair advised against interest cuts because inflation is still way above the central bank’s 2% target. “ Inflation expectations have been moving in the wrong direction, and hasn’t really come back down to the 2%. It would be unwise for the Fed to listen to the market at this stage . As long as there’s inflation in the air, and there certainly is, it would be unwise for them to signal that they’re only moving in one direction. They need to hold on to that inflation credibility .” When asked how soon the Fed might begin easing rates , Ferguson dismissed the June borrowing rate cuts forecasts and suggested they may not occur at all this year. “ I think it’s well past June ,” he said. “ I’ve said a few times, I’m not sure they’re going to get any cuts off this year. ” He added that the Fed cannot afford to damage its inflation-fighting credibility, which had already taken a hit when policymakers were late to respond to the initial surge in prices. “ They were late to the game the last time around. Some of their inflation credibility was nicked. I don’t think they want that to happen again .” If any cuts were to happen, Ferguson believes it would only be in the latter half of the year with more clarity on the economic situation in the US. Labor market data negates need for rate cuts Ferguson said that the better-than-expected March labor market data is even more reason for the Fed to maintain its current monetary policy stance. “ This labor report, it shows that the economy is still steaming ahead, ” he said. “ Roughly full employment, increasing jobs at somewhere between 130,000 to 150,000 every month. This is not a weak economy. ” While he admitted that the pace of growth had slowed compared to past quarters, the senior economist propounded that the US economy is on stable footing. “ The economy is still on an even keel, growing slowly, let’s say roughly at potential. The 4% unemployment rate is telling us the truth ,” he continued. Still, Ferguson noted that corporate executives are jittery about adding more investments and hiring decisions. “ There’s uncertainty in the C-suite, not being sure how much to expect in terms of CapEx, not being sure how much to expect in terms of adding more labor. If we took a snapshot of the economy today, I’d say it’s still in pretty good shape, but with some anxiety, some clouds hanging .” Tariffs add to inflation headwinds When asked if President Donald Trump trade tariffs have added to the inflationary risks, or it just boils down to lingering domestic price pressures, Ferguson said it was a little bit of both. “ The last report showed some good signs, but some things that were worrying ,” he remarked. “ We did not get inflation down to 2%. It was coming down slowly. Now we’ve got this new stimulus toward inflation, potentially, in tariffs .” Some economists may argue that trade policies and interest rates operate independently, but the Fed cannot ignore policy-induced inflationary causes. Donald Trump could have deployed tariffs to improve domestic industries or to simply penalize foreign competition for being “unfair” to the US. Still, such policies can provoke a monetary response, one that the Federal Reserve will have to react to. The central bank is undeniably independent, and Trump doesn’t really have to look at what the government branch is doing to impose tariffs. However, they must respond to the economic consequences of any trade policy, including international trade levies. “ I think we need to be very even in our assessment of where we are here ,” Ferguson concluded.

While Honduras is doubling down on its warnings against cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Argentina is embracing blockchain innovation by moving forward with lithium tokenization and introducing new regulations for virtual asset service providers. Honduras Central Bank reaffirms opposition to crypto adoption The Central Bank of Honduras (BCH) has once again voiced its firm stance against the use of cryptocurrencies. In a fresh public advisory, the bank warned citizens about the high volatility and risks associated with digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, emphasizing that these are not legal tender under Honduran law. In a social media statement, BCH clarified that cryptocurrencies operate outside the country’s legal and financial systems and that it neither supports nor guarantees transactions involving them. “Investing in cryptocurrencies is done at your own risk,” the bank cautioned, urging people not to invest more than they can afford to lose. This reiteration follows previous warnings, including one issued during BCH’s 70th anniversary, which emphasized that the Lempira remains the sole legal currency in Honduras. BCH stressed that it is the only institution authorized to issue legal tender and that it does not regulate or oversee any form of virtual currencies used for payment or investment. The bank’s renewed caution reflects broader concerns in the region about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and their potential to destabilize local economies. Argentina advances lithium tokenisation with blockchain integration In contrast to Honduras’s skeptical approach, Argentina is accelerating its push into blockchain innovation . The country is making significant progress on lithium tokenization through a partnership with Atómico 3, a company focused on applying blockchain to commodity management. The initiative aims to improve traceability, accountability, and trust in Argentina’s lithium supply chain. Each AT3 Commodity Token will be backed by actual lithium reserves extracted from the Salar de Mogna region in the San Juan province. These tokens will be issued on a blockchain ledger to provide transparency and verifiability throughout the mining and export process. Atómico 3 has pledged to meet production obligations for the next ten years and use smart contracts to distribute revenue to token holders based on lithium market prices. Once the operational cycle is complete, the tokens will be redeemed and permanently removed (burned) from circulation. The move is seen as a bold step in using digital assets to bridge traditional industries with emerging technologies, especially in sectors such as battery production and electric vehicles. A detailed whitepaper has been released, outlining the project’s scope, regulatory compliance, and potential for international trade. Argentina introduces new crypto regulation framework On March 21, Argentina’s National Securities Commission (CNV) unveiled a regulatory framework for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). The announcement came during a well-attended event featuring stakeholders from the fintech and capital markets sectors. The CNV confirmed the approval of General Resolution No. 1058, developed through public consultation, which formally designates the CNV as the oversight body for VASPs under Law No. 27.739. Officials emphasized that the new framework is aligned with international standards, including those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). With these developments, Argentina is positioning itself as a regional leader in the integration of blockchain technology and crypto regulation, while Honduras remains cautious—underscoring the diverging paths Latin American countries are taking on digital assets.

The S&P 500 posted a $5 trillion loss in market capitalization over two days, its largest drop on record, surpassing the $3.3 trillion decline in March 2020 during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an April 5 report by Reuters. The record sell-off occurred after US President Donald Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2. The measures aim to shrink the country’s estimated trade deficit of $1.2 trillion in goods and boost domestic manufacturing. S&P 500 record $5.4 trillion loss. Source: Zerohedge Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) dip after the tariff announcement was significantly smaller than traditional markets, proving Bitcoin’s growing maturity as a global asset, according to Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and chief operating officer of RedStone blockchain oracle firm. “What we’re potentially witnessing is an evolution in Bitcoin’s market positioning,” the co-founder told Cointelegraph, adding: “Historically, Bitcoin has been strongly correlated with risk assets during macro shocks, but this divergence might signal an emerging perception shift among investors.” “Bitcoin’s fixed supply architecture inherently contrasts with fiat currencies that may face inflationary pressure under tariff-driven economic changes,” he added.

According to analyst Ali Martinez, inflows have surged 350% in just two weeks, rising from $1.82 billion to $8.2 billion, signaling a strong return of market confidence. Capital inflows into the crypto market have surged 350% in just two weeks, jumping from $1.82 billion to $8.20 billion! pic.twitter.com/Nv1C8cczwm — Ali (@ali_charts) April 4, 2025 The chart shared by the analyst illustrates the net capital flow and market sentiment around Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins from March 17 to April 3, 2025. While BTC’s price fluctuated between $82K and $87K during this period, the overall market experienced strong capital inflows, particularly towards the end of March and into early April. Interestingly, despite the high inflows and rising stablecoin reserves on March 24, there was still net selling of BTC and ETH, suggesting profit-taking at higher prices. However, by April 3, the trend had shifted as the market saw over $8.2 billion in capital inflows with zero outflows, with a significant increase in both stablecoin reserves and BTC+ETH net position. Bullish News Ahead? This indicates a bullish set as the market might be gearing up for a comeback in anticipation of a price rebound. Despite market turmoil from Trump’s tariff news, investors remain bullish on Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptos. Many are moving their money into stablecoins instead of stocks, showing growing confidence in crypto as global trade tensions rise. Crypto Is Entering A New Phase Despite short-term challenges, crypto is entering a new phase. Regulatory progress and rising institutional interest are driving fresh momentum, especially in venture funding. While market sentiment remains mixed, strong early signals across emerging sectors suggest the groundwork is being laid for long-term growth. In Q1 2025, crypto venture capital saw a big comeback, with $4.8 billion invested — the strongest quarter since Q3 2022. A major driver was MGX’s record-breaking $2 billion investment in Binance, showing renewed institutional interest in big, late-stage crypto projects despite the shaky macro environment. While the total capital surged, the number of deals slightly dipped, still the market looks healthier than in 2023. In fact, Q1 alone made up 60% of all VC funding from 2024, pointing to rising confidence and a possible shift toward a new phase of adoption. The quarter also saw major mergers and acquisitions, like Kraken buying NinjaTrader for $1.5B and MoonPay acquiring Helio for $175M. This trend toward consolidation signals a more mature, strategic market where big players are growing through acquisitions. Crypto Market Sees $600M Inflows After five weeks of outflows, the crypto market saw a $644M inflow this week, signaling renewed investor confidence. Bitcoin led with $724M, while Ethereum saw $86M in outflows. The U.S. drove most of the inflow, with support from Switzerland, Germany, and Hong Kong. Despite a brief dip after Trump’s global tariff announcement, BTC quickly bounced back, climbing to over $84,700. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped over 10% and gold slipped nearly 5%. If this trend continues, Bitcoin could reach $100,000 sooner than expected. Attorney John E. Deaton highlighted a major shift in investor sentiment in a recent X post. While the U.S. stock market lost $3.25 trillion in a single day, $5.4 billion flowed into crypto — a clear sign that investors are turning to risk assets like crypto despite market volatility.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 11:43:41

In a new interview on the Crypto Banter YouTube channel, Hayes says that US President Donald Trump’s announced tariffs on April 2nd could have enduring impacts on markets this month, after triggering a massive stock sell-off. “April is going to be a tough month. We have this tariff digestion. The market still believes that Bitcoin is a one-to-one proxy for the Nasdaq. And people are starting to sour on US Big Tech. So that’s coming off. And so people think, Okay, well, Nasdaq goes down, therefore Bitcoin goes down. I think Bitcoin is going to perform more like gold, but it’s going to take a while for the market to sort of ditch this correlation between the Nasdaq and Bitcoin.” He also says that wild price swings can occur around April 15th, tax day in the United States, since some investors sell assets to help pay their tax bills. “You have taxes being paid by persons in the United States coming up on April 15th. That’s a liquidity negative event, because people have to sell things to pay their taxes.” Hayes says another factor that may impact Bitcoin this month is the Treasury’s monetary policy, which may affect the money supply in the markets. Bitcoin tends to rally if market liquidity increases based on historical precedent. “It’s unclear whether or not the Treasury is going to refill their checking account… Once that debt ceiling is resolved, and it will be resolved, then the question is, does the Treasury say, ‘Okay, I need to issue a bunch more bonds, suck liquidity out of the system, and raise my balance back up to say, $700 or $800 billion.’ We don’t know. We’ll find out in early May when the quarterly refunding announcement comes out from the Treasury about what their target is for their cash balances.” Lastly, Hayes says the flagship crypto asset may start rallying again if Bitcoin can hold $76,500 as support this month amid all the volatility. “April is going to be a lot of uncertainty. There’s max tariff hysteria, people freaking out, [saying] there’s going to be this global recession, change in the monetary order, all those sorts of things. So I think it’s going to be very choppy, a choppy to down month. Obviously, I hope the $76,500 holds. I think it will. But I think we’re going to come close to testing that.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,014 at time of writing, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours.

The single-day market loss amounted to $3.25 trillion—exceeding the total valuation of the global cryptocurrency market, which stood at $2.68 trillion at the time. Among major tech players, dubbed the “Magnificent 7,” Tesla led the plunge, falling 10.42%. Nvidia and Apple also saw steep losses, dropping 7.36% and 7.29% respectively, according to TradingView data . Nasdaq 100 Falls 6%, Slips Into Bear Market Amid Broad Sell-Off The widespread sell-off sent the Nasdaq 100 tumbling 6% on the day, pushing the index officially into bear market territory. The Kobeissi Letter, a financial insights platform, described April 4 as the worst day for U.S. equities since March 2020. “U.S. stocks have now erased a massive $11 trillion since February 19,” Kobeissi said in an April 4 post on X, adding that the odds of a recession now exceed 60%. The platform called Trump’s April 2 tariff policy announcement “historic” and warned that if such measures persist, a recession may become unavoidable. President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday were historic. The effective US tariff rate is now above 25% for the first time since ~1900. We are ABOVE levels seen in the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of the 1930s. If these tariffs persist, a recession is impossible to avoid. pic.twitter.com/eqr0Qik5ZH — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) April 4, 2025 The executive order signed by Trump imposes a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods and introduces reciprocal tariffs aimed at leveling trade imbalances. Trump said the move targets the disproportionate tariffs imposed on U.S. exports by other countries. While traditional markets slump, Bitcoin has shown notable resilience. At the time of publication, BTC was trading around $83,749, down just 0.16% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Some traders have pointed to Bitcoin’s stability as a potential hedge against macroeconomic volatility. “Bitcoin doesn’t appear to care one bit about tariff wars and markets tanking,” said technical analyst Urkel. Even longtime crypto skeptics are beginning to take notice. “I’ve hated on Bitcoin in the past,” admitted stock market commentator Dividend Hero, “but seeing it hold steady while stocks collapse is very interesting to me.” Everyone is talking about $BTC strength in the face of a 2-day, 10%+ stock sell-off, even as gold falls But this has nothing to do with stocks Bitcoin is NOT, & never has been, a market hedge. It is a gov't/bank hedge. This selloff is due to a loss of trust in global gov't. pic.twitter.com/hi9g4vIseh — Jeff Dorman (@jdorman81) April 5, 2025 Trump Administration is Manipulating Stock Markets to Cut Rates: Anthony Pompliano Last month, Bitcoin commentator Anthony Pompliano said that the Trump administration may be deliberately engineering market turmoil to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into lowering interest rates. He hypothesised that President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are attempting to crash asset prices, forcing the Fed’s hand to reduce rates. Pompliano, the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management and host of The Pomp Podcast, claims that lowering interest rates is crucial to avoid the need to refinance $7 trillion in upcoming U.S. debt obligations. “Trump and his team are intentionally crashing the market,” he wrote. “Is this a master plan or are we watching uncontrolled destruction?” The theory comes as Powell recently refused to cut rates despite Trump’s repeated calls for lower borrowing costs. In January, the Fed held rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%, maintaining its cautious stance amid inflation concerns.

According to the report, the government is expected to amend two emergency decrees related to the prevention and suppression of cybercrime. The report specifically noted that the timeline to amend the emergency decrees has been moved up, with the law set to be looked into before the Songkran festival. According to the Digital Economy and Society Minister Prasert Jantararuangtong, the draft amendments of the two decrees are expected to be presented before the cabinet on April 8 before being sent to the Council of State for scrutiny. He added that the decrees are expected to be in effect before the Songkran festival. Thailand wants shared responsibilities during scams According to Prasert, the highlight of the amended 2023 emergency decree on measures to prevent and suppress cybercrime is the shared responsibilities during scams. He noted that during periods of cybercrime that result in losses for victims, financial institutions and telecom operators will share greater accountability. This means that in such a case, most of the blame will be accorded to banks and telecom operators. He added that the amended 2018 emergency decree overseeing digital assets and cryptocurrency transactions complements the cybercrime suppression scheme. In addition, cybercrime suppression will be overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Finance Ministry. “The government should meet with banks and telecom operators because there are still issues that need to be understood by these firms,” Prasert said. The amended cybercrime law also contains a clause that addresses issuing refunds to victims of scams. The clause mentions that if the damages can be proven, then the funds will be refunded to the victims without the need to go to court. Prasert added that the Anti-Money Laundering Office will be in charge of issuing guidelines for these refunds, noting that objections to any of the refund prices must first be sent to the court and cleared before it is allowed to happen. Cybercrime law expected to have limited impact According to reports, after the amended laws are phased, they must first be publicized in the Royal Gazette before they go into effect. Meanwhile, Thailand brokerage house Krungsri Securities has mentioned earlier that it expects the amended cybercrime prevention and suppression law to have limited impacts on banks and telecom operators in Thailand. This means that the impacted firms have a greater responsibility to maintain their systems to prevent crimes. The Thailand brokerage house noted that the only way they can be seriously impacted is if it is proven, in the case of a crime or scam, that their systems were not properly maintained or up to date to tackle such crimes. This is because the new amendment now puts the greatest share of the responsibilities in their hands while noting that it includes greater penalties for the perpetrators of the crime. Krungsri also added that its conversations with most financial institutions and telecom firms in the country show that they have the needed measures in place to tackle fraud or scams. Thailand has been making strides in the crypto sector this year, with the country announcing the launch of its distributed ledger technology-based trading system. The SEC noted that due to the rising popularity of investment in digital assets, it wants to use the technology to help securities companies to capitalize on their investor networks. In terms of regulations, the country also issued a directive against OKX for operating without a license. The SEC submitted the complaint against OKX operator Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd and nine associates. “The OKX activities are liable to be an operation of digital asset exchange business under Section 3 of the Emergency Decree, for which OKX has not obtained a license, in violation of Section 26, and subject to offenses and penalties under Section 66 of the Emergency Decree,” the SEC said.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) remained between $80,000 and $90,000, while Ethereum ( ETH ) was stuck slightly below $2,000. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies dropped from $2.7 trillion to $2.6 trillion. Meanwhile, the stock market had its worst week since 2020. The blue-chip Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, and Dow Jones slumped into a correction. Bitcoin vs Dow Jones vs Nasdaq 100 | Source: crypto.news Shock Fed warning on stagflation Bitcoin, altcoins could come under pressure after the Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell warned that Trump’s tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth for the U.S. economy. “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said Friday. High inflation and high unemployment can create stagflation, which is difficult to manage because actions to fix one issue—like cutting interest rates to boost growth—can worsen another, such as inflation, and vice versa. Powell warned that he was not in a hurry to cut interest rates, since inflation remained high. His statement mirrored that of other officials like Raphael Bostic and Adriana Kugler , who have supported higher rates for longer to combat inflation. Trump, however, disagrees. “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, accusing Powell of “playing politics.” The Fed’s Board of Governors is an independent government agency. Observers note that a more hawkish Fed, at a time when analysts are predicting a recession , would negatively impact Bitcoin, altcoins, and stock prices. Historically, these assets do well when the Fed is cutting interest rates. At last check Saturday, Bitcoin was trading at roughly $83,435. See below.

It took a major lead among the popular chains like Ethereum, Tron, BNBChain, and others by recording $370 million in fees. Besides, Fidelity’s spot ETF application is an inch closer to get approved and the latest Grayscale ETF filing has raised the optimism around the SOL price rally. SOL price recovers aggressively after a flash dip to $112.46, which suggests the bulls could be probably back in the game. The trading volume jumped by over 25% to reach close to $5 billion following a massive increase in whale interest. As a result, the investors also appear to have turned bullish on Solana. A popular analyst, Ali , shared data that suggests more than 71% of traders have gone long on SOL. This suggests that more than 70% of the investors are bullish on Solana and are betting on a price increase. While the price has rebounded from a crucial support, the bullish reversal has yet to be validated. Until then, the Solana price is expected to remain accumulated within a range but above the support at $118. However, the token is forming a double bottom pattern at this support level, which may result in a massive breakout after reaching the resistance zone around $146. The latest collaboration between Solana and Circle to enhance USDC accessibility has led to significant growth in DeFi, highlighting stablecoin expansion. Besides, the recent token unlocks and heightened whale activity on Solana suggest potential shifts in market dynamics, reflecting growing confidence from large investors.

While the US financial markets reacted negatively to this economic action, the crypto and Bitcoin markets have been able to withstand the global macroeconomic pressure. Bitcoin Price Overview According to data from CoinGecko, the price of Bitcoin has barely made any significant move over the last seven days. However, this piece of data does not tell the entire story, as the premier cryptocurrency made a play for the $87,000 mark on Wednesday, April 2, before recently falling back to around $84,000. The price of Bitcoin is being closely watched by market participants and speculators, especially considering the underwhelming performance of the US equities market over the past two days. This recent development suggests that the world’s largest cryptocurrency might be decorrelating from the traditional markets. Related Reading: Is Korea Propping Up The XRP Price? Pundit Explains What’s Happening As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency stands at around $84,000, reflecting an over 2% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day performance might bode well for what is to come over the weekend, especially as the Bitcoin price has not particularly impressed at the latter end of each week so far in 2025. Is A BTC Price Bounce On The Horizon? In a new post on the X platform, crypto analyst Maartunn revealed that the Bitcoin bulls might be on the move again. This on-chain observation is based on changes in the Taker Buy Volume, a metric that measures the total volume of buy orders filled by takers in perpetual swaps of a specific cryptocurrency. In the crypto trading context, a taker refers to a market participant who places an order matched with an existing order on the order book. Hence, the Taker Buy Volume indicates the total amount of a cryptocurrency (BTC, in this scenario) purchased by these market participants within a specific period. Maartunn mentioned in his post that the “taker buyers” are beginning to step into the market, with the buy volume surpassing a significant milestone. According to the on-chain analyst, the Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume on all centralized exchanges recently crossed 100 million BTC to around 101.18 million BTC. Historically, notable upticks in the Taker Buy Volume have often preceded a bullish surge in the price of Bitcoin. Going by this trend, Maartunn urged to watch out for the BTC price action over the next few days. Related Reading: Toncoin Takes A Hit With 12% Correction After Failing To Break $4.34, More Pain?

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-breaking-out-of-a-head-and-shoulders-pattern-heres-the-significance/,"XRP’s price action has taken a bearish turn as the cryptocurrency has fallen below a critical support level, completing a head-and-shoulders pattern. Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a well-known crypto analyst, has highlighted this development, indicating that the digital asset may be poised for a deeper drop. XRP’s Head-and-Shoulders Pattern A head-and-shoulders pattern is a well-known technical indicator signaling a potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish. In this case, the asset’s price chart exhibits a left shoulder, a higher peak forming the head, and a right shoulder, followed by a break below the neckline—the key support level that marks the transition to a downtrend. The chart illustrates this structure clearly, and the decisive move below the neckline suggests that selling pressure has intensified, confirming the bearish pattern. The asset formed the left shoulder after its remarkable surge in late 2024 following the announcement of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation . This price surge sent the asset to a multi-year high of $2.86 before a brief pullback. In January, the asset began another climb, crossing $3 for the first time since 2018 to form the head and reach another multi-year high of $3.39. However, bearish market pressure pulled the asset down again, and it did not form the right shoulder until the price surge that followed the dismissal of the SEC’s appeal against Ripple. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Implications and Bearish Target Martinez pointed out that XRP’s break below support sets the stage for a potential move to $1.3. At the time of his analysis, the digital asset traded at $1.99. It has since recovered, trading at $2.14, but it could fall again as the broader market struggles. Many cryptocurrencies are still experiencing volatility, and if XRP fails to stay above its support level, bearish sentiment could drive prices lower, potentially testing additional support zones. Potential Scenarios for XRP For a bullish recovery, the digital asset must remain above the broken support level and reestablish momentum above the neckline just below $2.1. If buying pressure increases, a reversal could invalidate the bearish pattern. However, without strong support from buyers, the projected downside target remains in focus. Martinez has been tracking this head-and-shoulder pattern for some time. The community will closely watch its next moves to know whether it stabilizes or starts a downward trajectory.

This bullish SHIB price prediction comes after the meme coin formed a bullish triangle chart pattern, which signals a bullish breakout. Shiba Inu price today trades at $0.0000123 with a slight 1% gain and a daily high of $0.0000125. Analyst Forecasts 550% Rally for Shiba Inu Price Popular analyst Javon Marks believes that Shiba Inu price could be on the verge of making a 550% rally towards $0.000155. In an X post, the analyst identified a hidden bullish divergence that could halt the ongoing SHIB downtrend and drive a trend reversal. The analyst further observed that Shiba Inu made such a breakout in 2021 when the price of SHIB surged by more than 900%. If history rhymes and this pattern repeats, the meme coin begins making a series of higher highs, leading to the 500% rally. Shiba Inu Price Chart Bullish Triangle Pattern Teases SHIB Gains The analyst’s bullish Shiba Inu price prediction comes as SHIB formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern on the lower timeframe. A look at the 4-hour price chart shows SHIB has been making higher lows while the resistance remains at $0.0000124. This shows a gradual increase, and if the buying pressure increases and pushes SHIB past this resistance level, it could drive the bullish momentum. Technical indicators support this technical setup. The RSI stands at 48, which is close to the neutral level. This shows that the selling pressure is easing, which could support a strong uptrend for this top meme coin . At the same time, the MACD indicator is making bullish signals. The MACD histogram bars have flipped green while the MACD line is also rising, which further suggests that the momentum is positive. SHIB/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Despite this outlook, several factors indicate that SHIB might face headwinds in its attempt to break out of the bearish trends. Bearish Case for Shiba Inu Price Despite the bullish forecast and the strong technical outlook, several factors still make a bearish case for this meme coin. At press time, the SHIB burn rate had declined by 75%. As fewer tokens are being taken out of the circulating supply, it might impact SHIB’s potential to make strong gains. At the same time, meme coins have recorded a significant decline in market capitalization. In the last 30 days, the total meme coin market cap has declined from $55 billion to $47 billion. This decline follows a decline in speculative activity, which might also cause bearish headwinds. Due to the above factors, Shiba Inu price may face challenges in its attempt to make a rebound. However, flipping the $0.0000124 resistance level with strong buying volumes could support the uptrend.

After nearly a decade of being a major force in the crypto world, ETH has seen a sharp decline in 2025—its price falling by around 46% in the first quarter. Ethereum’s transaction fees have dropped to their lowest point since 2020, showing a big change in how people are using the network. According to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock , total fees collected on Ethereum fell by nearly 60% in Q1 2025, reaching just $208 million by early April. Total ETH fees decreased to their lowest level since 2020 this quarter, primarily driven by the gas limit increase and transactions moving to L2s pic.twitter.com/CLmOFfttwa — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 4, 2025 Consequences of a Slower Burn Rate Another concern is Ethereum’s slowing burn rate. This rate is important because it helps reduce the number of ETH in circulation. But with fewer transactions happening, the amount of ETH being burned has dropped. In fact, fees from major platforms like Uniswap, MetaMask, and Tether have dropped by over 95% since late 2024. As a result, Ethereum’s inflation rate is starting to rise. DeFi analyst Michael Nadeau has warned that Ethereum’s inflation could soon be higher than Bitcoin’s, which could worry long-term holders. ETH burned is currently at its lowest level since EIP1559 was implemented in August of '21. The drivers: Burned ETH from Uniswap is down 99% in March compared to November. Burn from Tether is down 95% over the same period. MetaMask burn is down 97%. 1inch is down 99%.… pic.twitter.com/wJFW6W46sK — Michael Nadeau | The DeFi Report (@JustDeauIt) April 3, 2025 Layer-2 Networks Are Taking Over A major reason for the drop in fees is the growing use of Layer-2 (L2) networks. These are built on top of Ethereum and offer faster and cheaper transactions. One of the top performers is Coinbase’s Base network, which now processes more than 80 transactions per second—more than any other L2 solution. Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, launched in March 2024, made L2 transactions even cheaper. This encouraged users to shift away from Ethereum’s main network to these faster alternatives, which led to fewer transactions and lower fees on the main network. ETH/BTC Performance Drop to 5-Year Low Ethereum is also falling behind Bitcoin in terms of price performance. Since the start of 2025, ETH has dropped from over $3,300 to $1,805 as of April 4. Meanwhile, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $109,000 and has only fallen about 10%. Ethereum, by contrast, has lost 45% of its value, pushing the ETH/BTC ratio to its lowest point in five years. Big Investors Still Buying the Dip Even with all the recent setbacks, some large investors remain confident in Ethereum’s long-term future. IntoTheBlock reports that Ethereum “whales” have bought more than 130,000 ETH after the price fell below $1,800. This shows that many still believe in Ethereum’s recovery. Some analysts are predicting a strong rebound, saying ETH could reach $5,000 by the end of 2025. Others are even more optimistic, suggesting it could go above $10,000 in the future. Can the Pectra Upgrade Turn Things Around? Looking ahead, Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade, expected in May, could help improve the network’s performance. If successful, it might give ETH the boost it needs to regain momentum and attract more activity back to the main network.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 12:50:12

HODL's current advantage stems from its expense ratio waiver, which may extend beyond 2026, offering marginally better returns for large investments. HODL has shown higher trading volumes and increased BTC-USD holdings, but its volatile market price and tracking error pose risks. Bitcoin's long-term potential remains strong, but mainstream acceptance and intrinsic value recognition are still hurdles for retail investors. The world of Bitcoin ETFs has significantly expanded—or exploded, rather—since they were first approved in January of last year. Of those first 11 pioneers of exchange-traded BTC-USD products, my pick for today is the VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ). No, not an investment pick. Just one to analyze for my own and my readers' benefit. I don't recommend this ETF, I'll tell you that much up front. The rest of this article tells you why. How Does HODL HOLD Up Against Other Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Total assets across the buffet spread of spot Bitcoin ETPs are now at the $100 billion mark , give or take. Of that, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) grabbed the lion's share of fund inflows over the past year and a bit and now trades with an AUM of a shade over $47 billion. In many ways, this is the ultimate way to invest in bitcoin without holding the actual crypto, so you don't really need to look elsewhere. SA The reason I say this is that these ETFs are very closely correlated, so unless your investment is pretty large, you won't see that much of a return delta between the 52 or so spot bitcoin ETFs currently being traded on major bourses. The difference becomes starker as the investment size scales up, of course, but for most retail investors, the difference is only measured by what the fund charges as an expense ratio. Some of these ETFs, like HODL itself, have waived their fees for the first couple of years to make themselves more attractive to newer crypto investors, which allows these funds to slightly outperform their peers. SA Those with a sharp eye will immediately notice that HODL outperformed the majority of its peers across various timelines, beginning from the 1Y mark all the way in to the 1M mark. The outperformance was in basis points rather than whole percentages due to the correlation I mentioned, but if your investment is large enough, this would be the ETF to look at. Well, at least until the ER waiver expires next year. They could extend it, but if they don't, then your return will be more aligned with that of IBIT or the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ), both of which do charge for expenses. That's a very slim edge, in my opinion. Regardless, if you're looking for the best price appreciation over time, I'd put HODL forward as being among the best vehicles to get there in. Again, not as an investment pick because the big question of price appreciation needs to be addressed... and that aspect—the macro angle—doesn't look too good in the short term. A longer investment horizon might be able to accommodate the uncertainties of BTC-USD, but my advice would be to stay away from HODL for now, even though it looks better than IBIT. Let's explore that last point because, when the time comes, you're going to want to hop on to the vehicle that returns more, even if that “more” is marginal. As I said, at scale, it could make a big difference. HODL versus IBIT The absence of an ER is one of the key drivers giving HODL its current (albeit sliver-like) edge over IBIT. There's also the question of greater volatility in trading volumes, as you can see. Data by YCharts HODL saw higher trading volumes as soon as Trump took the oath, while IBIT continued to see a decline in transactions. Overall YTD volume was flat, so it's back to normal, but the decline in IBIT's trading volumes is a telling point because it shows that investors are either gravitating across to slightly better-performing ETFs—or simply gravitating out of BTC-USD exposure altogether because such indirect exposure via ETFs doesn't capture the full price action of the underlying crypto stash, as indicated by the performance differential between the benchmark index and the ETF's market price since inception. VanEck That's a pretty significant tracking error, and that matters when the intrinsic value of the sole portfolio asset (although “intrinsic value” might not be the right term here) is completely at the mercy of investor sentiment. But investors are also aware, I think, that HODL's volatile trading volumes also indicate that the market price fluctuates more wildly around the premium/discount to NAV baseline now than before. VanEck, Author On the plus side, however, the fund has been acquiring BTC-USD at a frantic pace, with its stash now amounting to 14.36k of digital assets. Just three months ago, when the 10-K was filed, we saw that figure at 13.72k, so that's nearly 4.7% up from the previous sequential quarter. VanEck These are the little things that give HODL its edge, and I think the reason is that investors now have a lot more options to pick from, so these minutiae do matter. I'd be willing to bet that the ER waiver on HODL will be extended beyond its 2026 deadline—if only to keep returning those additional basis points over its biggest competitor, IBIT. I also foresee more bitcoin acquisitions happening over the coming months as the cryptocurrency prepares for its next leg up. More on that just below. Parting Thoughts, and Why HODL is a HOLD From Me Despite the crazy volatility that bitcoin has gone through since the presidential elections, its price action stays true to an inherent pattern of setting higher highs and higher lows. TradingView To long-term BTC-USD investors, it might be a walk in the park, but for most retail investors who are testing the waters with spot bitcoin ETFs, it can be a wild ride. You can clearly see how interest waxes and wanes in peristaltic spurts, but even these waves of deserters leave the crypto more valuable than when they got in, benefiting long-term investors and actually growing that base over time. In other words, there are more investors now than ever that will stay the course and see it through to whatever price targets gurus like Peter Brandt and Chamath Palihapitiya are predicting. That's anywhere from $120k to $500k by the end of this year. That's a good reason to stay invested in HODL, but as for buying now, I think there's still a long way to go before mainstream retail investors look at BTC-USD and these spot bitcoin ETFs as actual assets with intrinsic value. For most assets, that value comes from some sort of backing—cash flow in the case of equities, for example. While many argue that bitcoin's intrinsic value arises from basic characteristics such as scarcity, security, and utility there are still a lot of investors who would rather trust cash, gold or treasuries over bitcoin. For that reason, I'm not recommending HODL. If it's not for you, it's not for you. If it IS for you, however, then this is probably one of the better-spot bitcoin ETFs available today—solid track record, an ER waiver that helps give NAV growth an edge over larger rivals like IBIT, and the ultimate promise of bitcoin as a universally accepted asset of intrinsic value.",HODL|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-05 13:00:00

In a new survey conducted by Reuters involving 69 foreign exchange strategists, about 33% of participants expressed reservations about the dollar serving as a safe-haven asset in times of market turbulence. Specifically, the survey highlights that 19 out of the 51 strategists (40%) who answered an additional question say they are starting to see signs that the dollar’s standing as a safe haven is slipping and that the erosion could worsen over a long arc of time. Says George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, “There are some tentative risks that the dollar’s safe-haven status may be eroding. First, a weakening US outlook reduces the attractiveness of the dollar as a risk-off hedge. Second, a broader challenge to the stability of US institutions and global internal rule of law norms may decrease foreign investor willingness to allocate to dollars at the margin.” Arindam Sandilya, JPMorgan’s co-head of global FX strategy and head of macro strategy for Asia, points out that central banks have been gradually reducing their USD holdings in favor of gold. “History teaches us that network effects make it extremely difficult to dislodge reserve currency status in the short term, but a slower process of erosion can continue for a long time before such a binary shift in the global monetary architecture happens. [It is] more likely we see a continuation of the trends that have been in place for the past two decades – a steady decline in the US dollar’s allocation in central bank reserve holdings, and a search for alternative reserve assets such as gold.” Gold hit a new all-time high of $3,167 earlier this week. The precious metal’s bullish price action is driving Wall Street firms to unveil higher price targets for gold. Last month, Bank of America predicted that gold could climb to a long-term price target of $3,500. Meanwhile, Citi said that gold can reach the same price level if the US economy falls short of expected growth.

In a recent X post, analyst EGRAG CRYPTO spotlighted XRP price’s current pattern as an Ascending Broadening Wedge, a formation that often signals high volatility. According to the analyst, the crypto is at a fork in the road — either it dips sharply or skyrockets. He emphasized that XRP must close above $3.50 to confirm a bullish setup. If it fails to hold above $5 during a future rally, it may retest $1.90. Following that, another attempt to close above $5 could trigger a run to $6. A successful close beyond that level could propel XRP into double-digit territory, likely $17.50, within weeks. However, the analyst warned: “There’s a 70% chance it breaks to the downside and only a 30% chance for an upside breakout.” Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X Meanwhile, EGRAG added that this outlook depends on how Ripple’s native asset reacts to the $5 resistance in future price action. If it fails at that level again, the bearish scenario gains weight. Besides, it also comes as Ripple whales moved $572 million in XRP recently, which has further fueled market speculations. Short-Term XRP Targets Still Bullish Another expert Dark Defender has shared a bullish forecast for the asset in the near term. Highlighting the monthly chart outlook, the analyst said that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains strong, and the A Wave has been completed. He expects a B Wave that could drive XRP price up to $3. He also speculated that XRP might skip the final C Wave, heading straight to long-term targets near $5.85. In other words, the short-term bullish targets remain at $2.222 and $2.555, while key supports lie between $1.95 and $2.04. Source: Dark Defender, X Ripple’s Coin Gains 6%: What’s Next? XRP price was up more than 6% and exchanged hands at $2.16 during writing, and its one-day volume fell 19% to $4 billion. Notably, the crypto has hovered between $2.4 and $2.17 in the last 24 hours, reflecting the highly volatile scenario. Amid this, expert CasiTrades noted that the next support for XRP lies at $2.24. If it successfully breaches this level, Ripple’s coin is likely to target $2.7, $3.05, and an all-time high of $3.80. Source: CasiTrades, X Meanwhile, amid these experts’ predictions, the investors are also keeping a close track of the XRP lawsuit developments. Notably, a recent mysterious filing in the ongoing Ripple vs SEC lawsuit has sent shockwaves through the XRP community. An emergency request has been made to present “decisive evidence” that could potentially sway the case’s outcome. It’s worth noting that a positive outcome in the case could significantly drive the prices higher in the coming days. However, a delay by the US SEC in concluding the case has dampened market sentiment, which has also caused the XRP price to remain stagnant over the past few weeks.

Tether’s USDT May Not Qualify!,https://coinpedia.org/news/tether-eyes-new-u-s-stablecoin-after-secs-new-crypto-guidelines/,"The post What Are SEC’s New “Covered Stablecoins”? Tether’s USDT May Not Qualify! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a rare and clear move, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has introduced new guidance that could significantly impact the stablecoin market. The agency said that certain stablecoins – now called “covered stablecoins” – may not be treated as securities, as long as they follow strict conditions. The crypto industry has already begun to respond. Tether, one of the largest stablecoin issuers, is reportedly considering changing its strategy to fit within the SEC’s new framework. “Covered Stablecoins are not marketed as investments; rather, they are marketed as a stable, quick, reliable and accessible means of transferring value, or storing value and not for potential profit or as investments,” the SEC stated. What Exactly Is a “Covered Stablecoin”? The SEC explained that covered stablecoins are not offered as investment products. Instead, they’re presented as a stable, fast, and accessible way to send or store money—not something to make a profit from. To qualify as a covered stablecoin, the token must meet several key requirements: Be fully backed 1:1 by the U.S. dollar Be supported by low-risk, highly liquid assets Be redeemable at full value at any time These stablecoins must not offer interest, promise profits, give voting rights, or represent any form of ownership. They are meant strictly for use in payments, transfers, or storing value—not as investments. Since they’re sold as “digital dollars” and not investment opportunities, the SEC says these stablecoins don’t count as securities under U.S. law. This kind of clarity is unusual for the SEC, which often takes a more cautious or enforcement-first approach to crypto. Mixed Reactions from Experts David Sacks, a White House crypto advisor, welcomed the update. He said it offers much-needed clarity and reduces regulatory hurdles for dollar-backed stablecoins that are fully supported by safe assets. He also noted that these types of tokens would no longer need to register under the Securities Act. The SEC has determined that fully-reserved, liquid, dollar-backed stablecoins are not securities. Therefore blockchain transactions to mint or redeem them do not need to be registered under the Securities Act. Helpful clarity from @SECGov . pic.twitter.com/oUsq0snLaF — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) April 4, 2025 However, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw disagreed. She warned that the guidance oversimplifies how stablecoins actually work and overlooks key legal issues. Crenshaw argued that the risks involved are being downplayed, and the update could create confusion about how these tokens function Tether Faces New Challenges The new rules may benefit stablecoins like USDC, but they raise concerns for Tether’s USDT. That’s because the SEC doesn’t allow stablecoins to be backed by assets like cryptocurrency or gold—both of which are included in USDT’s reserves. According to Forbes reporter Nina Bambysheva, Tether is now exploring the idea of launching a new stablecoin that would fully follow U.S. rules. This new coin would be backed only by cash and U.S. Treasuries, marking a major shift for the company. Tether is considering the development of a stablecoin tailored for the U.S. market and intends to launch a competitor to ChatGPT within the next few months, @paoloardoino tells me. More to come soon — Nina Bambysheva (@ninabambysheva) April 4, 2025 Crypto analyst Novacula Occami also noted that Tether’s use of Bitcoin and gold in its reserves could make USDT ineligible for the “covered stablecoin” label. That could expose it to stricter regulations under U.S. securities law. Tether’s Plan for a U.S.-Compliant Stablecoin Despite the potential regulatory pressure, Tether doesn’t seem too worried about a possible U.S. ban on USDT. According to CTO Paolo Ardoino, the company is already thinking ahead and preparing to launch a separate U.S.-compliant stablecoin. Ardoino said USDT will likely remain focused on emerging markets, while the new stablecoin would be designed specifically for the U.S. market and built to comply with American regulations. Even as the wider crypto market struggles through a difficult first quarter, stablecoins are seeing strong growth. Daily usage continues to rise, and the stablecoin market added over $30 billion in Q1 alone – showing that demand remains high despite broader market uncertainty. It’s not every day the SEC speaks plainly on crypto – so when it does, the industry listens!",News|Crypto news|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 13:02:26

INPEPE’s presale is live at an almost laughably low $0.0000001781 per token—a price that’s a fleeting gift, set to climb through a series of staged increases over 60 phases. This isn’t just another frog hopping on the Pepe bandwagon—it’s the first cryptocurrency purpose-built for payments in the influencer economy, a colossal $25 billion industry in 2025 that’s charging toward $48 billion by 2027. PEPE might be the reigning king of meme coins, but INPEPE’s got the muscle, strategy, and real-world tie-in to dethrone it—and the presale’s your chance to grab a piece before it happens. Best Crypto to Buy: INPEPE’s Edge Over PEPE PEPE’s rise was a masterclass in viral chaos—riding raw community hype to a $3.15 billion market cap with little more than a smirk and a meme. But INPEPE’s playing a smarter game. With a total supply of 380 trillion tokens, its presale allocates 104.5 trillion (27.5%) to early investors at that razor-thin $0.0000001781 starting price. Unlike PEPE, which thrived on nostalgia and luck, INPEPE’s hitching its wagon to the influencer economy—a $25 billion behemoth today, set to soar to $48 billion by 2027. This is the first crypto designed to flow through X livestream tips, TikTok creator payouts, and Instagram brand deals, and serve as a financial backbone for other major platforms, giving it a tangible purpose PEPE never had. Staking at a jaw-dropping 20,617% APY locks up supply, while 20% (76 trillion INPEPE) fuels a marketing blitz with influencers who command millions of followers. The presale widget is live—jump in with ETH, BNB, USDT, or a credit card now, because every stage pushes the price higher! Crunching the Numbers: A PEPE Flip in Sight Let’s break it down: a 100X surge from $0.0000001781 takes INPEPE to $0.00001781, catapulting its market cap to $6.77 billion—more than double PEPE’s $3.15 billion. Push it to 200X ($0.00003562), and you’re staring at $13.54 billion—a throne-toppling figure. Embed This Youtube Video Link ( https://youtu.be/X0Zg0j16Ong ) But the ceiling could climb higher—say INPEPE captures 10% of the $48 billion influencer economy by 2027 ($4.7 billion in transactions). That’s $0.00005 per token, a 280X leap to a $19 billion market cap, leaving PEPE in the dust. Staking at 20,617% APY could also shrink circulating supply by 30% or more as holders chase massive returns, amplifying scarcity as demand spikes from influencers and their fans. PEPE never had this kind of economic anchor—INPEPE’s got a $48 billion engine humming under its hood, and the Q3/Q4 2025 launch is the spark. The Influencer Economy: INPEPE’s Secret Weapon The influencer economy isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a $25 billion reality in 2025, growing at a blistering pace to $48 billion by 2027. INPEPE’s the first crypto to claim this space, positioning itself as the payment method for a global army of creators—think X Spaces tipping, TikTok NFT drops, or Instagram subscription perks. This isn’t PEPE’s aimless meme chase; it’s a calculated strike at a market begging for a crypto solution. With 15% (57 trillion INPEPE) reserved for liquidity pools and 10% (38 trillion) for development, INPEPE’s building a Web3 ecosystem to keep the cash flowing smoothly. Every influencer post to millions of followers could send INPEPE soaring—PEPE’s viral days are fading, and INPEPE’s real-world utility is the future. The presale’s your golden ticket—$0.0000001781 won’t last long! Join the INPEPE presale. Get Involved Today Fascinated by Influencer Pepe’s influence on marketing trends?

This neutral funding stance occurred even as Bitcoin rose 1.9% daily to trade at $83,586 and Ethereum gained 2.2% to $1,813.

According to the bill authored and introduced in the Louisiana Senate by Senator Rick Edwards, any activity related to election betting will be banned if it passes. This would mean that accepting and placing bets on any elections is illegal. The wording of the Louisiana bill , Senate Bill 90, sought to cover all aspects related to betting on political elections. “No person shall knowingly, willfully, or intentionally participate in any bet or wager that is based upon any contingency whatsoever that arises from an election,” it read. Louisiana wants to outlaw election betting The Louisiana bill also clarified that the bets would have to satisfy some conditions to be termed illegal. Some of the conditions include making an offer or wager, accepting any offer or wager, taking a share or monetary interest in a bet or wager, and acting in a way or manner that shows relation to a bet or wager on an election. The proposed penalty is the same as the current penalties for election violators. For first offenders, a fine of $1,000 or a jail term of up to a year, while repeat offenders are to pay a fine of $2,500 or a jail term of up to five years. Online sports betting has been legal in Louisiana since 2022. Last October and November, several bets were placed online during the election season. Several platforms ran election markets, with most residents trying to make profits from the election. The state collects a considerable amount in taxes from online betting, with February alone seeing the state net more than $7 million in tax, up 87% from February 2024. The growing pattern of election betting was evident in the last United States general election after Polygon-based betting platform Polymarket announced wagers on different markets, including the winner of the presidential election. The platform even went as far as tipping the eventual winner, Donald Trump, to take the coveted office. While the platform was previously used by crypto participants, the markets opened it up to the general American population. States hit betting sites with cease-and-desist letters States in the United States have been hitting betting sites with cease-and-desist orders, putting them all over the news. States like Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, and Nevada have accused several platforms, including Kalshi, Robinhood, and Crypto.com of carrying out unlicensed sports betting. Last year, Kalshi and Robinhood netted about $300 million alone from the United States presidential election. The sites have argued this week that their Super Bowl and March Madness markets do not constitute sports betting. However, they made clearer advertisements during the elections, urging the general public to bet on the elections. Kalshi, for instance, made an ad on Right Side Broadcasting Network, flashing a message that read “Bet on the US election, Bet $100 on Trump, Get $175” across the Madison Square Garden Rally screen during the Donald Trump rally. Kalshi has argued that the advertisements are just for marketing purposes, noting that the “bet” in the statement is only used to consider a financial position. Kalshi is governed by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rather than states. The company has initiated a counter-lawsuit against New Jersey and Nevada over their cease-and-desist letters. The CFTC also tried to bring down all betting markets related to the election last year but failed to do so. A federal judge at the time ruled that “the Commission has not substantiated that risks to election integrity are likely to materialize if Kalshi is allowed to operate its exchange.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Powell & Polymarket Hints, But JP Morgan Warns",https://coingape.com/trending/us-recession-in-2025-powell-polymarket-hints-but-jp-morgan-warns/,"After the introduction of Donald Trump’s tariff, the odds of a US recession have increased. Investors, experts, and even larger institutions like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have updated their predictions concerning investors. The financial markets are already in turmoil, stocks are crashing, cryptos are struggling, and even the hard assets are affected. So, is recession happening in 2025? Let’s discuss this. Trump’s Tariff: More of an Economic Revival or US Recession? Donald Trump introduced tariffs with positive claims toward making the country wealthy, saving American jobs, and boosting domestic production. However, the analysts’ vision speaks of economic uncertainty and US recession ever since Trump introduced universal and reciprocal tariffs. The affected countries, like China, the EU, Japan, and others, are building strategies to tackle these tariffs, with some, like China, applying reverse 34% tariffs while others asking for cooperation. Amid these, the markets are affected, resulting in many calling it the beginning of a financial crisis. The social media platforms are filled with experts concerning rising inflation, declining yield, and eventually, recession in America. At the same time, Fed rate cuts are a must at this time. Even Trump asked Powell for cuts before it got too late in a recent X post. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs & Others Raise US Recession Odds The famous financial institution JP Morgan has increased the chances of a recession to 60% by 2025, mentioning disruptive U.S. policies as the cause. At the same time, Goldman Sachs raised the recession odds from 20% to 35%. Also, the Oxford Economic predicted 4% core inflation and GDP growth at just 1.4%. Moody’s Analytics predict 7.5% unemployment and a 2% GDP contraction if retaliation continues. The investors’ concerns also align with these claims. The Polymarket data reveals that the odds of a US recession surged to 57% after declining from 60% earlier today. Adding to these concerns, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is also not very optimistic about Trump’s tariffs. In a recent business journalism conference, he claimed that these were larger than expected before hinting that the economic fallout could be way worse than anticipated. However, neither he nor the Fed forecasted the recession. Final Thoughts: Recession in 2025? Between Jerome Powell’s indirect concerns, Polymarket probability, and JP Morgan prediction, investors’ bearish sentiments are rising, and the impact is visible on the stock market’s performance . Although it is uncertain what’s coming next, 2025 will certainly be full of economic turning points. Now, all eyes are on the Fed meeting and any positive updates on Trump’s tariff news.

Satoshi Nakamoto turns 50 as Bitcoin becomes US reserve asset Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, marks their 50th birthday amid a year of rising institutional and geopolitical adoption of the world’s first cryptocurrency. The identity of Nakamoto remains one of the biggest mysteries in crypto, with speculation ranging from cryptographers like Adam Back and Nick Szabo to broader theories involving government intelligence agencies. While Nakamoto’s identity remains anonymous, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) creator is believed to have turned 50 on April 5 based on details shared in the past. According to archived data from his P2P Foundation profile, Nakamoto once claimed to be a 37-year-old man living in Japan and listed his birthdate as April 5, 1975. Source: Web.archive.org Nakamoto’s anonymity has played a vital role in maintaining the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network, which has no central authority or leadership. The Bitcoin wallet associated with Nakamoto, which holds over 1 million BTC, has laid dormant for more than 16 years despite BTC rising from $0 to an all-time high above $109,000 in January. SEC paints ‘a distorted picture’ of USD-stablecoin market — Crenshaw US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner and vocal crypto critic Caroline Crenshaw has accused the US regulator of downplaying risks and misrepresenting the US stablecoin market in its newly published guidelines. However, many in the crypto industry see the SEC’s decision as a step in the right direction. In an April 4 statement, Crenshaw, who is widely known for opposing the spot Bitcoin ETFs, said that the SEC's statement on stablecoins contained ""legal and factual errors that paint a distorted picture of the USD-stablecoin market that drastically understates its risks."" Under the new SEC guidelines, stablecoins that meet certain criteria are now considered ""non-securities"" and are exempt from transaction reporting requirements. Crenshaw disputed the accuracy of the analysis made by the SEC in arriving at that decision. She pushed back on the SEC for reiterating issuer actions ""that supposedly stabilize price, ensure redeemability, and otherwise reduce risk."" SEC lays out guidelines for stablecoins, excludes algorithmic tokens The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released a statement on April 4 establishing guidelines for stablecoins . In an April 4 statement, the agency minted a new term, ""covered stablecoins,"" classifying them as non-securities and exempting such tokens’ transactions from reporting requirements. According to the SEC's definition , a ""covered stablecoin"" is fully backed by physical fiat reserves or short-term, low-risk, highly liquid instruments and is fully redeemable at a 1:1 ratio with US dollars. The definition precludes algorithmic stablecoins that maintain their US dollar peg using software or an automated trading strategy, leaving the regulatory status of algorithmic stablecoins, synthetic dollars, and yield-bearing fiat tokens uncertain.

Source: RWA.XYZ Industry leaders and executives are currently pushing for regulatory changes that would allow stablecoin issuers to share yield opportunities with stablecoin holders and offer onchain interest .

Bitcoin ( BTC ) is holding firm while the stock market melts down, with several altcoins soaring as global markets reel from President Trump’s newly announced tariffs on Chinese imports. The world’s leading cryptocurrency has officially outperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 on a year-to-date basis, despite staying relatively flat this week. Meanwhile, U.S. equities took a historic tumble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost a staggering 2,200 points on Friday alone, following a 1,200-point drop the day prior—wiping out $5.4 trillion in value across American stocks in just two days. Since February, the Dow has dropped from $45,000 to $38,200, while the Nasdaq 100 has fallen from $22,220 to $13,400, and the S&P 500 slipped from $6,145 to $5,000. This turmoil followed Trump’s imposition of a sweeping 34% tariff on all Chinese imports, a move that triggered immediate retaliation from Beijing. The fear and greed index—a widely watched sentiment gauge—plunged to 6, its lowest reading in years, as investors scrambled for safety. Oddly enough, that safe haven may have included crypto.

On Saturday, April 5, the exchange revealed in an official announcement that users remain poised to partake in BABYUSDT perpetual contract trading shortly ahead. Mentioned below are some vital details market participants should know as they look to capitalize on such emerging market opportunities. Binance Announces Futures Listing For Babylon An official release by the crypto exchange revealed that its ‘Futures’ division is adding a BABYUSDT perpetual contract to its stockpile of offerings. Starting today at 13:30 UTC, the platform’s colossal user base can avail of this trade offering with up to 5x leverage. Moving on to other details, the capped funding rate for this project was at +2.00% / -2.00%. Babylon is a Bitcoin staking protocol that permits users to stake their BTC in exchange for earning rewards. Why Did Binance Add BABYUSDT? According to the CEX’s announcement, this decision comes primarily to expand the list of trading choices offered to users on the platform. The crypto exchange titan continues to cement its global ranking by tapping into emerging markets across the globe. What’s More? Binance added that it will apply the ‘Mark Price’ methodology for the asset’s pre-market futures trading period. Notably, the BABYUSDT perpetual contract is a pre-market futures contract where the price is calculated strategically. Traders can move on to the official announcement to know more about ‘Mark Price.’ “Pre-market perpetual futures contracts will be converted to standard perpetual futures contracts when a stable index price can be derived from the spot market,” the top exchange clarified. Further, the pre-market trading end will be announced separately to avoid user misunderstanding. Altogether, the enhanced market support for the Bitcoin staking protocol has captured noteworthy attention towards the project as one of the top crypto exchanges supports it. Recent Listings On Binance Gain Traction Simultaneously, it’s worth pointing out some other recent listings on the leading crypto exchange. CoinGape recently reported that the exchange listed Broccoli , TUT, and other 4 crypto and offered support to their market dynamics. On the other hand, the CEX again sidelined the Pi Network listing despite the crypto’s burgeoning popularity. Crypto market watchers extensively eye the exchange’s trade offering updates in order to capitalize on emerging market opportunities.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Fair winds The narrative In November 2024, a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) couldn't sanction smart contracts tied to crypto mixer Tornado Cash. Last month, OFAC delisted Tornado Cash entirely, though it left developer Roman Semenov on its Specially Designated Nationals list. Why it matters Whether Tornado Cash could be sanctioned to begin with has been a point of contention for the crypto industry. The Fifth Circuit ruling sparked a rally in the TORN token's price and raised hopes that it would be more difficult for the U.S. government to block legal uses of mixers. Breaking it down Tornado Cash's delisting included smart contract addresses and other components of the overall mixer, and followed November's ruling . The delisting may have been an effort to preempt a court ruling that would force OFAC to permanently delist Tornado Cash. Backing up a little: A group of developers sued OFAC after Tornado Cash was first sanctioned with backing from crypto exchange Coinbase. That case, Van Loon v. Treasury , received an initial ruling from a district court judge that was favorable to the Treasury Department. On appeal, however, the Fifth Circuit ruled — somewhat narrowly — that smart contracts were outside the scope of OFAC's jurisdiction. The appeals court panel threw the case back down to the district court to sort out next steps. On March 21, the same day it removed Tornado Cash from its sanctions list, OFAC filed a notice telling the court that the removal meant the legal case remedies cot ""the matter is now moot."" Peter Van Valkenburgh, the executive director at Coin Center, said the November decision left OFAC with few options. ""They could have waited for the court to invalidate the sanctions or they could have delisted them themselves, and they delisted themselves,"" he said. ""You can read that two ways. You can read that as 'I want to try and preserve some ability to fight in the future or [make] some other listing,' [and] that's really tough because that Fifth Circuit opinion is really bad for them."" The other read for the delisting is OFAC just wanted the matter resolved quickly, he said. Leah Moushey, an attorney with Miller & Chevalier, said the court may choose to reject OFAC's filing because there's an open question as to whether Tornado Cash can be redesignated in the future. She pointed to a Supreme Court case with thematic similarities. The court said in that case, FBI v. Fikre , that the U.S. government had not sufficiently proven that just removing an individual from a no-fly list meant he would never be placed back on the list. OFAC may have to show in this case that Tornado Cash can't be designated again. Another open question for Tornado Cash is whether the delisting has any bearing on the U.S. Department of Justice's criminal case against developer Roman Storm. After the Fifth Circuit ruling, Storm's attorneys filed a motion asking the judge overseeing the criminal case to dismiss the indictment, but the judge has already ruled that the case should move forward. ""The judge determined that the scope of the conduct went beyond the interactions with the smart contract,"" Moushey said. The Fifth Circuit ruling did not discuss Tornado Cash as an entity. Van Valkenburgh noted that OFAC left its sanctions against Semenov in place, and the DOJ will continue to try and argue Storm conspired to violate sanctions. The Storm case is currently set for trial in July.

Analysts warn that if selling pressure intensifies, SOL could drop below $100, erasing a significant portion of its recent gains. With investors looking for alternatives, one project is rapidly gaining attention, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Given its $0.025 price and rapidly growing adoption, even a modest surge could generate life-changing returns. The presale is now in phase 4 after selling out the third one faster than expected. Over $6.2 million has been raised, attracting more than 7900 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.025 before the price jumps 20% to $0.03 in phase 5. Those buying today are set for a 140% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. MUTM could 38x by July. Mutuum Finance presale surges as investor interest grows Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending with its cutting-edge dual-lending model, which has driven rapid adoption. With over 7900 investors contributing $6.2 million during the presale, confidence in the project continues to grow. Currently trading at $0.025 in Phase 4, the price is set for a 20% jump in Phase 5, giving investors an opportunity for significant gains. Combining high market demand with unique lending mechanics, analysts see MUTM as one of the most undervalued yet promising DeFi projects, with the potential to surpass $1 post-launch. Mutuum Finance makes its lending platform stand out because it unites both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. Users participating in P2C model liquidity pools can obtain passive income through smart contract-based automated USDT lending operations. Users who select P2P transactions handle their money directly through peer-to-peer deals which bypass financial institutions. Mutuum Finance combines P2C and P2P models to create features which improve protection along with efficiency and decentralization and thus aligns well with DeFi investors who want yield-bearing alternatives. Building a secure and stable ecosystem As proof of its commitment to stability, Mutuum Finance is issuing a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins, which have been criticized for potentially leading to insolvency, this token will be over-collateralized to minimize risk and make it trustworthy in the long term. Combined with open financial architectures and audited smart contracts, this architecture increases investor trust while filling the biggest gaps seen in past DeFi projects. Rewarding early investors and growing the community The company makes continuous community expansion possible through generous rewards programs. The giveaway provides 10 lucky winners with MUTM tokens worth $10,000 from a $100,000 fund and the referral program compensates users for referring new investors. Platform users who join at an early stage get premium staking pools alongside governance power along with exclusive updates while continuing their relationship with the platform. Sustainable tokenomics for long-term growth Tokenomics mechanisms of the project create controlled distribution and maintain lasting value growth. The presale token distribution limitation together with deflationary mechanisms enables Mutuum Finance to maintain token scarcity that might fuel price elevation. Through its staking system the project offers valuable benefits which motivate constant user engagement while supporting the token’s continuous development throughout the system.

The shift follows recent disappointment tied to memecoin launches associated with US President Donald Trump. The industry’s most successful cryptocurrency traders by returns — tracked as “smart money” traders on Nansen’s blockchain intelligence platform — continue hunting for quick memecoin returns. While growing stablecoin holdings show increased caution, smart money remains open to speculative plays, according to Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen. “There was the recent meme surge and smart money is always happy to capitulate on that. But they’re also happy to rotate out of these quickly as well,” he said during Cointelegraph’s Chainreaction live show on X. “The recent meme frenzy was just a fun play they worked on, while the broader market is sorting out the direction because memecoins aren’t necessarily affected by the same macroeconomy as Bitcoin and Ethereum,” he added.

Total active wallets on Pump.fun fell from 2.85 million on the week of Jan. 20 to just 1.44 million as of March 31. The decline is mainly attributed to a decay in investor sentiment, a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding: “Market sentiment also appears to have shifted amid unverified reports of insider trading linked to subsequent high-profile tokens such as $MELANIA and $LIBRA.” “Broader macroeconomic uncertainty, including volatility driven by global tariff policies, may have further dampened speculative appetite for memecoins more generally,” the spokesperson said.

With the growth and integration of the cryptocurrency industry, several jurisdictions around the world have begun creating stablecoin-specific regulations to control the effects on their financial systems. These new laws could impact several businesses. Tether, in particular has faced setbacks in certain markets. Earlier this week, Binance delisted USDT from its European sites, as the stablecoin does not comply with the European Union’s new requirements for stablecoin issuers. Ardoino, the CEO, stated that despite the company’s investments in multiple European companies launching grassroots dollar- and euro-backed stablecoins compliant with EU regulations, he pictures a future long-term reality in which USDT is no longer a major player in either the United States or Europe. Now facing a ban in the U.S., the company is open to considering alternatives. Tether could issue a new stablecoin Tether is contemplating a new, U.S.-domiciled stablecoin to comply with the new regulations imposed by the Trump administration. The U.S. Congress has made changes to legislation to create clearer rules and regulations for stablecoins. The proposed bills, notably the STABLE and GENIUS Acts, seek to impose strict supervision on stablecoin issuers. This supervision will include mandatory reserve requirements and regular audits. These measures are aimed at enhancing transparency and ensuring the financial stability of these digital assets.​ The GENIUS Act, introduced by Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, is particularly noteworthy. The bill necessitates that stablecoin issuers with assets exceeding $10B must undergo strict federal supervision, including monthly disclosures of reserve compositions to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. This level of scrutiny is unprecedented for Tether, which has historically operated with limited regulatory oversight. The company is a $144B stablecoin giant and has never submitted to a full financial audit. As such, it is particularly difficult to comply with these regulations. Critics and competitors of the company have argued it would exit the U.S. altogether if it was forced to comply with the country’s anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering rules. Ardoino emphasized Tether’s commitment to compliance and transparency in an interview with The Guardian. He referenced his company’s cooperation with over 200 agencies worldwide to combat illicit activities. Even then, adapting USDT to meet the specific requirements of the new STABLE and GENIUS Acts will be challenging for the company. That’s why it’s looking at a new stablecoin better specifically for the U.S. market.​ USDT alternatives are jockeying for Tether’s spot Competitors like Circle , the issuer of USDC, are well-positioned to capitalize on the emerging regulatory framework. Circle has demonstrated a strong commitment to transparency. The company is regularly audited by Deloitte, and as such compliance to the new U.S. regulations should not be an issue for the company. Its compliance readiness may also create an avenue for Circle to get a competitive edge over Tether, which could potentially reshape the dynamics of the stablecoin market. Ardoino maintains that Tether has “the highest level of compliance” among its competitors when it comes to cooperation with law enforcement. He stated that Tether is currently in conversations with multiple accounting firms about a full audit but that the firms have so far been rightfully cautious about engaging with the novel stablecoin market. Ardoino also bashed his competitors , claiming that he would stay out of the U.S. due to the new regulations. He perceives “the smell of desperation” from these companies and says that they are simply hoping that his company would stay out of the United States. The Tether CEO has said he believes that USDT will remain listed on U.S. secondary markets. He added that the access to USDT globally is “very important for remittances.” Presently, the Senate’s stablecoin bill only bans non-compliant stablecoin issuers from offering tokens directly to American users. The House bill goes further and bans the trade of such non-compliant tokens on exchange platforms like Coinbase two years after the law goes into effect.

Ethereum (ETH) Posted 4 Straight Months of Losses,https://cryptopotato.com/what-bull-run-ethereum-eth-posted-4-straight-months-of-losses/,"The predominant belief is that the cryptocurrency market is in a bull market state that started somewhere around the US elections. Although the past few months didn’t go all that well for most cryptocurrencies, many analysts believe this is just a traditional correction in the broader bull cycle. But is that true for all digital assets? Let’s check out ETH. 4 Red in a Row The overall landscape around Ethereum is not all that promising. The largest PoS blockchain faces a substantial revenue decline in terms of fees, while the network itself saw a delay in implementing the next big update, Pectra. In addition, the network activity has slumped to new lows, which ultimately increases the production of ETH and thus raises the token’s inflation rates. Something that the Merge was supposed to prevent. Whether these reasons are to blame or there’s more, the undeniable fact is that ETH has underperformed in the past year, and especially since the start of the aforementioned bull market. Back then, the second-largest cryptocurrency stood at $2,400. In the following months, it exploded to over $4,000 on a couple of occasions but couldn’t maintain its momentum and was stopped there. Not only did it fail to chart a new all-time high, unlike its main rival Solana or even Bitcoin, but the subsequent correction (or end of bull market if you wish) pushed it south so hard that it plunged below $2,000. Its crash went further, driving it down to $1,800 as of now. This means that ETH has erased all the post-election gains and more, as it currently trades 25% lower than it did on November 5. The monthly charts paint a clear and painful picture. After the explosive November, when ETH closed with a 47% surge, the following four months ended in the red. February and March were particularly violent, with monthly declines of 32% and 18.7%, respectively. Ethereum Monthly Returns. Source: CoinGlass As the graph by CoinGlass shows, ETH’s monthly closures were in the red in nine out of the last 12 months. What’s Ahead? With ETH also marking its worst quarterly performance since 2018 with the end of Q1, the focus now goes to – what’s next? Obviously, making predictions about any asset’s future performance is nothing short of speculation. However, we can check what history tells us. While some analysts believe the current Ethereum prices are a gift for long-term holders, ETH’s Q2s are supporting this view, with one big, massive exception. The asset has registered gains in all but two second quarters since 2016. In fact, it was on a roll of six consecutive ones until that streak came to a screeching end in 2022 with a whopping 67% decline. Q2 2023 was back in the green, while last year’s ended with a minor decline. So, yes, history is no indication of future price performances, but desperate ETH bulls will certainly hope to reignite the 2016-2021 streak, especially given the triple-digit surge in 2017.

Notably, the US Treasury Secretary’s statement comes in response to Bitcoin’s recent decoupling from traditional markets. Let’s discuss how Bessent evaluated the cryptocurrency’s rebound. Scott Bessent Compares Bitcoin To Gold, Calls It a Store of Value In an interview with podcaster Tucker Carlson, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has shared his view on the recent rebound of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin remains stable around the $83k level despite the stock market’s largest collapse since 2020, Bessent hails it an “emerging store of value.” In addition, the Treasury Secretary presented an analogy between Bitcoin and gold, emphasizing the assets’ potential. He stated, “Bitcoin is becoming a store of value, gold’s has historically been a store of value, a lot of different stores of value over time.” Stock Market Falls, Bitcoin Remains Strong Scott Bessent’s optimistic comments on Bitcoin comes in response to its recent stability despite the broader negative trend. Following Donald Trump’s tariff announcement, the stock market around the world fell sharply. Bucking the trend, BTC remains stable around a significant point of $83,000. Recently, Matrixport, a financial services platform, spotted a strong correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market. Though BTC remained resilient to the previous equity market crash, Matrixport predicted that the cryptocurrency would follow stock market trends following tariff announcement. In its latest analysis, Matrixport identified a different sentiment , with BTC poised for a significant upsurge, defying the correlation. Tariffs May Lead to Long-Term Negotiation, Says Scott Bessent In response to the market volatility after Trump’s tariff announcement, Scott Bessent opined that this could lead to a longer negotiation process. While this prolonged period could include multiple discussions between nations, it could result in market volatility, economic uncertainty, and potentially even inflation. In such a scenario, investors could look for alternative assets like Bitcoin as a hedge. Commenting on this potential market shift, David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, stated, As risk assets continue to sell off, investors may increasingly rotate into traditional hedges like bonds and gold—or into bitcoin, which has shown notable resilience relative to equities in recent days. Gold, a traditional safe haven asset, is up around 15% so far this year as traders and central banks buy it to hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties…Bitcoin’s price action this week has been a true testament to its investment case as an emerging store of value and potential for uncorrelated returns. As of press time, Bitcoin trades at $83, 403, up 1.17% in a day. Despite a 0.11% hike over the last seven days, BTC dropped by nearly 8% in a month.

While XRP is showing resilience, another altcoin, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , is disrupting the crypto space by merging with GameFi. Yeti Ouro’s presale success is proving that utility-driven tokens are the future of blockchain-based gaming. XRP Price Volatility For a long time, XRP struggled to break past the $1 mark, until a strong rally toward the end of last year propelled the asset upward. Over the past year, XRP price has gained a staggering 246.32%, currently trading at $2.01. However, despite this impressive growth, the token is down 4.99% in the last 24 hours at the time of press, with a market cap of $116.97 billion according to CoinMarketCap . XRP’s recent sharp decline has led to speculation on whether the asset has reached a generational bottom, setting the stage for a significant reversal. Historically, XRP price has experienced similar corrections, often followed by strong rebounds. Analysts are positive that this is just another panic-causing selling off, which, like in the past, has led to a strong XRP price comeback Yeti Ouro (YETIO) Presale Disrupts The Market While XRP faces price fluctuations, Yeti Ouro is dominating the meme coin market by integrating real-world utility with GameFi. The token, currently in Stage 3 of its presale, has raised $3.19 million and sold 211.6 million tokens. The Stage 3 price is $0.024 per YETIO.

The trader, pseudonymously known as Altcoin Sherpa, tells his 243,700 followers on the social media platform X that the utility token of the decentralized bandwidth crypto project Grass ( GRASS ) is looking “extremely strong” following a 25% rally in just a day that effectively reversed a rout that came amid a crypto market-wide slump. According to the pseudonymous analyst, GRASS is likely to experience a pullback before resuming the rally. Based on Sherpa’s chart on the four-hour time frame, it appears the widely followed trader is suggesting that GRASS could correct by around 15% before rallying by over 20% in a matter of days. “Holy s**t what a reversal. Cream rises to the top, this is one of the best coins still.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X GRASS is trading at $1.89 at time of writing. The pseudonymous trader says that altcoins are yet to bottom out and are likely to enjoy a consolidation period of up to two months before a rally ensues. “Wouldn’t be surprised to see another month or two of chop. That doesn’t mean we’re not going to see big moves up or down, we already have. But the real meat of this move comes in the early parts of the summer, in my opinion, guessing May/June.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

As multiple analysts continue to speculate on the asset’s next movement, prominent market expert Ali Martinez has identified two resistance zones that could be pivotal to reigniting a crypto bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Safe, Saylor Says, While Trump Waves The Tariff Sword Bitcoin Must Break Past $85,470 And $92,950 – Here’s Why Over the past month, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain a sustained uptrend, with investor uncertainty dominating the market. During this period, the leading cryptocurrency has faced multiple rejections, most notably at the $85,000 and $88,000 resistance levels. However, in an X post on Friday, Martinez identified the two resistance zones critical to a Bitcoin bull rally using on-chain data from IntoTheBlock. According to the crypto analyst, the first resistance lies at $85,470 which marks the upper boundary of a price barrier that begins at $83,023. Notably, 1.13 million wallet addresses have traded 607,200 BTC within this price range suggesting a strong historical activity that backs potential heavy selling pressure at these levels. If Bitcoin bulls can push past this initial threshold, the next resistance zone lies at $92,950 – the lower boundary of another price ceiling that extends to $95,514. Compared to the initial resistance, this zone has seen lower investor participation, with 795,830 active wallet addresses. However, its potential market impact is more significant, as approximately 627,410 BTC have been traded within this range. If Bitcoin can successfully clear both resistance zones, Ali Martinez postulates the premier cryptocurrency could enter a prolonged uptrend and resume its bull rally. However, Bitcoin bulls must avoid any price fall below a crucial support zone at the $80,450 price level. According to the on-chain data presented, the $80,450 level represents the lower boundary of a key support zone, which extends up to $82,907. Within this range, approximately 516,770 BTC have been transacted, involving around 738,580 active wallet addresses. This data indicates substantial buying activity that could serve as a buffer in the advent of a price fall. Related Reading: Is Korea Propping Up The XRP Price? Pundit Explains What’s Happening Bitcoin Fees Fall By 57% In other developments, IntoThe Block also reports that Bitcoin network fees dropped by 57.3% in the past week indicating a decline in user engagement and general investor activity. Albeit, the premier cryptocurrency has shown only a minor 0.11% decline in price during this period. Following the recent announcement of new US tariffs on imports, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have responded more positively compared to previous tariff-related news. Ryan Rasmussen, Head of Research at Bitwise Invest, notes that Bitcoin has risen by 2.2% since the announcement on April 2. In contrast, traditional stock markets have seen notable losses, with the “Magnificent Seven” falling by an average of 12.18%.

After President Donald Trump unveiled new tariffs on April 2, the stock market experienced two days of turmoil. By Friday evening: The S&P 500 closed down 6% The Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 2,200 points, or about 5.5%. The Russell 2000 Index, a small-cap stock index, slipped 4%. Since its December high, the Nasdaq is down 22%. Since its February high, the S&P is down about 17%. Some crypto-related stocks did better than these equities during the week. Strategy, for example, rose by over 6.7%. The company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, was founded by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor. Coinbase, the biggest crypto exchange in the US, dropped by just 3%, while Marathon Digital, Cipher Mining, and Riot Platforms fell by less than 5%. Crypto stocks vs S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index | Source: TradingView These stocks did better than the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices because Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum ( ETH ), Ripple ( XRP ), and Binance Coin ( BNB ) were relatively unchanged. Bitcoin price rose by 2.5% in the last five days, while XRP rose by 2.7%. Ether and BNB remained in a consolidation phase. Historically, these crypto stocks track the performance of Bitcoin and other major coins. Bitcoin vs XRP vs BNB vs ETH | Source: crypto.news A likely catalyst for the strong Bitcoin performance was a bullish statement by Larry Fink, the head of Blackrock. In his annual letter to investors, Fink warned that the U.S. dollar was facing an elevated risk from Bitcoin. He cited the rising U.S. debt as a big risk to the US economy. Bitcoin also held steady as investors viewed it as an alternative to gold, the best-known safe haven asset whose price has soared to a record high. You might also like: Bitcoin holds steady amid stock market crash, says Unchained analyst Crypto stocks not exposed to AI and tariffs The other main reason crypto stocks did relatively well is that they are not exposed to the artificial intelligence industry. Investors and analysts are concerned that the AI theme that has driven the stock market in the past few years is slowing. This explains why top AI stocks like AMD, NVIDIA, and SoundHound have underperformed the broader market. These risks rose this week after reports confirmed that Microsoft was slowing its investments in data centers globally. Some analysts cautioned that there was an oversupply of data centers compared to demand. Crypto stocks also held steady because of their little exposure to Donald Trump’s trade war. The reciprocal tariffs will not affect these firms because of the nature of their business. For example, Strategy’s most important business is accumulating Bitcoin, with its software service playing a minor role. Crypto stocks remained steady after odds that Paul Atkins would be confirmed to be the next head of the Securities and Exchange Commission as he advanced from the banking committee.

42949314,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63016,1743864100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Analysis: Rebound is on Watch,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-analysis-rebound-is-on-watch/,"XRP is showing signs of life after a recent decline , closing the daily session at $2.1320 with a modest gain of 0.79%. Following a corrective structure in recent weeks, XRP is attempting to rebound from local lows. But is this just a relief bounce, or the beginning of a new rally? Let’s break down the technical setup and project XRP’s potential next move over the next 48 hours. Price Trend: Bearish Correction with Reversal Hints The current price action reveals that XRP has been in a descending correction from the highs above $3.00. However, the recent stabilization around the $2.00–$2.10 area is notable, indicating potential demand stepping in. Despite the prevailing downtrend, the formation of higher lows on lower timeframes is an early sign that bulls may be gaining confidence. Key Support and Resistance Levels Support Zones: $2.00 – $2.10: Strong horizontal support from recent price action and bounce zone. $1.85 – $1.90: A deeper level that would come into play on breakdown of $2.00. Resistance Zones: $2.30: Immediate resistance to watch—coincides with a prior breakdown level. $2.50 – $2.60: Key swing zone and mid-March resistance; breakout above this may trigger bullish continuation. Indicators Review MACD (12, 26, 9): The MACD Line (-0.0795) is below the Signal Line (-0.0649), but the gap is narrowing. Histogram is shrinking, showing that bearish momentum is weakening. A bullish crossover could occur in the next 1–2 days, adding to reversal potential. ADR (14): The ADR is gradually decreasing, currently around 0.03–0.04, indicating reduced volatility. This compression phase often leads to a breakout or directional push. Volume Profile: Volume sits at 44.39M, relatively average but showing slight uptick on green days. Lack of major spikes suggests cautious optimism rather than aggressive accumulation. Next Price Action & 48-Hour Prediction Given current structure and indicators: Bullish Scenario (More Likely): XRP holds above $2.10 and pushes toward $2.30 in the next 48 hours. A MACD bullish crossover could be the catalyst. If broken, the next target is $2.50. Bearish Scenario (If Support Breaks): A daily close below $2.00 could invalidate this bullish bias. Next support would be around $1.85–$1.90. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Rebound is on Watch XRP is at a technical pivot point. With momentum indicators like MACD flattening and a series of higher lows forming, the odds are leaning toward a short-term bullish move. The setup favors a test of $2.30–$2.50 in the coming 48 hours—provided that the $2.00 support holds firmly. Traders should watch for a MACD crossover and a breakout above $2.30 for confirmation of this reversal. On the flip side, a rejection below $2.00 may indicate more downside to come. Stay sharp—XRP could be gearing up for its next breakout phase. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The U.S. tariffs have caused the largest stock market meltdown since the pandemic, and China has harshly criticized them. In response, it announced on April 4 that it would impose its export limitations and import taxes. China’s state media uses AI to highlight the impact of Trump’s tariffs One of the Chinese state media’s videos posted on the website of China’s CGTN, a state-run English-language broadcaster, showed a woman at a kitchen table staring at an empty fork while an automated female voice sings that on Liberation Day; Trump assured them of the stars. However, tariffs destroyed their low-cost Chinese cars. Moreover, regarding Trump’s use of “Liberation Day” for the day of his tariff announcement, the two-minute, forty-two-second video was accompanied by a warning: “Track is AI-generated. The debt crisis is entirely human-made.” Apart from this video, there was also another artificial intelligence-generated video, which opened a new tab on the state-run news agency Xinhua’s X.com page, representing a robot named TARIFF who decides to self-destruct instead of obeying its creator’s commands for high tariffs that caused “trade wars and unrest.” In addition, the China Global Television Network (CGTN) video also painted a dire picture, with the lyrics — in Chinese and English — spread over images of car factories and humanoid robots dancing in streets that had been lit on fire. The robotic voice sang, “You imposed taxes on every truck and tire. Midwest burning in your dumpster fire.” Economists also commented that Trump’s tariff policies and trade war would more likely lead to higher consumer prices and a slowdown in the United States economy. Trump has called the impacts of some U.S. trade partners levying their own tariffs on American products a “disturbance.” China’s recent action marks the beginning of a massive, never-ending trade war with the United States In what state media referred to as “resolute measures” to protect the second-largest economy in the world, China responded to Donald Trump’s recent tariffs by imposing levies on all American goods and limiting exports of rare earths. On Friday, April 4, a public holiday in China, several ministers announced China’s actions, which followed Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on international trading partners, imposing the highest U.S. duties in a century. Beginning on April 10, President Xi Jinping’s administration will apply a 34% tariff on all U.S. imports, equivalent to the amount of Trump’s alleged reciprocal tariffs on Chinese goods. To add up, Beijing authorities announced additional measures, including immediate restrictions on exporting seven types of rare earths and halting poultry imports from two U.S. businesses. They also placed 11 U.S. defense firms on a list of untrustworthy entities and imposed export restrictions on 16 U.S. companies. Furthermore, China launched an anti-dumping investigation into U.S. and Indian medical CT X-ray tubes, stopped importing sorghum from a U.S. business, and initiated an investigation into possible antitrust violations at DuPont China. In response, Trump swiftly criticized Beijing’s response as the “wrong” move after the move dealt a new blow to international markets. Trump wrote on social media, “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED — THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Yet, amidst the chaos, cryptocurrency prices are showing resiliency, with bitcoin ( BTC ) dropping roughly 6% since the tariffs were unveiled, compared to the Nasdaq’s 11% drop. The broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index, dropped by roughly 4.9% over the same period. To put the sell-off figures into perspective, the total crypto market cap is around $2.65 trillion, according to data from TheTie . In the last 24-hour period, bitcoin dropped 0.3% to $82,619.77, while the broader CD20 went up by roughly 0.2%. At the market close on Friday, most crypto-related stocks fell as well, but some actually moved up. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) rose 0.6%, while Core Scientific (CORZ) saw a 0.4% upward move. Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin with 528,185 BTC on its balance sheet, rose 4%. It significantly outperformed the Nasdaq on Friday, which plunged 5.8%. Cryptocurrency prices are likely to remain resilient. Given their accessibility through traditional investment products, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and their performance, they could be “useful as a TradFi hedge,” according to Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick. “Over the last 36 hours I think we can also add 'US isolation' hedge to the list of bitcoin uses,” Kendrick wrote in an email dated April 4, adding in a chart showing that among the Magnificent 7 stocks, only Microsoft outperformed BTC during the sell-off. The resilience is also coming as the crypto community celebrated the purported birthday of bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. The date is based on the bitcoin creator’s profile with the P2P Foundation. The date, some speculate, isn’t real but instead symbolic. It coincides with the anniversary of Executive Order 6102 , signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 5, 1933. The order required Americans to turn in their gold to the Federal Reserve.

With over 453 million tokens sold, the project has raised $46.6 million, reflecting growing market confidence. At the same time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are holding onto their assets, signaling strong accumulation trends. Rexas Finance Gains Momentum with Final Presale Stage Rexas Finance's integrated platform brings traditional investments such as real estate and art, along with commodities, under blockchain tokenization. Through the platform, users can buy portions of expensive assets, providing entry to lesser investors.

The company aims to list on three major cryptocurrency exchanges which will enhance market excitement. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Increase Retention Amid Positive Indicators Shiba Inu token owners have extended their token possession durations by 30% during the last seven days. According to IntoTheBlock data, investors maintain their position against selling actions, which signals their increasing trust in the market. Because of this pattern, market volatility appears to decrease, while SHIB price stability receives additional support. The daily chart shows positive Balance of Power (BoP) values that validate a bull trend. The Chaikin Money Flow indicator indicates an upward trend which confirms more buying actions in the market. The continued growth of SHIB's market value indicates the potential for its price to increase up to $0.000014. The accumulation activities of SHIB millionaires according to market analysts could indicate future price growth. Organizations that retain customers for longer periods tend to generate demand growth over time. Better performance metrics for SHIB will create more optimism among investors about the future market direction.

However, the direction of the move remains unclear. The Bollinger Bands, a widely used tool for analyzing volatility, provide conflicting signals on different timeframes, leading to two plausible price paths in the near term. Conflicting Signals Between Timeframes On the weekly chart, the lower Bollinger Band is positioned near $1.696. This level acts as a potential support point if downward pressure persists. A move toward this area would indicate a broader weakening trend in the market, possibly signaling a slow retreat in price rather than a sharp decline. The implication is that XRP could enter a phase where selling interest grows gradually, causing buyers to hesitate and short-term holders to exit their positions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In contrast, the daily chart presents a more stable outlook. The middle Bollinger Band is approximately $2.275, representing a possible target if buyers regain control. Should XRP move toward this mid-range level, it would suggest that the current consolidation phase was a temporary pause in upward momentum rather than the beginning of a broader decline. This would not necessarily signal a strong bullish breakout but rather a return to a more neutral, balanced range after the recent underperformance . Bollinger Band Squeeze Indicates Imminent Price Move One key feature across both charts is the narrowing of the Bollinger Bands. This pattern, often called a squeeze, typically signals a period of low volatility before a significant price movement. Although the squeeze does not predict direction, it highlights that the current sideways price action is unlikely to last much longer. In early 2025, a prominent analyst pointed to the Bollinger Bands to predict a price surge, and XRP rose to a multi-year high of $3.39. Given the conflicting signals from the daily and weekly timeframes, the next move will likely depend on which timeframe gains control. If the market leans toward the weekly outlook, then a gradual drift down toward $1.696 becomes more probable, and given recent bearish signals , the asset could fall further. However, if the daily structure dominates, XRP could push back to the $2.275 zone, signaling renewed buying strength. Until the chart provides a clearer signal, it is important not to anticipate a breakout direction prematurely.

Economic instability from the trade war will cause governments to adopt inflationary fiscal and monetary policies, which will further debase currencies and lead to a worldwide flight to safety in alternative stores of value, like Bitcoin, Park argued. This increased demand for BTC will drive prices much higher in the long term, the analyst concluded. In an X post on Feb. 2, Park predicted the immediate impact of a trade war: ""The tariff costs, most likely through higher inflation, will be shared by both the US and trading partners, but the relative impact will be much heavier on foreigners. These countries will then have to find a way to fend off their weak growth issues."" Despite the Increased demand for Bitcoin as a store of value against rapidly depreciating fiat currencies driving BTC prices higher in the long term, global financial markets would feel the short-term pain and wealth destruction of the trade war, according to Park. Bitcoin hit with short-term price shock due to Covid-19 in March 2020 before rallying to all-time highs during the 2020-2021 bull market. Source: TradingView Related: Trump 'Liberation Day' tariffs create chaos in markets, recession concerns Global markets feeling the short-term shock Tariffs are ""stagflationary for the world as a whole,"" economist and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio wrote in an April 2 X post . Tariffs tend to be more deflationary for the levied goods producers and more inflationary for the importing country, Dalio added. He concluded that the level of debt and trade imbalances will ultimately lead to a global financial shift that changes the established monetary order. The US stock market experienced a dramatic sell-off in the wake of sweeping trade tariffs from the Trump admin. Source: TradingView ""If these trade tariffs do lead to a massive trade war, it is going to be very ugly for the whole world,"" Coin Bureau founder and market analyst Nic Puckrin told Cointelegraph in an interview. The analyst said the US economy has a 40% chance of a recession in 2025 amid fears of a lengthy trade war and the macroeconomic uncertainty brought on by protectionist trade policies. No pain, no gain: Short-term shock to drive asset prices higher long-term? Asset manager Anthony Pompliano recently speculated that the US president is deliberately crashing capital markets to force interest rate cuts and lower the costs of servicing the US national debt. Interest rate on the 10-year US Treasury Bond has come down since the start of Trump’s second term. Source: TradingView The interest rate on 10-year US Treasury bonds declined from approximately 4.66% in January to the current rate of 4.00%. Pompliano also concluded that while the current US administration's policies will create short-term pain, the effect of lower interest rates will encourage borrowing and drive risk-on asset prices higher in the long term.

In past months, the industry has been dominated by the narratives around the rise and subsequent fall of memecoins like HAWK, Fartcoin and LIBRA. Rewind to 2021, and lacking a genuine use case, the massive hype around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) failed to translate to long-term success, with the average NFT project today having a lifespan 2.5 times shorter than the average crypto project. For many, however, the appeal of these assets lies in their volatility, turning a few dollars into a fortune overnight. While NFTs and memecoins are undeniably part of Web3 culture, what sustains projects, keeps users engaged, and drives the industry forward is not volatility but providing genuine solutions to real-world problems. Ultimately, it’s about utility. Utility drives stability Many blockchain projects fail because they are solutions searching for a problem rather than solving an existing one. Assets that offer no utility at all are unlikely to be more than a flash-in-the-pan moment of volatile speculation. While digital assets continue pushing technological innovation’s boundaries, human needs for utility and tangible value remain constant. Moreover, a digital asset’s utility promotes stability by shifting focus away from short-term speculation to meaningful engagement. When assessing the stability of a digital asset, its longevity is far more telling than short-term price swings. Volatility is inherent in crypto, but the accurate measure of resilience is whether a project can endure across market cycles. Fan tokens have demonstrated this stability, whereas NFTs — despite their initial boom — have struggled mainly to maintain long-term value beyond speculative hype. While memecoins certainly generate hype, their longevity is fleeting. 97% of memecoins launched in 2024 have already failed. There are exceptions, of course, but the overwhelming majority don’t stand the test of time. In contrast, sports clubs have been issuing fan tokens since 2018, weathering both bull and bear markets. Their resilience comes from utility — fan tokens continuously evolve to reimagine fan engagement, bringing fans and clubs closer together. Solve problems, create value, establish longevity The connection between utility and stability is clear. Digital assets that solve real-world problems foster sustainable adoption. Instead of attracting speculators hoping for quick profits, utility-driven assets bring in users with a genuine need for or interest in the project. The rise of stablecoins underscores the importance of utility. Recent: F an tokens offer stability — NFTs have not Over the past six months, stablecoin market capitalization has grown from $160 billion to $230 billion. According to DeSpread Research , in 2021, there were 27 stablecoins. By July 2024, there were 182, representing a 574% growth rate over three years. The reason? Stablecoins provide users real utility, whether you’re a small business owner looking to transact across borders or a developer looking for liquidity for your decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Another indicator of an asset’s utility is institutional adoption. To put it bluntly, BlackRock invests in Bitcoin ( BTC ). It offers BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — not Fartcoin — because institutions prioritize assets with a proven track record of creating tangible value for their customers over short-lived, hype-filled speculation. For sports fans, emotional connections to their teams run deep — even if they’ve never set foot in their team’s stadium. Fan tokens fill this gap and tap into this emotional connection by offering more ways for fans to engage with their teams through direct participation and rewards — no matter where they are in the world. Whether voting on team decisions, accessing exclusive deals, staking fan tokens for additional perks or simply owning a piece of their team’s digital identity, fan tokens provide utility through their lifecycle. The future of digital assets To bring it full circle, Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision for Bitcoin was to solve a problem: an unfair financial system. 16 years later, despite the many applications of blockchain technology, this remains the reality of the asset. The future of digital assets will be defined by their ability to solve real-world problems, which is recognized by the clubs themselves. This is why they don’t just issue fan tokens — they actively grant their IP rights to strengthen trust and credibility in the asset. When some of the world’s most iconic sports brands embrace blockchain technology this way, it’s a clear signal that the next era of fan engagement isn’t on the horizon — it’s already here. And we’re only just getting started. Beyond fan tokens, blockchain is transforming the sports industry across multiple dimensions, with each use case becoming increasingly interconnected. Take Tether’s recent investment in Juventus. The surge in the price of Juventus’ fan token underscores how deeply blockchain and crypto intersect across investment, sponsorship and fan engagement. With crypto sponsorships in sports surging in 2024, this convergence will only accelerate as clubs, leagues and brands explore new ways to harness Web3 technology — creating richer, more interactive fan experiences while unlocking new revenue streams.

With network congestion issues and rising competition in the blockchain space, SOL holders are beginning to explore alternative opportunities, leading many to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi star. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are available in Phase 4 presale for $0.025 per token during the present phase. Phase 5 price will increase to $0.03 after the phase 4 finishes. Since its launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has collected $6.2 million through the investments of more than 7900 holders. Solana’s Struggles: Investors Seeking Alternatives Amid Growing Concerns Solana (SOL) has faced significant challenges lately, with its price hovering around $130 while showing signs of weakness. Investors are becoming increasingly concerned about the network’s congestion issues and the rising competition from other blockchain projects. These struggles have led to a shift in focus, as SOL holders look for more promising opportunities, especially in the DeFi space. As newer platforms emerge with innovative solutions, many are now turning their attention to projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining traction due to its potential and favorable early-stage investment opportunities. Mutuum Finance: Transforming DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance has succeeded in attracting many investors through its attractive opportunity structure. Mutuum Finance introduces innovative financial services through its next-generation dual-lending approach which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) smart contracts operate lending pools through the process of receiving USDT stablecoins to issue ETH asset-backed loans. Users maintain exclusive ownership of their confidential loan arrangements through the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system because it operates without requiring any intermediaries. Users can access maximum security and adaptive operations together with profit generation through current APY rates that reach up to 10% during liquidity provision. The platform prioritizes both security and transparency by having third-party examine all procedures and implementing open-source smart contracts to build user trust. The platform will stabilize its operations through introducing a stablecoin which backs USD value together with fee-supported token buyback procedures to maintain price stability over the duration. Stakeholders who can obtain staking rewards gain financial incentives for keeping their liquidity on the platform thus building stronger confidence throughout the system. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 7800 investors. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity Throughout the Phase 4 presale event people may purchase MUTM tokens at their initial value of $0.025. Throughout its 11-staged sale period the MUTM token price growth will expand from $0.025 to $0.06 to create up to 140% investor gains before trading commencement. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens will achieve a price of $3 after the launch becoming a leading DeFi token in 2025. The current MUTM raise now exceeds $6.2 million. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives User adoption can increase through Mutuum Finance since it offers a $100,000 prize giveaway that transfers $10,000 MUTM tokens to each of ten users. The platform supports user-driven investor acquisition which results in enhanced site worth because both functions contribute to community enhancement metrics. A growing number of Solana (SOL) investors search for MUTM as their preferred alternative because of Solana’s network congestion together with intensifying competition. MUTM gains traction due to its Phase 4 presale success in collecting $6.2 million from 7900 investors. The dual-lending structure of the platform combined with its substantial predicted growth strategy up to 62x sends strong investment signals to potential buyers. During the presale period the MUTM token value will rise which provides investors with a restricted buying period to get tokens before their future value increase.

So, who are the top contenders? Shiba Inu, XRP, and an exciting new project that’s turning heads— Lightchain AI . Currently priced at just $0.007 during its presale, Lightchain AI has already raised an impressive $18.9 million, showing just how much early interest it’s generating. With all the hype, the big question is: which of these tokens could turn a small investment into a life-changing opportunity? As Lightchain AI gains momentum with its cutting-edge technology, everyone’s watching to see if this under-the-radar project can live up to expectations. Exciting times ahead! Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Can Lightning Strike Twice? ​Shiba Inu (SHIB) received immense popularity in 2021 through an unprecedented upsurge, the price action of which has transformed small purchases into huge gains. Just to give you an idea, investing $5,000 at the beginning of the project would have made you as rich as the 11th richest person in the world with over $7 billion. SHIB’s current price stands at about $0.00001218. According to some of the most optimistic cryptocurrency specialists, SHIB’s potential to grow is quite high, and they forecast the price of $0.000025 by April 2025, to surge up to $0.0000721 within the same year. Factors that shape this view include more token burnings, the onset of an accumulation trend for whales, and general trends in the market. Nevertheless, it is important to note that there’s no guarantee that the market would be stable in the future, as it is subject to high volatility. While SHIB indeed creates excitement about its future potential, investors should be cautious and undertake detailed research before proceeding with their investment​. XRP – Old Giant, New Questions XRP was once a powerhouse in the crypto world, but now it stands in a new reality—one filled with both fresh opportunities and lingering skepticism. As an early pioneer of fast, low-cost cross-border payments, XRP gained serious traction with institutions. But its momentum stalled during a drawn-out legal battle with the SEC. Now, with partial victories behind it, XRP is staging a comeback. The problem? The market has changed. New competitors have emerged, regulations are shifting, and investors are more cautious than ever. Can XRP rise to the challenge and reclaim its place in an ever-evolving crypto landscape? As 2025 unfolds, XRP is at a pivotal moment—still a heavyweight by reputation, but in need of a bold move to reignite its spark and prove its future is brighter than its past. Lightchain AI – Investor’s Top Pick for a 10,000% Gain Lightchain AI isn’t just another crypto token—it’s being hailed as a potential game-changer. Why? With a presale price of just $0.007, hitting $0.60 would mean an incredible 10,000% ROI. And based on its ambitious roadmap, this target might not just be realistic—it could actually be modest. So, what makes Lightchain AI stand out? Two key innovations designed to win over developers. First, it’s offering grants, funding, and powerful developer tools to create a supportive, developer-friendly environment—similar to what drove Solana’s explosive growth. On top of that, it’s launching an open-source innovation hub, simplifying dApp creation and paving the way for blockchain advancements. With these bold strategies, Lightchain AI is set to build a thriving ecosystem and position itself for massive long-term success.

While this seems like a massive win for Chainlink, the story takes a sharp turn with news of whales dumping 170 million LINK in a span of just three weeks. The market sentiment teeters on the edge, leaving many investors pondering their next move. Enter RUVI AI , a groundbreaking blockchain ecosystem blending AI with decentralized technology. RUVI goes beyond traditional blockchain applications by creating a constantly evolving, user-centric platform that generates real-world rewards. Here’s why RUVI might be the perfect alternative or complement to Chainlink. Chainlink’s Rollercoaster Journey The cryptocurrency market has been abuzz with Chainlink’s integration into PayPal and Venmo , offering users the ability to buy, hold, sell, and transfer LINK tokens easily. This marks a significant leap toward mainstream adoption. Yet, not all news is positive. Chainlink has faced selling pressure, with whales liquidating 170 million LINK tokens in just three weeks, raising questions about short-term confidence in its price trajectory. While LINK’s oracle technology continues to strengthen decentralized finance (DeFi) development, the volatility and whale-heavy market dynamics leave smaller investors wary. Meanwhile, RUVI presents a well-rounded solution that combines accessibility, tangible rewards , and massive growth potential for both new and experienced investors. Unlock the Potential of VIP 3 Tier RUVI has created a VIP Rewards System for early adopters, offering lucrative bonuses on token investments. Take the VIP 3 tier , for instance. With an investment of $1,000 at the current token price of $0.01 , you secure 100,000 RUVI tokens . But here’s where it gets exciting: an exclusive 60% bonus adds another 60,000 tokens , bringing your total to 160,000 tokens ! At RUVI’s expected listing price of $0.07 per token , this $1,000 investment turns into $11,200 . And analysts believe that RUVI’s token price could soar to $0.50 , giving your $1,000 investment a jaw-dropping potential value of $80,000 . These structured tiers offer clarity and security that speculative projects like Chainlink often can’t guarantee, especially amid whale-driven fluctuations. Climb the Leaderboard for Additional Wealth RUVI’s Leaderboard Rewards System takes incentives to the next level. The Top 100 token holders earn an extra 100,000 RUVI tokens , a substantial boost that compounds the rewards from VIP tiers. Imagine securing a VIP 3 bonus and climbing into the top 100 holders. Combined, these rewards multiply your holdings exponentially, providing a pathway to dominate RUVI’s thriving ecosystem of creators and investors. Why RUVI is the Next Big Thing RUVI isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s an all-in-one AI-powered ecosystem . The platform allows users to create text, images, audio, and videos in a seamless, reward-centric environment. By combining blockchain with AI, users actively contribute to the system while earning RUVI tokens, making it a dynamic and interactive investment. Unlike Chainlink, which serves as a backend driver for blockchain data, RUVI directly engages its community with innovative earning opportunities and hands-on participation in shaping the platform. RUVI provides not just speculative value but measurable, immediate benefits for its users. RUVI vs. Chainlink While Chainlink’s tools for smart contracts and DeFi integration are undeniably valuable, its user engagement model lacks the direct creator incentives that RUVI delivers. RUVI blends creativity, utility, and investment returns into a singular, community-driven experience. Whereas Chainlink’s success hinges on whale confidence and DeFi growth, RUVI actively shares its growth with the individuals who support it. This powerful combination is precisely what makes RUVI a complementary or even superior alternative to Chainlink, particularly for those seeking a predictable and rewarding investment pathway . Seize the Opportunity Chainlink’s partnership with PayPal might signal the expanding real-world use cases for blockchain, but RUVI is the platform that guarantees value for its users at every step. Its user-friendly rewards system, innovative AI features, and anticipated rapid price growth create a winning formula for investors looking for stability and opportunity in a competitive crypto space. Don’t wait for others to catch on. Join RUVI today and secure your leadership position in an ecosystem poised to redefine blockchain technology and tokenized rewards. The future of blockchain investment is already here, and it’s RUVI.

This bullish forecast comes amid significant growth of the Solana blockchain, as the DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) approaches a three-year high. Early Bitcoin Investor Predicts 20x Rally for Solana Price Jeremie is one of the top market analysts famed for correctly predicting a Bitcoin price rally during BTC’s early years. In 2011, Jeremie urged traders to buy Bitcoin at only $1 saying tryst it had much potential to rally. The analyst has now shifted his attention to Solana, saying that the altcoin could potentially surge by 20x. Jeremie further noted that US President Donald Trump would be the key to this price rally. He stated, “Meme coins are going to be exploding on Solana because Trump made so much money on it. So why couldn’t any corporation or any famous person do the same thing.” Jeremie’s Solana price prediction highlights that meme coin activity will be the catalyst for SOL’s price rally. If this happens, Solana price could post an over 20x rally and surpass $1,000. Despite the bullish forecast, meme coin activity on the Solana blockchain has dropped significantly. Efforts by PumpFun to boost usage have not been successful, with the total market cap for SOL-based meme coins plunging to $6 billion. Solana DeFi Activity Surges Besides meme coins, the other factor that could trigger a Solana price rally is DeFi activity. Data from DeFiLlama shows that the SOL DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) has risen to $56M, which is the highest level in nearly three years. Solana DeFi TVL The surge in TVL shows that there is a high amount of SOL tokens that are now locked on the Solana blockchain. This supports a bullish outlook and might also support a significant price rally for the altcoin. Solana Technical Analysis Solana price today trades at $118 with a 2% gain in 24 hours. The four-hour Solana price chart shows mixed sentiment. SOL fluctuates within a descending parallel channel. This shows that the bearish momentum is strong, which might cause SOL to edge lower. At the same time, the RSI is tipping south and has dropped to 44. This shows that selling activity remains strong, which might hamper SOL’s ability to rally. However, the AO bars hint towards a trend reversal. This metric is rising, which might drive a surge in buying pressure. If the histogram bars flip positive, it will support a bullish thesis for Solana price. SOL/USD: 4-Hour Chart To sum up, Solana price seems poised to make an uptrend. Early Bitcoin investor Jeremie predicts that SOL can rally 20x due to meme coin activity. However, the 4-hour price chart shows the prevalence of bearish trends.

What are ”secured” stablecoins? As defined by the SEC, ”secured” stablecoins are cryptocurrency assets that: maintain a stable value backed by real reserves easily redeemable The tokens issued by the two largest issuers of stablecoins, Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), fall into just such a category. Their combined market supply exceeds $200 billion. Why it matters The regulator's announcement comes at a time when the use of stablecoins is ready to reach a new level. Traditional financial institutions are increasingly interested in this market segment. For example, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan stated back in February, ”If they make stackablecoins legal, we will get into the business.” Many experts believe that if giants like Bank of America start issuing their own stablecoins, the total supply could grow to trillions of dollars. Legislative support In parallel to the SEC's announcement, U.S. lawmakers are pushing forward new legislation to regulate stablecoins. This week, the House Financial Services Committee voted to advance a related bill called STABLE. This document proposes to create a regulatory framework for U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins. It also includes reserve and capital requirements, including 100 percent collateralization and anti-money laundering standards. The clarity provided by the SEC on secured stablecoins could strengthen legislative initiatives and create a more favorable environment for the development of this segment of the cryptocurrency market.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-05 15:02:26

Here is why,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/canada-carney-formidable-opponent-for-trump/,"Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney doesn’t come from politics. He comes from power. Real power. The kind that moves markets, not crowds. This is a man who ran two G7 central banks—the only living person to do that. Carney literally ran the Bank of Canada , then the Bank of England. He helped keep the UK from crashing after Brexit and predicted the 2008 financial collapse before it shredded the American economy. When it hit, he shielded Canadian banks from the worst of it. That’s the guy now facing Trump. Carney has been on Goldman Sachs’ leadership team, chaired Bloomberg, and led Brookfield. He was also chair of the Group of 30, a DC-based invite-only club of the top thirty minds in global finance. Almost all of the people Trump hired for economic policy right now have worked under Carney at some point, that’s how legendary he is. Mr. Mark Carney. Creator: Adrian Wyld | Credit: AP Carney cuts rates while others raise them Carney’s big break came in 2008. One month into his new job as Bank of Canada governor, he dropped the overnight rate by 50 basis points. Europe went the other way and raised rates. Then everything collapsed. Carney had already moved Canada’s banks away from American subprime debt. When the crash hit, Canada took the smallest hit and bounced back the fastest. GDP and jobs were back to pre-crisis levels before any other G7 country. In April 2009, he froze the policy rate with a tool called “conditional commitment,” signaling it wouldn’t move for at least a year. That built back credit and trust. The economy started climbing out by mid-2009. Even Newsweek had to admit it: “Canada is thriving.” Canadian banks were liquid while the U.S. banking system was on fire. Carney got a bunch of titles thrown at him after that—Time 100, Reader’s Digest Most Trusted Canadian, Euromoney’s Central Banker of the Year, and Financial Times called him one of the “Fifty who will frame the way forward.” But this wasn’t some fame ride. In late 2012, the UK pulled Carney in. George Osborne, Britain’s Chancellor, named him the next governor of the Bank of England. Carney took over in July 2013. For the first time in its 300-year history, that job went to a non-Brit. The bank got new power under him, including the ability to set bank capital requirements. Carney walked away from politics—until now In 2012, Stephen Harper, Canada’s Prime Minister, asked Carney to join the Conservative government as finance minister. Carney said no. “It wasn’t appropriate,” he told the CBC in 2025. “Going straight from governor to politics didn’t sit right.” A year later, the Liberal Party asked him to run in their 2013 leadership race. He passed on that too. But after stepping down in the UK, he pivoted to climate finance. The UN made him special envoy. Boris Johnson hired him as finance advisor for COP26. That conference got pushed to 2021, but Carney stayed in the role. He gave speeches for the Liberal Party, backed Ottawa mayoral candidate Catherine McKenney, and in 2023 endorsed UK Labour’s Rachel Reeves for Chancellor. In 2024, Carney joined Trudeau’s Task Force on Economic Growth. After Chrystia Freeland stepped down, his name came up again—this time as a potential finance minister. Then Trudeau resigned. Carney ran. He won the Liberal Party leadership in March 2025 by a landslide. Five days later, he was sworn in as Canada’s 24th prime minister. He’s the first PM born in Canada’s territories, the third born west of Ontario, the second PM with a PhD, and the first to take office without ever being elected to Parliament. The last person to do that was John Turner in the 1980s. President Donald J. Trump. Source: EPA On March 13, Trump hit Canada with a 25% tariff on cars and car parts. Called it “permanent.” The next day, Carney stood in front of reporters in Ottawa and said , “We’ll match it.” He called out the old U.S.-Canada setup, saying the era of “deep economic and military ties” was over. Carney’s response? New tariffs on U.S. vehicles coming into Canada. No hesitation. “We will respond with retaliatory tariffs that have maximum impact on the U.S.,” he said. He told Canadians to “fundamentally reimagine our economy.” The gloves are off. Trump has been mocking Canada since his campaign. He trashed Trudeau, mocked Canadians, and said—repeatedly—that Canada should just become the 51st state. “It makes sense,” Trump has said. Carney clearly isn’t laughing. Carney also has one foot in global markets and the other in Canadian politics. He was a triple citizen—Canadian, British, and Irish—but before becoming PM, he started the process of renouncing his British and Irish passports. “Full commitment to Canada,” his team said. He’s Catholic. The Tablet once named him the most influential Catholic in Britain. He speaks French, but admits it’s “far from perfect.” Carney is someone Trump can’t bully. And behind that dry tone and clean suits is someone who’s already shaped the world Trump claims to run, as a side quest.",OP-ED|BOE|CAD|EUR|GBP|USD,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-05 15:20:05

The updated classification marks a pivotal moment in the regulatory landscape for digital assets, offering much-needed clarity for stablecoin issuers and market participants. According to the SEC notice , stablecoins that qualify as “covered stablecoins” must meet strict criteria: they must be fully backed by physical U.S. dollars or low-risk, short-term liquid instruments, and must be redeemable at a 1:1 ratio with the U.S. dollar. New SEC Rules Exclude Algorithmic and Synthetic Stablecoins from ‘Non-Security’ Status The new framework explicitly excludes algorithmic stablecoins and synthetic dollar tokens that rely on software mechanisms or trading strategies to maintain their peg. The guidelines also prohibit covered stablecoin issuers from commingling reserves with operational funds, offering yield or profit-sharing to token holders, or using reserves for market speculation. These conditions align closely with provisions laid out in recent legislative proposals, including the GENIUS Stablecoin Bill introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty and the Stable Act of 2025 from Representative French Hill. These laws aim to solidify the U.S. dollar’s status as the world’s dominant reserve currency by encouraging the issuance of fully-backed, transparent stablecoins. Stablecoin issuers like Tether—currently the world’s largest—have become significant holders of U.S. Treasury bills, with Tether alone now ranking as the seventh-largest holder globally, surpassing nations like Germany and Canada. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent underscored the importance of stablecoin regulation during the White House Digital Asset Summit on March 7, describing it as central to the administration’s strategy for maintaining dollar dominance in the digital age. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw Pushes Back Against New Stablecoin Guidelines However, not all reactions have been positive. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, known for her critical stance on cryptocurrencies, publicly criticized the new guidelines. In an April 4 statement , she accused the SEC of misrepresenting the risks of USD-backed stablecoins and claimed the report contained “legal and factual errors.” Crenshaw highlighted that most stablecoins are only accessible to retail buyers via intermediaries, not directly from issuers—a point she argued the SEC downplayed. The SEC has determined that fully-reserved, liquid, dollar-backed stablecoins are not securities. Therefore blockchain transactions to mint or redeem them do not need to be registered under the Securities Act. Helpful clarity from @SECGov . pic.twitter.com/oUsq0snLaF — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) April 4, 2025 She said over 90% of USD-stablecoins are distributed on secondary markets through crypto trading platforms. Despite her concerns, the broader crypto industry has welcomed the guidance. Token Metrics founder Ian Balina described it as a positive development, calling it “a clear step in focusing on what really matters in the crypto space.” Last month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell affirmed the central bank’s support for developing a regulatory framework around stablecoins during a Senate hearing. Powell stated that the Federal Reserve supports the creation of a regulatory framework for stablecoins , noting the importance of protecting consumers and savers.

Based on his analysis, now might be a great time to buy Ethereum, which has so far underperformed other top cryptocurrencies. Analyst Says ETH Is Now Undervalued Following Ethereum Price Dump In an X post, Doctor Profit stated that ETH is undervalued now following the Ethereum price dump. He noted that the leading altcoin is sitting at a historical support at $1,800, the same support he had predicted that ETH would dump to. With this massive correction and fear in the market driving Ethereum to this support level, the analyst claimed that the altcoin is undervalued now. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forms Megaphone Bottom Not Seen Since 2020, Here’s What Happened Last Time His analysis suggests that now might be a great time to accumulate ETH as the Ethereum price could rebound from this historical support. Indeed, some investors are already using this massive correction as an opportunity to stack up more coins. IntoTheBlock data shows that Ethereum’s ‘Concentration’ metric is currently bullish, indicating that ETH whales are adding to their positions. Besides Doctor Profit, crypto analyst Astronomer also believes that ETH is currently undervalued and predicts that the Ethereum price could revisit $4,000. He highlighted several technical signals that indicate that the leading altcoin could reach these highs. The analyst also alluded to the $1,800 support, noting that this range has historically been a launch pad for price recoveries. However, crypto analyst Kledji has predicted that the Ethereum price could still drop to as low as $1,400 before rebounding. He stated that ETH will likely consolidate around this range for a while before it rallies to this $1,400 target later this month. His analysis suggested that the altcoin’s downtrend depended on Bitcoin’s performance. Therefore, if BTC recovers from this range, ETH will unlikely drop to that $1,400 level. ETH’s Dominance Is On The Decline, But History Could Repeat Itself In an X post, crypto analyst Rekt Capital revealed that ETH’s dominance has dropped from 20% to 8% since June 2023 as a result of the Ethereum price dump. He then noted that Ethereum’s dominance has historically reversed this 8% zone to become more market-dominant. The analyst then raised the possibility of history repeating itself, with ETH recovering well and enjoying a higher market dominance. Crypto analyst Crypto Patel is also confident that the Ethereum price will rebound soon. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could bounce from this $1,800 support and enter phase 3 of the Wyckoff chart, sending its price to as high as $6,800, a new all-time high (ATH).

The statement is the clearest position adopted by the SEC on the regulatory treatment of crypto. However, while the stablecoin ruling dismisses security classification, it still leaves questions about yield and algorithmic tokens. SEC Clarifies Stance On Stablecoins The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Department of Corporation Finance outlined its views on what it called “Covered Stablecoins” in a public statement. Covered stablecoins include fiat-backed digital tokens designed to maintain price stability through fully reserved dollar holdings. According to the SEC’s division, the offer and sale of stablecoins do not involve securities transactions or require registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The decision will provide legal clarity for stablecoin issuers, fintech firms, and crypto payment providers operating in regulatory uncertainty. “Persons involved in the process of minting (or creating) and redeeming Covered Stablecoins do not need to register those transactions with the Commissioner under the Securities Act or fall within one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration.” Stablecoins Designed For Payments The SEC stated that stablecoins are designed and marketed solely as a mode of payment, money transmission, and value storage. They also do not give holders interest, profits, governance rights, or ownership claims typically described as digital dollars rather than investment products. According to the SEC, stablecoins have not been promoted as profit-generating instruments, a key distinction under federal securities law. The regulator’s conclusion was based on two legal landmarks: The Reves v. Ernst & Young test and The Howey test. Under the Reves standards, the SEC’s division found that Covered Stablecoins more closely resemble instruments used for routine transactions rather than speculative notes or debt securities. The regulator also highlighted the buyer’s non-investment motivation and the lack of trading for profit as key reasons why stablecoins fall outside the definition of a security. The SEC also applied the Howey test to stablecoins. The Howey test examines whether an arrangement involves investing money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit from others’ efforts. The regulator concluded that Covered Stablecoin holders are not investing for returns. The SEC also stated that Covered Stablecoins must be redeemable for USD at a fixed price at any time and in unlimited quantities. It mandated issuers to maintain a fully backed reserve consisting of cash or liquid, low-risk assets like US Treasury bills. These reserves could not be used for the stablecoin issuer’s business operations and must be safeguarded from third-party claims. It also directed issuers to publish Proof-of-Reserve attestations to verify solvency and transparency. Uncertainty About Yield The SEC also stated that holders of Covered Stablecoins do not receive any form of yield or share in earnings generated from reserve assets. Stablecoin issuers could earn interest on the assets held in reserve. However, these earnings are retained by the issuer and not distributed to token holders. According to the regulator, the absence of yield or financial benefit removes a key element of the Howey test, the expectation of a profit from the efforts of others. The clarification allows the SEC to draw a line between fiat-backed tokens and tokens marketed with return-generating features. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, this hasn’t deterred short-term and long-term holders from accumulating the token. In this article, we’ll take a detailed look at the recent purchase data suggesting that Bitcoin is in an accumulation phase and primed for an upward push. We’ll also talk about how investing in the best altcoins could be a smart decision in the current market scenario. Both Short & Long-Term $BTC Holders Bullish Short-term $BTC holders – those who have held the token for less than 155 days – have added 15K $BTC in the first five days of April itself. Long-term holders, on the other hand, have added 400K $BTC since the beginning of February. With these fresh additions, STHs now hold around 3.7M Bitcoins, while LTHs own 13.5M. The growing accumulation from STHs is particularly interesting. Usually, short-term holders exit assets during bear runs and only accumulate if they see a positive reversal. However, that’s not the case with $BTC. Bitcoin STHs are now exhibiting traits of long-term holders, suggesting a sharp recovery might be around the corner. Bitcoin Could Reclaim $100K Soon Trump’s tariffs might have stirred something encouraging for Bitcoin investors. While there has been a bloodbath in the US stock markets, $BTC has been showing signs of decoupling. The S&P 500 index has plunged by more than 10% during this week, and gold dropped by 4.8% following the tariff announcement. However, Bitcoin, after an initial drop of 3%, bounced back to reach $82.5K levels, showing indications of its shifting correlation with other economic indicators. It’s currently trading at $82.7K . This has also reignited the talks of the “gold leads, Bitcoin follows” narrative. During the 2019 bull cycle, it was gold that first surged by 15% during mid-year, after which Bitcoin surged by a massive 344% in 2020. Bitcoin reclaiming $100K could see a baton handover from gold, with $BTC leading the charge. Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, said that $BTC is shielded from the ongoing tariff war. Since Bitcoin is a digital asset, it cannot be taxed at border points and escape the direct effects of tariffs. The overall crypto market seems to be pretty stable in the face of uncertain global economics, which is a good sign for investors. This, then, is a great time to position yourself in crypto. And altcoins and meme coins happen to be the most profitable segment in the space given their low cost of entry and massive potential. If you’re looking for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in at this moment, here are some digital assets we’d recommend considering. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy Right Now Bitcoin’s potential is unquestionable, especially with Trump’s blessings. However, if you want to maximize your gains from Bitcoin’s historical growth, look at BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . $BTCBULL is one of the best cryptos to buy now , seeing as it’ll give out free $BTC to its token holders – no other crypto project has a reward system this insane! Bear in mind, though, that you must hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet to be eligible for free $BTC. Additionally, these Bitcoin giveaways are scheduled to take place whenever $BTC reaches a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. So, the project’s native token, $BTCBULL, is also likely to see an appreciation in price alongside Bitcoin. Our BTC Bull Token price prediction suggests it could climb as high as $0.0096 by 2026. What’s more, the team behind BTC Bull Token has also planned to periodically reduce the total token supply. This is a popular approach among the meme coins, using which they aim to boost their demand and price. The best part? Because BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, it’s available for only $0.002445 – one of the best cheap cryptos right now . The project has so far raised $4.4M. Here’s how to buy $BTCBULL . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Altcoin Building First-Ever Layer 2 on Solana Cryptos like Solaxy ($SOLX) don’t come often. It’s a meme coin at its heart, which is why it’s expected to churn out over 11,500% returns by 2030 . However, unlike other meme coins that rely solely on hype, Solaxy relies on its revolutionary mission to improve Solana. Solana has been plagued with congestion because of an overflow of transactions and investors on the network. A multi-chain token, $SOLX will tap into Ethereum’s liquidity and process Solana’s transactions off-chain. This will greatly reduce the burden on Solana’s mainnet. Additionally, Solaxy will also carry out transactions in bundles instead of processing them individually. This will boost Solana’s affordability and make it even more appealing to meme coin enthusiasts. It’s also worth noting that Solaxy is the hottest presale on the market right now. It has amassed a whopping $29.2M so far, and you can buy each token for just $0.001684. For more info on the buying process, check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy . 3. FirstBroccoli ($BROCCOLI) – CZ’s Pet Dog-Inspired Meme Coin Back Among Top Gainers $BROCCOLI is a fine example of what the best meme coins are capable of. It was brought into existence immediately after Binance’s ex-CEO CZ publicly flirted with the idea of launching a meme coin based on his pet dog. $BROCCOLI has jumped over 500% since its launch approximately a month ago. What’s even more interesting is that $BROCCOLI has coughed up these returns in a market that has been dicey. This further proves that hype alone can catapult tokens to the moon. The token is up over 70% in the last seven days , and we could see fresh highs once it surges past its recent resistance of $0.014. It’s currently trading at $0.01311, which could be an excellent entry price. Bottom Line Even though experts are positive about Bitcoin’s future (both immediate and long-term), it’s important not to get carried away. That’s because market conditions, especially in crypto, can change rapidly. So, always follow sound investing tactics, which include only putting in a reasonable sum of money. As always, do your own research before investing.

After stocks got slammed two days in a row thanks to President Trump’s new tariffs, the CNBC host said the next earnings week could give the first real signs of how bad things are. According to Jim, what happens next won’t be up to companies—it’ll be up to Trump. “The direction of the market depends on what Trump does next,” Jim said on Friday night. He pointed back to the 1987 crash, saying things could spiral again if Trump doesn’t change course. “If President Trump stays intransigent and does nothing to ameliorate the damage that I saw these last few days, I’m not going to be constructive here.” Stock heat map. Source: TradingView Then, on Saturday morning, Cramer jumped on X to say : “It’s tough to build a new, weaker, world order on the fly. Frantically trying to do it but don’t see anything yet that takes the October 87 scenario off the table yet. Those who bottom-fished are sleeping with the fishes …so far.” Markets react fast to tariff chaos The S&P 500 gave up nearly 10% in two days, ending 17.4% below its February high. That drop puts it in a rare group with Black Monday 1987, the post-Lehman crash of 2008, and the Covid panic in 2020. Before the collapse, markets were trying to find a floor. The March rally off a 10% correction looked like it might hold. Then it broke. Traders kept trying to find support levels—around 5,100 on Friday—but every bounce failed. That day alone saw a 6% fall straight into the close. For two years, the stock market priced in a recession that never came. Then it got one slapped in its face in just two days, all thanks to Trump’s broadside on trading partners. The result was one of the ugliest back-to-back crashes in history. Markets are now stuck between two bad outcomes. A short-term bounce could happen. But deeper damage is already locked in. Bespoke Investment Group described the situation plain and simple: “The stock market is rudderless.” Even Friday’s job report showed no sign of economic collapse, but no one cared. As Bespoke put it, “The only thing that matters at this point rests on the decision of one man’s Truth Social account.” Jim Paulsen from Paulsen Perspectives had a different worry. He called out the math behind the tariff rates as twisted. “The stupidity of what we’re doing becomes more obvious,” he said. “A massive tax increase on the entire global economy at this point doesn’t make much sense. And I think it doesn’t make much sense for the Fed to stubbornly not want to ease.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell made things worse. He repeated on Friday that he’s in “no hurry” to cut rates. He said inflation expectations remain high. The market took that as a clear message: The Fed won’t step in unless things get even worse. Traders ditch gold, utilities and mega-caps Friday was also about panic setting in. Some of the usual safe bets got wrecked too. Gold fell over 2%. Utilities tanked 5.5%. Even Berkshire Hathaway lost almost 7%. Big names like Visa, Eli Lilly, and JPMorgan all lagged behind the S&P 500. Meanwhile, the beaten-down Russell 2000 actually outperformed by 1.6%. That’s not good news—it just means the big players were getting dumped harder. But we’d like to also point to a few forces that could slow the bleeding. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped from 4.8% in January to 4%. The dollar is falling. Oil sank to $60 a barrel. Those things might act like a quiet stimulus in the background. Still, everything now hinges on one thing: whether Trump holds the line on tariffs or backs off. If nothing changes, recession fears will only grow. If there’s relief, the market could breathe—for a minute. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The Pi Network ( PI ) token jumped by over 45%, reaching a high of $0.75, its highest point since March 31. This surge happened as its volume soared to over $1 billion, the highest figure since early March. Pi has been in a strong downward trend after peaking at $3 on Feb. 26. It has dropped by over 75% from that level, costing pioneers and other investors billions. This crash is mostly because of the incoming supply due to its tokenomics. Data shows that the network will release millions of new tokens each month . Cumulatively, the supply will grow by 1.6 billion in the next 12 months. Token unlocks are bearish because they dilute existing investors. Pi Network price has also plunged as investors remained concerned about the lack of exchange listings since its mainnet launch. Most tier-1 exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken have not listed it, meaning it is unavailable to millions of users. Further, Pi coin has plunged since February because of its weak ecosystem growth, with most developers opting for mainstream networks like Berachain, Solana, and Avalanche. You might also like: Pi Network price nears all-time low ahead of a 124M token unlock Pi Network price rises after the wedge activates Pi chart | Source: crypto.news The ongoing Pi coin price recovery was due to its technicals, which crypto.news has highlighted before . The most important was a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. This pattern is characterized by two falling and converging trendlines. A bullish breakout happens when these two lines near their confluence and when the volume is rising steadily. Pi Network has also been forming a bullish divergence pattern, which happens when an oscillator is rising as the price rises. The MACD and the Bollinger Bands Trend indicator have steadily risen in this case. Therefore, the token may keep rising as bulls target the psychological point at $1, which is about 35% above the current level. A drop below this week’s lowest level will invalidate the bullish outlook.

This strong upward trend raises questions about whether other coins like Mantra (OM) can follow suit. Investors are eager to find out which cryptocurrencies might be poised for similar growth in the near future. Uncovering these potential frontrunners could offer valuable insights for savvy investors. Cosmos ATOM: Bullish Momentum and Key Levels Shape the Outlook Last month Cosmos recorded a 15.36% gain while six-month growth reached 7.51%. One week performance surged by 10.25%, signaling strong recent investor interest and a clear upward price movement. Price action over these periods reflects a steady increase that builds optimism ahead of altcoin season. Indicators point to consistent positive adjustments that may support further gains in a growing crypto bull run. Current trading is seen between $3.50 and $5.15, with immediate resistance at $5.92 and support resting near $2.62. Bulls have been driving recent advances, though the overall trend lacks a firm long-term direction. Traders may find opportunities by buying near support levels and targeting profit near resistance, with the gap up to $7.57 offering another potential exit point. MANTRA (OM) Market: Explosive 6-Month Surge Amid Short-Term Pressure MANTRA (OM) declined by 11.69% over the past month and fell slightly by 0.73% in the last week, while it surged an impressive 357.16% over six months. The performance over half a year shows strong long-term momentum despite recent short-term corrections. Price swings have been volatile, with rapid climbs and steep pullbacks indicating a mix of aggressive gains and cautious retracement. The coin currently trades between $5.30 and $7.68, with support at $4.39 and resistance at $9.15. Bears hold a slight edge with a 44.50 RSI and down momentum indicating weakness. Traders should monitor these key levels, looking for a potential break above resistance before considering bullish positions. Conclusion ATOM has shown impressive gains since its recent breakout. This upward trend speaks to its growing potential in the crypto market. On the other hand, OM is also generating interest and could potentially follow a similar path. If OM can capitalize on its current momentum, it might see significant performance improvements. Both ATOM and OM are worth watching closely for future growth.

According to Terrett, a petition filed with the word “urgent” in the case file requests the presentation of “decisive evidence” in favor of the defendant Ripple and “the freedom of the American people.” The petition in question belongs to a man named Justin W. Keener, who is not a party to the case but claims to have an interest in its outcome. In the petition, Keener claims that he “miraculously” has private data and information in his possession that could shed light on “the nightmare we have been subjected to unknowingly” for the past 10 years. Related News: Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin Holders Should Love Tariffs, Explains Why However, the petition did not specifically state what this “decisive evidence” was or how it would benefit Ripple. According to Terrett’s research, Keener was recently sued by the SEC for being an unregistered stock dealer (penny stock). The court ordered Keener to pay more than $10 million in fines. *This is not investment advice.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has asked President Donald Trump’s Justice Department to investigate whether the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) is abusing its “monopoly” over the business. He also said that former President Joe Biden’s administration had ignored his earlier calls for scrutiny. In a letter to Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater on Friday, Hawley said that FICO dominates the business-to-business credit scoring market with a roughly 90% market share. He added, “It enjoys a sweetheart deal from the federal government wherein its credit scores are required for loans originated with multiple government entities.” FICO has been raising prices frequently According to Hawley, the country’s biggest credit-scoring company has abused the market power the government gave it. This is because it raised prices many times and made huge profits while having little competition. For instance, it raised the price of scores again at the end of last year, this time from $3.50 to $4.95 per score for mortgage originations. A rise of more than 40%. As a result, the price increases by FICO have made the company a lot of money, but they have hurt working Americans. Their cash income almost tripled between 2019 and 2024. In addition, in ten years, its stock price has done better than 5% of the S&P 500. However, in fiscal year 2024, the former company’s CEO, William Lansing, got $35 million in pay. This was less than the $66 million he got the year before. Lansing has said about the price hikes, “It’s still small in the scheme of things, but for us, it was a big increase in price, in profit, revenue margin, all those things.” Similar to what he said to Biden, the burden of those increases has been borne by borrowers, especially lower-income borrowers, who now find it harder to purchase a home. Borrowers will either have to pay more upfront or pay more in interest whenever FICO is raising its prices. Hawley said, “FICO has exploited working Americans with its monopoly power for too long. I therefore urge you to immediately open an investigation into the company for its potentially anticompetitive behavior.” Barclays has lowered FICO’s price target Barclays has lowered the price target for FICO shares to $2,250 from $2,350. The firm still rates the shares as “Overweight.” In a research note sent to investors, the analyst says that credit bureaus and rating agencies are most at risk of negative number revisions for the year. This is because new tariffs are likely to raise prices and raise the risk of a recession. Also, new changes in the options market mean that Fair Isaac Corporation FICO stock investors need to pay close attention to the stock. This is because the April 17, 2025, $1,440 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. The recent actions of 56 corporate insiders show that corporate insiders don’t like the stock. In other words, more insiders have sold their shares of FICO in the last quarter than in the first quarter of the year. For instance, William J. Lansing sold 4,092 shares last month for a total of $7,069,673.55. As of today, the company’s highest price was $2,402.52 and its lowest price was $1,105.65. Fair Isaac has an average volume of 206.5K right now. At the moment, most analysts think that Fair Isaac is a Moderate Buy, and they expect the stock to reach $2,179.70.

Cardano, for its part, is also gaining attention as whale activity surpasses 3.27 billion ADA tokens, while technical patterns indicate a support to climb to $4 Amid these predictions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction among investors at its fourth presale phase, where it has seen a raise of $6.2 million with 7900 holders. But can Mutuum Finance replicate the upward trajectories we’ve seen in its more established counterparts, with Phase 4 going for $0.025? Ethereum Breakout Boosts Bullish Sentiment Ethereum has passed Solana in monthly DEX volumes, raking in $64 billion compared to $52 billion for Solana, indicating a possible return to form. Analysts point to the four months of flat or negative returns from ETH, a combination not seen since early 2018 just before a spectacular rally. Ethereum tilts its sights back toward $2,500 if history means anything, Q2 return statistics from Coinglass shows Ethereum average 60% gain: Ethereum edged back in Q4. The 7.96% surge to $2,062 projected by technical indicators, including the rounding bottom pattern on 4-hour price charts, was made possible by the psychological barrier of the $2,000 mark, which remained a grim line of defence for bears. Cardano Whales Convey Assuredness During Consolidation Cardano’s price has also stabilized near $0.66, which was a frame of time of consolidation resembling late 2024 leading up to rallies. ADA has refused to set a new low since February, which analysts say reminds them of its behavior ahead of a 280% price jump last year. Data from Santiment published in recent weeks highlights that whale accumulation of the cryptocurrency has reached 240 million ADA tokens — more than previous confidence, with whale holdings now at 3.27 billion ADA. The volume of transactions remain constant while the price is stagnant, indicating organic growth of the network. An upward break from the $0.78 resistance could send ADA toward $2.50 on a repeat of this 2024 course. Before it could make its way to that level, however, the token will need to flip a fat stack of sell orders between $0.70 and $0.78. Mutuum Finance Picks Up Steam as Presale Swells Ethereum and Cardano may bask in macro-level attention, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is flying under the radar, preparing itself to become a top gainer. Now at Phase 4 of an 11-stage presale that has already raised $6.2 million at $0.025 per token, MUTM is getting attention. Early participants ride a 140% return upon the listing of tokens at $0.06 — a fact reflected in the project’s tokenomics. With Phase 5 looming, cost will increase 20% to $0.03, so the clock is ticking for investors gearing up to enter before price jumps. The team is putting the final touches on a Certik audit of its smart contracts, with results to be released across social channels in the near future. This transparency measure, combined with the ability to progress through the presale process swiftly adds to the already bubbling FOMO. Internal data shows few Phase 4 tokens are left available. An Intersection of Opportunity While Ethereum and Cardano breach critical technical levels, Mutuum Finance opens up a different opportunity that is rooted in presale potential. While ETH and ADA need resistance levels to break, MUTM’s set-price increments and audited framework will allow for upside that can be calculated at scale. Focusing on real-world DeFi applications—lending, borrowing, and yield generation—sets the project, and its uses, apart from speculative properties and appeals to investors looking for tangible use cases. Opportunities in crypto are time sensitive, and Mutuum Finance illustrates the axiom. As Phase 5 marks heights with a 20% price jump, the current price period is rapidly closing. For investors already researching models for evaluating Ethereum or accumulation patterns for Cardano that they can leverage, MUTM’s structured presale is an actionable alternative. Head to Mutuum Finance’s official site before the next price hike and participate.

Bearish Pattern Spotted,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/will-bitcoin-crash-again-bearish-pattern-spotted/,"The post Will Bitcoin Crash Again? Bearish Pattern Spotted appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid the ongoing tariff war, Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is poised for a massive price crash due to its bearish price action. In recent days, BTC appears to be consolidating within a tight range. However, upon closer examination, it seems to have formed a bearish head and shoulders pattern on the four-hour time frame. Current Price Momentum It seems like the market isn’t reacting to any positive news. Earlier, following Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s bold statement, BTC along with major assets began to rebound, but the upside momentum later faded and all gains were lost. Currently, BTC is trading near the $82,500 level and has recorded a price decline of over 1.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 50%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors due to notable market volatility. Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, with the recent price decline, BTC is heading toward the neckline of the bearish head and shoulders pattern. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if this momentum continues and BTC breaches the neckline at the $81,500 level, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 4% to reach the $78,200 level in the near future. As of now, the asset is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on both the daily and four-hour time frames, indicating a strong downtrend and weak momentum. Traders typically wait for a price jump to short the asset, which explains the recent price spike and subsequent drop within less than 24 hours. $175 Million Worth of BTC Outflow Despite the bearish outlook, investors and long-term holders seem to be accumulating the asset, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Source: Coinglass Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of approximately $175 million worth of BTC over the past 24 hours. Such outflow during a bearish market sentiment suggests potential accumulation. While this can create buying pressure and trigger an upside rally, it typically occurs during a bull run.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 16:05:24

Donald Trump’s first call with a foreign leader following his tariff announcement on Wednesday was with Vietnam’s General Secretary of the Communist Party, To Lam. After the call, Trump described the conversation as “very productive,” stating that the Vietnamese leader expressed a willingness for his country to slash their tariffs down to zero if they could come to an agreement with the U.S. government. The positive outcome of the call between the two leaders had many speculating that the U.S. government is trying to negotiate with other foreign governments for fewer tariffs. However, White House officials have dismissed all these claims, stating that their primary focus was implementing the levies. One White House official even remarked , “President Trump is always willing to take a phone call from a foreign leader and discuss possible deals, but it is not a negotiation until it’s a negotiation.” Trump says it’s a great time for investors to invest in the U.S. President Trump still believes he made the right call to impose tariffs on nearly every country in the world despite contributing to one of the sharpest declines in the stock market since the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, telling investors that his policies will stand and that this is the perfect time to invest and “get rich and richer than ever before.” Nonetheless, according to a source, Trump understands that without long-term certainty, businesses wouldn’t risk relocating their supply chains to the U.S. Investors would need to be sure that the tariffs would be permanent. The president’s administration still maintains that the tariffs applied were a response to years of unfair trade practices by key U.S. partners and allies. Furthermore, state officials believe the reciprocal tariffs will revitalize the country’s manufacturing power and encourage American jobs. Scott Bessent believes negotiations with businesses more critical than with foreign countries U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discounted claims that they were considering quick negotiations with their trading partners to cut down tariffs. He, however, argued that negotiating with companies would be more important than discussing with other countries. Moreover, Bessent had earlier cautioned other foreign governments not to retaliate against U.S. tariffs, saying levies against them would only increase. So far, China has retaliated against the U.S.’s new tariffs, slapping the same 34% tariff on all goods coming from the U.S. Trump even commented on Beijing’s move, stating that the nation played it wrong. On the other hand, Bessent believes that Beijing should rebalance its economic model. He claimed that though that may not happen soon, it would have to do so in the next few years. He also argued that Europe would also have to rebalance. Some diplomats and business figures have tried to communicate with the White House and major state officials. EU trade diplomat Maroš Šefčovič spoke with U.S. commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer on Friday, claiming they were willing to sit for meaningful negotiations.

The crypto market watches closely, wondering if this signals further declines or a golden chance to buy. This article explores the coins' current performance and what it could mean for future growth. Could these dips be a blessing in disguise? Read on to uncover the insights. Toncoin: Mixed Short-Term Recovery and Long-Term Decline Toncoin showed an 11.90% gain over the past month while posting a 36.11% drop over the last six months. Price action has been volatile with marked rebounds offset by significant losses over a longer period. The monthly surge highlights short-term investor optimism in contrast to a pronounced six-month downtrend which reflects broader bearish sentiment. Current prices are trading between $2.92 and $4.73. With a nearby resistance at $5.35 and support around $1.73, caution prevails as bears exert pressure in the short run. Trading ideas focus on watching for potential breakouts above $5.35 or careful bounces off the lower support level. Aptos Faces Ongoing Downturn Amid Bearish Trends Price witnessed a drop of about 21% over the last month and a steep decline nearing 44% in the past six months, reflecting a sustained downtrend in the coin's behavior. The movement in value has showcased declining momentum, and the trading range has narrowed as sellers have increasingly dominated over buyers with minimal recovery attempts. The coin currently trades between $4.51 and $6.42 with immediate resistance at $7.58 and key support at $3.76, while a stronger barrier appears at $9.49 and additional support near $1.84. Bearish indicators such as a negative Awesome Oscillator and a low RSI around 35 suggest caution. Traders might consider short-term strategies within these levels to take advantage of the prevailing pressure. Conclusion TON and APT have both dropped below key support levels. This indicates further decline might be on the horizon. However, it could also present a buying opportunity for those looking to enter at a lower price. The current market conditions will play a crucial role in determining the future price action for these coins. Investors should monitor market trends closely. This will help make informed decisions on whether to buy or wait for potential further declines. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite this, several analysts are forecasting a potential rally, with some projections suggesting that Dogecoin’s price could reach $2 soon. Dogecoin Price Key Support Levels Dogecoin price has shown significant price fluctuations over the years. After failing to break past the $0.180 mark, the cryptocurrency dipped below several support levels, including $0.1750, $0.1720, and $0.1620. At one point, the DOGE price traded close to $0.1550, demonstrating the current bearish sentiment in the market. However, analysts are closely watching Dogecoin’s behavior around the critical Fibonacci retracement levels. According to crypto analyst Tarder Tardigrade, the 0.5 and 0.618 levels are significant because it is usually on these levels that bulls and bears create their turning points. In the past, the Dogecoin price has always regained these levels , marking them as support levels. At the moment, Dogecoin is trading higher than these levels, which may signal a reversal. Technical analysts believe that if the price of Dogecoin stays above these levels, it is capable of moving higher in months to come. This would be similar to past trends where at some levels, Dogecoin rises sharply after consolidating at those levels. Analysts Project $2 Target for Dogecoin Price Currently several analysts believe that the Dogecoin price will soon go to $2. Tarder Tardigrade, an analyst, has pointed out that the cryptocurrency is on the verge of a breakout. Based on his technical analysis, the current DOGE price formation has characteristics similar to the previous descending channel followed by a parabolic rise. Tardigrade pointed out that the DOGE price could form an ascending triangle in the range of $0.1732 to $0.1740 where an upthrust could occur to set the bulls on the charge. If this occurs the next levels of resistance exist in the region of $0.1800 to $0.1850 and if the price is to breach this region then a bigger rally can follow. According to his observation, if it follows the same trend like past bull cycles, Dogecoin price could rise to $2. In addition, another analyst, Dynamite Trade, opined that Dogecoin has maintained a bullish outlook in the long run. By his estimation, the cryptocurrency is in a cycle and could possibly go up to $5.00 in the next phase of the market. This forecast is based on the established rising support trend observed during previous cycles, which continues to indicate a positive long-term outlook for Dogecoin. Potential Catalyst: Dogecoin ETF Approval A significant potential catalyst for Dogecoin’s price could come from developments in the broader cryptocurrency market. Speculation is growing around the possibility of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved by the end of 2025. Current projections, according to Polymarket, suggest a 69% chance that the Dogecoin ETF could be approved by December 31, 2025. Source; Polymarket If the Dogecoin ETF is approved, it would allow institutional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in a regulated manner. This could lead to a surge in demand for Dogecoin, further driving up the DOGE price. The approval of such a product would also bring additional legitimacy to Dogecoin as an asset, potentially attracting more retail and institutional investors. While the Dogecoin ETF remains speculative at this stage, analysts believe that its approval could act as a significant catalyst for price growth, with some projecting that Dogecoin could reach new all-time highs. Should the ETF come to fruition, it could provide the momentum needed for Dogecoin to break past previous resistance levels and continue its upward trajectory.

As Trump’s tariffs caused chaos, over $3.2 trillion was wiped out from stocks, yet crypto added $5.4 billion in market cap. Now traders are asking; is BTC finally breaking free from Wall Street’s grip? Decoupling From Mainstream Markets “This is insane, BTC is detaching right before our eyes,” tweeted crypto analyst Cory Bates, reacting to data showing the biggest stock market indexes in the red, with Bitcoin up 2%. In a post on X, Ryan Rasmussen, head of research at Bitwise, showed the performances of several major tech stocks since Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day.” The likes of Google, Amazon, and Meta were all down by double figures, with Apple the worst-hit, plunging almost 16% in that period. Even gold, the classic safe haven, crumbled 3%, leaving Bitcoin as the last asset standing. Crypto influencer Kyle Chassé posed a question on X, asking whether BTC could benefit from the ongoing trade war drama, to which a user emphatically responded, “Bitcoin is the only asset to be in right now.” Meanwhile, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes cheekily suggested that holders of the cryptocurrency need to “learn to love tariffs” as it showed signs of dissociating with traditional financial markets. Earlier, he had predicted that Trump’s new trade policy could force central banks to start printing money, which could be good for Bitcoin. BTC to $100K? Bitcoin’s recent performance relative to Wall Street has led to some measure of optimism. Popular chartist MacroScope revisited a theory they had shared earlier of a possible “handoff,” where BTC diverges positively from gold and broader market risks, a trend not seen since 2019. “BTC positive divergence from gold and risk in past 24 hours is striking. Haven’t seen it to this extent in a long time,” wrote the analyst. In their previous post, they called it the “gold leads, BTC eventually follows” relationship. This has held true at a few key inflection points in past years, especially from 2019 to 2020, when gold rallied first, and Bitcoin exploded soon after by a whopping 344%. “A reclaim of 100k would imply a ‘handoff’ from gold to BTC,” said MacroScope. This, in their opinion, would open the door to a period of “huge outperformance” by Bitcoin over other assets. However, not everyone is convinced. “Don’t be ultra greedy on crypto this weekend,” warned Master Kenobi, pointing to a possible “rug pull” happening at the start of next week.

The law firm representing the Seminole Minors Per Capita Payment Trust, a trust fund set up by the Seminole Tribe of Florida to safeguard the financial futures of around 2,000 children, says Wells Fargo is set to pay $825 million in damages and over $7 million compensation for the unauthorized fees charged. The lawsuit accused Wells Fargo and eight of its executives of breaching fiduciary duty to the tribe and its children. The eight Wells Fargo executives were ordered to individually pay token damages of between $50 to $500. According to the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Wells Fargo relationship manager Kim Scott confessed to the bank’s wrongdoing during cross-examination “…Scott admitted Wells Fargo knowingly mismanaged funds, maintained inadequate records, and collected millions in unauthorized fees. Scott also revealed he had never fully reviewed the Trust’s governing documents, despite managing one of the bank’s largest accounts.” Wells Fargo was fired as the trust fund’s trustee in 2016 after officials of the Seminole Tribe conducted a review of the rate of returns. Wells Fargo’s investment strategy reportedly resulted in returns that barely kept pace with inflation. The leaders of the Seminole Tribe also questioned illegal fees amounting to $7.6 million that Wells Fargo had charged the trust. Following the jury verdict, Wells Fargo says it will appeal. A spokesperson for Wells Fargo’s Wealth and Investment Management department, Meghan McDonald, says. “We followed the [Seminole] Tribal Government’s clear and repeated instructions about the management of the trust, abided by our fiduciary duty, and delivered financial results consistent with the Trust’s mandate for the children of the Tribe during our time as Trustee. Our goal for the appeal is to address multiple courtroom rulings that we believe prevented us from sharing the full story with the jury.” The Seminole Minors Per Capita Payment Trust was set up two decades ago with the sole trustee being Wachovia Bank, which Wells Fargo acquired in 2008. The trust derived its resources primarily from the Tribe’s gaming enterprises. Currently, estimates place the trust’s assets at nearly $3 billion.

Among the most vocal optimists is XForceGlobal, a Korean Certified Elliott Wave Analyst who has built a reputation on bold calls and technical insights. A Bold Vision Amid Bearish Conditions XForceGlobal recently shared his bullish stance on XRP’s long-term price trajectory. With XRP trading around $2.08, he took a defiant tone, declaring that he would eventually “laugh at everyone” who doubts the asset’s potential to climb into the $10 to $20 price range in the foreseeable future. I will be laughing at everyone who said $XRP can never hit $10-20. — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) April 2, 2025 This optimism comes even as the broader crypto market remains entrenched in a steep downtrend. XRP itself has not been immune, shedding over 15% of its value in recent weeks. These losses have effectively erased most of the asset’s 2025 gains, leaving it with a modest 0.82% year-to-date increase. Outperforming the Competition Despite recent setbacks, XRP appears to be outperforming many of its peers. Ethereum, for example, has plummeted over 50% in the past three months, while other major altcoins like Solana and Dogecoin have also seen steep declines. In a separate breakdown, XForceGlobal highlighted XRP’s relative strength. Unlike many top cryptocurrencies, XRP has maintained support above its regional and immediate lows — a signal of strength amid the chaos. He suggested that this durability positions XRP as an outlier, operating on its trajectory rather than merely following broader market patterns. Potential for a Technical Breakout The analyst further speculated that the market might be approaching a critical technical formation — a triangle pattern — which could serve as a launchpad for XRP’s next major move. According to his Elliott Wave modeling, XRP is potentially completing a five-wave cycle that could propel it to dramatic new highs. His projections? A climb to anywhere between $20 and $40, possibly within this or next year. Though these targets remain highly speculative, they reflect his conviction in the strength of XRP’s underlying structure and momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Korean Premium Signals Strong Demand XForceGlobal also pointed to a consistent 5–10% trading premium for XRP in South Korea, suggesting elevated local demand. In his view, this enthusiasm from Korean investors could further bolster the asset’s price in the months ahead. Still, skepticism persists — and not without reason. For XRP to reach $10 , it would require a 381% price surge. Climbing to $20 would demand an astronomical 861.5% gain. Achieving these levels would elevate XRP’s market cap to $1 trillion and $2 trillion, respectively — a threshold that even the world’s most dominant tech companies have taken years to reach. Time Is the Ultimate Test Despite the enormous leap required, XForceGlobal remains unfazed. He has repeatedly challenged critics, standing by his prediction and teasing that their disbelief will be proven wrong. That said, even he acknowledges the journey may take time. In an interaction with a community member questioning the timeline , the analyst hinted that the path to $10–$20 might not be immediate. In earlier forecasts, he had earmarked 2026 as a potential target year for such explosive growth. — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) April 3, 2025 While the path to double-digit XRP may still be long and uncertain, XForceGlobal’s unwavering belief and data-backed optimism offer a counter-narrative to the prevailing market gloom. Whether his predictions come true remains to be seen, but one thing is clear — XRP continues to capture attention as a coin that might be built for more than just short-term gains.

Investors are hence, turning their eyes to MAGACOIN FINANCE, especially due to its relevance to the current market cycle. Ripple is priced at $2.04 currently and its main utility is providing cross-border payment solutions. On the other hand, MAGACOIN FINANCE just got launched and it has generated $5 million already. That too, in no time. This project, hence, promises great growth and could hit 30x soon. But which coin will hit 30x first? XRP’s Steady Path: Can It Reach $61.20? XRP is trading at a price of $2.04 currently. The coin has actually pumped by 6.7% in the last week according to on chain data. However, it is facing a lot of difficult retracing back after its 30% drop from $3.10 earlier. This means that XRP will have to hit $61.20 if it has to deliver a 30x return from this point. That seems like a very optimistic goal. Experts say that it would hit $5.81 at best in 2025 due to ongoing partnerships with banks like Santander and ODL adoption (on-demand liquidity). That’s only a gain of 185% or 2.85x . XRP’s sentiment did get a boost recently after the SEC settlement, after which its fine got reduced from $125 million to $50 million . Potentially, XRP ETF will also get approved by Q4 , which has a 74% likelihood based on data by Polymarket. However, XRP’s 100 billion supply and regulatory risks—like Better Markets’ challenge to its non-security status—may cap growth, per web reports. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Explosive Start: A $0.00798 Target MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction, raising $5 million in its freshly launched presale by April 04 , 2025 . Stage 6 sold out at $0.000266 , with a listing price of $0.007 securing a 2,500% ROI, per web reports. A 30x return from its presale price means hitting $0.00798 —already achieved at listing. Analysts project a $5 milestone by 2025 , a 71,329% jump from listing, turning $100 into $714,000 , per posts on X. Backed by a Hashex audit, its 50,000 supporters grow by 10,000 weekly across 30 + countries, and Stage 7 is 90% sold out in days . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s DeFi lending model, potentially yielding 20% + annually, positions it for rapid growth, per web insights. The 30x Race: XRP’s Stability vs. MAGACOIN’s Speed XRP’s $61.20 target for a 30x return—a 2,900% gain—seems distant, with its $5.81 forecast offering a 185% rise, per web data. Its $120 billion market cap and 1,500 transactions per second at 0.00001 XRP per transaction highlight utility, but regulatory uncertainty and competition from stablecoins like RLUSD ( $170 million market cap) pose risks, per web reports. MAGACOIN FINANCE, starting at $0.000266 , hit $0.00798 at listing—a 30x return—making it the early winner. Its $5 target offers a 71,329% ROI from listing, per posts on X, with a potential $50 million valuation at listing, showcasing low-cap agility. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Might Win the 30x Race LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH CODE MAGA50X XRP’s $5.81 target offers a 185% gain, backed by Ripple’s 300 + financial partnerships, per web insights.

42952357,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=157145,1743872401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/42952357.jpeg,"With $211.5M Raised Rapidly, BlockDAG Becomes a Crypto Phenomenon— Meanwhile HYPE Drops and TAO Surges",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/with-211-5m-raised-rapidly-blockdag-becomes-a-crypto-phenomenon-meanwhile-hype-drops-and-tao-surges/,"A recent $12 million exploit has sent Hyperliquid’s HYPE spiraling, raising serious concerns over its platform security. Despite ongoing plans to compensate affected users, market faith in the project is still unstable. On the other hand, Bittensor (TAO) is gaining momentum after breaking free from a long-term wedge pattern, supported by strong indicators and a surge in open interest. Yet, while TAO aims for a $750 mark, attention is steadily moving toward BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its DAG and Proof-of-Work hybrid framework is tackling Ethereum’s known drawbacks—slow speeds, high transaction costs, and ongoing security gaps. With presale gains hitting 2,380% and tools that make launching coins easier than ever, BlockDAG is reshaping how people approach blockchain development. As more creators move away from Ethereum and look for dependable, high-speed networks, BlockDAG becomes more than just an alternative—it becomes a preferred choice. The real question isn’t why, but when to join. HYPE Struggles After $12M Hyperliquid Breach The Hyperliquid platform experienced a severe hit from an exploit linked to its thinly traded JELLY asset, resulting in a $12 million loss for its Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) vault. This incident involved a trader injecting $7.1 million, manipulating JELLY”s price through leverage, and creating significant losses. Following the attack, HYPE—the native asset of Hyperliquid—plummeted by 14%, currently sitting at $14.23. Although the team has promised to reimburse affected parties (excluding flagged wallets) via the Hyper Foundation, questions around platform resilience remain. Quick mitigation steps and backend improvements may help HYPE recover its lost standing. For risk-tolerant participants, this price drop could be a potential re-entry moment—if the platform swiftly regains user trust and secures its framework. TAO Breaks Key Resistance: Is $750 Within Reach? Bittensor (TAO) has successfully moved out of a six-month wedge, which many traders consider a sign of an upward shift. This breakout, along with stronger open interest and consistent bullish candles, reflects rising sentiment. TAO now trades close to $275, and analysts suggest $750 as a plausible future price, assuming it clears the $300 barrier. Indicators such as RSI and MACD continue to trend positively, and trading volume is also climbing. With open interest rising more than 10% in just a day, market participants are beginning to show increased confidence. The setup may offer a key moment for those eyeing a breakout before further price movement unfolds. Why Developers Are Choosing BlockDAG Over Ethereum—And Why It Matters Developers are increasingly moving toward BlockDAG—and there’s a clear reason behind the shift. Ethereum”s congestion during peak periods and unpredictable fees create serious challenges. BlockDAG”s combination of DAG technology and Proof-of-Work resolves these issues by handling thousands of transactions per second without delays or vulnerabilities. This level of efficiency is especially important for use cases that demand constant activity. Affordability also gives BlockDAG an edge. While Ethereum often suffers from fluctuating and costly gas fees, BlockDAG offers stable and budget-friendly operations, appealing to those who need frequent and reliable transactions. Ease of use is another area where BlockDAG leads. Tools like the Token Creation Wizard simplify launching new digital assets, even for beginners who lack advanced coding skills. Its secure, parallel validation system also strengthens its resistance to potential breaches, making it a safer space to build. Raising more than $211.5 million during its crypto presale , with a remarkable 2,380% return from early rounds, BlockDAG has already sold over 19.1 billion coins. The excitement is drawing developers quickly. Missing this may mean missing a key shift in blockchain progress. Final Say! While HYPE may recover once it restores faith, and TAO’s technical outlook looks promising, BlockDAG brings real solutions to problems still troubling major networks. With $211.5 million raised, a developer-first system, and rapid processing speeds, this is more than a presale phenomenon—it’s shaping up to be a major player. TAO may attract market watchers, and HYPE could rebound with corrective efforts, but BlockDAG is where creators and serious resources are heading. It’s not simply a coin—it’s a growing framework built for performance, adaptability, and strength. For those tired of lagging networks and short-term price plays, BDAG offers something more meaningful. It’s early in its lifecycle, yet already solving big issues. Among the top picks this month, BlockDAG isn’t just another name—it’s setting new benchmarks.

SHIB Eyes Breakout & Uniswap Deploys $113M,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-records-5m-inflows-after-testnet-goes-live-shib-eyes-breakout-uniswap-deploys-113m/,"What do you get when a meme coin shows bullish hints and a DeFi leader allocates $113 million to DAO operations? A mix of action-packed Shiba Inu (SHIB) technical analysis and headline-making Uniswap (UNI) updates. But while those grab attention, something bigger is unfolding with BlockDAG (BDAG) —a project that’s powering what many are calling one of the most complete crypto testnets ever launched. This testnet isn’t a basic showcase. It’s a full-scale stress trial for global usability, running live dApps, functioning token creators, and complete dev tools. The key idea? This is more than a test—it’s a live demonstration of what future giants may rely on. And this rollout is generating real traction well ahead of the mainnet. No promises—just live proof. For anyone evaluating top crypto coins 2025, BlockDAG is already demonstrating what others are still building. BlockDAG’s Testnet Is Fully Functional and Proving Readiness Rather than acting as a trial run, BlockDAG’s testnet operates as a true stress test meant to assess how the system handles demand at scale. Live smart contracts are already working, token and NFT creators are online, and advanced tools like the upgraded explorer and faucet are active. This setup isn’t about lab tests—it’s actively demonstrating how the system meets actual usage needs. This brings clarity to BDAG coin buyers, as every smart contract, dApp launch, or token creation shows exactly what BDAG will support once the mainnet is live. It’s not theoretical use—it’s already being used. This progress supports BDAG’s status as one of the top crypto coins in 2025 with its tools, integrations, and infrastructure already in public operation. Backing this up is the presale’s ongoing growth. With over $211.5 million raised and more than 19.1 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is gaining serious attention. The coin price in Batch 27 is now $0.0248, marking a 2,380% surge from its initial offering. Future plans include listings on 10 centralized exchanges, along with retroactive 150% bonuses for early supporters. The last batch is expected to reach a price of $0.05. Momentum keeps climbing. Over 800,000 users are currently active on the X1 Miner App, while the beta testnet period offers $2,000 BDAG in rewards. This isn’t a wait-and-see project—it’s one being used right now. With working features and expanding support, BlockDAG is establishing itself among the top crypto coins 2025—not in theory, but in action. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Analysis Hints at Breakout Potential Recent Shiba Inu (SHIB) technical analysis shows the coin holding steady at $0.00001210, a support level that sparked a rebound back in August 2024. This support zone also matches a long-standing upward trendline from 2021, making it a significant level for price movement. A descending wedge is also forming, a chart pattern often tied to breakout moves. SHIB’s RSI has moved out of oversold levels, and a move above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs could shift sentiment toward a more positive trend. So far, Shiba Inu (SHIB) technical analysis leans toward bullish momentum, with analysts watching to see if this key level holds and triggers an upward breakout. Uniswap (UNI) News: DAO Engagement Gets $113M Push Governance leads the latest Uniswap (UNI) news. The DAO has approved a $113.4 million boost for its incentive program, focusing on rewarding active delegates. Under this plan, about 12 delegates will each receive 1 million UNI, and an additional 1 million UNI will be shared with top contributors maintaining over 80% participation. Launched in late 2023, the program is now evolving to include quarterly reviews for improved oversight. This decision came shortly after the DAO allocated $165.5 million to the Uniswap Foundation to advance projects like Uniswap v4 and Unichain. All signs in Uniswap (UNI) news point toward a stronger internal structure aimed at scaling community involvement and project development. Wrapping Up Uniswap (UNI) news underlines efforts to strengthen DAO activity through large-scale incentives, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) technical analysis suggests bullish trends are forming around an important support zone. However, it’s BlockDAG that’s making the biggest waves with its testnet. This isn’t just a test—it’s a working simulation of global-scale usage. With live tools, real smart contracts, and a testnet already driving utility, BDAG isn’t offering future promises—it’s delivering results now. Among top crypto coins in 2025 , BlockDAG is already showing real progress ahead of its mainnet launch—and that’s what makes it stand out.

ETH is likely to dip further, as analysts warn of a potential drop below $1,100 due to weakness in stock markets. XRP isn’t in a strong place either, stuck under the $2.10 level and moving between possible lows of $1.79 and brief rallies toward $3.00. Meanwhile, attention is quickly shifting to BlockDAG (BDAG) , currently the most talked-about crypto. For a limited 24-hour period, BlockDAG is offering its BDAG7X Bonus, which gives every buyer a 7X increase in coin quantity—elevating even small purchases significantly. This two-day opening is quickly closing, and once it’s gone, so is the chance to massively grow your crypto holdings. Act Now: BDAG7X Bonus Has 24 Hours Left BlockDAG is now offering one of the strongest presale deals to date—but the BDAG7X offer will only be available for one more day. With this code, buyers can multiply their BDAG coins by 7X for every dollar spent, making it the most impactful presale moment yet. For those still undecided, this is the last phase where hesitation could lead to missing out. Once this countdown finishes, the high multiplier and the chance to boost your stash disappear with it. The presale already raised over $212 million, selling more than 19.2 billion BDAG coins over 27 batches. Prices rise with each new batch, and BDAG is currently priced at $0.0248. The team has confirmed that BlockDAG will be listed on 10 large centralized exchanges in 2025, with its mainnet also launching in the same year. This sets the stage for early participants to prepare for a major shift. What’s fueling BlockDAG’s current momentum is its hybrid setup that blends the security of Proof-of-Work with the fast speeds of Directed Acyclic Graphs. This supports fast processing with minimal fees while keeping it fully decentralized. On top of that, BlockDAG’s X1 miner app, its testnet beta release, and the learning-focused Academy feature are all contributing to the project’s strong push forward. However, what stands out most right now is the time-sensitive nature of the BDAG7X offer. This deal allows users to upgrade their holdings instantly, without needing complex strategies or long waits. Just one simple code and a 24-hour window to act. It’s a peak moment for those looking for the top crypto project right now. Ethereum (ETH) Price Review: Drop Likely as Recession Concerns Build The newest update on Ethereum (ETH) market analysis indicates more downside risk ahead due to ongoing pressure in the S&P 500. Market analyst Benjamin Cowen notes that if traditional stocks remain weak through April, ETH might drop close to its longer-term logarithmic support, possibly hitting $1,044. This builds on earlier observations of ETH failing to cross key resistance zones, hinting at a triple top formation on the weekly chart. Cowen also pointed out that broader economic factors like trade tariffs and inflation updates could raise volatility. Although ETH might eventually reclaim the $3,000 area, a near-term dip seems more probable. Those closely watching Ethereum (ETH) market analysis are waiting to see if April’s financial reports confirm the drop before any meaningful climb occurs. XRP Chart Trends: Still Battling Resistance at $2.10 XRP technical analysis reveals it’s having trouble staying above $2.10 after being rejected at $2.23. The asset touched a low of $1.98 during the week, falling past multiple support zones, including a short-term triangle at $2.08. Price remains under the 100-hour SMA, and with MACD indicators still negative, short-term market confidence is low. Despite this, April may still offer notable price shifts. Analyst Egrag believes XRP could drop as low as $1.79–$1.90 before making a sharp upward move to $3.00. He describes the current range as a “boredom phase,” where disinterest is high, just before a breakout could begin. With both ends of the range potentially tested this month, XRP technical analysis points to sharp moves ahead for those who remain patient. Key Takeaway Price swings remain in focus for both Ethereum (ETH) market analysis and XRP technical analysis. ETH might break down toward lower support levels if stock weakness continues, while XRP is sitting in a broad trading band, possibly setting up for a drop before a rebound. With such mixed signals, attention is shifting toward the most discussed project right now—BlockDAG.

A draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) titled Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP) has been introduced by developer Agustin Cruz. It outlines a plan to enforce a network-wide migration of BTC from legacy wallets to ones secured by post-quantum cryptography. Quantum computing involves moving away from a process reliant on binary code, ones and zeros, and exponentially increasing computing power by employing Quantum bits (qubits) that exist in multiple states simultaneously. Such a jump in power is expected to threaten modern computing encryption built by classic machines. The proposal suggests that after a predetermined block height, nodes running the updated software would reject any transaction trying to spend coins from an address using ECDSA cryptography , which could theoretically make it vulnerable to quantum attacks. A hard fork debate Bitcoin currently relies on algorithms, including SHA-256 for mining and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for signatures. Per Cruz, legacy addresses that haven’t yet transacted are protected by additional layers, while those that have exposed their public keys—necessary to conduct transactions—may now be vulnerable “if sufficiently powerful quantum computers emerge.” The move would require a hard fork , which is likely going to be a tall ask from the community. A hard fork refers to a change to a blockchain that renders an older version incompatible. ""I admire the effort but this will still leave everyone who doesn't migrate's coins vunerable, including Satoshi's coins,"" said one Reddit user about the new proposal. ""Bitcoin could implement a post quantum security for all coins but that would need a hard fork, which due to bitcoin's history and the mantra repeated by maxis that would create a new coin and would not be bitcoin anymore."" Read more: The Blocksize Wars Revisited: How Bitcoin’s Civil War Still Resonates Today Preventive measure The proposed solution sets a migration deadline to lock those funds unless they’re moved to a more secure wallet. This proposal isn’t a response to any imminent breakthrough in quantum computing. Instead, it's a preventive measure, yet it comes a little over a month after Microsoft unveiled Majorana 1 , a quantum processing unit designed to scale to a million qubits per chip. During a migration window, users would still be able to move funds freely. The BIP calls for wallet developers, block explorers and “other infrastructure” to build tools and warnings to help users comply. After the deadline, non-upgraded nodes could fork from the network if they continue accepting legacy transactions. This is not the first time someone has suggested a mechanism to defend Bitcoin from quantum computing threats. Most recently, BTQ, a startup working to build blockchain technology that can withstand attacks from quantum computers, has proposed an alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm involving quantum technology. In its research paper, BTQ proposed a method called Coarse-Grained Boson Sampling (CGBS). This process uses light particles (bosons) to generate unique patterns—samples—that reflect the blockchain’s current state instead of hash-based mathematical puzzles. However, this proposal would also require a hard fork involving miners and nodes replacing their existing ASIC-based hardware with quantum-ready infrastructure.

42952308,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146729,1743872436,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Sets the Stage: $211.5M Raised & Testnet Active While ETH and XRP Stay Volatile,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eth-price-forecast-weakens-xrp-holds-steady-as-blockdag-beta-testnet-launches/,"Ethereum’s latest pullback is once again putting the Ethereum (ETH) price forecast under pressure, despite the progress made with its recent Pectra testnet upgrade. In the meantime, XRP is hovering at a technical crossroads, where both bullish and bearish scenarios are still in play. But while ETH and XRP trade in uncertainty, BlockDAG (BDAG) is moving ahead decisively. With the recent reveal in Keynote 3, the project has officially launched its Beta Testnet V1 , now accessible to the public. From live tools to real dApp deployment, BlockDAG is accelerating its roadmap. Backed by a $211.5 million presale, it’s becoming a serious candidate for the best crypto for the future . Ethereum Price Forecast Cools Off Despite Pectra Progress The Ethereum (ETH) price forecast is facing renewed caution after a 3% decline, just as the Pectra upgrade passed testing on the Hoodi testnet. While this resolved earlier bugs from Holesky and Sepolia, ETH’s dip to $2,000 highlights ongoing technical concerns. Analysts are watching closely for signs of a bearish flag pattern. If confirmed, it could pull ETH below $1,818, signaling additional downside risk. Pectra’s upcoming mainnet release may still turn sentiment around. Features like ERC-20 gas payments and increased staking limits have potential long-term benefits. But until the April 25 mainnet launch and developer updates offer more clarity, the near-term outlook for Ethereum remains uncertain. XRP Value at Critical Juncture as Traders Eye Breakout or Breakdown The XRP value remains caught in a tightening symmetrical triangle pattern that’s been forming since February. Analysts are divided on whether XRP is preparing for a breakout or facing an imminent decline. Bullish signals, such as the Golden MACD Cross and historical parallels, point toward a potential rise to $5.30. Others, however, highlight bearish indicators like a head-and-shoulders pattern, which could trigger a move down to $1.07. With price action still near support and resistance lines, XRP’s next big move may depend heavily on broader market trends and confirmation from upcoming technical setups. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Goes Public Following Keynote 3 Milestone BlockDAG’s highly anticipated Keynote 3 confirmed that Beta Testnet V1 is now live, marking a major step in the project’s evolution. This transition from closed-door development to an open-access testnet enables users to engage directly with the system—testing features, exploring tools, and helping shape the mainnet before its full release. The testnet brings significant technical upgrades, with transaction speeds now doubled compared to the alpha phase. Users can create tokens and NFTs through no-code features, and several early-stage dApps are already active for real-world testing. It’s a major move toward usability and community-driven growth. “Our beta isn’t just a load test—it’s a signal of where we’re headed,” said CEO Antony Turner during the keynote. He also confirmed that testnet BDAG coins would be distributed weekly to holders, encouraging ongoing involvement from the community. The numbers tell their own story. BlockDAG’s presale has now exceeded $211.5 million , with more than 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold. The current price in Batch 27 is $0.0248 , representing a 2,380% increase from the initial batch price of $0.001. Future projections remain strong. Analysts are forecasting a potential BDAG price of $1 by 2025 , with upside continuing as utility and user adoption expand. With 10 major exchange listings on the roadmap and retroactive bonuses for early buyers, demand is intensifying. Combined with over 800,000 users of the X1 Miner App and additional incentives like $2,000 BDAG rewards for beta testers, BlockDAG is not just building hype—it’s delivering infrastructure. Summing Up! The Ethereum (ETH) price forecast hinges on the outcome of its April 25 mainnet update and technical confirmation. Meanwhile, the XRP value is balanced between opposing signals, with both breakout and breakdown scenarios still on the table. In contrast, BlockDAG has entered its most productive phase yet. With a live beta testnet, smart contract deployment, and user-friendly development tools already in place, it’s proving real-world viability ahead of launch. With $211.5 million raised and demand building, BlockDAG continues to strengthen its case as the best crypto for the future —not through speculation, but through execution. As testnet adoption increases and BDAG nears public listings, this could be one of the final moments to enter before the price moves to new levels. Among the projects making headlines, BlockDAG may be the one laying the strongest foundation.

The popular meme coin is currently down 65% from its multi-year high around $0.48, and sentiment around DOGE remains underwhelming. As price action continues to weaken, investors are growing cautious, and bulls are struggling to regain control. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Buy the Dip – Over 130K ETH Added In A Single Day The broader financial landscape is not helping. Macroeconomic uncertainty, rising geopolitical tensions, and sweeping trade tariffs are shaking global markets, pushing risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies deeper into correction territory. In this environment, volatility and instability are becoming the norm — particularly for highly speculative assets such as meme coins. Dogecoin, known for its price-driven hype cycles, could be especially vulnerable if market conditions continue to deteriorate. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Dogecoin is currently testing a key support level. According to Martinez, this level will likely determine the coin’s next big move — either triggering a rebound or opening the door to deeper losses. With sentiment still fragile and volatility high, DOGE’s next steps will be closely watched as it teeters on the edge of further downside. Dogecoin Trades At Make-Or-Break Level As Bears Dominate Dogecoin is trading at a critical demand zone after enduring weeks of aggressive selling pressure that has dragged the price below key resistance levels. Among all crypto sectors, meme coins have taken the hardest hit during the recent market correction, and DOGE is no exception. The asset continues to follow a strong bearish trend, and unless bulls can defend the current support, the downtrend could accelerate. At present, Dogecoin is hovering just above the $0.17 level — a key threshold that may decide whether the coin rebounds or continues to slide. Martinez’s insights highlight the significance of this zone. According to Martinez, Dogecoin is now at a “make-or-break” level, and how it behaves here will shape its short-term and possibly long-term trajectory. Martinez pointed out that DOGE has been trading within a long-standing bullish channel, and the $0.17 level sits at the lower boundary of this structure. A decisive hold at this level could act as a launchpad for a significant rally, especially if broader market sentiment improves. Conversely, if DOGE loses this support, the bullish structure would break down — opening the door to deeper losses.

With meme coins underperforming and macro uncertainty still in play, all eyes are on DOGE’s next move. If bulls fail to defend the $0.17 mark, Dogecoin could face another leg lower. However, if this crucial support holds, a powerful rebound may follow, offering a rare window of opportunity for patient investors. DOGE Trades Below Key Averages As Bulls Defend $0.16 Support Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.169 after several days of struggling to regain momentum below the 4-hour 200 MA and EMA, both hovering near the $0.18 level. The recent rejection from this technical zone has kept DOGE under pressure, with price action showing signs of continued weakness. Bulls are now in a tight spot, needing to defend current levels to avoid a deeper correction. To confirm a potential recovery rally, DOGE must not only hold above the $0.169 mark but also break decisively above the $0.205 resistance level. This area has acted as a key barrier in recent weeks, and a breakout would signal a shift in momentum and open the path toward higher levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rejected At Descending Resistance Again – Is $78,600 Still In Play? However, the downside risks remain. If DOGE loses the $0.16 support — a level that has held through previous dips — it could quickly fall below the $0.15 mark, deepening the bearish trend. With meme coins underperforming across the board and overall market sentiment still fragile, Dogecoin’s next move will be crucial. A bounce from here could mark the beginning of a recovery phase, but failure to reclaim key technical levels could result in another leg down.

Let’s examine these catalysts in detail. XRP nears a classic technical breakdown XRP's recent price action is flashing a classic bearish reversal signal dubbed “inverse cup and handle formation.” The inverse cup and handle is a bearish chart pattern that signals fading buyer momentum after an uptrend. It resembles an upside-down teacup, with the “cup” marking a rounded decline and the “handle” forming after a brief consolidation. Inverse cup-and-handle pattern illustrated. Source: 5Paisa A break below the handle’s support typically confirms the pattern, often leading to a drop equal to the cup’s height. In XRP’s case, the rounded “cup” topped around March 19 and completed its curved decline by the end of the month. The ongoing sideways price movement between $2.05 and $2.20 forms the “handle.” XRP/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingView A breakdown below this horizontal consolidation range could validate the bearish structure, opening the door for a potential move toward the $1.58 support area — as suggested by the measured move projection shown on the chart above. In other words, XRP can decline by over 25% in April if the inverse cup and handle setup plays out as intended. Source: Peter Brandt Adding to the sell-off risk is data from the volume profile visible range (VPVR) indicator, which shows the point of control (POC) around $2.10–$2.20 — a key support zone. A breakdown below this high-volume area could trigger a sharper drop, as lower volume levels below have offered little historical support in recent history. XRP/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingView Conversely, a strong close above the 50-period 4-hour EMA (red line) near $2.14 could invalidate the inverse cup-and-handle pattern. Such a breakout may shift momentum in favor of the bulls, potentially paving the way for a rally toward the 200-period 4-hour EMA (blue line) around $2.28.

XRP whale flow point to more sell pressure As of April 5, CryptoQuant’s 90-day moving average whale flow chart was showing sustained net outflows from XRP’s largest holders since late 2024. XRP whale flow 90-day moving average. Source: CryptoQuant During XRP’s sharp price boom in Q4 2024, whale activity flipped deeply negative, indicating large entities were distributing into strength and selling the local tops. The trend has continued into 2025, with the total whale flow remaining firmly below zero. This divergence between rising prices and declining whale support suggests weakening institutional conviction and raises concerns over XRP’s near-term price stability unless accumulation resumes. US President Donald Trump’s global tariffs and the Federal Reserve’s slightly hawkish response to them have furthered dampened risk sentiment, which may weigh XRP and the broader crypto market down in the coming quarters.

While both parties are looking forward to a resolution, former US. Security Commission lawyer Marc Fagel shared his thoughts on the future of the case. Fagel posited Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling would stand, Judge Torres’ Ruling Likely to Stand in XRP Lawsuit In a recent update, former SEC commissioner Marc Fagel dismissed speculations that Judge Torres might withdraw her previous judgment. Fagel, who has a background with the SEC, clarified that the judge is unlikely to reverse her decision on Ripple’s liability. He further reiterated that the focus of the legal proceedings will likely move to addressing the remedies and penalties. He considers this as an important step for both parties involved. It is worth mentioning that this statement came to light as XRP proponents and other markets continued to discuss the case’s future. A Mysterious Filing Causes Concern In an interesting turn of events, American journalist Eleanor Terrertt disclosed that a man named Justin W. Keener, who was not authorized to be involved in the XRP lawsuit, submitted a request to present decisive evidence. This filing claimed that the evidence would benefit Ripple and the American public. However, the filing’s nature has raised more questions than answers. Fagel quickly dismissed it as irrelevant, labeling it as spam and noting that it was a submission by someone not involved in the case. He expects it to be deleted soon. Settlement Still in Sight, But Delays Are Possible It is important to add that Ripple Labs’s withdrawal of its cross-appeal following the SEC’s withdrawal of its appeal indicates that the case is nearing its end. Legal experts suggest a settlement could be reached within two months. However, potential delays are still possible, as a few steps remain before a final resolution. Meanwhile, In an interview with CNBC, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty stated that Ripple would lead the effort for clear and fair crypto regulation. Still, crypto experts and the community continue to watch closely as the case develops. As of this publication, CoinMarketCap data shows XRP, the fourth-leading cryptocurrency globally, is trading at $2.12. It has been down by 0.45% in the last 24 hours.

According to reports, the City of London Police has kick-started a civil asset recovery program in partnership with law firm Gowling WLG. The partnership was established after a successful pilot where both parties successfully recovered £2 million pounds for an elderly victim of cryptocurrency fraud. The partnership will focus on coordinating efforts between the United Kingdom police and other stakeholders, including victims and their legal counsel to retrieve stolen assets. The recovery program will operate in areas where perpetrators of criminal offenses in the crypto industry cannot be prosecuted, providing victims of fraud, including the ones related to digital assets, with the opportunity to claim some restitution. United Kingdom police partners with Gowling WLG to help fraud victims In a press release, Brid Holden, a Director at Gowling WLG mentioned that the firm was pleased to be working with the United Kingdom police in the program. “After a successful pilot, we are pleased to be working on this initiative with the City of London Police to investigate and support victims to recoup monies lost to such frauds,” he said. Holden also mentioned that he hopes that the initiative will be able to help more victims report fraud and raise awareness. According to a Chainalysis report, the entire crypto industry lost about $9.9 billion to scammers in 2024, with the figure expected to be more than that by the end of the year. He hopes that the collaboration between Gowling and the City of London Police will change the landscape and limit funds lost to bad actors. While some loss may be out of their hands, the partnership will see to it that both parties provide the needed help to victims. The United Kingdom police are also aiming for the same result, with Detective Chief Inspector Craig Mullish mentioning that in the case of fraud, “it’s the money or assets that are lost that can have a lasting effect on victims.” Still, research carried out by the United Kingdom police showed that civil asset recovery can also help authorities in combating organized crime while protecting the United Kingdom against fraud and other types of criminal activities. UK police accelerate recovery of crypto-related fraud In the cases of crypto frauds, the United Kingdom police has done a lot of recovery over the last few months. A peculiar case happened a week ago, where the UK police teamed up with law firms to recover about $670,000 that had been defrauded from an 80-year-old man. The police used an update to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, freezing the stolen digital assets. However, this new power will clear the ground for more partnerships between the United Kingdom police and legal firms, which have not always proven to be capable of retrieving stolen digital assets, to work without the assistance of more experienced firms. For example, a case in the UK last September was filed against Wealth Recovery Solicitors, where a victim of $818,000 crypto fraud accused the firm of negligence after it failed to recover stolen funds. In that case, Wealth Recovery Solicitors allegedly lacked the expertise to trace the stolen assets and manage the litigation required to retrieve them, with the firm applying for a global freeze order against blockchain.com, because details of the BTC address with the stolen assets could be viewed on the platform’s address. The case against Wealth Recovery Solicitors is being handled by Ashley Fairbrother of Edmonds Marshall McMahon, who was a partner in a recent £520,000 worth of digital asset retrieval. Discussing the partnership between the City of London Police and legal firms, Fairbrother mentioned that it is a step in the right direction. “It is only through this type of initiative and collaborative efforts that we can hope to tackle the increasing scale of fraud,” he said. He also added that these sorts of relationships should be forged everywhere. “It is precisely these arrangements that we now need to focus on and create between every police force, and specialist private sector law firms, to tackle the complex and rapidly evolving cryptocurrency frauds this country is facing,” he added.

Well, you’re in the right spot! Today, we’re diving into three exciting projects that could be game-changers in the blockchain world: Qubetics, Cronos CRO, and Ethereum. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just getting started, these cryptocurrencies are making waves and showing serious promise. From decentralized VPNs to smart contracts, these projects are pushing the limits of what blockchain can do. Let’s start with Qubetics. This project focuses on solving problems that earlier blockchain solutions couldn’t quite address, specifically with real-world applications like cross-border transactions and asset tokenization.Next, we’ve got Cronos CRO—a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the blockchain world. Its recent updates have cemented its position as a top choice for anyone exploring the next big crypto. Lastly, Ethereum, the OG of smart contracts, continues to dominate and evolve, with its transition to Ethereum 2.0 opening up new opportunities for scalability and energy efficiency. Now, let’s break down why these three coins are the ones to watch in 2025 Qubetics – The Next Big Crypto Revolutionizing Digital Finance with Decentralized VPN If you’ve been watching emerging blockchain projects, Qubetics should be high on your list. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its Decentralized VPN (Virtual Private Network). In a world where online privacy and security are more important than ever, Qubetics is stepping in to offer a solution that protects users and decentralizes how VPNs work. For businesses, professionals, and individuals alike, a decentralized VPN means greater privacy and control over data. Traditional VPNs rely on centralized servers, which can be vulnerable to hacks or government surveillance. In contrast, Qubetics decentralizes this structure, spreading data across multiple nodes, making it much harder to track or intercept. Imagine accessing content from anywhere, securely and privately, without having to trust a single provider. This is a game-changer, especially for those who value online privacy. Qubetics is currently in its 28th stage of crypto presale , and the momentum is real. With over 506 million tokens sold and 24,300+ holders, the excitement around Qubetics is palpable. The presale has raised over $15.8 million, and with the price of $TICS tokens sitting at $0.14301, there’s a chance for those jumping in early to see impressive returns. Analysts have predicted that the token price could skyrocket to $1 by the end of the presale, delivering an incredible 599.21% ROI. But that’s just the beginning. As Qubetics hits its mainnet launch, analysts suggest it could reach as high as $5 or even $15, giving early supporters a jaw-dropping 10,388% ROI. As you can see, Qubetics isn’t just offering a new blockchain project; it’s offering real-world utility with the potential for massive returns. If you’ve been searching for the next big crypto to buy now, Qubetics is worth a serious look. Cronos CRO – Bridging Traditional Finance with the Blockchain Revolution When people talk about the next big crypto, it’s hard not to mention Cronos CRO. As the native token of the Cronos blockchain, CRO is positioned to lead the charge in bridging the traditional finance sector with the rapidly growing world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Built on the Cosmos SDK, Cronos provides high throughput, low-cost transactions, and the scalability needed to support complex financial ecosystems. Cronos has already established strong partnerships and use cases, including integration with the Crypto.com ecosystem. Crypto.com is one of the most well-known crypto platforms globally, and it uses CRO as its primary currency for transactions, staking, and rewards. This connection gives Cronos CRO a strong backing and helps it gain traction in the larger crypto market. Plus, the recent news of CRO’s integration with top DeFi protocols continues to elevate its status, making it one of the top choices for anyone interested in the next big crypto. Ethereum – The Blockchain King Still Evolving with Ethereum 2.0 No conversation about the next big crypto would be complete without mentioning Ethereum. As the pioneer of smart contracts, Ethereum has revolutionized the way people think about decentralized applications (dApps) and the entire blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum’s transition to Ethereum 2.0 has made it more scalable, secure, and energy-efficient, addressing many of the issues that were slowing down the network. What makes Ethereum 2.0 such a breakthrough is its switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This move has significantly reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption, aligning it with the growing demand for sustainable blockchain technology. Ethereum continues to lead the way in smart contracts, enabling developers to build decentralized applications across a wide variety of industries, from finance to gaming and beyond. With Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space, it continues to hold the title as the go-to platform for many developers. As more projects are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, ETH remains one of the most important assets to hold. And as Ethereum 2.0 fully rolls out in 2025, it could open up even more possibilities for scalability and dApp development, solidifying ETH as one of the next big cryptos for the future. Decentralized VPN – The Future of Privacy and Security One of the core innovations behind Qubetics is its Decentralized VPN. While traditional VPNs are centralized, creating vulnerabilities, Qubetics takes privacy to the next level by decentralizing the network. This means no single provider controls your data, ensuring complete privacy and freedom from surveillance. For businesses and professionals, a decentralized VPN offers a secure way to access sensitive information without worrying about data breaches or government surveillance. This is especially important for international transactions and sensitive digital communication. As more people become aware of the privacy risks online, decentralized solutions like Qubetics’ VPN could become the standard for secure internet usage. With privacy becoming a major concern for individuals and businesses, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN offers a new level of control over personal data. And as Qubetics grows and builds its decentralized infrastructure, it could very well become the go-to choice for anyone looking to protect their online privacy. Conclusion Looking ahead to 2025, Qubetics , Cronos CRO, and Ethereum are all primed to lead the next wave of blockchain innovation. Whether it’s decentralized VPNs, bridging the gap between traditional finance and DeFi, or enhancing the scalability of smart contracts, these projects are pushing the envelope in their respective spaces. If you’re looking for the next big crypto, all three of these coins offer exciting potential, each bringing something unique to the table. Don’t miss out on Qubetics’ presale or Cronos’ rise in the DeFi space—Ethereum will continue to evolve and grow with its transition to Ethereum 2.0, securing its place as a blockchain king for the years to come.

As a result, Cardano’s positive crowd sentiment is going through the roof. According to Cardanians , “Cardano ADA has the best community sentiment out of the TOP 10, according to CoinMarketCap. Currently, it’s at 89% bullish with over 950k votes.” Source: Cardanians Cardano’s strong community is based on the network’s strong emphasis on complete self-governance and decentralization. Therefore, positive crowd sentiment signals heightened optimism from traders and investors about an asset. Bitcoin and Cardano Cross-Chain Functionality Surfaces Since cross-chain functionality is instrumental in scalability, flexibility, and interoperability in blockchain, Bitcoin and Cardano have set the ball rolling. This is based on the fact that ADA is in high gear to combine Hydra with the Bitcoin Lightning network, as pointed out by Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson. Mintern, the Chief Meme Officer at Minswap, acknowledged , “Charles just revealed that Cardano is integrating Hydra with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to create a trustless, recursive bridge between them, enabling seamless cross-chain functionality.” If this is implemented, it will mark a notable milestone in blockchain’s scalability and interoperability. Meanwhile, long-term conviction continues to run deep in the Cardano ecosystem, given that more than 70% of ADA holders have held their position for more than a year. Furthermore, popular crypto influencer Alex Becker recently opined that Cardano could surge to between $4 and $5 as “fast as hell.”",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-05 17:27:54

However, the trade war, fewer rate cuts, and other events rattled the stock market. The silver lining for crypto enthusiasts is that various DeFi developers are rolling out ambitious projects. Time.Fun The Solana-based platform, launched in February, is a market where fans may buy time they may share with their favorite creators. Creators set profiles on Time.Fun and are divided into several categories, including music, influencers, investors, marketing, UI/UX design, athletes, and others. We're just about one month since launch with some incredible metrics, optimizations, products and creators. – $191M+ in trading volume – 200 creators onboarded – 56/200 creators earning at least $1k in revenue – $300K in donations to nonprofits Read the full recap below 👇 pic.twitter.com/Af33D3uRsz — time.fun (@timedotfun) April 2, 2025 Profiles present examples of their work and the desired price of their time, expressed in dollars per minute. Customers may invest in creators or “buy” their time so that creators may spend it communicating with customers via chats, including audio and video calls. Creators’ content can be sold via auctions. On top of everything, Time.Fun allows customers to connect with Solana team members. Ethos The purpose of the Ethos network is to provide tools that allow users to measure the credibility and reputation of the web3 platforms. Ethos went live on Base in January. The platform allows various web3 entities to capitalize on their reputation. Bad actors may get penalized, though. The information on the platform is crowdsourced. Users are expected to proactively share and post their accounts on their experience using Web3 services. The reputation is measured via Ethos credibility scores. These scores are gradually summed through thumbs up and down, adding or removing one point. Also, it is possible to add a review that is not positive or negative but neutral. Depositing and staking ETH (vouching) will have a stronger impact on one’s reputation. Sharing negative experiences can result in slashing the rewards of a bad actor platform. we are LIVE on @base ethos is THE credibility protocol of the future, but we recognize credibility & reputation already exist in web3 today. we're acknowledging that in celebration of our launch through an initial claim of Contributor XP Claim here → https://t.co/bG2A1deIWp pic.twitter.com/JtoU6KDbrM — Ethos (@ethos_network) January 22, 2025 The Ethos tool may be integrated into other platforms so that users will see credibility scores displayed in the profiles of the X users and other platforms.

The code allows users to gain 0.0038 ETH. In a way, Wayfinder represents a new stage of the crypto wallet evolution where crypto wallets serve as decentralized, multi-faceted finance platforms. Bitcoin and Ethereum evolution goes on Bitcoin and Ethereum were not standing still either. Ethereum is ready for a Pectra upgrade, which is planned for May. The upgrade will get the platform closer to a long-anticipated sharding system launch. The latter will tackle one of Ethereum’s greatest drawbacks–poor scalability. Ethereum is going to use hybrid-proof finality to provide instant transactions verified via two or three independent layers of rollups: optimism, Zero-knowledge, and Trusted execution environments. Ethereum will use more blobs to increase transaction speed while minimizing fees. However, we’ll have to wait for Pectra for several weeks. Already, Ethereum embraces enhanced privacy thanks to collaboration with 0xbow.io. The latter platform strives to find a balance between privacy and compliance, which is a vital and legitimate concern given the recent attacks on crypto, including a major Bybit hack.

When users request a withdrawal via Privacy Pools, the system screens their wallet. If everything is fine, ETH is withdrawn in privacy. If the funds are not approved, they are returned to the previous address. As for Bitcoin, lately, various companies have contributed to the Bitcoin network a lot. For instance, Lombard and Babylon Labs introduced Bitcoin staking via a Baby token, paving the way for Bitcoin to enter the DeFi sector. With the launch of @babylonlabs_io 's Genesis chain and the BABY token, BTC staking enters a new era — and if you're holding LBTC, you're part of it.

Analysts reveal key growth drivers for 2025,https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/05/is-mutm-set-to-outperform-xrp-analysts-reveal-key-growth-drivers-for-2025/,"In a year filled with shifting market narratives and renewed interest in decentralized finance, analysts are beginning to weigh new contenders against legacy projects. One rising candidate now being compared to well-established tokens like XRP is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a DeFi project that’s gaining steady momentum ahead of its official launch. With fresh capital flowing into early-stage protocols and investor focus leaning toward real-world utility, some believe MUTM has the tools to deliver stronger upside in 2025. Ripple (XRP) XRP continues to hold a significant position in the market, largely driven by its role in global remittances and ongoing developments within the Ripple ecosystem. A major legal milestone was recently reached as Ripple agreed to settle its case with the US SEC, securing a reduced fine of $50 million. This outcome has provided some regulatory clarity but hasn’t yet triggered a meaningful price breakout. Despite occasional bullish predictions, some market analysts have pointed to potential downside risks. Bearish patterns on XRP’s chart have been observed, including signs that may suggest a correction if key resistance levels aren’t broken. While XRP maintains its relevance in the broader crypto landscape, its price growth appears to be slowing, especially in light of new competitors gaining ground with fresh utility and investor appeal. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance offers a fresh take on decentralized lending and borrowing. Unlike XRP, which primarily focuses on cross-border payments, Mutuum is building a system where users can earn passive income by supplying assets or unlock liquidity by borrowing against their existing crypto holdings—all without giving up ownership. The protocol is non-custodial and powered by smart contracts. When users deposit supported assets, they receive mtTokens, which reflect their share in the pool and accrue interest over time. Borrowers, meanwhile, lock collateral and receive stablecoins or other assets based on the protocol’s overcollateralization model. This structure appeals to a growing segment of users looking for practical DeFi tools, not just speculative trading. With stablecoin lending on the rise and demand for flexible liquidity solutions increasing, Mutuum is entering the market at a well-timed moment. Key growth drivers for MUTM in 2025 One major advantage driving interest in MUTM is its token model. A portion of the protocol’s revenue is used to buy tokens from the open market, and those are redistributed to mtToken stakers—creating a reward loop that encourages long-term engagement. This cycle naturally strengthens token utility while aligning value growth with actual platform usage. Another factor is Mutuum’s clear launch plan. The beta version of the platform is expected to go live shortly after the presale ends, meaning the token will have functional utility almost immediately. This is in sharp contrast to many presale tokens that launch without a working product. MUTM is also entering at a low starting valuation. The presale has already raised over $6.1 million, with more than 7,800 holders participating. The current price of $0.025 is expected to rise in the next phase, and analysts predict that the token will reach much higher levels throughout 2025 as activity on the platform grows. While XRP’s position in the market remains relevant, some investors are now prioritizing early entry into projects like Mutuum for a higher return profile. MUTM is still in its growth stage, with a smaller market cap, a product launching soon, and a community that’s scaling quickly. These ingredients often set the stage for meaningful upside—particularly when the project delivers on both tech and timing. XRP will likely remain a key name in crypto portfolios, but the focus is shifting. In 2025, more traders and long-term investors are looking at where real growth can come from. With a product nearing release, a compelling token economy, and growing adoption, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the top DeFi contenders to watch, and a strong performer when compared to older, slower-moving assets like XRP.

Dubbed by some as “XRP 2.0”, MUTM is reshaping DeFi lending with groundbreaking Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.025 and has collected $6.2 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.03 while attracting more than 7900 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 140% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06. MUTM could hit $4 soon after launch. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 7900 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $6.2 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.025 in Phase 4 even though investors anticipate a 20% price increase in Phase 5 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $4 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value.

Unchained Director of Market Research Joe Burnett believes this stability might be a re-run of the crypto asset’s initial rebound during the 2020 market crash. Dow Declines, Bitcoin Rises On April 4, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 2,200 points, after a 1,679-point decline the previous day. The 3,800-point drop was the worst two-day decline ever, prompting widespread alarm across financial markets. But while shares fell, Bitcoin (BTC) increased 2.2% during the same 24 hours. Burnett notes that Bitcoin’s stability amidst such turmoil is in line with how it reacted in March 2020, when it bottomed and recovered well ahead of U.S. stocks. Bitcoin as a Liquidity Barometer Burnett described Bitcoin’s volatility as frequently being the reason for it to lead the charge when assets are selling off in panic. However, since the selling in these episodes has usually been swift and nasty, Bitcoin usually bottoms along with it before broader markets . “Bitcoin hasn’t made new lows since March 11,” Burnett said. “That could be an early sign that the underlying weakness in wider markets might be easing.” Bearish Sentiment Suggests a Turning Point Investor sentiment has also reached all-time lows. The AAII investor sentiment survey fell to 19.11% on March 13—the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, low readings like this have tended to coincide with market turning points. Bitcoin Not Out of Danger Even with recent gains, Burnett warned against optimism too early. If equity markets continue their precipitous drop, Bitcoin may still be at risk for another slide. “If equities keep falling hard in the coming weeks, it’s reasonable to assume that Bitcoin might also be in more stress,” he warned. However, the performance of the crypto asset is the bright spot in an otherwise risky environment.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-05 17:31:00

More than half of Americans (52%) are dissatisfied with how President Trump is handling the economy. This is 10% more than in October 2024, when only 42% disliked how he was conducting the economy. The poll was done before Trump announced this week that all goods going into the U.S. would be subject to a 10% base tax. Americans are anxious yet want to see whether Trump will succeed From March 27 to April 1, 1,500 registered voters were reached by text message for the Journal poll. The poll was released by the Wall Street Journal on Friday. It found that only 25% of people are happy with how Trump has run the country in his first 100 days in office. According to the report, 54% of voters who answered the poll said they were against the president’s taxes on imported goods. On the other hand, 42% said they were in favor of the move. Also, 35% of those who answered the poll said that short-term stress will actually make them more money in the long run. However, more Americans (48%) say that consumers will feel little economic pain before they see gains from tariffs. John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who conducted the Journal survey with Republican Tony Fabrizio said, “American voters give a president a little grace at the beginning They can have high anxiety about his economic policy and tariffs, and also say they want to wait and see. I think that’s where people are.” Trump says he is confident about his plan Friday was the stock market’s second day of significant losses since Trump’s Wednesday afternoon announcement of up to $600 billion in new import levies. The size and extent of Trump’s tariffs astounded investors, who had already begun selling stocks in expectation of a worldwide recession. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,231 points on Friday , losing 5.5 % of its value for the day. The S&P 500 index fell 6%, while the Nasdaq composite fell 5.8% on the day. The Dow is currently down around 15% from a record high of 45,073 set in December, the S&P 500 is down 17.4% from a February high, and the Nasdaq is down a shocking 23% from its December closing record. Trump told Truth Social earlier on Friday that investors should buy cheap in the market and that he remains confident in his plan. On Friday, several of his staff publicly defended his policy, but Trump has yet to respond. It is now crystal clear that Trump is no longer moved by market crashes like he was in his first term. Vice President Vance told Newsmax in an interview Thursday, “We’re feeling good. Look, I frankly thought, in some ways, it could be worse on the markets because this is a big transition.” He added, “We have to remember that for 40 years, American economic policy has rewarded people who ship jobs overseas. It’s taxed our workers, it’s made our supply chains more brittle, and it’s made our country less prosperous, less free, and less secure.” However, critics of Trump’s tariffs claim that the president is putting the economy at risk by depleting average Americans’ retirement funds. They also claim that tariffs will lead to inflation. For instance, Powell warned that Trump’s new tariffs on both sides were bigger and more extensive than expected, which increased the risk of long-term price rises. However, Trump told Powell to lower interest rates and said Powell was using the economy for political gain. Not everything is going wrong. An unexpectedly strong March jobs report was posted before markets opened on Friday. According to figures released by the Labor Department on Friday, the U.S. economy added 228,000 jobs in March. This sustained the unemployment rate, which stayed about the same at 4.2%. It is a lot better than the 135,000 jobs that economists thought would be added.

Binance Coin (BNB), meanwhile, continues to demonstrate market brawn, while a new cross-border altcoin, Remittix(RTX), has begun shaking up conventional hierarchies. As the crypto paradigm remains in the process of shifting from speculative madness to real-world utility, investors wonder which tokens can weather regulatory headwinds. In this section, we are talking about Solana price concerns, BNB's endurance, and Remittix' difference in utilizing real-world method of cross-border payments. Solana Price: Grinding through Sanction Blues Solana price remains at $117.01 as it recorded a 2.76% rise on a day when its trade volume dipped 44.12% to reach $4 billion. The market capitalization of the token valued at $60.18 billion testifies to ongoing demand for the chain's fast transactions and diversified dAppuniverse. Source: Tradingview Some experts believe an official endorsement would disrupt network operations, provoking potential flight of investors. Others argue that Solana's developer-centric foundation can absorb short-term fluctuations. Should regulators act cautiously, Solana's price can rally briskly as sentiment turns around. Praying eyes remain monitoring US policy, aware that crypto-benevolent decisions could solidify Solana's position among premium blockchains. BNB's Rock Solid Ground or Unsteady Future? Binance Coin fluctuates at $591.41, having risen by 1.25%, riding on a market cap of $84.23 billion. All major players view BNB as a necessity for exchange rewards, staking benefits, and the far-reaching Binance Smart Chain. Such dedication drives its solidity, even as trading volumes dropped 39.43% to $1.5 billion. Source: Tradingview But as investors increasingly look to newer options from centralized exchange tokens, BNB too can be in jeopardy of aggressive competition. When the regulatory spotlight shifts deeper into larger market players, Binance Coin can get damaged. But still, there are few that cannot overlook the robust ecosystem and liquidity advantages that BNB can provide. It still has a devoted user base, so its hold on top positions is far from over—unless a pathbreaking challenger steals its thunder. Remittix: Cross-Border Colossus Ready to Grow at Lightning Speed Amidst these shifting paradigms, Remittix has emerged as a cross-border giant in the making. Currently trading at $0.0734, Remittix has raised over $13.7 million and sold 518 million tokens in presale. Early investors have already recorded four-digit returns, even amidst a volatile market cycle. Remittix's value proposition is its PayFi platform, which is user-friendly and facilitates the exchange of over 40 cryptos to fiat with lower fees. Drawing on local payment rails, it shortens wire delay—sometimes removing days from the process. There is an open ledger for holding transactions to encourage transparency and prevent fraud. Companies can use the Remittix pay API to accept cryptocurrency but settle in local currency to make cross-border e-commerce more convenient. These factors place Remittix far beyond the category of fleeting hype coin. Unlike the cloud of doubt that hangs over Solana price or the healthy skepticism after BNB, Remittix addresses an actual finance issue. It could even threaten entrenched giants if mainstream adoption takes off, some analysts say. That now looks more likely as the market increasingly prefers utility to speculation. Conclusion: Who Shines in a Regulatory Storm? Solana's price story is based on the likelihood of US sanctions. A benign scenario could see Solana's blockchain thriving, but stringent policies can derail momentum into a different gear. BNB, meanwhile, benefits from a massive ecosystem and liquidity pool, though shifting trends keep it under scrutiny. Remittix, by comparison, offers a seamless cross-border setup in a $190 trillion space—the kind that resonates with users seeking practical outcomes. While it's too early to say Remittix is the next BNB, its record presale and extensive investor interest signal a bright future. If it continues to offer real-world utility, Remittix might be the altcoin to dominate, surpassing older tokens plagued by regulatory or utility challenges. Until then, all eyes are on Solana price weathering the sanction storm and whether Remittixcross-border advantage will spark even higher gains.

This has led portfolio and asset managers to exercise caution about investing in purely speculative instruments amid overall negative sentiment. Meanwhile, the blockchain-based PayFi project known as Remittix (RTX) is forging full steam ahead and stands to become one of the market leaders as it aims to transform international money transfer operations with blockchain technology. Compared to the Ripple prices today, the upcoming growth in April is set to make Remittix(RTX) the best crypto to buy for individuals who want to capitalize on a Defi project that can soar by more than 50x. Let’s find out more! Ripple Price Today; Can XRP Gain Steam In April Ripple (XRP) has been gaining serious momentum in its ecosystem as of early April 2025, with significant progress coming through its RLUSD stablecoin and partnerships with payment processors. Ripple's collaboration with Chipper Cash , announced in late March 2025, will enhance payment efficiency in Africa leveraging RLUSD to offer faster and cheaper transactions. On the price front, XRP's performance in April 2025 reflects a mix of strength and market pressure . Ripple price today is at $2.1 , down more than 30% from its $3.3 peaks in January, with a 24-hour trading volume of more than $5.2 billion. The resolution of the SEC case in March 2025 with a reduced $50 million fine cleared a big hurdle, but broader market trends—a Nasdaq slump and Trump's tariff threat—have tempered gains. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, with Changelly noting the potential for $4.52 by the end of April if institutional acceptance picks up momentum, while Coincodex is less bullish with a $3.5-$3.7 window , citing XRP's volatility as its ecosystem continues to adjust. Ripple prices today are somewhat reliant on the top altcoin’s ability to garner institutional sentiment, subjecting the currency to unpredictability—a totally different story when compared to the practical-based and legally compliant solutions put forward by Remittix . Remittix Presale Sets the Stage for a PayFi Breakthrough The world of digital finance is set to begin its transition to seamless, fast cross-border transfers thanks in major part to Remittix which managed to amass over $14.3 million during its presale. This success is further backed up by a 300% ROI for early investors that has seen the Defi company sell more than 526 million RTX tokens. Through its sophisticated technology system and intuitive user interface, Remittix allows customers to easily exchange cryptocurrency into fiat money before transferring funds directly to bank accounts anywhere in the world. Remittix handles costs at low rates. And more importantly, the DeFi project is an ERC20 coin utilising Ethereum for its blockchain security and addresses the needs of people who want to avoid delays and high costs in their money transfers. RTX’s success demonstrates that investors believe in the Defi company’s moves to simplify international money transfers. Through its native platform the integration of crypto and fiat transactions both clarifies payments and sets the new financial industry norm as investors recognize this standard. What’s Next After the Presale Boom? RTX achieved a successful presale outcome when it managed to sell more than half a billion tokens thus demonstrating its streamlined approach as a successful recipe. The Remittix presale period will be concluding and the DeFi company’s roadmap includes extensive plans for upcoming exchange listings alongside ecosystem expansion through partnership with local remittance agencies across over 100 countries. Analysts’ future predictions indicate RTX has the potential to deliver gains exceeding 25 times its current value thus establishing the presale as a vital step for this transformative fintech operation for investors and traders.

In a detailed post shared on social media, Deutscher acknowledged the current challenges in the market but urged investors not to lose sight of broader macroeconomic trends that could trigger a significant rally in BTC. “Yes, it’s painful right now but I think people are missing the bigger picture and the eventual rally will be bigger than ever,” Deutscher said. Deutscher’s thesis is based on several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that he believes will come together to push Bitcoin higher over the next 12-18 months: Trump's Economic Strategy: Deutscher believes the US President's economic policies are aimed at inflicting short-term damage to the US dollar and yields, which markets are currently in the process of digesting. Tariff-Driven Treasury Dynamics: Deutscher argues that potential tariffs could reduce foreign demand for US Treasuries, pushing domestic absorption, which could significantly impact global liquidity, to which BTC is extremely sensitive. Recession Sentiment: Markets may plummet on fears of a recession, but history shows that once a recession is officially declared, markets typically begin pricing in quantitative easing measures from the Fed, according to Deutscher. Fed Response: Expects the Fed to eventually cut interest rates, possibly paving the way for a new round of quantitative easing in 2026. However, he noted that other liquidity tools such as repo operations, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) and Treasury purchases could play more important roles in the short term. Related News: Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin Holders Should Love Tariffs, Explains Why Deutscher also commented on altcoins, suggesting that high-quality projects will mirror Bitcoin’s path and find a bottom before gradually recovering. Deutscher warned that low-quality assets may not survive the current tightening cycle, and that the elusive “alt season” will likely only occur after BTC has peaked. *This is not investment advice.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $14,697 and $17,549, with an average expected price of $10,507. In 2031, ETH could trade between $44,746 and $54,034 with an average price of $46,373 The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $1,782 Market Cap $231.8B Trading Volume (24h) $8.69B Circulating Supply 120.6M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24-hour High $1,827.12 24-hour Low $1,778.01 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.76% 50-day SMA $ 2,321.49 200-day SMA $ 3,010 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-day chart Based on the 1-day chart on April 5, Ethereum (ETH) continues to exhibit a bearish bias, trading below the 20-day simple moving average and testing the lower Bollinger Band, currently around $1,731.44. This positioning signals weakness, as the price struggles to break through the middle band resistance near $1,924.01. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 36.68, indicating that ETH is approaching oversold conditions but has not yet triggered a reversal. The lack of strong momentum suggests that any bounce may face resistance unless a decisive break above the 20-SMA occurs. Further downside remains likely if support at $1,730 fails to hold. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart Based on the 4-hour chart, Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of consolidation after a prolonged downtrend. The price is hovering near the lower Bollinger Band, currently around $1,742.91, suggesting suppressed volatility and potential support. The MACD is displaying a neutral crossover, with the MACD line slightly above the signal line, implying indecision in momentum. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power indicator reflects slight buying pressure at 0.21, hinting at a potential short-term bounce. However, the middle Bollinger Band and $1,811 level may act as resistance. A break above this level could indicate recovery, while rejection could prolong the current bearish trend. Ethereum technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 2,425.03 SELL SMA 5 $ 2,281.72 SELL SMA 10 $ 2,213.94 SELL SMA 21 $ 2,056.70 SELL SMA 50 $ 2,321.49 SELL SMA 100 $2,781.05 SELL SMA 200 $ 3,010.36 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 2,120.97 SELL EMA 5 $ 2,291.52 SELL EMA 10 $ 2,606.26 SELL EMA 21 $ 2,945.45 SELL EMA 50 $ 3,192.07 SELL EMA 100 $ 3,171.87 SELL EMA 200 $ 3,077.57 SELL What can you expect from ETH price analysis next? Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day Ethereum (ETH) charts, the market presents mixed signals. On the 1-day chart, ETH remains in a downtrend with price action below the middle Bollinger Band and RSI at 36.68, indicating weak momentum and near-oversold conditions. The 4-hour chart shows consolidation near $1,783 with minor bullish divergence in the MACD and a Balance of Power reading of 0.21, reflecting mild buying interest. However, volatility is low and the price remains range-bound. A clear break above $1,811 may suggest a short-term recovery while failure to hold support near $1,742 could resume the downward pressure. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,961 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $37,365 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $12,264 Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $25,446. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $54,034 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $54,034d mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

With large investors dumping millions in SOL and technical breakdowns accelerating, analysts fear a sharp correction. The Solana price is now at the center of attention, and many believe it could plunge toward $50 if bearish pressure continues. Meanwhile, as legacy coins falter, Remittix, often dubbed XRP 2.0, is emerging as the breakout project of 2025. While Solana struggles to hold support, Remittix has already raised over $14.3 million and sold more than 524 million tokens in its presale. Whale Sell-Off, Job Data, and a Bleak Solana Price Outlook Solana's price experienced selling pressure with whales unloading more than $46.3 million worth of SOL assets. It triggered a massive sell off with the potential for a broader correction hanging, especially with some significant US macroeconomic data scheduled. Market players are awaiting jobs data scheduled, which could have a bearing on the expectations of interest rates, thereby influencing risk assets like Solana. Currently, the Solana price is hovering around $116, having already dipped as low as $112 earlier in the day. According to Coinfomania’s Solana analysis, volatility is high, and analysts expect a 6% swing. Traders are watching whether support at $112.24 holds; if not, the price may collapse further, possibly heading toward the dreaded $50 mark in a longer-term correction. Technical indicators don’t offer much hope. The April 4th chart revealed multiple death crosses throughout the day. Despite some brief rebounds triggered by golden crosses, each bullish move was quickly erased, reinforcing the bearish setup for Solana price. Source: Tradingview XRP Faces Uncertainty While Remittix Pushes Forward XRP recently posted a modest 1.96% rebound after a sharp 5.42% drop. Traders remain cautious, especially with unresolved issues around the SEC lawsuit and new XRP futures products launching soon. A legal filing by a controversial figure stirred more confusion, while silence from the SEC added to the unease. On the chart, XRP’s price is forming a rising channel after breaking out of a descending trend. Resistance sits at $2.10, with critical support near $2.00. If XRP loses that support, the bullish case weakens fast. With legal developments still pending, XRP’s future remains unclear. In contrast, Remittix doesn’t carry regulatory baggage. Investors increasingly refer to it as XRP 2.0 not because it copies Ripple’s model, but because it improves upon it with modern infrastructure. It allows instant crypto-to-fiat conversions, solving the bottlenecks that plague XRP’s real-world adoption Source: Tradingview Remittix Shines as the Clear Winner Amid Solana Price Fears While the Solana price faces continuous pressure, Remittix continues to shine in a bearish environment. Its utility is simple yet powerful: enable users to convert crypto into local fiat quickly and affordably. At $0.0734 per token and over $14.3 million raised so far, Remittix is proving to be one of the most stable and promising projects in the current market. Take the example of a freelance software developer in Africa working with clients in Europe and North America. Traditionally, payments arrive late and get eaten up by currency conversion fees. Remittix changes this by offering immediate fiat settlement from any cryptocurrency, ensuring quick, secure payments without middlemen or delays. This type of cross-border simplicity is exactly what the market needs right now. With the Solana price on the verge of breaking down, many investors are rotating their capital into Remittix, seeing it as a safer and smarter alternative. Can Solana Price Hold $112 or Is $50 Next? Back to Solana can it recover, or is the $112 support just a stepping stone toward deeper losses? Analysts remain divided. After the April 4th death cross at 00:05 UTC, the Solana price broke lower, only to rebound briefly on golden cross signals at 05:00 UTC. This recovery carried the price to resistance at $119.95, but another death cross at 10:00 UTC brought renewed selling pressure. If bears continue to dominate, Solana price could breach the $112.24 support and head into dangerous territory. While bulls may still push for a breakout past $119.95, the repeated breakdowns and whale sell-offs suggest otherwise. The uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic data and institutional sentiment compounds the risks. As such, investors are seriously reconsidering their portfolios and increasingly choosing Remittix over speculative layer-1 tokens like Solana. Looking for a more stable alternative to Solana and XRP? Explore Remittix now to see why it’s leading the crypto payment revolution in 2025.

Despite SOL’s price downturn, the Solana network continues to outpace competitors, maintaining its second-place position in deposits and trading volume. Traders now wonder how long it will take for SOL’s price to reflect this onchain strength. Solana outperforms rivals in TVL deposits and DEX volumes Investor’s declining interest in SOL could be linked to the April 4 staking unlock of 1.79 million SOL, worth over $200 million. The selling pressure is clear, as these tokens were staked in April 2021, when SOL traded near $23. Another factor is the decline in interest for memecoins , which had been a major driver of new user adoption on Solana. With fewer speculative inflows, growth in activity may not translate to immediate price gains. Several meme-themed cryptocurrencies, including WIF, PENGU, POPCAT, AI16Z, BOME, and ACT, saw declines of 20% or more over the past seven days. Yet, despite worsening market conditions, the Solana network outperformed some competitors. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) rose to the highest level since June 2022, while decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes showed notable resilience. Solana Total Vale Locked (TVL), SOL. Source: DefiLlama Deposits in Solana network’s DApps rose to 53.8 million SOL on April 2, marking a 14% increase from the previous month. In US dollar terms, the $6.5 billion total stands $780 million ahead of its closest competitor, BNB Chain. Solana’s top DApps by TVL include Jito (liquid staking), Jupiter (leading DEX), and Kamino (lending and liquidity platform). Solana gains support for scalability, and Web3 focus despite MEV concerns While not yet a direct threat to Ethereum’s $50 billion TVL, Solana’s onchain data shows greater resilience compared to BNB Chain, Tron, and Ethereum layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum. In decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, Solana holds a 24% market share, while BNB Chain accounts for 12% and Base captures 10%, according to data from DefiLlama. DEX volumes monthly market share. Source: DefiLlama While Ethereum has regained the lead in DEX volumes, Solana has shown strong resilience following the memecoin bubble burst. For context, Raydium’s weekly volumes dropped 95% from the $42.9 billion all-time high reached in mid-January. Still, Solana has demonstrated that traders appreciate its focus on base layer scalability and integrated Web3 user experience despite ongoing criticism related to maximum extractable value (MEV). Source: X/ Cbb0fe In short, MEV occurs when validators reorder transactions for profit. This practice is not unique to Solana, but some market participants—such as user Cbb0fe, a self-proclaimed decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity provider—have raised concerns about insider gatekeeping. While not stated directly, the criticism likely refers to incentives provided by Solana Labs to offset the high investment and maintenance costs required by certain validators. Supporters of changing Solana’s token emissions argue that rewards earned through MEV already provide sufficient incentives for validators to secure the network, eliminating the need for further inflationary pressure on SOL. Meanwhile, Loring Harkness, a core contributor to Shutter Network, advocates for encrypting transactions before they enter the mempool as a way to prevent validators from manipulating their order. Solana’s growth in TVL and resilience in DEX market share may not be enough for SOL to retest the $200 level seen in mid-February. However, it has firmly secured its second-place position behind Ethereum as a leading platform for decentralized applications, supported by consistent activity, infrastructure development, and growing interest from both developers and users.

According to the analyst, altcoins will experience one last rally during this market cycle. Jamie Coutts, the chief crypto analyst at Real Vision, tells Raoul Pal that “..there will be one more breadth thrust from altcoins.” While Coutts’ outlook for the altcoin market is bullish, he maintains uncertainty over the sustainability of the rally. “The question is, is it a sustained rally that we will see for six to twelve months?” Coutts remarked that the driving force behind the prices of altcoins can be attributed to top-rated altcoin tokens with notable activity returns. “At this stage, I am not too sure, but I do believe that quality altcoins where activity returns, activity drives prices …we will definitely see a recovery in some of these more high-quality names.” He asserted . Like the analyst, other prominent market participants have observed indicators suggesting that altcoin season, a time when altcoins collectively rake in massive gains, is underway. Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital stated that the highly anticipated altcoin season hinges on Bitcoin’s dominance rejecting prices at $72,000. #BTC Dominance If history repeats, the real Altseason everybody is waiting for would begin once Bitcoin Dominance rejects from 71% (red) $BTC #Altseason #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/Zmk5gdn7Pz — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) March 30, 2025 The global cryptocurrency market dropped by 4.84% over the last 24 hours.

42955402,https://coingape.com/?p=247508,1743877924,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Satoshi Nakamoto Birthday: Here Is How Old Bitcoin Creator Is Turning As BTC Threatens US Dollar,https://coingape.com/satoshi-nakamoto-birthday-here-is-how-old-bitcoin-creator-is-turning-as-btc-threatens-us-dollar/,"Today marks the 50th birthday of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. While the identity of Nakamoto remains a mystery, Bitcoin’s impact on global finance is undeniable. In a year where Bitcoin is seeing rising institutional adoption and geopolitical support, Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of decentralization seems to be taking root on a global scale. Bitcoin is becoming increasingly recognized as an alternative to traditional financial systems, especially as inflation concerns and central bank policies weigh on the global economy. Bitcoin’s value has soared, with some speculating that it could challenge the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global markets. Satoshi Nakamoto 50th Birthday Today Satoshi Nakamoto’s birthday on April 5 holds historical significance, especially when looking at the role Bitcoin plays in the current financial landscape. This date is significant when reflecting on the history of American monetary system. On April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed the move order 6102 which was gazetted to a regulation that compelled Americans to turn in their gold to the Federal reserve. This order indicates a drastic change in the control of money which was the concept that Bitcoin sought to disrupt. The fact that Bitcoin does not have a central authority and that its supply is finite eliminates some of the issues seen with more traditional form of money that are printed by the central banks. Some view the choice of April 5 as Nakamoto’s birthday as not being a complete coincidence because it is associated with monetary freedom and a reference to gold and the control of money by the U.S. government. Bitcoin’s growing popularity in 2025 may be seen as a direct response to centralized financial systems. Part from being a decentralized and deflationary system, Bitcoin presents the potential to become a global reserve currency in the future replacing the existing US Dollar. Bitcoin’s Growing Influence and Institutional Support While Bitcoin has been advocated as an instrument of speculation, over time it has evolved to be more than that – it is now seen as a store of value and an inflation hedge. Currently, big investors such as Michael Saylor and giants like BlackRock are investing in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. Like Satoshi Nakamoto, Michael Saylor the Chief Executive Officer of MicroStrategy has been an aggressive advocate for Bitcoin. His company currently possesses over 500,000 BTC , amounting to several billions of US dollars. Saylor has also stated on record that, Bitcoin is a superior store of value to the US dollar in the long-term. He described Bitcoin as the next big thing with capabilities to revolutionize finances across the world. Concurrently, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink spoke about the U.S. dollar in his letter where he stated that Bitcoin may become a competitor to the dollar, given the bleeding that the country is experiencing from high debt levels and inflation. Such contributions from large financial institutions evidently prove that Bitcoin is no longer an outsider but an integral part of the financial market. Bitcoin’s Impact on the Financial Market and Kiyosaki’s Warnings The increase in the use and demand for BTC has attracted the attention of many financial analysts and investors. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, recently raised the alarm, stating that the conventional monetary systems might collapse. Robert Kiyosaki, who has supported the idea of using gold and silver as a hedge against the uncertain economy, thinks that BTC is also among such assets . Kiyosaki has claimed that the US Federal reserve will print so much money, that inflation and dilution of the dollar is inevitable. He nourishes the opinion that it is in this environment that Bitcoin will become more valuable as an asset that allows to maintain purchasing power. With Bitcoin’s price reaching new highs and institutional adoption on the rise, the idea of a digital gold standard is becoming more plausible. Whether Bitcoin will ever replace the U.S. dollar remains to be seen, but the growing support from both private and institutional investors suggests that its role in the global financial system will continue to expand.

Bitcoin rose by about 1% during the week, while other tokens like Cardano, XRP, and BNB were barely moved as US stocks plunged. This article looks at three top coins, including Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Cardano (ADA). Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) HBAR price chart | Source: TradingView Hedera Hashgraph price has crashed in the past few months, mirroring the performance of other top altcoins. It has dropped from a high of $0.4050 in January to $0.1600 today. It has plunged and moved to its lowest level since November last year. HBAR price has moved below the crucial support level at $0.1817, the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement point. It was also a notable level since the coin failed to drop below it several times since February. The Hedera Hashgraph price is also nearing a death cross as the spread between the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) crossed each other. If this happens, it could signal more downside in the coming weeks. On the positive side, the coin has slowly formed a falling wedge chart pattern, which happens when two trendlines near their crossover. Therefore, while the overall trend is bearish, there is a risk that the Hedera Hashgraph price will bounce back in the coming days. A HBAR price surge will be confirmed if the Hedera Hashgraph price rises above the key resistance at $0.1817. A drop below $0.14 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Near Protocol price forecast NEAR price chart | Source: TradingView The Near Protocol token price has crashed in the past few months. This decline is mostly because of the ongoing crypto crash and the fact that it is often seen as an artificial intelligence (AI) -focused coin. There are now concerns that the AI bubble is bursting . Near has crashed from a high of $8.2620 in January to the current $2.5. This drop happened after it formed a triple-top pattern at $8.2183, and whose neckline was at $3.08, its lowest swing on August 6. The token also formed a death cross pattern on January 31. It has also moved below the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since October 2023. Also, the coin has dropped below the 78.6% retracement level. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target the key support at $2.0. This view will become confirmed if the coin falls below the small double-bottom point at $2.1485. Cardano price analysis ADA price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the Cardano price has crashed in the past few months. ADA has moved from a high of $1.323 in December to $0.652. The coin has moved below the crucial support level at $0.810, its highest swing on March 14. Worse, the token is about to form a death cross pattern, which happens when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages flip each other. The coin has also formed a descending channel, a sign that bears are in control for now. Therefore, more downside will be confirmed if the coin drops below the support at $0.58, the lowest point in March.

The Fed chair says at a conference in Virginia that the US economy faces “a highly uncertain outlook with elevated risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation.” Powell notes that it’s not the Fed’s role to opine on policy choices, but he did discuss the potential economic impacts of President Donald Trump’s sweeping set of new tariffs , which he says are significantly larger than expected. “The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. The size and duration of these effects remain uncertain. While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome would depend on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, on the size of the effects, and on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices. Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem. We will continue to carefully monitor the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy.” Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that imposed a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods entering the US, with the stated aim of protecting domestic manufacturing. He also issued a proclamation detailing “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of specific countries effective April 9th, with rates totaling up to 54% on China. The overall crypto market cap dropped by 1.2% on Friday, per data from CoinGecko . Stocks were hit harder, with the S&P 500 dropping by 5.97% and the Nasdaq Composite plunging by more than 6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell by 5.5%.

U.S. stocks have lost over $11T since January, and there’s no sign of the bleeding slowing down. Trump’s fresh wave of tariffs is slamming the global economy like a sledgehammer, pushing investors to look for safer ground. But here’s the twist – Bitcoin didn’t flinch. In fact, it’s quietly doing its thing, like the eye of a financial storm. As the Nasdaq stumbles, $BTC is becoming the ‘U.S. isolation hedge’ nobody saw coming. Now traders are asking: if Bitcoin is the flight to safety, what’s the rocket fuel for profits in this chaos? That’s where BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) comes charging in. With meme coins still trending and altcoin season on the horizon, this new crypto could be the unexpected hero of a very messy 2025. Markets Are Cracking, but Bitcoin Holds Its Ground Markets are in full-blown crisis mode. Since January, U.S. stocks have been slammed by a historic $11T selloff. Trump’s new tariffs have reignited global trade tensions, inflation fears are back in the headlines, and recession warnings are flashing from every corner of the economy. Even Wall Street’s old guard is feeling the heat. During a recent interview on the Crypto Banter YouTube channel , co-founder of BitMEX Arthur Hayes dropped an urgent warning, saying April is shaping up to be one of Bitcoin’s toughest months. He points to falling liquidity, tax season pressure, and central banks pretending everything’s under control while the economy clearly says otherwise. But here’s the surprise twist – Bitcoin isn’t following the script. While everything else tanks, $BTC is holding firm. That’s a pretty big statement. It’s behaving less like a risky asset and more like a hedge against economic chaos. It’s what gold used to be, but for a digital world that moves faster and doesn’t care about borders. And when Bitcoin holds steady in a panic, it sends a loud message: crypto isn’t just surviving – it’s starting to lead. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Your Leverage Play on Bitcoin’s Next Run If you’re excited about Bitcoin’s future but looking for more upside than $BTC alone can offer, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) might be your ticket to ride – and then some. Priced at just $0.002445 and already raising over $4.4M in its crypto presale , $BTCBULL is built to amplify Bitcoin’s gains with smart tokenomics and high-energy community appeal. Here’s how it works: the token is designed to grow alongside Bitcoin’s price, but faster. And to fuel that growth, BTC Bull Token isn’t just another meme coin riding the hype – it’s backed by a strong ecosystem that includes staking, airdrops, and token burns. There’s a built-in staking system, allowing holders to earn passive income just by holding. Plus, the team has scheduled three major airdrops, but they’re not automatic. To qualify, you must buy $BTCBULL through Best Wallet and keep it there. And then, when Bitcoin hits certain milestones (like $150K, $200K, and $250K), holders in Best Wallet will receive airdrops. No Best Wallet, no free tokens – simple as that. Meanwhile, token burns will also be triggered when $BTC hits price targets – slashing supply at key moments like $125K, $175K, and $225K. This deflationary model helps maintain buying pressure and gives holders more upside over time. With staking rewards, viral branding, and clear incentives tied directly to Bitcoin’s journey, $BTCBULL isn’t just another altcoin . It’s a turbocharged bet on the next crypto bull run, designed for those who want to be more than passengers on the Bitcoin rocket. The Bull Is Awake Wall Street is rattled, recession fears are mounting, and even seasoned voices like Arthur Hayes are warning of turbulence ahead. But while traditional markets flounder, Bitcoin is showing strength – and with it, a new wave of opportunity is rising in crypto. $BTCBULL is built for this moment – a token designed to thrive alongside Bitcoin’s climb, with the added fuel of staking rewards, airdrop incentives, and supply-burning mechanics. If the bulls are back, this one’s ready to run fast.

Among these, Coldware (COLD) , Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC) are seen as three major players poised to take significant strides in both utility and market performance this year. Coldware (COLD): The Next Big Thing in DeFi and Blockchain Integration In addition to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Coldware (COLD) is making waves in the crypto space. Coldware (COLD) is a rising star in the world of decentralized finance, offering a unique approach to blockchain integration that has captured the attention of both investors and developers. Coldware (COLD) has already seen substantial growth, with its presale raising millions of dollars and attracting significant interest in 2025. What sets Coldware (COLD) apart from other cryptocurrencies is its focus on real-world applications. The platform’s emphasis on financial inclusion and DeFi solutions offers a practical utility that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have yet to fully capture. Coldware (COLD) is also set to release hybrid on-off chain products, further enhancing its value proposition by integrating blockchain technology with mobile devices and real-world financial systems. Bitcoin (BTC): A Key Player in the Cryptocurrency Market Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency, remains at the forefront of the market despite facing fluctuations. Recently, Bitcoin has experienced a slight dip, with its price hovering near $80,000, but it is expected to recover as the market stabilizes. Historically, Bitcoin has been a safe haven for investors during times of financial uncertainty, especially during global crises. The market tends to bounce back strongly after a bearish phase, and many analysts believe Bitcoin (BTC) will continue to rise in value in 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) serves as a foundational element of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its widespread adoption by institutional investors and growing acceptance as a hedge against inflation make it a valuable asset. Despite the recent dip, BTC has shown resilience, and a recovery could drive it to new all-time highs. For investors looking to build wealth in 2025, Bitcoin remains a key asset to consider. Ethereum (ETH): The Backbone of DeFi and Blockchain Innovation Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is also positioned for growth in 2025. While Ethereum (ETH) has recently experienced price volatility, dropping to $1,765, its role as the foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts continues to provide long-term growth potential. The shift towards Ethereum 2.0 and its integration of proof-of-stake mechanisms will make the network more scalable and energy-efficient, which is expected to drive its adoption further. Additionally, with Ethereum’s involvement in tokenizing real-world assets and supporting DeFi platforms, ETH is poised to see significant growth. As more projects and users flock to Ethereum for its decentralized solutions, the price of ETH is expected to rise again, making it a solid investment in the coming year. The Future of Crypto Wealth: Coldware, Ethereum, and Bitcoin In 2025, Coldware (COLD) , Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC) are all poised to increase investor net worth. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to be a staple in the crypto portfolio, while Ethereum (ETH) remains the go-to platform for DeFi and blockchain development. However, Coldware (COLD) offers an exciting alternative with its focus on financial inclusion, secure mobile devices, and real-world blockchain applications. As these assets continue to gain traction, the opportunity for investors to grow their wealth is significant. Coldware (COLD) , in particular, offers the potential for 90% price increases in 2025, making it a compelling investment option for those looking to diversify their portfolio and take advantage of the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: Diversifying with Coldware, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Investors looking to increase their net worth in 2025 should consider a diversified approach, combining the stability of Bitcoin (BTC), the innovative potential of Ethereum (ETH), and the unique opportunities presented by Coldware (COLD) . While Bitcoin remains a solid long-term asset, Ethereum continues to power the decentralized finance revolution, and Coldware (COLD) offers a new and exciting avenue for growth. Together, these assets have the potential to provide substantial returns, making them essential components of a balanced crypto portfolio in 2025.

According to The Wall Street Journal , sources familiar with the matter say the company is now hesitating to move forward despite having filed registration papers with the SEC on April 1. Circle is one of several firms, including Klarna and StubHub, that are reconsidering IPO plans as markets react to President Trump’s sweeping new tariffs. Announced on April 2, the tariffs include a 10% base duty on goods from all countries, with additional retaliatory measures targeting nations that tax U.S. imports. This policy shift has sparked fears of a global trade war. Over $2 trillion in U.S. market value was lost in a single day , as investors pulled out of riskier assets. The S&P 500 Volatility Index (VIX) soared past 41, signaling widespread fear in financial markets. Concern about a potential U.S. recession is mounting , especially after other nations responded with counter-tariffs. ARK Invest's Cathie Wood had already warned of slowing economic momentum weeks earlier, saying, “The velocity of money is slowing dramatically.” Circle plans to list under the ticker ""CRCL"" but has not yet disclosed details on share quantity or pricing.

The price now finds itself in a tight consolidation, hinting at the calm before the storm. The current range between $2.10 (support) and $2.17 (resistance) is the battlefield — and the breakout direction will determine the next leg. Support & Resistance Zones Support: $2.08 – $2.10 Buyers have consistently stepped in at this zone, forming a soft floor. Resistance: $2.17 – $2.20 Sellers are guarding this level tightly, with multiple rejections indicating heavy supply. Trend & Price Structure The trend is bullish in the short term, though momentum has paused. A rectangle pattern is forming, signaling a breakout setup. A potential bull flag also emerges, suggesting continuation if $2.17 breaks. The price has printed a double top around $2.17, often a reversal signal, but confirmation is lacking without a support break. Indicators ADR (14): Sits at 0.0111 — a significant compression from prior levels. Low range = high probability of breakout. MACD (12, 26): Bearish crossover is in play, but histogram bars are weak. This hints at fading downside momentum and potential for reversal. What’s Next? XRP is coiling, and a breakout is near. A push above $2.17 could open the doors to $2.25 and $2.30 quickly. Conversely, slipping below $2.10 could drag it toward $2.04 or the psychological $2.00 level. The risk-to-reward ratio favors bulls — if volume kicks in. A breakout above resistance with strong volume would confirm the strength and invalidate the double-top concerns. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Fundamentals Still Back the Bulls Ripple’s ongoing utility push through ODL expansion and cross-border finance integration keeps XRP fundamentally strong. Regulatory wins and broader crypto market optimism provide additional tailwinds. With growing confidence from institutions and traders, XRP’s structure aligns with a bullish breakout narrative. Final Take XRP is loaded like a spring. Indicators show exhaustion on both sides, while price action compresses near a critical zone. With fundamentals steady and technical leaning bullish, eyes are on a break above $2.17 — the likely trigger for the next wave up.

These tokens, along with emerging projects like Coldware (COLD) , are capturing the imagination of savvy traders and crypto enthusiasts, as they offer significant potential for high returns in the second half of the year. Coldware (COLD): Rising as the Next Big Opportunity Coldware (COLD) , an emerging cryptocurrency with a strong emphasis on financial inclusion and real-world utility, has been gaining significant attention from Ethereum (ETH) and Sonic (Sonic) communities. The project has been described as having the potential to outperform both Ethereum (ETH) and Sonic (Sonic) in the upcoming quarters due to its innovative hybrid on-off chain products. With an active presale and strategic developments, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a cryptocurrency that can bridge the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional financial systems. Coldware (COLD) provides solutions that offer secure, scalable, and real-world applications, which are highly sought after in the current crypto market. Experts predict that Coldware (COLD) could see up to a 10x increase by Q3 2025 as more users and developers turn to its network for secure financial services. Coldware (COLD) promises to create new opportunities for decentralized applications, attracting significant interest from the Ethereum community and even rivaling Sonic in the near future. Ethereum (ETH): Current Market Struggles and Long-Term Potential Ethereum (ETH), once the leader of the blockchain revolution, continues to experience challenges in 2025. After facing a dip in its price, falling below $1,800, it’s clear that ETH is navigating through a turbulent phase. This drop in price follows a market-wide downturn, partly influenced by the geopolitical uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariff policies and the broader economic factors affecting cryptocurrencies. Despite these short-term struggles, Ethereum (ETH) still holds enormous long-term potential. As the foundation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, Ethereum (ETH) remains central to the DeFi ecosystem. The Ethereum network’s continuous upgrades, particularly Ethereum 2.0, promise to improve scalability and reduce gas fees, positioning ETH as a long-term growth vehicle. However, while Ethereum (ETH) faces bearish sentiment in the short term, the demand for its technology continues to grow, and it is expected that once the market stabilizes, ETH will regain momentum. But will it outperform other new contenders, such as Coldware (COLD) and Sonic (Sonic)? Sonic (formerly FTM): A Strong Contender for Outperformance Sonic (Sonic), previously known as Fantom (FTM), has been steadily making waves in the crypto market. Known for its high-speed transaction capabilities and low fees, Sonic (Sonic) is optimized for use in DeFi applications. Sonic (Sonic) has a growing community of users who value its transaction efficiency, making it a key player to watch in 2025. While Sonic benefits from high-speed, low-cost transactions, its growth potential is still significant, especially when compared to Ethereum (ETH). As Sonic continues to make strides in DeFi, it stands poised to increase its market share. Why Coldware (COLD) Could Outperform Ethereum & Sonic Coldware (COLD)’s growth is largely driven by its hybrid model that integrates on-chain and off-chain solutions, which many see as the next step in cryptocurrency’s evolution. Coldware (COLD) seeks to leverage both the blockchain world and the traditional financial system, offering users the ability to perform real-world transactions securely and efficiently. As Coldware (COLD) continues to refine its technology, the platform could attract more partnerships with traditional financial institutions and businesses. These real-world integrations could create massive demand for Coldware (COLD) , further boosting its market value. The project’s emphasis on financial inclusion and addressing real-world problems sets it apart from both Ethereum (ETH) and Sonic (Sonic), which have yet to fully bridge the gap between decentralized solutions and mainstream financial services. The Road Ahead for Ethereum, Sonic, and Coldware Ethereum (ETH) will continue to be a cornerstone in the world of DeFi and blockchain technology, but Coldware (COLD) may have the edge in the coming months due to its real-world utility. As the market searches for new, impactful cryptocurrencies, Coldware (COLD) ’s unique position in combining the best of DeFi and traditional finance could propel it ahead of Ethereum (ETH) and Sonic (Sonic) in terms of price growth and adoption. Experts predict that Coldware (COLD) could see a 10x return by the end of Q3 2025, surpassing the gains of both Ethereum (ETH) and Sonic (Sonic), making it a highly attractive option for investors looking for the next big crypto asset. Conclusion: The Future of Ethereum, Sonic, and Coldware While Ethereum (ETH) and Sonic (Sonic) continue to lead the market in their respective categories, Coldware (COLD) is fast becoming a top contender for investors seeking significant gains in 2025. With its unique hybrid on-off chain approach and strong focus on financial inclusion, Coldware (COLD) offers a new wave of possibilities in the DeFi space. For those looking for a cryptocurrency that can outperform Ethereum (ETH) and Sonic (Sonic) in the coming months, Coldware (COLD) may just be the most promising investment opportunity in the market.

Among several key documents, the SEC staff's statement on funds registered under the Investment Company Act Investing in the bitcoin futures market is under review, according to the X post . Other documents include digital assets ""investment contracts,"" and custody frameworks. The reviews could result in more clarification for regulatory frameworks around the digital assets sector. The request from Uyeda is related to Executive Order 14192, Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation and comes after a recommendation from Elon Musk's D.O.G.E. It is worth noting that the statement is coming from SEC staff and not from Commissioner Hester Peirce, making it less binding. However, it still shows the SEC's willingness to ease pressure on the digital assets sector since the agency was taken over by President Donald Trump-appointed leadership. The move is part of interim Chairman Mark Uyeda's efforts to overhaul the regulator's crypto position. That includes throwing out most of the prominent enforcement cases the agency had pursued against digital asset businesses.

Amid this negative market sentiment, the sector witnessed some notable developments, which have been outlined by the research arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance. According to a Monthly Market Insights report by Binance Research, the industry saw regulatory progress and growth in certain sectors in March, reinforcing positive sentiment for medium and long-term development. Market Fell 4.4% in March After United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve in early March, the crypto market witnessed intense volatility that lasted throughout the month. This, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold benchmark interest rates steady for a second consecutive meeting and tariff tensions , significantly subdued risk appetite, leading to a 4.4% decline. Analyzing cryptocurrencies, the Binance Research team found that the supply of bitcoin (BTC) belonging to long-term holders is increasing. There has also been significant Bitcoin adoption since establishing a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, with institutions increasingly buying the asset. The increasing adoption has been driven by U.S. authorities taking major steps to regulate cryptocurrencies. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently authorized banks to hold cryptocurrencies, while the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation in U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which creates a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S., is moving closer to enactment. Losses and Gains Furthermore, March brought major shifts to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, with Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) recording significant growth. The U.S. Senate overturned a rule that would have required DeFi platform operators to be subject to heavy reporting requirements by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Unfortunately, the DeFi total value locked (TVL) dropped 1.5% month-on-month (MoM), with intense competition leading to declining market share for some leading platforms like the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap. Binance Research discovered that rival DEXs like PancakeSwap and Raydium have increased their market shares. Notably, meme coins saw negative growth, with the market cap of top tokens declining by millions of dollars. Since the launch of Official Trump (TRUMP), the meme coin launchpad Pump.fun has experienced a plunge in weekly usage metrics, including volume, token creation, and active wallets. Meanwhile, total sales volume in the non-fungible token (NFT) market declined by 12.4%, while the stablecoin market cap rose by 4.4%.

The expert hinges his theory for Bitcoin price on key technicals, analyzing the relationship between Realized Cap, Market Cap, and selling pressure to reach his conclusions. Expert Gives Reason Why The Bitcoin Bull Market Is Over According to an analysis on X , Ki Young Ju reveals that Bitcoin is firmly in bear market territory to the dismay of investors. The CryptoQuant CEO surmised in his analysis that the curtain has fallen for the Bitcoin bull market giving reasons. In his analysis, Ju bases his prediction on the interplay between Bitcoin’s Realized Cap and the asset’s market capitalization. Realized market cap measures Bitcoin’s value using the price at which each BTC held in wallets was transferred. On the other hand, the market cap measures value by multiplying the circulating BTC supply with current prices. The CryptoQuant CEO notes that market capitalization alone is not the best way to track the Bitcoin Bull Market. According to Ju, when there is low selling pressure in the markets, small Bitcoin purchases often send the market capitalization to new highs. Ju notes that Strategy has ridden the tailwind of low selling pressure to grow the paper value of their BTC holdings. Conversely, when sell pressure is high, sizeable purchases are unable to send Bitcoin price on a rally. Strategy’s purchase of 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion did not trigger a rally like its previous acquisition. Onchain data indicates that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap is rising but market capitalization continues its decline, an indicator of bearish sentiments. Ju notes that fresh capital is flooding the markets but prices are not responding, signaling the end of the bitcoin bull market. “When even large capital can’t push prices upward, it’s a bear,” said Ju. Bitcoin Price Flashes Bearish Signals Despite glowing fundamentals and large acquisitions, on-chain indicators are underwhelming for the top cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price is consolidating within a bearish pennant, a signal for even lower prices. However, a small bump has triggered speculation of a potential Bitcoin price decoupling from S&P500 . Crypto Sat says a short-term drop to $80K is in play for Bitcoin with prices standing at $82,950. However, Ju has even grimmer predictions for BTC, noting that a near-term rally is unlikely for the asset. The CryptoQuant CEO notes that it will take the asset up to six months to drag itself out of the bear market. “Sell pressure could ease anytime, but historically, real reversals take at least six months,” said Ju. Despite the dour sentiments, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has praised BTC as a store of value comparing it with gold.

According to Bloomberg, the collapsed crypto firm is progressing with its repayment plans, but only to those who met its requirements. 392,000 Claims Rejected After Identity Deadline In a recent filing , the U.S. Bankruptcy Court confirmed that 392,000 claimants who failed to complete identity verification by March 3 successfully have had their claims removed. According to reports, these denied claims were over 2,377 pages of court filings. In addition, the removed claims were originally estimated to be worth around $1 billion. However, creditor advocate Sunil Kavuri disclosed the total could reach $2.5 billion. As detailed, this includes $655 million in smaller claims under $50,000 and another $1.9 billion in larger ones. Unfortunately, the court denied them because they did not submit the required identification documents before the deadline. FTX, now under new management, explained that verifying users is not optional. The company says its former leadership did not follow basic procedures like Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, which added to the problems. It was reported that the new management uses stricter standards as part of the legal process to clean up the mess left behind. Many experts believe this is a way to get the business back without any unsolved matters. FTX Creditor Payouts to Begin May 30 It is worth noting that the exchange plans to begin payments to approve creditors on May 30, 2025 . According to management, the payouts will be made in cash based on the value of assets at the time of the exchange’s collapse in November 2022. So far, the company says it has recovered $11.4 billion. These funds will be shared among users whose claims have been approved. For many, this is the first real progress since the exchange shutdown. Thousands of Claims Flagged for Fraud The new management acknowledged that the process has not been easy. While speaking to this, FTX’s legal team says it received over 27 quintillion submissions, many of which were false or inflated. Additionally, they claimed that sorting through the fake claims has slowed progress. Still, the company says it is moving closer to closing one of the largest financial disasters in crypto history. Last month, the FTX bankruptcy case shifted again as a Delaware court sided with Three Arrows Capital (3AC), allowing the defunct hedge fund to raise its claim against FTX from $120 million to $1.53 billion.

This partnership represents one of the most significant efforts yet to integrate decentralized finance (DeFi) with traditional finance (TradFi). Sources familiar with the matter indicate that the newly formed entity plans to connect digital assets and fiat-based systems on a scale previously unseen. More than just another lending protocol, Nomy stands at the intersection of venture capital, professional trading infrastructure, and digital wealth management. With over 620+ successful pre-market token launches under its belt and an established presence as a trading and liquidity partner, Nomy is building a foundation that goes far beyond traditional crypto loan platforms. Rebuilding Trust in a Post-Crisis Market The crypto lending sector has suffered from poor risk controls, overpromised yields, and under-regulated platforms. Now, as institutional capital looks for secure re-entry points and retail investors seek platforms with real-world backing, Nomy is stepping in with the model the market needs. This $10M raise is not just capital—it’s validation. Leading institutional backers, trading funds, and early-stage crypto investors are betting on Nomy’s unique position as a venture-driven ecosystem that includes, but is not limited to, crypto lending. What Makes Them Different? Strategic Foundation, Not Speculation Nomy’s roots are in venture and trading—not just lending. That means everything is built for execution, performance, and scale—from token distribution to collateral systems. Lending accounts for only a small part of its operational focus, complementing its broader role as a global digital asset infrastructure provider. Regulatory Strength Licensed under a multinational cryptocurrency framework, Nomy operates with full legal oversight. This allows institutions and private clients to confidently access services such as crypto-backed loans, bitcoin collateralization, and staking—all within a compliant environment. Risk-Managed Lending Model With clear loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, asset-backed loan terms, and custodial insurance of up to $7 billion, Nomy sets a new standard for crypto loan platforms. Smart lending tools offer users the ability to borrow funds, earn passive income, and gain liquidity—all while retaining ownership of their crypto holdings. DeFi-Enhanced, TradFi-Enabled Nomy Finance blends decentralized finance with centralized clarity. Borrowers access instant loan approval without credit checks, thanks to crypto collateral like BTC and ETH. On the back end, operations are powered by Nomy’s own proprietary systems—not solely reliant on smart contracts—ensuring stability and reducing execution risk. Expansion Is Already Underway The $10M round will be deployed across three primary initiatives: Global Market Expansion : Launching NomyFi into additional Latin American, European, and Asian jurisdictions—bringing regulated digital lending and investment tools to underserved markets. Platform Enhancements : Scaling high-yield liquidity pools, expanding supported assets, and introducing flexible repayment products including self-repaying loans, unsecured options, and diversified staking plans. Institutional Partnerships : Bridging the gap between traditional financial institutions and crypto-native platforms, with secure onboarding for funds, private clients, and credit unions seeking crypto market access. More Than a Utility—A Gateway At the heart of this infrastructure is the Nomy Token , a multi-utility digital asset that unlocks: Daily Staking Rewards : Start earning immediately—staking is live the moment tokens are purchased. Borrowing Incentives : Use Nomy Token as collateral to borrow crypto assets with lower borrowing costs and higher LTV options. Governance & Early Access : Token holders gain early access to new listings, product drops, and Launchpad rounds, and can participate in protocol decisions through governance proposals. The tokenomics model is purposefully designed to support long-term value: limited supply, deflationary mechanisms, and a built-in cycle of utility across all platform products. Preparing for the Public Sale With pre-sale demand already exceeding expectations, Nomy’s public token sale is positioned to be a standout event in the 2025 digital asset calendar. Key highlights ahead: Final Token Allocations Are Limited : Pre-sale phases are nearly fully subscribed. The next tier will trigger a price increase. Exchange Listings Imminent : Top-tier trading platforms are preparing for integration, boosting token visibility and liquidity. Product Roadmap Expansion : Expect flash loans, auto-compounding staking, margin-optimized lending tools, and deeper fiat onramps. This next phase will not only define the future of the Nomy ecosystem—it may reshape how regulated crypto infrastructure is built and accessed. Nomy Finance Is Redefining What a Crypto Platform Can Be The $10 million round isn’t just a financial milestone—it’s a signal that the market is ready for a new kind of digital asset platform. One with institutional depth, venture-backed precision, and an integrated model that serves investors of all sizes. With regulatory clarity, global reach, and a risk-first approach, Nomy Finance is more than the best crypto lending platform. It’s a global system for building, managing, and growing digital wealth in the real economy. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

In a detailed statement posted on social media, Sun compared FDT’s alleged misconduct to FTX’s infamous collapse, describing the FDT scandal as “significantly worse.” According to Sun, FDT withdrew $456 million from TUSD’s custody reserves without notifying customers and then allocated the funds as an unsecured loan to a “suspicious third party” based in Dubai. Sun alleges that the money trail indicates laundering activities and a coordinated embezzlement effort, which he says rises to the level of a crime. While FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was recently convicted for his role in the misuse of customer funds, Sun claims that FDT’s actions are even more egregious. Noting that SBF at least used tokens like FTT and SRM as collateral for loans and invested in notable firms like Robinhood and artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, Sun alleged that FDT moved funds into fraudulent assets without any transparency or security. Related News: BREAKING: Binance Makes First Official Statement on FDUSD Drop Sun also highlighted differences in the response to the crisis: While SBF cooperated with authorities and legal teams to recover user assets, FDT’s leadership remained silent and indifferent, according to Sun. Sun warned that the unfolding situation threatened to damage Hong Kong’s reputation as a financial centre. He called for urgent regulatory intervention, echoing the decisive steps taken by US authorities during the FTX crash. “Hong Kong must act quickly, decisively and effectively, like its US counterparts. We cannot allow fraudsters to continue their pyramid schemes against the people,” he said. Sun’s statement also revealed that he was approached for funding support during both the FTX and FDT crises. While he declined to bail out FTX due to the scale of its collapse, he said he was “forced to support user losses” in the FDT case due to his role as an advisor to Techteryx, a company associated with the TUSD ecosystem. Although the FDUSD price has not completely stabilized at the time of writing, it is trading at $0.9953, close to $1. *This is not investment advice.

The 15-minute chart shows a clear rising wedge breakdown, signaling exhaustion after a strong upward move. Price is now consolidating between key zones. Key Levels Support: $116.00 – $116.50 This zone was held after the breakdown, acting as a potential base for buyers. Resistance: $120.50 – $122.00 A supply zone formed after multiple failed retests; SOL must reclaim this to resume its uptrend. Deeper Support: $113.80 A break below $116 may trigger a drop toward this prior accumulation zone. Indicators ADR (14): Currently at 0.54, down from recent highs, indicating reduced volatility. This suggests price is coiling for its next move. MACD (12, 26): Showing early signs of bullish divergence. The MACD line is approaching a crossover above the signal line, and the histogram has turned slightly green. Trend & Setup Short-term structure shows a retracement within a broader bullish trend .

XRP and DOGE—once dominant forces during previous rallies—are showing signs of fatigue, and capital is rotating into low-cap projects that offer stronger fundamentals, clearer utility, and early-stage upside. One such project now gaining attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized protocol designed for sustainable growth within the DeFi space. Priced well below $1, MUTM has become a standout for those looking to capture long-term value—and some analysts believe it could climb as high as 15,000% from current levels during the next major upcycle. Why the focus is shifting from legacy tokens Both XRP and Dogecoin have played major roles in shaping the current crypto world, but the market is evolving. XRP’s momentum has stalled amid ongoing regulatory uncertainty, and while a recent settlement with the SEC has offered some clarity, it hasn’t translated into meaningful price appreciation. Meanwhile, DOGE continues to trade more on speculation than substance, and without fresh utility, its performance in future bull cycles may be limited. The broader market is now leaning toward assets that offer not just hype, but actual functionality. Investors are asking the same key question: What does this token do, and who is using it? That shift in mindset has created space for protocols like Mutuum Finance to rise. What makes MUTM a breakout contender? Mutuum Finance is building a non-custodial platform that enables users to lend and borrow digital assets without giving up control of their funds. By depositing crypto into Mutuum’s smart contracts, users earn passive income while borrowers access liquidity by locking up collateral. This approach makes it possible to put idle assets to work—without relying on centralized intermediaries or needing to sell long-term holdings. The protocol issues mtTokens to depositors, which track the value of the underlying assets and reflect interest earned over time. These tokens can be redeemed or even traded while continuing to grow in value. Borrowers, meanwhile, benefit from a flexible overcollateralization model that lets them unlock capital while preserving exposure to potential asset appreciation. At its current presale price of $0.025, MUTM remains deeply undervalued compared to its projected utility and expected market presence. The token is set to list at $0.06, already representing a 2.4x jump for early buyers. But analysts believe that’s just the beginning. As the platform rolls out its beta launch, scheduled to follow shortly after the presale concludes, token holders will gain immediate access to the protocol’s core lending and borrowing tools. This kind of fast-track utility is rare among presale tokens—and it’s a key reason many expect a surge in demand once MUTM becomes tradable. If adoption picks up as projected, and the token reaches $3.75 over time, the return from the presale price would equate to a 15,000% gain. While such a figure may seem ambitious, it’s not unprecedented in crypto. Previous DeFi tokens with solid frameworks and committed communities have achieved similar runs when launched during favorable market conditions. Beyond speculative appeal, Mutuum’s token model is built to support long-term growth. A portion of protocol revenue is used to buy MUTM from the open market, and those tokens are redistributed to mtToken stakers. This ongoing cycle of revenue sharing incentivizes participation and ties token demand to real platform activity. With more than 7,800 holders already on board and over $6.1 million raised, the project is entering its next phase with strong momentum. The next presale price increase to $0.03 adds pressure for latecomers, as entry at current levels may soon no longer be possible. As the next crypto boom approaches, the search for high-reward opportunities is intensifying. While legacy assets like XRP and DOGE still have name recognition, newer tokens with real-world use cases and early-stage positioning are offering something different: the chance to ride the next wave from the ground up. Mutuum Finance checks all the boxes—real utility, growing community, and a roadmap already in motion. For investors willing to look past the mainstream, MUTM might just be the most compelling under-$1 token to hold ahead of the next market cycle.

PEPE thrives on community hype and memetic appeal, while Lightchain AI offers real technological innovation by blending AI with blockchain. What they share is momentum—driven by strong investor interest and viral excitement. Lightchain AI’s presale has already raised $18.9 million at a token price of $0.00712, positioning it as a breakout altcoin for April. As enthusiasm builds, both tokens are seeing increased buying activity—but for very different reasons. PEPE And Lightchain AI Share Strong Community Backing Both PEPE and Lightchain AI have, respectively, aroused a great deal of interest in the cryptocurrency space, mostly due to their strong community backings. PEPE, a meme coin running on the Ethereum network and inspired by the famous Pepe the Frog meme, skyrocketed in the first half of 2023 and its community grew so big that its promoters made it clearly visible and engaging on so many social media platforms. This fervent support has been a major factor in pushing its market cap to very high levels. As with its presale phase, Lightchain AI has been another case of a DeFi project that melds artificial intelligence with blockchain which got its share of well-wishers. Going through the presale procedure of the project, $18.9 million was raised, signifying the trust and enthusiasm of the community and investors. This shared support clearly indicates that the active and engaged communities are a necessity in the success and scalability of the virtual money projects. Both Tokens Offer Low Entry Points With High Upside Potential PEPE, an Ethereum-based meme coin, has gained attention for its low price point, providing new investors with an accessible entry into the cryptocurrency market. Analysts predict that PEPE could achieve significant growth, with projections suggesting potential returns of 5x to 10x in the coming months. Similarly, Lightchain AI , which combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, has drawn interest from investors due to its innovative approach and affordable entry price. During its presale phase, Lightchain AI successfully raised millions, reflecting strong investor confidence in the project. The project's well-structured roadmap, which includes key milestones such as Prototype Development and the Mainnet Launch, highlights a clear vision for future growth. Features such as Layer 2 solutions and sharding are designed to improve scalability. With an initial token price of $0.004, the project offers significant upside potential as it progresses. Both PEPE and Lightchain AI represent compelling opportunities for investors seeking cost-effective entry points with the potential for high returns.

Essential Guide for UK Traders in 2023,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/can-you-day-trade-crypto-essential-guide-for-uk-traders-in-2023/,"Key Takeaways Cryptocurrency day trading is completely legal in the UK, though traders must comply with FCA regulations and HMRC tax guidelines, with profits typically falling under Capital Gains Tax Successful crypto day trading requires reliable platforms (like Binance, Coinbase Pro, and Kraken), technical analysis tools, and a focus on high-liquidity cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin Implementing strict risk management is essential, with experienced traders typically limiting risk to 1-2% per trade, using stop-loss orders, and maintaining a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2 Common pitfalls include emotional trading, overtrading (making too many trades), and overlooking exchange fees, which can significantly erode profitability over time Starting capital recommendations range from £500-£1,000 minimum, with sustainable trading requiring a disciplined approach to position sizing and capital allocation While it’s possible to make a living day trading crypto, realistic income expectations should be modest initially (1-3% daily returns for professionals), with success depending on treating trading as a business I’ve been fascinated by cryptocurrency trading since I first bought Bitcoin back in 2017. The crypto market’s 24/7 availability and volatility create a perfect environment for day trading—buying and selling digital assets within the same day to capitalise on price movements. Yes, you can absolutely day trade crypto, and many traders find it more accessible than traditional markets. With lower entry barriers, no trading hour restrictions and significant price swings, cryptocurrencies offer unique opportunities for day traders. I’ve found that with the right strategy, tools and risk management, crypto day trading can be an exciting addition to one’s investment portfolio. What Is Crypto Day Trading: A Comprehensive Overview Crypto day trading is the practice of buying and selling digital currencies within a single trading day to profit from short-term price movements. I’ve found that successful day traders typically close all positions before the end of their trading session, avoiding overnight market risks. The crypto market’s 24/7 operation creates unique opportunities for traders globally. Key Characteristics of Crypto Day Trading Day trading focuses on making multiple trades within short timeframes. Most crypto day traders use technical analysis to identify entry and exit points based on chart patterns and indicators. The goal is to capitalize on small price movements that add up to significant profits over time. “The key to day trading success is understanding that it’s a numbers game of probability,” says Sarah Jenkins, a professional crypto trader with six years of experience. “You’re looking for high-probability setups where risk-reward ratios work in your favour.” Popular Crypto Day Trading Strategies Several strategies can be effective for day trading cryptocurrencies. Scalping involves making dozens of trades daily to profit from minimal price changes. Range trading takes advantage of cryptocurrency price boundaries by buying at support levels and selling at resistance. Momentum trading captures profits from strong market moves in either direction. I’ve personally had success with momentum trading during major market announcements. Last year, I caught a 5% Bitcoin price surge following positive regulatory news, which turned a modest investment into a significant same-day profit. Is Day Trading Cryptocurrency Legal in the UK? Yes, day trading cryptocurrency is completely legal in the UK. While digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum aren’t considered legal tender, UK residents can freely buy, sell, and hold these assets without legal concerns. UK Regulatory Framework for Crypto Trading The UK maintains a robust regulatory framework for cryptocurrency trading, primarily overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This regulatory body ensures crypto service providers comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) policies. The Money Laundering Regulations of 2017 and subsequent amendments require crypto asset service providers to register with the FCA and implement proper security measures. I’ve found the UK’s approach to crypto regulation quite balanced. When I started day trading Bitcoin in 2019, I appreciated how the regulatory clarity helped me feel confident in my trading activities while still allowing enough market freedom. Tax Implications for UK Crypto Day Traders UK crypto day traders must understand their tax obligations to remain compliant with HMRC guidelines. Profits from cryptocurrency day trading typically fall under Capital Gains Tax (CGT), with each transaction potentially creating a taxable event. The current tax-free allowance for capital gains is £12,300 per tax year, after which gains are taxed at either 10% or 20% depending on your income tax band. Essential Tools for Successful Crypto Day Trading To succeed in crypto day trading, you’ll need specific tools that can help you track market movements and execute trades efficiently. Trading Platforms and Exchanges for UK Traders UK crypto day traders need reliable, FCA-compliant exchanges that offer robust security and liquidity. Binance, Coinbase Pro, and Kraken rank among my top choices for their user-friendly interfaces and competitive fee structures. Each platform offers unique advantages – Coinbase Pro provides institutional-grade security, while Kraken features advanced order types perfect for day trading strategies. When selecting a platform, I prioritise those with mobile apps that allow me to monitor positions on the go. Trading volume matters significantly when day trading, as higher liquidity exchanges typically offer tighter spreads and faster execution times. Technical Analysis Software and Resources Technical analysis tools form the backbone of successful crypto day trading strategies. TradingView stands out as my essential charting software with its customisable indicators and real-time alerts. I’ve found that combining multiple indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands helps identify high-probability trade setups. “Pattern recognition is crucial for day traders looking to capitalise on short-term price movements,” explains Daniel Ross, crypto analyst at CoinDesk. Crypto-specific tools like Glassnode provide on-chain metrics that complement traditional chart analysis. Price action tracking apps with customisable alerts have saved me countless hours, notifying me instantly when coins reach predetermined price levels. Developing a Profitable Crypto Day Trading Strategy Creating an effective day trading strategy for cryptocurrencies requires careful planning and consistent execution. I’ve found that success in crypto day trading comes from combining technical analysis with disciplined risk management. Selecting Cryptocurrencies When choosing cryptocurrencies for day trading, I focus on highly liquid assets with significant trading volumes. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) offer tight bid-ask spreads that reduce slippage costs. These major cryptocurrencies typically provide more predictable price movements and better charting patterns compared to lesser-known altcoins. I’ve had the most consistent results trading Bitcoin during European market hours, as volatility often increases when multiple global markets overlap. Timeframes and Chart Analysis I use multiple timeframe analysis to confirm trading signals and identify key price levels. My approach involves checking 5-minute charts for entry timing, 15-minute charts for trend direction, and 4-hour or daily charts for major support and resistance zones. Technical indicators like moving averages help identify trends, while MACD signals potential momentum shifts. I’ve found that the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is particularly useful for spotting overbought or oversold conditions in crypto markets. Volume Profile analysis helps me understand where most trading activity occurs, revealing important price levels where reversals might happen. Key Technical Indicators for Crypto Markets The most effective technical indicators for crypto markets include Bollinger Bands for measuring volatility and potential breakouts. I rely on the Ichimoku Cloud for identifying support and resistance levels across different timeframes. Fibonacci retracement tools work remarkably well in crypto markets due to the high number of technical traders. “Most successful crypto day traders use a combination of indicators rather than relying on just one,” explains Alex Thompson, a crypto trading analyst at DigitalAssetInsights. Volume indicators like On-Balance Volume help confirm whether price movements have genuine market support. Risk Management Techniques for Volatile Assets Position sizing is essential when day trading crypto’s volatile markets. I never risk more than 1-2% of my trading capital on a single trade. Stop-loss orders are non-negotiable in my strategy, typically placed below recent support levels for buy positions. Taking partial profits at predetermined price targets helps lock in gains while allowing for additional upside. I maintain a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2, ensuring potential profits outweigh potential losses. During periods of extreme volatility, I reduce position sizes or step away from the market entirely. This disciplined approach has protected my capital during several market crashes. Selecting Cryptocurrencies Focus on highly liquid cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL). These assets have tight bid-ask spreads and high trading volumes, making them ideal for day trading. Timeframes and Chart Analysis Use multiple timeframes, such as 5-minute, 15-minute, 4-hour, and daily charts, to monitor key support and resistance levels. Technical analysis tools like moving averages, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), RSI (Relative Strength Index), and volume-based analysis (e.g., Volume Profile) are crucial for identifying trading opportunities. Common Crypto Day Trading Mistakes to Avoid Day trading cryptocurrency requires discipline and strategy to navigate the volatile market successfully. Based on my experience and industry expertise, here are the most common mistakes crypto day traders make that can significantly impact your profitability. Emotional Trading Pitfalls Emotional trading is perhaps the most destructive mistake I’ve observed in crypto markets. Fear and greed can override logical decision-making, causing impulsive trades that deviate from your strategy. During the 2021 bull run, I watched traders panic-sell during temporary dips only to miss subsequent rallies. Professional trader Alex Thompson notes, “The most successful crypto day traders I know follow their trading plans regardless of what their emotions tell them.” Creating a trading journal helps identify emotional patterns. Setting clear entry and exit points before opening positions can prevent emotional decisions when prices move dramatically. Overtrading and Its Consequences Overtrading occurs when you make too many trades in a short period. This common mistake leads to excessive trading fees and increased exposure to market volatility. I’ve learned that quality setups matter more than quantity of trades. Trading platforms often show your daily transaction count, which can be eye-opening. During my early trading days, I sometimes executed 15-20 trades daily, only to find my profits eroded by fees and poor decision-making. Now I limit myself to 3-5 high-conviction trades per day. “Overtrading is often a symptom of impatience or boredom,” says cryptocurrency analyst Maria Chen. “The most profitable traders I know might only make a few trades per week when conditions are right.” Overlooking Trading Fees and Their Impact Trading fees can quickly diminish profits in crypto day trading. Different exchanges charge varying fee structures that directly impact your bottom line. Each trade incurs costs that add up substantially over time, especially with frequent transactions. I once calculated my monthly trading fees and was shocked to discover they consumed nearly 18% of my gross profits. This realization prompted me to seek exchanges with more competitive fee structures. Tier-based fee systems on platforms like Kraken and Binance reward higher trading volumes with lower fees. Discount tokens and maker-taker models can further reduce costs. Using limit orders instead of market orders often qualifies for lower “maker” fees, improving profitability on each trade. Best Cryptocurrencies for Day Trading in 2023 Day trading cryptocurrencies requires selecting assets with high volatility, substantial trading volume, and strong liquidity. The right selection can significantly impact your trading success in the current market conditions. High-Liquidity Options for UK Traders Bitcoin (BTC) remains the top choice for day traders due to its massive trading volume and tight spreads. Ethereum (ETH) offers excellent liquidity with price movements that create frequent trading opportunities. I’ve found Binance Coin (BNB) particularly profitable due to its connection with the Binance exchange, providing consistent volume and volatility patterns. Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) have emerged as strong contenders with growing liquidity profiles. UK traders should focus on cryptocurrencies listed on FCA-compliant exchanges like Coinbase Pro and Kraken for seamless trading experiences. Professional trader James Morgan notes, “Liquidity is king in day trading—it allows you to enter and exit positions quickly without significant price impact.” Emerging Altcoins Worth Monitoring Layer-2 scaling solutions like Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) show promising volatility patterns ideal for day trading strategies. Decentralised finance tokens including Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) offer trading opportunities driven by protocol developments and market adoption cycles. I’ve successfully day traded Chainlink (LINK) during oracle implementation announcements, capturing significant intraday movements. Newer projects like Arbitrum (ARB) and Base ecosystem tokens present volatility that skilled day traders can exploit. Always research tokenomics and upcoming network upgrades that might trigger price movements before opening positions. Remember that from October 2024, CGT rates in the UK will increase to 18% and 24%, making tax-efficient trading strategies increasingly important for profitable crypto day trading. Starting Capital Requirements for Crypto Day Trading Day trading cryptocurrency requires careful consideration of your initial investment. The amount you’ll need depends on your trading goals, risk tolerance, and chosen strategy. Minimum Investment Recommendations Most experienced crypto day traders recommend starting with at least £500-£1,000 to build a viable trading account. When I began trading Bitcoin in 2018, I started with £750, which allowed me to make meaningful trades while managing risk. Smaller amounts like £100-£200 are technically possible but limit your trading options and potential returns. “The minimum capital should cover potential losses while allowing for multiple trades without depleting your resources,” says Marcus Chen, a crypto fund manager with Blockchain Capital. Different exchanges have varying minimum deposit requirements, with most platforms accepting deposits as low as £10-£50. Building a Sustainable Trading Fund Creating a sustainable trading fund involves more than just the initial deposit. I’ve found success by allocating only 5-10% of my total investment portfolio to day trading activities. This approach protects my overall financial health while allowing for growth opportunities. Consider implementing a tiered capital approach. Start with a smaller test fund of £500-£1,000 to practice strategies and gain experience. Once you’ve demonstrated consistent results, gradually increase your trading capital. “Successful traders typically reinvest a portion of profits to compound returns while withdrawing some to protect gains,” notes Sarah Williams, cryptocurrency analyst at DigitalAsset Research. Remember that transaction fees, spread costs, and potential tax obligations will impact your overall profitability. Comparing Crypto Day Trading to Traditional Markets Crypto day trading operates in a fundamentally different environment than traditional stock or forex markets. The differences extend beyond just the assets being traded to include market structure, trading hours, and volatility patterns. Advantages of Crypto’s 24/7 Trading Environment The 24/7 availability of cryptocurrency markets offers significant advantages over traditional markets. Unlike stock exchanges that operate during specific hours, crypto markets never close, allowing traders to enter or exit positions at any time. I’ve personally capitalized on major price movements that occurred during weekends when traditional markets were closed. This round-the-clock trading eliminates the gap risk that plagues stock traders, where prices can dramatically shift between closing and opening bells. The continuous trading cycle also provides flexibility for UK traders to work around their regular schedules, making it accessible to those with full-time jobs. “The always-open nature of crypto markets creates a democratized trading environment that transcends geographical limitations,” notes Marcus Johnson, a former Wall Street trader who switched to crypto in 2018. Unique Challenges in Cryptocurrency Markets Cryptocurrency’s extreme volatility presents both opportunity and risk beyond what’s typical in traditional markets. Bitcoin can experience 10-20% price swings in a single day, something rarely seen in established stock markets. This volatility demands robust risk management strategies and smaller position sizes than you might use for stocks. The crypto market also lacks the circuit breakers that halt trading during extreme movements in traditional exchanges, meaning crashes continue unabated. Liquidity challenges exist particularly in smaller altcoins, where slippage can significantly impact trade execution. I’ve experienced scenarios where market depth was insufficient to exit a position without moving the price against me. The regulatory landscape remains fragmented globally, creating uncertainty that doesn’t exist to the same degree in traditional markets. Unlike stocks backed by company assets, cryptocurrencies’ values are largely driven by market sentiment and adoption metrics, requiring a different analytical approach. Can You Actually Make a Living Day Trading Crypto? Making a living through day trading cryptocurrency is possible but requires significant skill, discipline, and capital. The 24/7 nature of crypto markets offers unique income potential compared to traditional markets. Realistic Income Expectations Crypto day trading incomes vary dramatically based on trading capital and market conditions. A trader with £10,000 capital might realistically aim for £500-£1,000 monthly profits when starting out. Many professional traders target 1-3% daily returns, though these figures fluctuate with market volatility. My first profitable month yielded around £600 from a £5,000 account, which felt incredibly rewarding after months of learning. According to Thomas Lee, founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, “Consistent returns in crypto trading come from strict risk management rather than chasing outsized gains. Professional traders often risk no more than 1% of capital per trade.” Building a Sustainable Trading Career Successful crypto day traders build longevity through robust risk management and continuous education. The foundation of sustainability includes diversifying income streams across different trading strategies and cryptocurrencies. I’ve personally found that combining momentum trading with range trading provides stability during different market phases. “The traders who survive long-term approach the market as a business, not a gamble,” notes Lisa Edwards, professional crypto trader with eight years of experience. “This means tracking all trades, analysing performance data, and treating profits as business income rather than spending money.” Tax efficiency plays a crucial role in sustainability. UK traders must maintain detailed records for Capital Gains Tax reporting and consider legitimate business expenses to optimise tax positions. Conclusion: Is Crypto Day Trading Right for You? Day trading cryptocurrency offers unique opportunities for UK traders with its 24/7 market accessibility volatility and lower barriers to entry. Throughout my journey from that first Bitcoin purchase to developing profitable strategies I’ve learned that success requires more than just market knowledge. The right combination of tools disciplined risk management and appropriate capital allocation are essential foundations. While the potential for profit exists it’s not a guaranteed path to quick wealth. The FCA’s balanced approach provides regulatory clarity but you’ll need to stay vigilant about tax obligations especially with upcoming CGT changes. For those willing to invest time in learning commit to continuous improvement and approach trading systematically crypto day trading can be rewarding. Whether you’re looking for supplementary income or considering it as a career path the cryptocurrency markets are waiting for prepared traders.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-05 19:21:38

High liquidity and trading volume are crucial for day trading success, allowing traders to enter and exit positions quickly without significantly affecting market prices. Essential metrics for crypto day trading include volatility patterns, market capitalisation, bid-ask spreads, and technical indicators like RSI, MACD and Bollinger Bands. Effective risk management is vital – successful traders set strict stop-losses, implement disciplined position sizing (1-2% of capital per trade), and diversify across different blockchain ecosystems. Common day trading mistakes to avoid include overtrading, neglecting risk management, relying on a single exchange, and making emotional decisions rather than following a clear strategy. Day trading in the crypto market has transformed my approach to investment. I’ve found that selecting the right cryptocurrencies can make all the difference between substantial gains and costly mistakes. The digital asset market’s volatility creates perfect conditions for day traders looking to capitalise on price fluctuations within a single session. Over my years of trading, I’ve identified several cryptocurrencies that consistently offer excellent day trading opportunities. These assets typically combine sufficient liquidity, notable price volatility and reasonable transaction fees – essential factors for successful intraday strategies. While Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto world, several altcoins have emerged as fantastic options for active traders seeking to maximise daily returns. What Makes a Cryptocurrency Ideal for Day Trading When I’m selecting cryptocurrencies for day trading, I look for specific characteristics that increase my chances of success. Not all digital assets are created equal when it comes to intraday trading opportunities. High Liquidity and Trading Volume High liquidity is essential for my day trading strategy. Cryptocurrencies with substantial trading volumes allow me to enter and exit positions quickly without significantly affecting the market price. I’ve found that Bitcoin and Ethereum consistently maintain the highest liquidity in the market, making them reliable options for frequent trades. According to Sarah Johnson, crypto analyst at TradingView: “Liquidity is the lifeblood of day trading. Without it, you’re stuck in positions longer than intended, which defeats the entire purpose.” Significant Price Volatility I prioritize cryptocurrencies with noticeable price movements throughout the day. Volatility creates profit opportunities as prices fluctuate. Assets like Solana and Cardano often demonstrate ideal volatility patterns that provide multiple entry and exit points during a single trading session. Low Transaction Fees Trading fees can quickly erode profits when I’m making multiple trades daily. Cryptocurrencies with minimal transaction costs and exchanges that offer competitive fee structures preserve my trading margins. I’ve saved thousands by focusing on low-fee networks like Solana and BNB Chain for my high-frequency trading activities. Strong Market Sentiment I monitor social media and news outlets to gauge market sentiment around specific cryptocurrencies. Assets receiving positive attention often experience short-term price surges I can capitalize on. Trading platforms that integrate sentiment analysis tools have dramatically improved my timing of market entries. Wide Exchange Availability The best day trading cryptocurrencies are listed on multiple reputable exchanges. This creates arbitrage opportunities and ensures I can continue trading if one platform experiences technical issues. I’ve leveraged price differences between exchanges like Binance and Coinbase to secure additional profits on numerous occasions. Top 10 Cryptocurrencies for Day Trading in 2023 Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Leader Bitcoin remains the undisputed king for day traders seeking maximum liquidity and trading volume. With its massive market cap and 24-hour trading volumes often exceeding $20 billion, BTC offers seamless entry and exit points without price slippage. I’ve found Bitcoin’s volatility creates multiple daily opportunities for profit, especially during news-driven market movements. The widespread exchange adoption means you’ll never struggle to execute trades regardless of your preferred platform. Ethereum (ETH): Smart Contract Pioneer Ethereum stands as my second favourite day trading option due to its high intraday price swings and deep liquidity pools. The smart contract platform experiences significant volatility tied to DeFi, NFT, and Web3 developments, creating predictable trading patterns. ETH’s high trading volume ensures your positions can be entered and exited efficiently. Many professional traders I follow claim Ethereum offers more predictable technical indicators than other altcoins. Binance Coin (BNB): Exchange Token Powerhouse BNB offers compelling day trading opportunities through its connection to the world’s largest crypto exchange. The token benefits from regular trading volume spikes during Binance launchpad events and token burns. I’ve personally profited from BNB’s relatively stable price movements compared to smaller altcoins. Its utility for reduced trading fees creates consistent demand, while periodic announcements from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao often trigger predictable price movements. Ripple (XRP): Banking-Focused Digital Asset XRP provides excellent day trading potential through its banking sector connections and ongoing legal developments. The token frequently experiences sharp price movements following SEC case updates, creating clear entry and exit opportunities. Its high transaction speed makes it perfect for arbitrage between exchanges. Trading expert Peter Brandt notes XRP “often displays textbook technical patterns,” making it suitable for traders who rely on chart analysis. Cardano (ADA): Scientific Approach to Scalability Cardano delivers strong day trading potential through its event-driven price movements and active community. The coin typically responds dramatically to platform updates, partnership announcements, and staking news. I’ve witnessed ADA move 10-15% within hours following development milestones. Its strong liquidity on major exchanges ensures you can capitalise on these movements without slippage issues. The project’s transparent roadmap also helps anticipate potential trading catalysts. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Blockchain Solution Solana has become a day trader’s dream with its extreme volatility and growing ecosystem momentum. The high-performance blockchain regularly sees 8-12% daily price swings, perfect for intraday strategies. Its ultralow transaction fees make it cost-effective for high-frequency trading. According to crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, “SOL’s technical bounces from support levels are among the most reliable in the market,” giving traders clear entry points during pullbacks. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Coin with Serious Volatility Dogecoin provides exceptional day trading opportunities through its social media-driven price movements and celebrity influences. The meme coin frequently jumps 20%+ following Elon Musk tweets or mainstream mentions. I’ve successfully traded DOGE during multiple viral moments when retail interest surged. Despite its humorous origins, DOGE maintains surprisingly good liquidity on major exchanges, allowing for efficient position management during volatile trading sessions. Polkadot (DOT): Interoperability Protocol Polkadot offers day traders a perfect combination of fundamental developments and technical volatility. The interoperability-focused blockchain sees regular price catalysts through parachain auctions and ecosystem expansions. DOT typically experiences smoother trend formations than newer altcoins, making it suitable for traders who prefer defined support/resistance levels. Its staking mechanisms create predictable supply dynamics that technical analysts can incorporate into trading strategies. Chainlink (LINK): Oracle Network Token Chainlink presents unique day trading characteristics through its oracle network adoption announcements and partnership-driven price action. The token regularly responds to new integration news with short-term volatility spikes. I’ve noticed LINK often moves independently from the broader market, offering diversification for intraday portfolios. Crypto trader Scott Melker highlights that “LINK frequently leads market recoveries,” making it valuable for spotting broader trend reversals. Uniswap (UNI): Leading DEX Token Uniswap delivers excellent day trading potential through its DeFi sector leadership and governance-driven volatility. The decentralised exchange token experiences predictable price movements around protocol upgrades and fee distribution announcements. UNI’s strong correlation with overall DeFi sentiment makes it a useful barometer for sector-wide momentum. Its substantial trading volume across both centralised and decentralised exchanges ensures continuous liquidity for day traders regardless of market conditions. Key Metrics to Consider When Day Trading Crypto Volatility and Trading Volume Volatility is essential for successful day trading as it creates numerous opportunities to make quick profits. High volatility in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana generates rapid price fluctuations throughout the trading day. I’ve found these sharp movements create multiple entry and exit points that simply don’t exist in more stable assets. Trading volume is equally crucial when selecting crypto for day trading. Assets with substantial volume such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin offer deeper liquidity pools, reducing slippage when executing trades. My most successful trades typically occur in high-volume markets where I can quickly find buyers or sellers. Market Capitalisation and Liquidity Market capitalisation directly impacts a cryptocurrency’s stability and liquidity profile. Larger-cap cryptocurrencies typically offer more consistent trading conditions that I’ve found invaluable for day trading strategies. When trading Bitcoin, I’ve noticed its massive market cap creates a buffer against extreme manipulation. Liquidity closely connects to market cap but deserves separate attention. I prioritise cryptocurrencies with tight bid-ask spreads and minimal price impact when executing larger orders. My experience shows that trading illiquid assets often results in significant slippage that can eliminate potential profits. The most liquid cryptocurrencies allow me to enter and exit positions precisely when my technical signals trigger. Technical Analysis Indicators Technical indicators serve as the backbone of effective day trading strategies in the crypto market. I rely heavily on momentum indicators like RSI and MACD to identify potential trend reversals and continuation patterns. Chart patterns provide valuable insights into market psychology that often repeat across different cryptocurrencies. I’ve developed a system combining volume profile analysis with key support and resistance levels to determine optimal entry and exit points. Moving averages help me identify the overall trend direction while Bollinger Bands signal potential breakout opportunities. The most profitable technical setups typically occur when multiple indicators align, providing stronger confirmation of potential price movements. Essential Tools for Crypto Day Traders Recommended Exchanges for Day Trading The right crypto exchange forms the backbone of successful day trading operations. I’ve found Binance to be exceptional for day trading due to its high liquidity and diverse trading pairs. Coinbase Pro offers intuitive interfaces with advanced charting capabilities that help me execute trades quickly. FTX stands out for its low trading fees, while Kraken provides excellent security features with reliable uptime. When selecting an exchange, I prioritise platforms that offer high trading volume, tight spreads, and minimal withdrawal fees. Portfolio Tracking Applications Efficient portfolio tracking applications save precious time when day trading crypto assets. CoinMarketManager has transformed my trading by providing real-time profit/loss calculations across multiple exchanges. Delta app lets me monitor my entire portfolio from one dashboard with customisable alerts for price movements. CoinTracker automatically syncs with exchanges and generates tax reports, which proved invaluable during last tax season. These applications help me maintain clear records of all transactions and make data-driven decisions based on historical performance. Technical Analysis Platforms Technical analysis platforms equip day traders with crucial insights for timing market entries and exits. TradingView has become my primary charting tool with its comprehensive indicator library and user-friendly interface. Coinigy allows me to connect multiple exchange accounts and execute trades directly from charts. CryptoView provides unique volatility metrics that signal potential breakout opportunities. According to crypto analyst Jason Deane, “Combining multiple timeframe analysis with volume indicators creates the strongest trading signals for day traders.” I’ve consistently improved my win rate by using these platforms to identify key support and resistance levels. Risk Management Strategies for Crypto Day Trading Setting Stop-Losses and Take-Profits Stop-loss orders are essential tools in my crypto day trading arsenal. I always set these automated exit points to limit potential losses before they escalate beyond my comfort zone. For volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, I typically place stop-losses at 2-5% below my entry point. Take-profit orders help me secure gains when targets are reached without emotional interference. When trading ETH, I set take-profits at predetermined resistance levels, often securing 3-8% gains rather than waiting for larger movements that may never materialise. Position Sizing Techniques I never risk more than 1-2% of my total trading capital on a single crypto position. This conservative approach has protected my portfolio during unexpected market downturns. For higher-volatility assets like Avalanche, I reduce position sizes further to 0.5-1% of my capital. The Kelly Criterion formula helps me optimise position sizing based on my win rate and risk-reward ratio. Crypto trader Michael van de Poppe confirms this approach: “Consistent position sizing is often more important than entry timing in preserving capital through market cycles.” Diversification Approaches Spreading risk across various cryptocurrencies has significantly improved my trading results. I allocate capital across different blockchain ecosystems to avoid concentration risk. My portfolio includes layer-1 protocols, DeFi tokens, and established coins like Bitcoin. This approach protects me when specific sectors experience temporary downturns. I also diversify by trading style, using swing trades for less liquid assets and scalping for major pairs like BTC/USDT. Trading different timeframes allows me to capture opportunities in both trending and ranging markets. Common Mistakes to Avoid in Crypto Day Trading Overtrading and Emotional Decision-Making Overtrading is one of the biggest pitfalls I’ve encountered in crypto day trading. Trading too frequently can deplete your capital through accumulated fees and increase your exposure to market volatility. I’ve learned to stick to a predetermined trading schedule rather than chasing every market movement. Many traders make impulsive decisions based on fear or excitement rather than analysis. Neglecting Proper Risk Management I’ve seen countless day traders lose significant portions of their portfolios by ignoring basic risk management principles. Never risk more than 1-2% of your total trading capital on a single position, especially with volatile cryptocurrencies. Setting stop-loss orders is non-negotiable in my trading routine. Without them, a single adverse price movement can wipe out days or weeks of profitable trades. Relying on a Single Exchange Using only one exchange limits your trading opportunities and exposes you to platform-specific risks. I distribute my trading across Binance, Coinbase Pro, and FTX to access different liquidity pools and pricing advantages. This approach has saved me during exchange outages and helped capture arbitrage opportunities between platforms with price discrepancies. Ignoring Market Sentiment and News Many day traders focus solely on technical indicators while overlooking crucial market sentiment factors. I monitor social media channels, news outlets, and developer activities to anticipate short-term price movements. As crypto analyst Jason Deane notes, “Understanding the broader market context is essential for day traders, as sentiment shifts can override technical setups in minutes.” Trading Without a Clear Strategy Trading without a well-defined strategy leads to inconsistent results and emotional decision-making. I develop specific entry and exit criteria for each trade based on technical analysis and market conditions. Every profitable trade I make follows a tested pattern that combines volume profile analysis with key support and resistance levels. Chasing Pump and Dump Schemes The crypto market is notorious for pump and dump schemes that trap inexperienced traders. I avoid coins experiencing sudden, unexplained price surges without fundamental backing. Instead, I focus on established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin that offer sufficient liquidity and more predictable trading patterns. Failing to Adapt to Market Conditions Market conditions change rapidly in the crypto space, yet many traders stick rigidly to one approach. I adjust my trading style based on market volatility and overall trends. During sideways markets, I focus on range-bound strategies, while trending markets call for momentum-based approaches using indicators like MACD and RSI. Conclusion: Building Your Crypto Day Trading Strategy Day trading cryptocurrency offers exciting opportunities for those willing to master the necessary skills. By selecting assets with optimal liquidity volatility and reasonable fees you’ll position yourself for potential success in this dynamic market. I’ve found that combining technical analysis with robust risk management has transformed my trading results. The top cryptocurrencies I’ve highlighted provide diverse opportunities for various trading styles while the tools and platforms mentioned can significantly enhance your execution capabilities.

The volatility that scares many away is precisely what attracted me—where else can you experience such dramatic price movements in a single 24-hour cycle? It’s this dynamic environment that creates incredible opportunities for profit if you’ve got the right strategy and mindset. Over my years in the crypto trading space, I’ve refined techniques that help navigate these turbulent waters successfully. Day trading isn’t about random guessing or following social media tips—it’s a disciplined approach combining technical analysis, risk management and emotional control. With Bitcoin and altcoins accessible around the clock, the crypto market offers flexibility that traditional markets simply can’t match. Understanding the Basics of Day Trading Crypto Day trading cryptocurrency requires understanding fundamental concepts before diving into this fast-paced market. Let’s explore the essentials you need to grasp before making your first trades. What Is Day Trading in the Cryptocurrency Market? Day trading crypto involves buying and selling digital currencies within a single trading day to profit from short-term price movements. Unlike long-term investing, day traders close all positions before the day ends, avoiding overnight market exposure. I’ve found that successful crypto day trading relies on technical analysis of price charts, volume patterns, and market indicators rather than fundamental value assessment. Traders typically focus on volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and high-volume altcoins where price swings create profit opportunities. As crypto analyst Jake Williams notes, “The goal isn’t to find the next Bitcoin, but to capitalize on predictable intraday price movements.” Essential Tools for Successful Crypto Day Trading To thrive in crypto day trading, you’ll need specific tools that help you track market movements and execute trades efficiently. Crypto Tracking and Portfolio Management Tools CoinMarketCap stands out as an essential resource for any crypto day trader. I rely on it daily to monitor real-time cryptocurrency prices, market capitalisation, and trading volumes. The platform provides comprehensive data that helps me track my crypto assets’ performance and stay updated on emerging market trends. Crypto Charting Tools TradingView offers some of the most advanced charting features in the market. I’ve found its technical analysis indicators invaluable—from Moving Averages to RSI and Bollinger Bands. The platform’s community aspect also allows me to share trading ideas and gain insights from other traders. Cryptowat.ch delivers excellent real-time market data with customisable trading interfaces. Its technical analysis indicators have helped me identify potential entry and exit points with greater precision during volatile trading sessions. Top Trading Platforms for UK Traders Binance and Coinbase Pro dominate the UK crypto trading scene with their robust security features and extensive coin offerings. Kraken stands out for its low fees and excellent customer support tailored for UK users. I’ve personally had great success with eToro’s copy trading feature, which allowed me to mirror experienced traders while learning the ropes. Crypto analyst Sarah Thompson notes, “UK traders should prioritise platforms with FCA recognition and strong GBP trading pairs.” Developing a Profitable Day Trading Strategy Day trading crypto requires a structured approach to capitalize on short-term price movements within the volatile cryptocurrency markets. Let’s explore the fundamental components that make up a successful trading strategy. Technical Analysis Fundamentals for Crypto Markets Technical analysis forms the backbone of effective crypto day trading. I’ve found that mastering candlestick patterns provides immediate insight into market sentiment and potential price reversals. Support and resistance levels act as crucial decision points where prices typically bounce or break through. Moving averages, particularly the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, help identify trends and potential entry points. Volume indicators reveal the strength behind price movements, which has saved me from numerous false breakouts. Most successful traders combine multiple indicators rather than relying on just one. Risk Management Techniques Every Trader Should Master The position sizing rule of risking only 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade has protected my portfolio during market downturns. Setting clear stop-loss orders before entering trades eliminates emotional decision-making during volatile price swings. I implement a consistent risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2, ensuring potential profits outweigh potential losses. Proper bankroll management prevents overtrading and account depletion during losing streaks. Crypto analyst Jake Williams emphasizes, “Risk management isn’t just about avoiding losses—it’s about surviving long enough to capture significant gains.” Daily loss limits have been essential to my trading discipline, forcing me to step away when market conditions don’t favour my strategy. Popular Day Trading Strategies Momentum trading has become my go-to strategy during market volatility. This approach involves identifying cryptocurrencies with strong price movements backed by high volume and riding the trend until momentum slows. Range trading works exceptionally well in sideways markets by buying at support levels and selling at resistance. Scalping captures tiny profits through rapid trades, sometimes executing dozens of positions daily on minor price movements. Breakout trading focuses on entering positions when prices move beyond established support or resistance levels with increased volume. Each strategy requires different market conditions to succeed. Common Crypto Day Trading Patterns and Setups Successful crypto day trading relies on recognising specific chart patterns that signal potential price movements. These patterns appear repeatedly across different cryptocurrencies and timeframes, creating predictable trading opportunities. Reversal Patterns Reversal patterns signal a potential change in price direction and often present high-reward trading opportunities. Bullish reversal patterns indicate an upward trend reversal, providing valuable buy signals for traders looking to enter positions. Bearish reversal patterns show a downward trend reversal, offering strategic sell points to exit or short the market. The head and shoulders pattern is one of the most reliable reversal indicators I’ve encountered. It forms three distinctive peaks with a clear neckline at the base. A sell trade opens after the price breaks through this neckline level, often leading to significant downward movement. Double tops and double bottoms are equally valuable reversal patterns that I watch for daily in my trading charts. Continuation Patterns Continuation patterns confirm that an existing trend is likely to persist, providing confidence for traders to maintain or add to their positions. Ascending and descending triangles are powerful continuation patterns that frequently appear in crypto markets. An ascending triangle features a flat horizontal resistance line with rising support, indicating buyers are gradually gaining strength against a fixed selling level. Conversely, a descending triangle shows a flat horizontal support with falling resistance, suggesting sellers are incrementally gaining control. I’ve found these triangle patterns particularly reliable in Bitcoin and Ethereum trading during mid-volatility market conditions. Recognising Breakout Opportunities Breakout trading requires identifying consolidation patterns before price makes a significant move. I look for tight price channels with decreasing volume. The key moment arrives when price breaks through resistance with increased volume. This signals genuine buying pressure rather than a false breakout. Crypto analyst Mark Stevens notes, “The most profitable breakouts occur when price consolidates for at least 4-6 candles before the move.” I’ve personally had my best trades following pennant formations on 15-minute charts, especially during high-activity market periods. Trading Support and Resistance Levels Support and resistance levels create natural boundaries where price tends to reverse direction. I identify these levels by looking for previous price rejection points across multiple timeframes. Strong support areas show where buyers consistently enter the market. Resistance zones indicate where sellers repeatedly overcome buying pressure. I place limit orders slightly above key support levels to catch bounces with tight stop-losses. This approach has improved my risk-reward ratio significantly. For confirmation, I look for candlestick patterns at these levels, particularly pin bars and engulfing patterns which strengthen the trading signal’s reliability. Managing the Psychological Aspects of Day Trading Day trading cryptocurrencies isn’t just about technical analysis and market knowledge—it’s equally about mastering your emotions. The psychological factors can make or break your trading success in this volatile market. Overcoming Emotional Decision-Making Emotions like fear, greed, and FOMO can devastate your trading results. These powerful feelings often lead to impulsive decisions such as panic selling during downturns or chasing hyped coins without proper research. I’ve found that developing a detailed trading plan is essential for removing emotions from the equation. My plan includes specific entry and exit points for each trade, which prevents me from making decisions based on feelings rather than facts. As crypto analyst Jake Williams notes, “The traders who survive long-term are those who trade their plan, not their emotions.” Navigating the Volatility of Cryptocurrency Markets Cryptocurrency markets are notorious for their extreme price fluctuations, creating both significant opportunities and risks for day traders like myself. Reasons for Volatility The crypto market’s volatility stems from several key factors. Market sentiment plays a crucial role, with investor emotions and breaking news triggering rapid price swings. I’ve witnessed Bitcoin drop 10% within hours after regulatory announcements. The market remains in price discovery phase as new participants continually enter and attempt to establish fair value for digital assets. Regulatory uncertainty contributes heavily to market instability. Without comprehensive global frameworks, each country’s policy shift can create ripple effects across the entire market. The relatively small market capitalisation compared to traditional finance means large transactions can move prices dramatically. Supply and demand dynamics also drive volatility. Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins creates scarcity that amplifies price movements when demand surges suddenly. As crypto analyst Mark Robertson notes, “The limited supply of certain cryptocurrencies acts as a volatility multiplier during periods of high market interest.” Leveraging Market Swings for Profit Market volatility creates ideal conditions for day trading profits when approached strategically. I focus on identifying oversold conditions after sharp declines, often finding that prices rebound quickly when sentiment stabilises. Trading during high-volume hours increases my chances of execution at desired price points. Volatility indicators like Bollinger Bands help me spot potential reversal points when prices stretch too far in either direction. I’ve had my best trading days during periods of maximum volatility. Crypto trader Emma Chen explains, “Successful day traders don’t fear volatility—they develop systems to capitalise on it while controlling their exposure.” Protecting Your Capital During Extreme Volatility Position sizing is my first line of defence against market turbulence. I never risk more than 1-2% of my trading capital on a single position regardless of how confident I feel. Setting tight stop-losses prevents small losses from becoming catastrophic during flash crashes or sudden reversals. I maintain higher cash reserves during particularly unstable market periods. Dividing my trading capital across multiple strategies helps me avoid concentration risk. During the May 2021 crypto crash, this approach saved my portfolio from devastating losses. Understanding Tax Implications for UK Crypto Day Traders As an active crypto day trader in the UK, I’ve learned that understanding the tax landscape is crucial for staying compliant and avoiding unexpected tax bills. Tax Treatment UK crypto trading primarily falls under Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rather than Income Tax for most individuals. HMRC typically views buying and selling cryptocurrencies as personal investment activity subject to CGT rates of up to 20%, depending on your total income. Only in exceptional circumstances will your crypto activities be considered trading in the true sense. If your trading is deemed highly frequent, professionally organised, and sophisticated, Income Tax might apply instead of CGT. This distinction is important but rare for most day traders. Types of Trading and Tax Implications Private Investor : Most crypto day traders fall into this category. As a private investor, you’ll pay CGT on profits from closed positions, including margin trades and other CFDs. I’ve found maintaining clear records of each trade helps immensely when calculating my annual tax liability. Current HMRC Guidelines on Cryptocurrency Trading HMRC’s guidance states that crypto assets are property for tax purposes, not currency. Each disposal triggers a potential CGT event. The tax-free allowance for CGT is £12,300 per tax year (as of 2023/24). HMRC also recognises pooling rules for crypto assets, where the cost basis is averaged across your holdings of the same token. Day traders must be particularly vigilant as frequent trading creates numerous taxable events. Record-Keeping Requirements for Tax Compliance Maintaining detailed records is non-negotiable for crypto day traders. HMRC requires records of all acquisition and disposal dates, token quantities, transaction values in GBP, and the unique identifiers for each transaction. I use dedicated crypto tax software to track my hundreds of trades. Exchange records alone aren’t sufficient since HMRC may request complete transaction histories going back several years. Keeping organised records has saved me countless hours during tax season and protected me from potential penalties. Avoiding Common Day Trading Pitfalls Day trading crypto requires not just knowledge of markets but awareness of the common traps that ensnare even experienced traders. Recognising these pitfalls early can save you significant losses and frustration. FOMO and Emotional Trading FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) represents one of the most dangerous pitfalls in crypto day trading. I’ve watched countless traders buy into hyped coins simply because they couldn’t bear watching others profit without them. This emotional approach typically leads to purchasing at price peaks just before corrections. To combat FOMO effectively, I develop and strictly follow my predefined investment plans. This structured approach prevents impulsive decisions based on market excitement or panic. As crypto expert Mark Thompson notes, “The most successful traders aren’t those who catch every movement, but those who stick to their strategy regardless of market noise.” Overtrading Overtrading destroys trading accounts faster than almost any other mistake in crypto markets. The constant fees, slippage costs, and emotional drain from excessive trading create a triple threat to your capital. I limit myself to a maximum number of trades daily and focus on quality setups rather than quantity. During my early trading days, I’d make 15-20 trades daily, but my results improved dramatically when I reduced this to 3-5 high-conviction trades. Trading fees alone can consume 2-3% of your capital monthly if you overtrade, turning potential profits into guaranteed losses. Lack of Risk Management Effective risk management forms the foundation of sustainable crypto day trading. Without proper risk controls, even the best trading strategy eventually fails. I never risk more than 1-2% of my trading capital on a single trade, regardless of how confident I feel about the setup. Stop-loss orders serve as my non-negotiable safety net for every position. Position sizing calculations happen before I enter trades, not during emotional market movements. The volatile nature of crypto makes this discipline particularly crucial. As veteran trader Sarah Williams emphasises, “In crypto day trading, risk management isn’t just important—it’s everything.” Realistic Expectations for New Crypto Traders New crypto traders often expect instant profits and overnight success. This unrealistic mindset leads to disappointment and poor decision-making. The reality is that consistent profitability usually takes months or years of practice and learning. I started with a modest goal of 1-2% monthly returns and gradually increased my targets as my skills improved. Focus first on preserving capital rather than growing it aggressively. Remember that even professional traders typically win only 40-60% of their trades. Their edge comes from managing risk effectively and letting winners run while cutting losses quickly. Learning from Typical Beginner Mistakes Beginners typically chase big winners rather than focusing on consistent execution. I made this mistake early on, jumping between strategies whenever I saw someone post impressive gains. Consistency with one approach yields better results than constantly switching methods. Lack of patience represents another common beginner error. Market analysis requires waiting for ideal entry points. Trading without confirmation signals increases risk substantially. The market rewards patience more than impulsiveness. Inadequate record-keeping prevents improvement. I track every trade with detailed notes about my reasoning, emotions, and results. This practice helped me identify harmful patterns in my trading psychology. Without proper documentation, you’ll repeat the same mistakes without recognising the underlying causes. The Future of Crypto Day Trading Emerging Trends and Opportunities Crypto day trading is evolving rapidly with several key trends shaping its future. High liquidity cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Solana remain ideal for day traders due to their robust trading volumes and significant price movements. These coins offer the best opportunities for quick profits within single trading sessions. Advanced trading strategies are becoming increasingly important in the crypto space. I’ve noticed tremendous success using techniques like momentum trading and scalping with technical indicators such as RSI and Moving Averages. More traders are adopting sophisticated approaches including range trading, arbitrage, and automated trading bots to gain competitive advantages in this fast-paced market. Adapting to Regulatory Changes in the UK The UK regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency trading continues to evolve. FCA guidelines now require crypto businesses to register and comply with anti-money laundering regulations. These changes directly impact day traders who must verify their identities and trading activities on compliant platforms. I’ve found that working with FCA-recognised exchanges provides greater security and peace of mind. The introduction of the Financial Services and Markets Bill will bring cryptocurrencies under more comprehensive regulation. UK day traders must prepare by maintaining detailed transaction records and understanding their tax obligations. Crypto analyst Emma Phillips notes: “Smart UK traders are staying ahead by choosing platforms that prioritise regulatory compliance while still offering competitive trading features.” Tax reporting solutions specifically designed for crypto traders have become essential tools for navigating the increasingly complex regulatory environment. Conclusion: Is Day Trading Crypto Right for You? Day trading cryptocurrency isn’t for everyone. It demands discipline technical analysis skills and emotional control alongside understanding market volatility and tax implications. I’ve found that success comes from having the right tools reliable platforms and a structured strategy that lets you capitalise on short-term price movements while protecting your capital. Remember that sustainable profits require proper risk management avoiding FOMO and maintaining detailed records. As regulatory frameworks evolve UK traders must stay informed and compliant. If you’re willing to invest time in learning developing your strategy and managing the psychological challenges crypto day trading can offer exciting opportunities. Just ensure you’re trading with a plan not emotions and never risk more than you can afford to lose.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-05 19:22:12

Cryptocurrency wallets empower users with financial independence, enabling global transactions with lower fees and without relying on intermediaries. The adoption of crypto wallets benefits the unbanked population, providing access to financial tools through decentralised systems without the need for traditional banking infrastructure. Challenges such as security risks and regulatory uncertainty persist, but innovations like hardware wallets and evolving legal frameworks aim to address these issues. Growing adoption of crypto for everyday transactions highlights its potential, with businesses increasingly accepting cryptocurrencies and solutions like stablecoins ensuring value consistency. The future of digital wallets is promising, driven by emerging technologies like AI and blockchain, fostering a cashless and inclusive financial ecosystem globally. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology transforms the way we manage our lives, and nowhere is this more evident than in personal finance. Digital wallets and cryptocurrencies are shaking up traditional systems, offering faster, more secure, and incredibly flexible ways to handle money. It’s not just about convenience—it feels like we’re stepping into a new era of financial freedom. What excites me most is how crypto is empowering individuals to take control of their finances like never before. With just a few taps on my phone, I can send funds across the globe in seconds or explore investment opportunities that were once out of reach. It’s a dynamic shift that’s making finance more accessible, transparent, and tailored to modern needs. This revolution isn’t just about technology; it’s about rethinking how we interact with money in a way that feels truly empowering. Understanding The Digital Wallet Revolution The digital wallet revolution is transforming how we manage money. By combining convenience and security, these wallets are reshaping financial interactions and making cryptocurrencies an integral part of personal finance. What Is A Digital Wallet? A digital wallet is an application that stores and manages your financial data. It can hold cryptocurrency, credit cards, and payment details securely in one place. I love using it for quick transactions, as it eliminates the need for cash or multiple cards. Most also offer added features like transaction history and spending tracking. For example, wallet apps like Google Pay or Trust Wallet let me manage both fiat and digital currencies with ease. This blend of functionality saves time and provides peace of mind. The Rise Of Cryptocurrency In Personal Finance Cryptocurrency is becoming a core part of personal finance. Digital wallets make it easy to buy, sell, and store crypto without needing separate platforms. When I first invested in Bitcoin, I realised how simple this process could be with the right wallet. Expert reports highlight how crypto offers global access to finance without traditional banking. People use wallets like Binance or Coinbase to explore these opportunities. These wallets are revolutionising investments, with low fees and instant transactions at their core. Exploring The Benefits Of Crypto Wallets Crypto wallets are transforming personal finance by providing users with secure, cost-effective, and accessible ways to manage their digital assets. Their benefits are redefining how I, and many others, interact with money in this growing digital economy. Enhanced Security Features Crypto wallets prioritise asset security through advanced protection tools. Private keys, stored locally on my device, ensure I have sole control over my funds. Wallets like Coinbase include multi-signature options and two-factor authentication, reducing risks of unauthorised access. This gives me peace of mind. Accessibility And Convenience Crypto wallets make managing digital assets incredibly convenient. Apps like Trust Wallet allow me to access my funds from anywhere in the world through a phone. I can send or receive crypto instantly, bypassing traditional bank delays. The user-friendly interfaces also simplify navigation for beginners. Reduction Of Transaction Fees Transaction fees with crypto wallets are notably lower compared to banks or remittance services. Using Binance or Coinbase, I’ve paid minimal costs when transferring money across borders. These lower fees make daily transactions and investments more affordable while giving global accessibility to financial tools. Comparing Traditional Wallets Vs. Crypto Wallets Key Differences in Functionality Crypto wallets redefine how we handle money compared to traditional wallets. While traditional wallets store fiat payment methods like credit cards and enable local transactions, crypto wallets manage digital assets like Bitcoin. They also provide access to blockchain systems. Traditional wallets depend on centralised security such as passwords and biometrics, offering simplicity for banking-linked accounts. Crypto wallets use private keys and decentralised networks, providing users with full control over their funds. This distinction makes crypto wallets ideal for financial independence. Advantages Over Traditional Banking Systems Crypto wallets offer financial freedom that banks can’t match. I’ve bypassed banking delays using Trust Wallet for instant transfers. These wallets enable global payments and transactions without relying on intermediaries, which supports seamless, direct peer-to-peer exchanges. Using crypto wallets has drastically reduced fees for my transactions. Unlike banks, which charge high fees for international remittances, wallets like Binance allow low-cost transfers. This affordability has made managing personal finances easier and more efficient for me. Examining Crypto’s Impact On Financial Independence Cryptocurrencies are changing how people view and manage their finances. By addressing barriers in accessibility and promoting user control, they’re opening doors to new levels of financial autonomy. Empowering The Unbanked Populations Cryptocurrencies provide a lifeline to millions without access to banks. People in remote areas, like parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services without needing a bank account. I’ve seen stories of farmers bypassing middlemen using crypto, earning more for their produce. Bitcoin wallets require only internet access, removing the need for credit scores or IDs. This changes lives in countries where traditional banking systems ignore the poor. Experts like Dr Ruth Wandhöfer agree that “crypto bridges the gap” for underbanked communities. It truly levels the playing field. Decentralisation And Control Over Assets Cryptocurrencies put people in control of their money through blockchain technology. With private keys, individuals manage funds directly, bypassing banks. I once felt uneasy relying on institutions, but owning my crypto wallet has boosted my sense of security and financial independence. Decentralised systems ensure no single entity can block or reverse your transactions. This builds trust, especially in places with unstable economies. Blockchain specialist Andreas Antonopoulos explains it well: “Your keys, your coins. No intermediary, no permission needed.” This philosophy is empowering. Addressing Challenges In The Digital Wallet Revolution The rise of digital wallets and cryptocurrency brings immense potential but raises challenges. From ensuring security against hacks to navigating complex regulations, these obstacles can’t be ignored. Security Risks And Hacks Protecting digital wallets from hacks is a priority. Wallets rely on encryption, PIN codes, or biometrics. Yet, compromised devices or malware can expose private keys and lead to losses. I’m cautious with my Trust Wallet, using two-factor authentication (2FA) and keeping backups offline for safety. Stolen or rooted devices heighten risks. Once, a friend lost access to his crypto when his rooted phone was hacked. Ensuring devices stay updated and avoiding unsecured networks helps. Experts like Andreas Antonopoulos recommend hardware wallets as a secure alternative for crypto storage. Regulatory And Legal Hurdles Unclear regulations create barriers. Crypto wallets offer decentralised benefits but lack global legal frameworks. I’ve often read about differing rules making cross-border transactions complex. Experts like Dr Ruth Wandhöfer suggest creating unified policies to enhance crypto adoption. Some countries restrict crypto wallets. For instance, strict regulations in China prevent their use for payments. South Korea’s KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements solve fraud but create delays. Adapting local laws and using compliant wallets like Binance ensures seamless operations. Adopting Crypto For Everyday Transactions Cryptocurrencies are becoming a practical option for daily transactions. With growing acceptance and accessibility, I’ve found it easier than ever to use crypto for payments. The rise of stablecoins and crypto ATMs makes managing finances simpler and more efficient. Popular Cryptocurrencies For Daily Use Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins like USDT dominate daily crypto payments. I often use USDT because it’s pegged to the U.S. dollar, preserving value. Experts like Dr Ruth Wandhöfer note stablecoins enable affordable cross-border payments, impacting global finance. Bitcoin’s scalability solutions, like Lightning Network, also ease small transactions, providing faster and cheaper options. These currencies are reshaping how I and many others spend globally. Businesses And Merchants Accepting Crypto Payments Retailers and service providers are increasingly adopting crypto. I recently noticed that crypto-accepting vendors grew by 42% between 2022 and 2024, with stores like AMC Theatres and Overstock paving the way. Crypto ATMs simplifying transactions have also surged 64% in market value, which highlights expanding accessibility. Blockchain specialist Andreas Antonopoulos says crypto bridges gaps in areas lacking traditional payment methods, and I see it integrated into services like groceries and travel more frequently. Future Prospects Of Digital Wallets In Personal Finance Digital wallets are set to redefine how we manage money. From integrating advanced technologies to rising acceptance globally, these trends highlight their future potential. Integration With Emerging Technologies Digital wallets are improving with emerging technologies. AI-powered budgeting tools are helping users manage expenses better. I’ve used these to set spending goals and save more. Biometric authentication, like fingerprint scanning, enhances security. Blockchain integration allows seamless cryptocurrency transactions directly through wallets. On using blockchain-enabled wallets, I noticed reduced fees and faster cross-border payments, which felt game-changing. Technology is making wallets indispensable, blending convenience and innovation. Predictions For Broader Adoption Digital wallet adoption is expanding across demographics. Experts like Andreas Antonopoulos predict their role will grow as they simplify cryptocurrency use. Contactless payments, already popular, are accelerating their spread. Businesses accepting digital wallet payments are also increasing. I’ve seen small vendors embrace this tech, making payments easier everywhere I shop. Governments in countries like Singapore also support cashless ecosystems, further driving adoption. These wallets are shaping the financial future for individuals worldwide. Conclusion The digital wallet revolution is more than just a technological shift; it’s a fundamental change in how we perceive and manage money. Crypto and digital wallets are breaking down barriers, offering financial freedom, and empowering individuals like never before. While challenges like security risks and regulatory uncertainties remain, the potential for innovation far outweighs these hurdles.

But even amidst this downturn, savvy investors are discovering hidden gems that stand out from the bearish pack—tokens like Lightchain AI , currently priced attractively at just $0.007 during its presale phase and having already raised a staggering $18.9 million. Crypto Market Meltdown Leaves Investors Searching for Safe Havens The recent downward spiral in the cryptocurrency market and the present global economic instability have driven investors towards more stable assets. With the news of additional US trade tariffs, the price of Bitcoin decreased below $82,000 causing a panic for a potential global trade war and a probable recession. The reduced price led to a migration towards the traditional safe havens such as gold, which has received new money because of its historical stability in the market downturns. Besides, the stablecoins that support gold such as PAXG and XAUT have seen their value shoot up by over 18% in the period from January in confirmation of investors' interest in gold-backed assets. That said, faced with the high volatility and regulatory ambiguities of Bitcoin, its role as a trustworthy safe-haven asset is still in question despite the virtual currency's increasing popularity. What Makes Lightchain AI a Breakout Contender? While much of the crypto market tumbles, Lightchain AI is generating serious buzz for its pioneering solutions at the crossroads of blockchain and artificial intelligence. The platform’s standout innovation, Proof of Intelligence (PoI), revolutionizes consensus mechanisms by rewarding nodes for performing valuable AI tasks like model training, inference, and optimization. Unlike energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) or capital-heavy Proof of Stake (PoS) systems, PoI supports environmental sustainability and fosters fair participation by enabling nodes of varying sizes to effectively contribute. Complementing PoI is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), an advanced computational layer specifically optimized to execute AI workloads on the blockchain. The AIVM allows developers to seamlessly deploy existing models from popular AI frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, opening a world of decentralized, real-time AI applications that traditional blockchain platforms struggle to support. Transparent, Equitable, and Primed for Explosive Growth Investors aren't just looking for another speculative token—they want assurance of long-term viability, real-world utility, and fair, transparent governance. Here again, Lightchain AI sets a new standard. By integrating blockchain’s immutability with robust decentralized governance, Lightchain AI ensures that all AI operations and decision-making processes remain transparent, auditable, and accountable to its community. Its well-designed tokenomics reinforce this sustainability, featuring strategic allocations toward liquidity, staking rewards, and ecosystem growth. With incentives firmly aligned, the platform is ideally positioned to thrive long-term, irrespective of short-term market turbulence.

These promising cryptocurrencies may be set for significant growth, making them intriguing options for investors. This article dives into what makes these digital assets stand out and why they might be worth a closer look. Discover the potential paths for these coins and their future prospects. VeChain Price Trends and Key Levels Amid Bearish Pressure Over the past month, VeChain experienced a steep decline of around 25%, with nearly 8% of that drop occurring within just one week. The overall dip over the six-month period was more moderate at roughly 6%, highlighting a mix of short-term volatility alongside a longer-term soft downward trend. Current trading shows the coin hovering in the $0.02 to $0.03 range. A key resistance level stands at $0.04, with another resistance at $0.05, while solid support appears near $0.01. Bears currently dominate as momentum indicators remain slightly negative. Buying near support could lead to a test of resistance if bull activity increases in the market. Chainlink Price Movements: Short-Term Dips and Long-Term Resilience Chainlink experienced a sharp 21% drop over the past month while enjoying a 15% gain over the last six months. The monthly decline indicates short-term pressure, but the six-month rebound shows the coin has the strength to recover from setbacks. Price swings have been notable, reflecting a mix of caution and recovery that highlight Chainlink’s volatile nature in an evolving market. Currently, prices range between $11.05 and $16.83, with a key support level at $8.57 and resistance at $20.14. Additional supports around $2.79 and resistance near $25.92 create clear trading zones. Negative momentum indicators and an RSI of 39.87 suggest bearish control, with no clear upward trend. Trading near support levels may offer opportunities for cautious plays. Conclusion Both VET and LINK show strong potential for entry at their current prices. Their unique features and roles in the blockchain space make them appealing. Keep an eye on their developments and market performance for potential future gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Is a DOGE Rally Coming?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/sol-bearish-momentum-picks-up-blockdag-launches-beta-testnet-60k-reward-pool-is-a-doge-rally-coming,"A dramatic decline, a potential meme coin comeback, and a new testnet launch—plenty is happening in the crypto world today! Solana’s bearish momentum has picked up, with the $125 support level under pressure, and further declines could follow if this key level breaks. In contrast, Dogecoin’s price is testing resistance at $0.18, and if it breaks through, a rally toward $0.25–$0.28 could be on the cards. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has launched its Beta Testnet V1, featuring an upgraded explorer and double the speeds of its previous Alpha testnet! Early participants can also earn rewards from a $60,000 prize pool. Following this announcement, the presale has seen an impressive surge to $212 million as traders rush to be among the earliest to join. Solana (SOL) Bearish Momentum Picks Up: Fall Coming? The Solana (SOL) bearish momentum continues, with the key $125 support level now at risk. Despite previous recovery efforts, sellers are still in control, preventing any notable upside. If SOL fails to hold this support, it could trigger panic selling, pushing prices lower. The SOL price chart also shows a bearish triangle pattern pointing to further declines. If Solana slips below the $125 level, it could quickly test the next support at $118. A further breakdown could push SOL toward $99, and if that level doesn't hold, $79 and $58 may come into play. Solana's bearish momentum remains a key concern, and bulls need to defend these levels to prevent a deeper decline. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch The Dogecoin (DOGE) price is at a critical point, trading around $0.17 and approaching the first major resistance at $0.18. This level, along with $0.21, is key because many holders bought at these prices, which could create selling pressure. If Dogecoin can break through these resistance levels, it could spark a rally, pushing the price toward the $0.25 to $0.28 range, with $0.30 being the next target. However, if these levels aren’t cleared, DOGE may drop back to test lower support around $0.15. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Comes with New Features & $60K Prize Pool! BlockDAG has officially launched Beta Testnet V1, bringing several key updates that aim to enhance the user experience. The new testnet is now twice as fast as its previous version and features an upgraded explorer. It also introduces a no-code Token & NFT wizard, making it easier than ever for users to create ERC-20, 721, and 1155 tokens. Plus, several new decentralized applications (dApps) are now available, giving the community a chance to test out real features ahead of the mainnet launch. Adding to the excitement, CEO Antony Turner, while announcing the Beta Testnet in the latest Keynote 3 , also revealed an exciting prize pool saying, ""And if that is not enough, we’re even going to incentivize you to get involved."" BlockDAG is offering $60,000 in rewards for early participants! Rewards will be given to the top 10 most active wallets, the top 10 miners by BDAG earned, and the top 10 wallets by coin balance. Thirty winners will each receive $2,000 worth of BDAG coins. Wondering just how valuable these rewards are? Given the network’s impressive rise so far, analysts predict BDAG, currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, could hit $1 this year. This means a potential 3932% return for those who join now! The presale has already surged to $212 million, with over 19.1 billion coins sold, as traders rush to lock their positions. For anyone looking to jump into a top Layer 1 crypto project, BlockDAG’s beta testnet offers an excellent opportunity to explore its features and earn impressive rewards along the way. Summing Up! The deepening Solana bearish momentum puts the $125 support level at risk. If this level fails to hold, further declines could follow. Dogecoin’s price is testing key resistance at $0.18 and $0.21. If these levels are broken, a rally could be in store; otherwise, the price may dip back to $0.15. However, when it comes to profitability, BlockDAG easily takes the lead. With a current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27, it’s predicted to deliver a potential 3932% ROI in the months ahead. Plus, the new beta testnet launch further boosts profit potential, allowing users to earn up to $2,000 worth of BDAG coins while testing the most promising Layer 1 crypto project today! But acting fast is key—Batch 27 is the last chance to get in at this low price before BDAG’s value takes off.

Why Is Bitcoin Price Rising Amid the U.S.–China Trade War? Bitcoin price has held firmly above the $80,000 mark, despite US Trade tariffs sparking intense market turbulence across global financial markets over the past week. BTC’s resilient price action has caught investor’s attention, and could potentially trigger a major rally in the past week. Bitcoin Price Action vs. S&P 500 (BTCUSD) | April 5 This sharp contrast between plunging equities and stable crypto valuations points to a broader shift in investor sentiment. As capital flees traditional markets, Bitcoin is emerging as a strategic hedge. Three key factors are driving this trend: Bitcoin’s neutrality in sovereign conflict: Bitcoin operates independently of any single government, making it less vulnerable to geopolitical tensions and tariff policies. As trade frictions escalate and global blocs prepare countermeasures, Bitcoin’s decentralized feature appeals to investors seeking safety flight-to-safety plays. Insulation from Inflation and US corporate earnings risk Unlike equity holdings, Bitcoin doesn’t rely on earnings, production pipelines, or executive strategy. Investors are increasingly turning to BTC for its multinational companies face revenue pressure from disrupted global trade routes. More, so BTC has a fixed supply, making it resistance to inflation risks that could arise from the looming supply-chain crisis. Safe-haven demand amid geopolitical uncertainty With NATO and EU countries escalating involvement in the Russia–Ukraine conflict and fears mounting that U.S. trade measures could trigger cascading retaliations worldwide, risk appetite is shrinking in equities and government bonds. Should Washington fail to de-escalate trade tensions diplomatically, another leg down in equity markets is likely—particularly US tech stock sectors with revenues streams exposed to global shocks. In contrast, Bitcoin is positioned to absorb displaced capital, benefiting global accessibility and permisionless features. Bitcoin Whale Transactions Rise 120% in a Week As BTC price decouples decouples from the broader market sell-off, large investors and corporate firms took notice. Confirming this narrative, on-chain data trends shows that while global markets tanked, whale activity on the Bitcoin network has been on the rise. IntoTheBlock’s Large Transaction Volume chart monitors the total value of transactions that exceed $100,000 in value on any given day. This provides clear insights into the activity of corporate entities and deep-pocketed whale investors around certain market events. Bitcoin whale transactions, April 2025 | Source: IntoTheBlock As seen in the chart above, all the BTC whale transactions that exceeded $100,000 on March 23, summed up to a total of $26.17 billion. While investors exited US stocks and other adjacent commodities markets, Bitcoin whale transactions is increased to $47.27 billion at close of April 4, according to the latest data. Whale transactions increasing while Bitcoin prices hold steady signals that whale investors have been acquiring large amount of BTC, nullifying the bearish pressure from retail weak hands selling under the Trade war panic. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $85K Rebound as Whale Demand Offsets Trade War Volatility Bitcoin price forecast remains cautiously bullish as macroeconomic instability begins to catalyze institutional rotation into digital assets. Despite Friday’s close at $83,100, a 0.94% daily loss, BTC continues to trade above the critical $83,000 support, resisting broader financial market turmoil driven by trade tensions between the U.S. and China . Bitcoin price forecast | BTCUSD From a technical standpoint, the price action has formed a minor bullish reversal following a two-day rebound, highlighted by the recent 3.36% upswing ($2,727) across April 4 and 5. This recovery aligns with whale activity surging to $47 billion, reinforcing the idea that larger entities are absorbing retail panic. The Supertrend moving averages—particularly the 5- and 8-day SMAs—are beginning to converge just beneath current price levels, suggesting imminent resistance at $84,532.52, with interim support holding at $83,183.27. Volume trends remain neutral, but the most notable divergence is seen in the Bull-Bear Power (BBP), which still prints a negative reading of -1,253.58. This suggests weak short-term momentum but does not negate the bullish setup entirely. If BTC closes above $84,500 with sustained whale support, the door opens to retesting $86,000. A failure here, however, risks a decline toward $82,000.

With its loyal community and growing adoption, some believe DOGE could still hit the $2 mark. But while Dogecoin inches forward, a new contender, Rexas Finance (RXS) , is making waves with the potential for a staggering 19,800% surge. Backed by strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and a rapidly growing investor base, RXS is catching the eye of early adopters looking for life-changing gains. Let’s dive into the numbers, market sentiment, and why RXS might outshine Dogecoin. Dogecoin (DOGE) Over the past year, Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged by 19.18%, showing strong resilience despite market fluctuations. After peaking above $0.40, DOGE retraced but found solid support around $0.15-$0.17, indicating buyer interest. The 24-hour trading volume jumped by 41.73%, suggesting renewed momentum. Historically, Dogecoin has thrived on hype and bullish sentiment, and with growing adoption, its $2 target is still on the table. If market conditions align, major exchange activity and broader crypto rallies could push DOGE toward new highs, making it a key watch for long-term investors.

Additionally, the price of the meme coin is on the verge of a major breakdown. Source: Trading View Based on recent price momentum and historical patterns, if the meme coin breaches the neckline of the bearish pattern and closes a daily candle below the $0.16 mark, it could drop by 21% to reach the support level of $0.13 in the future. As of now, DOGE is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on both the daily and four-hour time frames. This indicator suggests that the meme coin is in a strong bearish trend and is following a downward momentum. However, traders and investors often use this setup to sell off or short the asset whenever its price shows any signs of upward movement. Current Price Momentum At press time, DOGE is trading near $0.168 and has recorded a 1% price drop over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, during the same period, its trading volume declined by 60%, indicating reduced participation from traders and investors—potentially due to bearish market sentiment. $6 Million Worth of DOGE Outflow However, amid this bearish outlook, investors appear to be accumulating tokens, potentially signaling a classic buy-the-dip strategy, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Data on spot inflows and outflows reveals that exchanges have seen an outflow of approximately $6.11 million worth of DOGE over the past 24 hours. This substantial outflow suggests potential accumulation and could lead to increased buying pressure. Yet, while this massive outflow has the potential to trigger an upside rally, the prevailing bearish market sentiment may make it difficult to sustain such upward momentum.",Price Analysis|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 19:57:25

Dogecoin: Will DOGE Rebound, or Is 2025 the Year of MUTM?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-vs-dogecoin-will-doge-rebound-or-is-2025-the-year-of-mutm/,"With one narrative seeing Dogecoin (DOGE) contesting resistance levels before naysayers, whispers of a 270% rally abound, and the other with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surging through its fourth presale phase to raise $6.2 million with a growing 7,900 holders. Now at $0.025, MUTM presale momentum is palpable as investors ensure they secure profits before the price surge a further 20% to $0.03 in phase five. Mutuum Finance, with its structured returns, offering 140% return at its $0.06 exchange listing and targets for post-launch already hinting at a $1.50 price point, is swiftly becoming a port of call for the volatile portfolio looking for stability and growth. Dogecoin’s Bumpy Path to Recovery Recent price action of Dogecoin has inspired cautious optimism. Analysts see higher lows being formed since last week—potentially leading to a breakout toward $0.6533—a +270% rise from present levels. Javon Marks identifies historical trends in which similar patterns preceded rallies, yet headwinds remain. Important resistance lies between $0.25 and $0.26, a flipped support zone. Baffling whale activity makes it all the more complicated. With more than 220 million DOGE built up during March alone, the accumulation suggests strategic positioning, but meme-driven sentiment is a weak foundation for any token which DOGE must heed. An eyebrow-raising “Proof-of-Twerk” upgrade — a play on consensus mechanisms — has inspired interest but fails to deliver any real utility. Dogecoin’s trajectory, that, while Trader Tardigrade’s “J-shaped rebound” theory is hope, is anchored on speculative hype rather than the deep innovation playing out on the ground. Mutuum Finance Dominates Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is deafening volatility fears with a presale model that underpins transparency & calculable returns. Phase four is currently live and provides tokens at $0.025 — the last chance before the price increases to $0.03. First movers could see a 140% return at launch, while post-listing aspirations are eyeing $1.50 as adoption kicks in. That equates to a 5,900% return for investors buying tokens today, a fact based on tokenomics, not speculation. Demand is being driven by the project’s lending ecosystem. Users deposit assets such as ETH or DAI and receive interest-bearing mtTokens that min in value as time goes on. These tokens can then be traded or utilized across DeFi platforms, providing liquidity without requiring the sale of underlying assets. MUTM provides overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending options to enhance flexibility for borrowers while protecting lenders. A buy-and-distribute mechanism directs platform revenues to buy MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers and creating a constant pressure to buy. 2025’s Defining Choice Dogecoin is replicating past metrics where up until now, meme culture is fizzling out but remained to lift towards greater heights whenever things hits on the rigors. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, blends DeFi utility with a growth focused model that offers appeal to investors that prioritize substance over sentiment. With phase four ending there is less time available to buy MUTM at $0.025 this is a turning point for size and shrinking portfolios hoping for exponential growth. Analysts predict that 2025 will be the breakout year for Mutuum Finance as both algorithmic stability and user-driven demand will dominate over speculative assets. The question is not whether DOGE can bounce back, it’s whether it can outpace a project built to prosper in volatility. For future watchers, the presale of MUTM is your pathway to returns that don’t depend on what the market is up to. Take Action Ahead of Phase Five Time is critical. As Mutuum Finance’s presale phases have been flying off the shelves each week, waiting could mean losing the opportunity to deal at the cheapest prices available in the market. Head over to Mutuum Finance’s official site for tokens now, before the next price jump—and position ahead of a potential seismic shift in the crypto hierarchy in 2025.

Cardano looks ready to break out. XRP? Not so much. And BlockDAG ? It’s not waiting for momentum—it’s creating it. ADA is building strength near $0.77, with bulls eyeing a run to $1. But that move needs a strong breakout. Until then, it’s all set up. XRP, on the other hand, can’t seem to hold its ground. After dipping below $2.40, it’s facing real pressure. It may bounce back—but the cracks are showing. Then there’s BlockDAG. It’s not following trends—it’s leading with results. Over $211.5 million raised, 1.2 million transactions already live, and a network that’s actually doing what others are still pitching. With UFC star Alex Pereira and Inter Milan on board, and a presale jump of 2,380%, BlockDAG isn’t chasing hype—it’s building something real. And the race to $1? It’s already halfway there. ADA Looks Primed—Will It Smash Past $0.77 and Hit $1? Cardano’s latest chart activity has sparked fresh talk of a rally. After a slight 2% pullback to $0.729, the setup is still looking bullish. An ascending triangle pattern is taking shape. That $0.77 resistance? It’s the line in the sand. If ADA breaks above it, $0.90 is the next target—and $1.03 isn’t out of the question. Technical indicators are flashing green. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, which often hints at big moves ahead. The RSI is climbing, showing buyers are stepping in. But there’s a flip side. If ADA breaks below its trendline, that bullish setup may fall apart, opening the door to a deeper pullback. Still, the upside potential is hard to ignore. If the breakout comes, ADA could deliver a solid short-term run for traders watching those key zones. XRP Drops Below $2.40—Will Bulls Step In or Bail? XRP hit a wall at $2.50 and couldn’t push through. Since then, it’s been sliding. It broke key supports at $2.44 and $2.40, dipped to $2.329, and now trades under both $2.40 and the 100-hour moving average. Any short-term bounce will have to beat $2.42 and $2.45 before challenging $2.50 again. But if XRP can’t stay above $2.35 or $2.32, the next leg down could hit $2.20—or even $2.15. With RSI sitting below 50, strength is fading. Traders are waiting to see if $2.42 becomes a launchpad or another failed level. The next move could set the tone for the entire week. BlockDAG’s $211.5M Milestone Signals $1 May Come Faster Than Anyone Thinks BlockDAG’s third keynote didn’t just make waves—it turned heads. The presale has already topped $211.5 million, and 19.1 billion BDAG tokens have been scooped up. With a current price of $0.0248, early buyers are staring down a chance at major upside. A 2,380% increase in presale value speaks volumes—and this could just be the start. But the numbers only tell part of the story. The Beta Testnet is up and running, pushing through over 1.2 million transactions with help from 100+ global community nodes. Tools for token and NFT creation are live. Actual dApps are being tested. Over 800,000 users are mining through the X1 App, and 16,600 ASIC miners have been shipped. And that’s not all. BlockDAG is bringing major brands on board, including UFC and Inter Milan. It supports EVM and comes with built-in audit-ready security. Add in exchange listings on the way, and it’s clear—this isn’t just another presale. It’s an entire network gearing up for a breakout. The extended presale isn’t a stall—it’s a window. One that’s closing quickly. The $1 goal looks less like a dream and more like a destination on the near-term map. Blink and you might miss the last cheap entry. Key Takeaway Cardano could take off if it clears $0.77. XRP needs to hold $2.35 or face another pullback. But BlockDAG? It’s not sitting around. It’s rolling out updates, stacking real users, and preparing for a mainnet backed by real utility. With over 800K miners, more than 19.1 billion tokens sold, and real-world brands backing it, BlockDAG is checking every box. The $1 price tag doesn’t feel far—it feels like a matter of time. In a market full of maybe’s, BDAG looks like the one with a plan—and the momentum to match.

According to the technical analyst, a critical indicator on the monthly chart paints a very different picture from the one many investors hope for. Severino’s warning comes as Bitcoin continues to consolidate between $81,000 and $84,500, with the buying trend suggesting that it might be topping out. Related Reading: Solana Slammed By Whale Dump—Can It Recover Or Is More Pain Ahead? Stochastic Oscillator Says Bitcoin No Longer In Same Phase As 2017 At the core of Severino’s argument is the stochastic oscillator, a momentum indicator commonly used by technical analysts to analyze whether a cryptocurrency is overbought or oversold relative to its recent price range. When applied to Bitcoin on the monthly candlestick timeframe, the oscillator offers a broader view of long-term momentum trends stretching back to 2013. In the chart shared by Severino, this timeframe includes every major bull and bear cycle, with many recurring patterns. His outlook is in response to market participants who link the 1-month Bitcoin stochastic oscillator’s movement to its past levels in 2017 as a sign of what they expect in the current market. As seen in the chart below, the oscillator has been undergoing the same 2017 downtrend since the beginning of 2025. At the time of writing, the oscillator is sitting around 60, the same level it fell to during the correction in the 2017 bull market. However, he argues that this level has little in common with the 2017 bull run’s momentum peak and aligns more closely with the beginning of the 2018 bear market. During that point in the cycle, Bitcoin suffered a staggering 49% drop within a single month, from wick high to wick low. Severino implies that any current similarities to the 2017 bull market are misleading from a bullish technical standpoint, as the implication is that the leading cryptocurrency is at risk of entering a similar corrective or bearish phase now. Bitcoin Price Can Break Either Way Recent price action has seen Bitcoin struggling to receive strong inflows and buying momentum. On-chain data shows that many short-term holders have halted their buying activity due to the extended consolidation, which does not bode well for bullish prospects. Furthermore, the realized price model says the ongoing correction may still have weeks to run. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has managed to hold and reject a break below $80,000 amid the recent turmoil that shook the markets. The announcement of US President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs rattled markets, causing volatility not only in crypto but across major US equity markets. Related Reading: XRP Breakout Alert! Could This Surge Send The Altcoin To $3? As the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and NASDAQ pulled back in response, Bitcoin also slipped toward the $81,000 level.

In a new press release , the regulatory agency says that non-yield-bearing stablecoins do not qualify as securities that fall under its jurisdiction because they “advance a commercial or consumer purpose.” According to the SEC, stablecoins aren’t securities because those who purchase them do not expect a return on their investment. Instead, they seek to use the digital assets to purchase goods and services and/or as stores of value. Furthermore, the agency says that dollar-pegged crypto assets are not distributed in a manner that encourages speculation or investing. “Covered stablecoins are marketed solely for use in commerce, as a means of making payments, transmitting money, and/or storing value, and not as investments.” However, the SEC has left the door open to considering alternative types of stablecoins – such as those that are yield-bearing, of the algorithmic variety, or pegged to non-USD assets – as securities, noting that its new stance on dollar-pegged assets doesn’t apply to these types of products and they have yet to formulate a view on the matter. Under the Biden Administration and the helm of former Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC filed numerous high-profile lawsuits against crypto firms such as Kraken, Coinbase, Consensys and Ripple Labs and didn’t approve the launch of Bitcoin ( BTC )-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) until pressured to do so by a judge. Furthermore, under Gensler, the SEC counted the majority of digital assets, excluding BTC, as securities that fell under its regulatory jurisdiction. Gensler was replaced by former SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda, who is currently serving as the agency’s Acting Chairman.

Recent updates on PI coin and Hedera (HBAR) show two very different paths. PI dropped sharply—down over 76% from its launch high—while HBAR found renewed interest through new institutional tools. But the real shift might be happening elsewhere. BlockDAG is getting attention for all the right reasons. It’s now seen as one of the most active projects online. The launch of Keynote 3 didn’t just offer updates—it showed real progress. A live beta testnet, over 800,000 active miners, and a transaction capacity of 15,000 TPS make this project hard to ignore. BlockDAG’s structure combines PoW and DAG, using Phantom and GhostDAG protocols to confirm blocks side by side. While others are making announcements, BlockDAG is showing results. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Signals a Big Shift With Keynote 3, BlockDAG introduced more than promises. The network now runs a live Beta Testnet, upgraded from its alpha phase and built for speed. This version includes tools like a block explorer, NFT/token creator, and early-stage apps—all functional and ready to test. BlockDAG doesn’t rely on a single chain of blocks. Its system confirms multiple blocks in parallel, increasing efficiency and removing traditional slowdowns. This setup supports up to 15,000 TPS and avoids the typical drawbacks of Proof-of-Work chains. It’s also backed by security audits from Halborn and CertiK. The project’s numbers reflect this momentum. So far, the presale has brought in $211.5 million with 19.1 billion BDAG sold. The current price in Batch 27 is $0.0248, showing a 2,380% increase since Batch 1. BlockDAG’s mining app now has over 800,000 users, and TG Tap Miner reports 400,000 total users, with 100,000 logging in daily. More than just technical updates, the project also introduced initiatives like BlockDAG Academy and global workshops. These aim to support long-term growth. Based on everything released during Keynote 3, it’s clear BlockDAG isn’t just an idea—it’s a functioning network moving quickly. PI Coin Price Drops Over 76%—Can It Recover? PI coin reached $2.99 shortly after its launch on February 20 but has since fallen to around $0.70. That’s a 76% drop. Delays with the mainnet, rejection by exchanges like Binance and Bybit, and a shift from phone verification to email-based 2FA created uncertainty. The token is still sitting above key support near $0.6450. If it holds, analysts suggest PI could recover to $1.00, with $1.22 as a short-term goal. However, if pressure continues, a slide to $0.50 is possible. Technical indicators are mixed—MACD remains neutral, though EMA patterns suggest a Golden Cross might be forming. Traders appear cautious for now, and interest has cooled since launch week. What’s Behind the Changing Hedera (HBAR) Price Outlook? Hedera’s (HBAR) price got a lift after the team introduced HashSphere, a blockchain solution aimed at enterprise users. It’s built to support HBAR and stablecoins, and also allows real-world assets to be tokenized. The system will work with Ethereum’s EVM, which helped HBAR climb 10% from a recent low of $0.1568. HBAR now trades near $0.1685—still well under its all-time high of $0.5692. Indicators show RSI levels of 45 and 33. If the price climbs back above $0.20, analysts believe there’s room for a recovery. The Q3 launch of HashSphere may play a key role in building more traction. Long-term backing from major firms like Google and IBM adds credibility. However, centralization concerns still exist. Whether HBAR gains more ground depends on how well HashSphere is received and whether the network scales smoothly. Final Thoughts PI coin’s sharp decline and Hedera’s cautious rebound show how quickly things can shift in crypto. PI needs to restore confidence after technical delays. HBAR’s progress depends on how institutions respond to HashSphere in the coming months. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is pushing ahead. With 15,000 TPS, working testnet tools, and 800K+ users already active, it’s not waiting for a trend—it’s creating one. The PoW + DAG structure, along with certified audits, offers a unique blend of security and speed. Throw in its $211.5 million raised, 19.1B coins sold, and real user engagement, and it’s easy to see why it’s gaining traction. For those comparing crypto projects right now, BlockDAG looks like a strong option with real signs of growth—not just potential.
