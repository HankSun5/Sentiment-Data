These support levels might indicate future price movements. Analyzing such patterns can help in predicting which coins hold potential for growth. Curious which ones are gearing up for a surge? Dive into the details and uncover the mid-term outlook. Stacks (STX) Endures Volatility While Key Levels Signal Trading Zones Past month performance saw STX drop nearly 20%, while the six-month decline reached around 67.5%. The coin experienced short-term rebound moves with a 3.08% one-week gain, yet the overall trajectory remains down. Price swings have kept the asset volatile, echoing a pattern of sharp corrections amid sporadic rallies. Technical measures reflect uncertainty, with indicators suggesting a cautious outlook despite brief upward spurts. Current pricing rests between $0.5774 and $1.2145, with support observed near $0.32 and resistance at $1.60, and a secondary ceiling at $2.24. Bears currently hold sway, and the market shows no clear trend. Traders may consider buying nearer support levels, while closely watching resistance for potential breakouts. Injective Analysis: Steep Decline with Support at $6.43 and Resistance near $24.03 Injective recorded a one-week drop of 6.47%, a one-month decline of 30.12%, and a six-month plunge of 61.03%. Price levels ranged between $9.87 and $18.68, showing a clear downward move over time. Data reflects persistent selling pressure and an overall bearish past performance, marking a significant price correction. Current price sits between $9.87 and $18.68 with immediate support around $6.43 and resistance close to $24.03, plus additional resistance at $32.83. Oscillators and momentum indicators are in negative territory, suggesting bears dominate the market with no clear recovery trend apparent. Trading strategies could focus on taking short positions when prices near the resistance levels and watching for any break above to indicate a change in sentiment. JasmyCoin: Key Levels and Market Sentiment in Focus Trading over the past month showed significant losses of around 40%, with a decline of over 50% in the last six months. This indicates a prolonged period of downward movement and mounting weakness in price action. The persistent losses highlight increased risk for traders, emphasizing the need for caution in current market conditions. The current price is fluctuating within a range from approximately $0.012 to $0.030, with immediate support at around $0.005 dollars and resistance near $0.041 dollars. Bears are currently in control, as technical indicators suggest a downward momentum, and there is no clear trend developing. Traders may look for potential bounces at support or breaks above resistance for potential trading opportunities while remaining alert to market volatility. Conclusion STX has shown resilience around its key support levels and could see upward movement if these levels hold. INJ has potential for growth if it confirms a bounce back from its current support points. JASMY requires close observation as it tests its lower bound. Careful monitoring of these support levels will be crucial for understanding the potential price movements of STX, INJ, and JASMY in the mid-term.

The DeFi founder told Cointelegraph that the high transparency of onchain transactions presents a problem for companies that must conceal sensitive information , including trading strategies, payroll information, and business-to-business agreements. Shibtoshi said: ""The main concerns — regulatory uncertainty, privacy limitations, and complex user experience — are real, but solvable. Innovations in privacy-preserving protocols are making DeFi increasingly compatible with enterprise needs. Platforms like SilentSwap are a step in that direction."" Regulatory uncertainty continues to be one of the biggest problems for DeFi and is compounded by a fragmented approach across legal jurisdictions, which prevents institutional adoption, Shibtoshi added. ""Are DeFi tokens securities? What happens if a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) messes up — and who is responsible when it does? It is all still pretty unclear,"" the SilentSwap founder told Cointelegraph. Shibtoshi urged common sense regulations that encourage innovation and preserve the value propositions of decentralized finance, including self-custody, speed, and cost-effective transactions. The total value locked across the DeFi ecosystem has not yet returned to peak levels witnessed in 2021 and 2022. Source: DeFiLlama Related: Specialized purpose DEXs poised for growth in 2025 — Curve founder US Congress overturns archaic DeFi rule, but DeFi still in danger Both chambers of the United States Congress recently voted to overturn the highly unpopular DeFi broker rule requiring decentralized finance protocols and platforms to report customer transactions to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The US Senate repealed the IRS broker rule in a 70 to 27 vote on March 4, followed by members of the US House of Representatives voting to repeal the IRS rule on March 11. Despite the repeal of the archaic rule, overregulation may end up killing a sector that was born as a decentralized, more accessible, and pseudonymous alternative to traditional finance. According to crypto entrepreneur and investor Artem Tolkachev, regulatory compliance is undermining decentralization in DeFi and destroying the value proposition of the nascent sector. The emphasis on regulatory compliance measures increases the potential for censorship and shifts control from the users to third-party intermediaries and large institutions, Tolkachev wrote.

This Hot Presale Is Here—Grab Your Chance to Ride the Next Best Performing Crypto!,https://thecoinrise.com/wishing-you-had-bought-gala-earlier-this-hot-presale-is-here-grab-your-chance-to-ride-the-next-best-performing-crypto/,"Remember when you brushed off Gala Games, thinking it was just another gaming token? And now it’s everywhere—from NFT gaming to massive partnerships—and those early supporters are living large while you’re stuck wishing you’d paid more attention. That’s the thing about crypto: you never realize what you’ve missed until it’s way out of reach. The best performing crypto doesn’t announce itself with a billboard—it shows up quietly, gets picked up by the sharpest minds, and explodes before the masses even understand what it is. If you’re reading this, you’ve got one job: don’t let history repeat itself. Because here comes Qubetics ($TICS)—a name that’s showing all the right signals of becoming the best performing crypto of 2025. Unlike other projects still figuring out their purpose, Qubetics already has a working roadmap, utility-driven applications, and a community that’s growing by the hour. And the Qubetics presale? It’s not just alive—it’s heating up with momentum you can’t ignore. There’s urgency here because every new stage gets pricier. This isn’t just about buying early. It’s about buying smart. If Gala was your missed ticket to wealth, Qubetics could be your redemption arc. You Missed the Early Qubetics Deals—But This Best Performing Crypto Still Has Room to Run Qubetics early supporters who joined its whitelist had the chance to secure $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. Qubetics started its journey on September 29, 2024, and you’ve already missed so many juicy presale stages where prices were ridiculously low. But here’s the good news: Stage 27 is still live, and the current price is $0.1300. With every stage lasting only seven days and a 10% price bump waiting at the next one, this is your last chance to buy in at a low rate before Stage 28 hits. With over $15.5 million already raised, more than 504 million tokens sold, and 23,900+ holders in the community, Qubetics is already acting like the best performing crypto—before even going live. Now let’s break down the numbers that matter. If you invest $2,000 at the current presale price, you’ll receive 15,380 tokens. When $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that’s $15,380 in your pocket—a 669% ROI. If it climbs to $5, that $2K turns into $76,900. At $6, you’re looking at $92,280. If it reaches $10 or $15 after mainnet, that same $2,000 investment becomes $153,800 or even $230,700. These are real projections, backed by the current momentum. That’s why people can’t stop calling it the best performing crypto in the making. And yes, the Qubetics presale is still open for now—but it won’t be for long. Now, what’s backing all this hype? The Qubetics application is no gimmick. It’s a cutting-edge Cross-Border Transaction solution for institutions, businesses, and individuals. For example, say you’re a global logistics firm needing to send high-volume payments to suppliers in other countries. Traditional methods? Expensive, slow, and filled with paperwork. Qubetics changes that. It enables near-instant payments via $TICS tokens with full transparency and zero middlemen. That means lower fees, faster settlement, and streamlined operations—game-changer for any global business. On a smaller scale, imagine you’re a freelancer in the Philippines working for a tech client in Germany. With Qubetics, you’re getting paid in minutes, not days, with none of the usual remittance fees. The wallet’s transparency helps both parties track and confirm transactions with zero stress. Whether you’re a growing company or an individual navigating global payments, Qubetics gives you the speed, control, and cost-efficiency you’ve been wishing for. No wonder it’s getting tagged as the best crypto presale of the year. Gala Was Slept On Too—And Now It’s Among the Best Performing Crypto Projects Gala Games had one of the most overlooked starts in crypto history. Its ICO price? A microscopic $0.0002. But while many dismissed it as just another gaming token, a few visionaries grabbed early access—and they’re the ones sitting on six-figure bags today. Gala’s rise wasn’t overnight, but once it started rolling out Web3 games, NFTs, and partnerships with big players, it blew up. By the time people caught on, it was already among the best performing crypto assets of its niche. Missed that? Yeah, a lot of people did. Since launch, Gala has built an ecosystem that spans entertainment, gaming, and DeFi—building utility where others just push hype. But the real takeaway here isn’t about Gala’s present; it’s about its past. Gala’s story is a blueprint: undervalued start, utility-focused growth, massive returns. It’s a reminder that the next best performing crypto doesn’t always look like a winner right out the gate. Just like Gala, Qubetics is in its early innings—but this time, you know better than to ignore it. Last Chance to Catch the Next Best Performing Crypto Before It Breaks Out The crypto space doesn’t give second chances often, but right now—it’s doing exactly that. Qubetics is sitting in a golden moment: presale open, price still affordable, and an ecosystem that’s already got serious real-world relevance. All the signs are here that this could be the next best performing crypto to dominate headlines. You’ve already watched Gala go from zero to legend—one of the best performing crypto stories of its time. Don’t let another opportunity slide past you while you’re stuck watching it unfold from the sidelines. Time is tight, and the window is closing. With the Qubetics presale still live and the price set to rise again soon, this is your shot to make a move before things go next-level. Every $TICS token bought today could be your bragging rights tomorrow. So if you’re serious about positioning yourself for the next breakout project—join this crypto presale now. Because missing out again? That’s not part of your 2025 success story.

Yotta Technologies is accusing Evolve Bank & Trust of fraud, conspiracy, and negligence. Yotta offered a high-yield savings product, depositing customer money with Evolve for safekeeping. But in May 2024, after Evolve’s fintech partner Synapse filed for bankruptcy, 85,000 Yotta customers lost access to $112 million in savings. Yotta claims Evolve quietly executed over $25 million in unauthorized and hidden transactions, taking the funds from Yotta customers’ accounts, including direct transfers to Synapse. Yotta says this violated banking rules and customer trust and contributed to an overall shortfall of $65 to 95 million. “Yotta’s investigation indicates that Evolve and Synapse conspired to simply take it, in violation of responsible banking practices and basic morality… These transactions were never authorized by customers. Evolve had no right to take this money from customers and never informed Yotta or its customers that it was doing so.” Evolve blames Synapse for the mess, saying Synapse gave inaccurate account data. Evolve has started repaying some customers, with about $11 million of $59 million owed to 13,300 respondents paid out for about 18 cents per dollar.

The viral star, who had been in jail, mentioned that the reason he launched the token was because he had been knee deep in legal bills, with things looking like he had racked up legal fees. According to reports, Tiger King has been in jail for seven years but did not launch the token himself. Instead, the 62-year-old asked his lawyers to help him launch the “Official Tiger King” token off the ground. The token then began trading on Monday under the ticker name EXOTIC. Most celebrity tokens often end up as viral memes, dropping in value as soon as their viral moments fade. According to Tiger King, he hopes his token does not turn out that way, noting that he knows that most celebrity tokens hinge on people’s attention, which can fade, while also mentioning others that have been marred by allegations of insider trading. “I pray to god that they don’t rug it and ruin my reputation,” he said. “I’m hoping that people will see this is legit and it has a purpose.” Tiger King wants his meme coin to be big While celebrity tokens are not new in the crypto industry, the tokens reached a new point last year after several stars, including Caitlyn Jenner, Cardi B, and Jason Derulo, stepped into the space. One of the most controversial projects was the Hawk Tuah token under the ticker name, HAWK. The token was brought to life following the viral moment in an interview featuring Hailey Welch, who is now known as the Hawk Tuah girl. Tiger King’s token EXOTIC was created on a little-known launchpad called pumpkin.fun, with the market cap of the meme coin rising to about $900,000 before falling to rest at over $100,000. According to Blockchain data, the meme coin currently has about 900 users holding the token. Tiger King initially mentioned that the proceeds from the token will also benefit children, noting that donations will be made to a nonprofit called Operation Smile. this right here too. Dont forget all of this. You wont find a more honest celebrity coin. Track the wallets, they are all on https://t.co/NoBlv57TF8 . When @realDonaldTrump pardons me, imagine the market cap then If you heard me on spaces last night, we are just starting. Its… https://t.co/moNCRG63pl — Joe Exotic (@joe_exotic) March 28, 2025 However, the token’s website does not reference the project’s goal of contributing to Operation Smile. Instead, it says some of the tokens will be donated to a foundation supporting Tigers or animal health after he is released from prison. On Friday, Tiger King’s X account mentioned that it had already donated $1,000 to the nonprofit. He mentioned that his lawyers supported his idea to launch the token as a show of commitment to his charitable work. He noted that it is the reason he wants to be free, mentioning that he just sits in prison watching people do drugs all day. Joe Exotic begs President Trump for a pardon Tiger King is currently being held at FMC Forth Worth, an administrative security center, according to the United States Bureau of Prisons. He uses the telephone to connect with the outside world at intervals, keeping his fans up-to-date via podcasts and X Spaces. He mentioned that even though his real-world experience with crypto is limited, he has been able to learn a lot, even from other inmates at the security center. “There’s not a lot to do all day besides sit and talk to people who know shit,” he said. “I do a lot from here, but I don’t even know how to set up a wallet.” He was resentenced to 21 years in federal prison in 2021, according to a post by Associated Press . He was convicted of the murder-for-hire scheme against animal welfare activist Carole Baskin, killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs, and falsifying wildlife records. He has continued to maintain his innocence while urging United States President Donald Trump for a pardon. He mentioned that someone launched an unofficial meme coin called Tiger King Coin in 2021 and was meant to give him 1% of the entire supply of the meme coin, but he never found out the person behind the project. He noted that he fears that the token may influence what people will think about his new token. Exotic hopes that he can use his meme coin as an initiative that benefits children and other people in the future. “People really need to invest in it,” he said. “I would like to be able to get it up there to where I can fix 500 kids’ [faces] and pay my lawyer bills.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

As Bitcoin corrects from recent highs, a crypto analyst expects a rebound to come next. However, if key support fails, the possibility of further downside remains. Bitcoin To Drop To CME Gap Close Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster this year, skyrocketing to new ATHs and experiencing major price breakdowns that pushed it to new lows. Recently the cryptocurrency saw a surge toward $89,000 but faced a rejection. Now the top crypto is pulling back again, with crypto analyst Astronomer on X (formerly Twitter) pinpointing the $83,000 – $84,000 low range as its next critical support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Face $14 Billion Options Expiry—Market Impact Ahead? This crucial support zone in the price chart aligns with the CME gap close, a common phenomenon in the BTC Futures market. BTC revisits price gaps left when the CME price closes over the weekend and opens on Sundays. Astronomer has outlined his long-term trading plan for Bitcoin, expecting the cryptocurrency to consolidate around the support level before bouncing. He believes that the CME gap close is a significant technical development that could determine Bitcoin’s price movements. Supporting the expectations of a short-term pullback, historically, a bearish close on Friday often leads to red Mondays or Tuesdays for Bitcoin. Moreover, the analyst highlights that the market is still in the pre-New York Open (NYO) phase, leaving room for an intraday reversal. However, he anticipates a late-night drop during the NYO trading session due to the lack of liquidations and untested support levels. He also mentions that combined with these factors, Bitcoin’s recent pullback from $89,000 is a strong indication that its price may not be bullish locally. Based on his Bitcoin price chart, Astronomer considers the $81,400 – $82,400 range the worst-case support zone. Bitcoin is expected to revisit this target zone before any attempt at a potential reversal. Can Bitcoin Rebound? Take Profit Levels To Watch While Bitcoin’s short-term price action appears bearish, its macro trend remains somewhat stable, according to Astronomer’s analysis. The analyst has marked a “long entry” zone in the chart, suggesting that the $83,000 – $84,000 zone was a potential buying opportunity if Bitcoin finds support there. Related Reading: Pi Coin Sinks 47% In 14 Days—What’s Behind The Massive Drop? The analyst predicts that if Bitcoin can successfully hold the CME gap close, a bounce toward the weekly open price at $86,000 could be its first step toward a much-anticipated recovery. Beyond this, the analyst has pinpointed key take profit levels marked from TP1 – TP4 on the price chart. These levels suggest that Bitcoin could surge higher to reach a target of $87,000 – $88,000. However, a break below the worst-case support zone could trigger a bearish shift in sentiment, potentially leading to a deeper price correction for Bitcoin.

Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran noted in a post that the class action lawsuit against Elon Musk, which accuses him of defrauding former Twitter shareholders by delaying disclosure of the initial investment, is now much more heated. The acquisition could increase ”risks” for xAI When Musk announced that ”xAI acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” a U.S. judge rejected Musk's attempt to halt the lawsuit. Cochran emphasized that this ”opened up his AI company to additional risks, with a much larger scale now involved.” Musk said the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, taking into account $12 billion in debt from an initial valuation of $45 billion. He originally bought X, formerly known as Twitter, for about $44 billion in April 2022. ”The future of xAI and X are tightly intertwined, and today we are officially taking a step toward combining data, models, computing power, distribution systems and talent,” Musk said. ”This merger will unlock tremendous potential by combining the advanced artificial intelligence capabilities and expertise of xAI with the massive reach of X,” he added. ”It will allow us to create a platform that doesn't just reflect the world, but actively accelerates human progress.” However, Cochran claims that ”Musk used xAI's artificially inflated stock price to pay several times the real value for X, yet record an $11 billion loss on the deal.” He said Musk was ”defrauding xAI and X investors” and the deal was done to sell xAI's user data. xAI is known for its chat bot ”Grok” integrated into the X platform. When Musk launched it in November 2023, he claimed that the bot outperformed the first version of OpenAI's ChatGPT on several academic tests. Musk explained that the motivation for creating Grok was to develop artificial intelligence tools that would help humanity by supporting research and innovation. While Cochran called Grok's $80 billion valuation ”incredibly stupid,” the cryptocurrency developer known as ”Keef” disagrees. ”The whole situation looks questionable, but given the current moment, Grok is probably really the best model for various tasks,” he said. The issue of social network X being acquired by startup xAI raises serious questions about Musk's corporate strategy and potential legal implications. The merger of these companies could lead to significant changes in the development of artificial intelligence and social media in the near future.",News|Business,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|RESEARCH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-29 21:47:48

While the crypto market is diving into an extensive search for hidden gems, another project is overshadowing the established leaders with the massively accelerated momentum and structured growth model. Chainlink Milestone Meets Modest Momentum Chainlink (LINK) Received an Oracle: First 20 Trillion Transactions. The number of daily active addresses reached multi-year highs, and exchange outflows showed that $4.5 million in LINK was moved to private wallets by investors demonstrating confidence. Despite those metrics however, LINK’s price action has been sluggish, rallying a mere 1% in the past week. Analysts see an ascending triangle pattern that indicates a possible run to $17.67, although immediate resistance at $15.45 and $16.42 may impede progress. But slow, steady price growth makes you question the near-term upside relative to tokens that are in their infancy. Hedera Flicks a Hope Amid The Bearish Reality Hedera (HBAR) gained 5% at one point, bringing it close to $0.20, as short-term moving averages suggested an imminent bullish crossover. Nonetheless, BBTrend continues to stay glued to -1.85, indicative of continued selling pressure. A tentative break above the Tenkan-sen line proved encouraging, yet HBAR finds itself under pressure at the lip of the Ichimoku Cloud — a ceiling that has blocked all recovery efforts since March. If the momentum should fade support at $0.184 could break once more, sparking fresh fears of a continued fall below $0.17. With such meagerness of bullish signs, token which once touted enterprise-grade for its accoutrements from blockchain, seems to have little in way of prospects in anything approaching the short term. Mutuum Finance is Gaining Significant Momentum in its Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in its fourth stage of 11-stage presale, with the tokens being claimed at $0.025 each. Investors are rushing to secure positions ahead of a 20% price jump to $0.03 in Phase 5. The project’s $5.7 million fundraising haul and 7,400-strong holder base reflect surging demand for its decentralized lending model. Such a self-sustaining ecosystem is rarely seen in speculative-driven markets, enabled instead by organic buy pressure from revenue-distributed token buybacks and mtTokens—interest-accruing deposit certificates. Existing presale participants could potentially earn a 140% return at launch, as MUTM will list at $0.06. After launch projections are far more dramatic, though. Catalysts for a possible leap to $1.50 a 7,400% increase on current pricing include overcollateralized loans, peer-to-peer lending features and staking rewards, analysts said. This prediction matches the project’s intentional tokenomics: just 20% of supply goes to presale, while 35% powers liquidity mining for sustained long-term growth. Security and Scalability as The Core Priority Mutuum Finance is completing a smart contract audit with Certik, a step that should increase investors’ confidence. When finished, the audit findings will be published along official channels to counteract potential security fears seen in newer DeFi projects. Along with an overcollateralized stablecoin and dynamic interest rates, these measure put MUTM firmly in the teritory of being a usable substitute for traditional finance, and not simply an idle speculation. A New Challenger Rises As Chainlink and Hedera struggle with the lack of price action compared to their fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines urgency and utility. Its phased presale mechanism establishes scarcity, with each price climb reducing the window for low-entry profits. The project’s emphasis on providing real-world financial solutions — from liquidity provisioning to negotiated P2P loans — is in stark contrast to tokens that rely on nothing but market sentiment. In a saturated market, MUTM’s price point at $0.025 could soon just be a distant memory for investors looking for asymmetric returns.

As digital currencies become easier to access, projects like Litecoin and MANTRA have shown how early planning and clear utility can build lasting relevance. Litecoin has relied on its simplicity and speed for over a decade, while MANTRA has climbed by tapping into DeFi and tokenized real-world assets. Now, BlockDAG is taking a step further. Its X1 mobile miner and hybrid DAG + PoW approach are not just expanding its user base—they’re changing how people access and use crypto. Mining with a phone may be the key to broader adoption. Litecoin’s Ten-Year Track Record of Speed & Practicality Litecoin (LTC) was introduced on October 7, 2011, by Charlie Lee, a former engineer at Google. It was designed to be a lighter, faster version of Bitcoin, offering shorter transaction times and a larger supply. The first block was mined shortly after, on October 13, 2011. Since then, Litecoin has remained among the most valued cryptocurrencies by market cap. Take November 2013 as an example—Litecoin’s price doubled in just 24 hours. By early 2020, it crossed a $10 billion market cap, showing a 100% rise since August 2020. On March 24, 2025, Litecoin traded at $93.67 with a market cap of $7.14 billion. Technologically, Litecoin has often led the way. It adopted Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the Lightning Network before Bitcoin. These updates have helped it stay relevant in a fast-moving crypto space. MANTRA’s Quick Rise Through DeFi & Real-World Assets MANTRA (OM) was first developed in late 2019 and officially launched in early 2021 by founders John Patrick Mullin, Will Corkin, and Rodrigo Quan Miranda. It focuses on decentralized finance, offering tools for staking, lending, and governance. Its OM token has a total supply of 888,888,888 units. When OM launched in August 2020, it was priced around $0.3820. The price dipped to $0.0175 by October 2023, but things turned around dramatically. In February 2025, OM reached a record high of $8.53—an increase of over 15,000% in just a year. As of March 26, 2025, OM trades at $6.53 and holds a market cap of $6.44 billion. What’s powering this surge? MANTRA’s work in bringing real-world assets like real estate and clean energy onto the blockchain, along with its generous staking rewards. Its mainnet launch and key alliances have also added fuel to its growing popularity. BlockDAG X1 App Makes Crypto Mining Easier Than Ever BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has shifted the idea of crypto participation. Now, anyone with a smartphone can mine crypto without needing pricey equipment or deep technical knowledge. Over 800,000 users are already mining through the app, transforming ordinary phone users into active members of a global decentralized network. The secret lies in simplicity. The X1 app offers a straightforward setup, an intuitive interface, and real-time mining rewards. Instead of investing time and money into mining rigs, users only need a phone and a few minutes to get started. This easy access has helped fuel the explosive growth of BlockDAG’s presale, which has now raised $209 million. In batch 27, coins are priced at $0.0248—marking a 2,380% jump from batch 1. So far, over 19 billion coins have been sold, showing the strong backing behind the project and its growing community. By combining phone mining with a dual DAG + PoW consensus, BlockDAG has created a system where contributing to the network is both practical and encouraged. It’s not just attracting users—it’s changing how people think about Web3 participation. And it’s gaining traction. Shifting the Crypto Experience Litecoin built a strong foundation. MANTRA introduced real-world utility. But BlockDAG is changing how people get involved with crypto at a basic level. While Litecoin and MANTRA rely on steady communities and focused tools, BlockDAG removes entry barriers and welcomes anyone—no tech background needed. The X1 app allows smartphones to connect directly to a secure, high-speed network. It proves that making crypto easier to access can also drive real growth. As the industry evolves, the platforms that simplify user entry—without cutting corners on performance—won’t just succeed. They’ll shape what comes next.

Aave showcased this early on by launching a DeFi lending platform that users could immediately benefit from, while Cronos strengthened its presence through direct integration with the Crypto.com network. What made both gain traction was delivering functioning platforms from the start. Rather than wait until launch day, BlockDAG (BDAG) is giving the public full access to its Beta Testnet before the mainnet rollout. This move invites users to explore, test, and interact with its system at an early stage. In a market where working models speak louder than forecasts, BlockDAG’s testnet-first method gives people something real to evaluate. Aave: A Pioneer in DeFi Lending Solutions Since its launch in 2020, Aave has introduced a new way for people to lend and borrow digital assets without needing banks or middlemen. Its system allows users to earn from liquidity pools or take out loans directly using crypto assets. Over the years, Aave included features like flash loans, cross-chain support, and flexible collateral swaps, securing its spot as a DeFi leader. By mid-2024, it held over $11 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), showing strong and steady traction. The AAVE token—used in governance and staking—reached almost $400 in early 2025, partially fueled by major backers like World Liberty Financial. On March 26, 2025, AAVE traded at about $188.72, giving it a market cap near $2.85 billion. Those who joined the platform early have gained significantly, showing how Aave has kept pace in the evolving DeFi space. Cronos: Connecting DeFi with Crypto.com Users Launched in November 2021 by Crypto.com, Cronos (CRO) aimed to link centralized finance to decentralized networks. With its fast processing and low transaction fees, Cronos smoothly integrates Crypto.com’s tools with DeFi apps. Because of this, the network quickly rose among the top 10 chains by TVL, with over 1 million users and more than 500 dApps supported by early 2025. On March 26, 2025, CRO was priced around $0.105981, giving it a market valuation close to $2.82 billion. Looking forward, its 2025 forecast ranges from $0.070 to $0.2644, reflecting cautious hope from experts. Returns have been mixed—some gained from high points, while others faced market dips. Still, Cronos remains central to Crypto.com’s bigger aim of combining traditional and decentralized finance. BlockDAG’s Testnet Rollout Builds Real-Time Trust What makes BlockDAG’s testnet strategy different is how it’s focused on showing real results before anything else. While others talk about what’s coming, BlockDAG is already letting people use its features. With twice the speed of the alpha version, a simple no-code tool for creating NFTs and tokens, and working dApps already being tested by users, the Beta Testnet proves the system is fully active. This open testing approach is catching attention. BlockDAG has raised $209 million through its crypto presale , now in batch 27 at a rate of $0.0248. More than 19 billion coins have already been purchased, delivering a 2,380% return since batch 1. These numbers show people aren’t just interested—they’re participating. What also stands out is the weekly testnet BDAG coin vesting, which keeps users engaged and supports system testing under real-use scenarios. This model builds reliability through direct interaction, not just technical claims. Instead of waiting until everything is finished, BlockDAG has chosen to stay open from the start. Letting users explore its inner workings before the mainnet sets a new bar for what future blockchain projects can do to gain early credibility. Wrapping Up! Aave made its mark by providing real services. Cronos gained ground through its tight links with a popular platform. Both delivered usable solutions. BlockDAG is following the same core principle—early access instead of hype. Its public testnet is more than just a feature—it’s a message that showing working results matters more than future talk. Unlike others waiting until launch day, BlockDAG has made its system available for feedback and testing right now. That shows a focus on openness and responsibility—traits that often matter most in building long-term trust in this space.

While $TRUMP briefly surged due to a presidential endorsement, it quickly collapsed. Dragoin, on the other hand, has steadily grown, backed by a well-structured model with real utility, strong community involvement, and an incentivizing presale system. Although $TRUMP saw a temporary spike after Donald Trump called it “The Greatest of Them All,” the coin has since lost more than 75%. Meanwhile, Dragoin ($DDGN) is gaining momentum and is being recognized by many as the true meme coin of 2025. The $TRUMP Coin Saga: A Surge and Sudden Crash On March 22, 2025, Donald Trump’s post on Truth Social calling $TRUMP “The Greatest of Them All” caused the coin to surge by 12%, reaching a price of $5.67. However, the excitement was short-lived. What seemed like a meme coin miracle quickly became a textbook example of a pump-and-dump scheme. Within 48 hours of the endorsement, $TRUMP lost more than 40% of its value, leading to mass sell-offs and panic among investors. By this week, the coin has seen a 75% drop from its peak, leaving many traders holding a token that once seemed like a winning bet. The market cap, which briefly reached eight figures, has since retraced sharply. $TRUMP is now seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of influencer-backed meme coins. The problem with $TRUMP wasn’t the initial surge—it was the lack of any real utility. Meme coins rely on virality, but $TRUMP had no roadmap, no clear purpose, and no intrinsic value. Once the hype faded, investors were left without anything to hold on to. Enter Dragoin. Dragoin’s Success: Building for the Future Where $TRUMP faltered with a burst of hype, Dragoin ($DDGN) is carefully building for long-term success. Dragoin is more than just another meme coin—it’s a fully immersive experience with real-world engagement and rewards. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Dragoin features a play-to-earn game where users can hatch, train, and battle dragons through Telegram. A standout feature of Dragoin is its presale model. Instead of relying on chaotic hype, Dragoin has implemented a structured 25-stage presale. Each stage sees a gradual price increase, rewarding early buyers and ensuring steady price momentum. Half of Dragoin’s total token supply—200 billion tokens—is reserved for the presale, and any unsold tokens are permanently burned. This deflationary model not only prevents inflation but also creates scarcity, benefiting long-term holders. The presale has proven to be a key growth driver. As new buyers enter at different stages, the buzz around Dragoin builds organically. This grassroots momentum is fueling a committed user base that sees the value in the project and is engaged for the long haul, contributing to its ongoing success. Dragoin’s Real-World Utility and Community Focus Dragoin’s true value lies in its utility, which sets it apart from coins like $TRUMP that rely solely on celebrity endorsements. Dragoin offers users real ways to engage and earn rewards. Built on Telegram, the play-to-earn game allows players to hatch, train, and battle dragons, earning $DDGN tokens as they progress. This creates a dynamic ecosystem where users are actively involved, unlike static coins with no practical use. Beyond the game, Dragoin provides staking rewards, airdrops, referral bonuses, and, most importantly, full decentralization. Once launched, the smart contract will be renounced, putting control in the hands of the community rather than a centralized entity. This transparency and community-driven approach are attracting investors who are tired of meme coins that operate behind closed doors with little accountability. Dragoin’s roadmap is clear, with achievable milestones. In Q2 2025, the game will officially launch, accompanied by staking features and partnerships with key crypto influencers. By Q3, Dragoin aims to be listed on exchanges, introduce new gameplay mechanics, and host seasonal events and competitive tournaments to keep users engaged long-term. These aren’t empty promises—they are tangible actions already being executed. Dragoin is focused on long-term growth, not short-lived hype, making it a more sustainable and promising project compared to $TRUMP. Why Dragoin Beats $TRUMP The stark contrast between $TRUMP and Dragoin highlights how the meme coin market has evolved. In the past, coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu relied solely on social momentum. But in 2025, investors are becoming more discerning. After being burned by empty tokens, traders are seeking coins that offer engagement, mechanics, and lasting value. $TRUMP’s 75% drop proves what happens when a meme coin depends entirely on celebrity hype. Dragoin, on the other hand, is showing what happens when a meme coin has a solid foundation, a growing user base, and a clearly defined roadmap. With a deflationary supply, a thriving play-to-earn system, and a roadmap focused on transparency, Dragoin is reshaping the meme coin landscape. It’s proving that meme coins can be both fun and functional, viral and valuable. Most importantly, it’s showing that the title of “The Greatest of Them All” isn’t earned through a tweet—it’s earned through smart planning and real community participation.

A letter sent by the American embassy in Paris and other embassies around the European Union warns that Donald Trump’s order applies to firms outside the United States if they are suppliers or service providers to the federal government. The embassies also included a questionnaire titled “Certification regarding compliance with applicable federal anti-discrimination law.” This questionnaire instructs recipients to confirm they do not operate any programs that promote DEI in ways that violate anti-discrimination statutes. The document states, “Department of State contractors must certify that they do not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable anti-discrimination laws and agree that such certification is material for purposes of the government’s payment decision and therefore subject to the False Claims Act.” According to the same sources, the letter and questionnaire were dispatched by US diplomats in eastern EU states and Belgium. A senior banker in Paris expressed shock when he read the letter, saying, “It’s crazy . . . but everything is now possible. The rule of the strongest now prevails.” Several companies contacted the French finance ministry about the demand, prompting concern within the government. A person close to France’s economy minister Eric Lombard said, “This practice reflects the values of the new US government. They are not the same as ours. The ministry will remind his counterparts in the US government of that.” Les Échos newspaper first reported the letter’s existence. Some executives will not respond to the request Initial legal reviews suggest that the measure may not be legally enforceable outside the United States. Some executives and their legal teams have chosen not to answer the questionnaire for the time being. This strain has intensified as the United States shifts away from long-standing alliances, particularly over Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this week, Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on auto imports into the United States. He also raised tariffs on European steel and aluminum, prompting the EU to explore reciprocal tariffs. Europe has not yet decided which goods to target. Tensions between Washington and the EU escalated after the recent Signal chat leaks. Vice-President JD Vance wrote, “I just hate bailing Europe out again,” to which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth replied, “It’s PATHETIC.” France has historically not accepted DEI programs. That is because national laws restrict how racial and ethnic data can be collected. Employers are forbidden from using a person’s background when making hiring or promotion decisions. According to Les Échos, the US order said, “If you do not agree to sign this document, we would be grateful if you could kindly provide us with detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal department.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The company announced on Friday that it will launch an online claims portal on March 31. This will allow affected investors to file for compensation for the Terra collapse. Notably, the deadline for submission is April 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET, and late claims will not be accepted. Terraform Labs Unveils Eligibility Criteria The claims process is part of Terraform Labs’ bankruptcy plan and will be handled by Kroll, a third-party company. As announced, investors can submit claims through an official website but must prove they own the assets. Notably, the review may take longer if a claim is based on screenshots or manually uploaded documents. Claims could also be denied if the evidence is not strong enough. To qualify for compensation, investors must have owned specific cryptocurrencies from the Terra ecosystem at the time of the collapse. These assets are listed in the official case documents, and only those who meet the requirements will be considered. The payout will not include assets with less than $100 in liquidity and Terra 2.0’s Luna token. What Happens Next? After submission, claims will be reviewed and verified. Initial decisions will be shared within 90 days after the deadline. If a claim is approved, the investor will receive a share of the available funds. The amount must depend on the total number of approved claims and the money left for payouts. However, it is uncertain how much investors will recover or what percentage of their losses will be paid back. A Look Back at the Terra Collapse The Terra ecosystem collapsed in May 2022, wiping billions of investor funds. Luna’s market capitalization fell from $41 billion to $6 million in just three days, marking one of the worst crashes in crypto history. The TerraUSD stablecoin, which was designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar, lost its value and never recovered. The collapse also led to legal troubles for Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon . Kwon faced multiple lawsuits and regulatory investigations across different countries. The Terraform downfall led to many bankruptcies in the crypto sector, affecting companies exposed to Terra’s ecosystem. This claims process may be the last opportunity for investors who suffered losses to recover a portion of their funds.

42607951,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=702497,1743289184,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42607951.jpeg,Trump urges advisers to back universal tariff as trade war escalates,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-pushes-for-universal-tariffs/,"President Donald Trump is doubling down on tariffs, calling on his senior advisers to act more boldly as they make last-minute preparations for April 2, his “Liberation Day.” According to several people familiar with internal White House discussions, Trump wants to impose huge import tariffs that could affect trillions of dollars of international trade. Trump doubles down on tariffs despite warnings from economists and Wall Street Trump consistently disregards economic experts and has ignored pushback from congressional Republicans and Wall Street. He believes that aggressive tariffs are the best way to restore American manufacturing and boost federal coffers. His administration has already imposed tariffs on major industries. The move is a huge escalation of Trump’s under-the-radar trade war, which will likely affect U.S. economic policy for years. Advisers to the president are still deciding the exact nature of the tariffs, weighing their potential economic costs against Trump’s vision of a more self-sufficient American economy. Trump’s campaign to raise tariffs has already shaken financial markets. Earlier this week, his administration declared a 25% tariff on all automobile imports , panicking investors and plunging stock prices. Now, he is considering expanding tariffs similar to those of other parts of the economy, including pharmaceuticals and lumber. The market response has been immediate and negative. The three big U.S. stock indices dropped last Friday, and analysts pointed to the uncertainty of Trump’s widening trade war as a key driving force. Economists have cautioned that these retaliatory tariffs will discourage economic growth, inflate prices, and even lead the country into recession. Even Republican lawmakers traditionally bound by free-market orthodoxy have grown nervous. Stephen Moore, a longtime Trump ally and co-founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, said the emphasis on tariffs was eclipsing debate about tax policy. He said imposing tariffs was not the answer to saving manufacturing jobs. Trump pushes tariffs as a win-win strategy for the U.S Still, Trump remains confident that tariffs will bring economic benefits. He thinks they will compel U.S. trading partners to reduce their tariffs and encourage American firms to repatriate manufacturing. People close to Trump say he regrets listening to advisers who talked him out of higher tariffs during his first term. Now, he is determined to act on those instincts. He has revived the debate over a single, across-the-board import duty that would simplify the tariff system and thwart exemptions that could dilute its power. Tariffs are more than just a negotiating tool for Trump; they are a centrepiece​ of his economic policy. He has openly touted import taxes, which he called the “most beautiful” word in the dictionary. He even called for the declaration of April 2 as a day of national celebration, as he believes tariffs will change the economy. Among those allies was former White House strategist Steve Bannon, who pitched the idea. Rather than celebrating Trump’s birthday, Bannon said April 2 should be made “Liberation Day,” a national day of mourning for the lost jobs, skills, and trade he claimed had returned to America and its people. Trump has not been shy about levying tariffs, a position that has divided Republicans. While many in the party support using tariffs as a short-term negotiating tactic, Trump seems more enthusiastic about permanent trade obstacles that would remap the American economy. Trump’s former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, “Any number of options are still under consideration.” He said officials were looking at every option and working hard to make the idea of a reciprocal tariff popular with the American public and functional. However, some Republican lawmakers are uneasy about the long-term consequences. They worry that permanently adding tariffs could upend supply chains, raise consumer prices, and undermine critical industries that depend on worldwide commerce. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) acknowledged the risks and expressed a sense of unease. But he said that overall, many were still inclined to give the president the benefit of the doubt, given his past accomplishments. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) offered a slightly separate view, saying that he didn’t see tariffs as a means of adding to the bottom line but as a means of returning jobs to the U.S. economy. Tariffs disrupt farming and manufacturing industries The agricultural sector is closely monitoring Trump’s next moves. North Dakota farmers, for instance, were mostly insulated from earlier rounds of tariffs but feared the consequences of any further actions. During Trump’s first term, the administration provided $23 billion to farmers affected by the trade war with China. And some lawmakers have begun consultations with the Department of Agriculture on providing similar aid, should it be necessary. Manufacturers are nervous, too. Some believe tariffs could give them an edge by making foreign competition less affordable. In contrast, others worry they will need to raise prices or lay off workers because of higher import costs. The battle over Trump’s trade policy indicates a deep split in his political base. Some right-of-centre economists claim tariffs can be used to pressure other countries to drop trade barriers. Others have come to see them as a permanent solution sufficient to defend American industry. Nick Iacovella, the Coalition for a Prosperous America vice president, advocates permanent tariffs. He justifies using tariffs as a temporary bargaining chip, which contradicts Trump’s vision of reviving American manufacturing. His group has proposed a broad 18% tariff on virtually all products.

However, unlike the hype-driven tokens of past cycles, the leading meme coins this time around bring much more to the table. These tokens mix community engagement with practical utility, scarcity-driven economics, and well-thought-out long-term plans. Meme coins are no longer just jokes—they’re evolving into substantial ecosystems. Among the meme coins making waves for Q2, Dragoin ($DDGN) stands out. It’s not just another meme token but one of the most polished and well-structured projects in the space. While other contenders are still gaining traction, Dragoin’s presale success, utility, and decentralized framework have already set it apart. For those eyeing the next big thing this quarter, Dragoin is undoubtedly a project to watch, along with a few select others. Dragoin: The Meme Coin Set to Dominate Q2 Dragoin is far from your typical meme token with a cute mascot and a few flashy promises. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Dragoin offers something most meme coins lack—active, hands-on engagement. It features an interactive, play-to-earn game directly on Telegram, where players can hatch, train, and battle dragons, earning $DDGN tokens for in-game activity. This gamified approach sets Dragoin apart, turning passive holders into engaged participants. But the game is just the start. Dragoin’s presale is organized into 25 stages, each with a slightly higher price. This structure not only rewards early investors but generates ongoing momentum as each stage sells out. Of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens, 50% are allocated for the presale, and unsold tokens will be permanently burned, tightening the supply. This deflationary model is crucial. It ensures that supply continues to shrink over time as demand rises, especially when the game goes global in Q2. Unlike many meme coins that flood the market with tokens, Dragoin is deliberately reducing supply while fostering a loyal player base—two key factors that are likely to drive up long-term value. When the presale concludes, Dragoin will renounce ownership of its smart contract, making it a fully decentralized token. This transparency, coupled with the absence of any central authority, ensures there will be no rug pulls—just a community-governed token with a sustainable economy. This level of integrity is rare in the meme coin space and has already garnered attention from seasoned traders who are wary of influencer-led projects that disappear overnight. With staking rewards, referral bonuses, airdrops, and major exchange listings planned for the coming quarters, Dragoin is on track for growth. Its combination of meme appeal, gamified functionality, and strategic tokenomics positions it as a leading contender not just for Q2, but for the entire year. Cheems: Reinventing Its Meme Legacy Cheems has been a fan favorite in the meme coin world for years, thanks to its “doge with a speech impediment” persona. But in Q2 2025, Cheems is trying to evolve. It’s shifting towards more serious initiatives, integrating philanthropy and introducing staking incentives for long-term holders. Cheems is still beloved for its strong community ties. Meme contests, giveaways, and collaborations with creators keep the community active and engaged. However, the heavy reliance on nostalgia could limit its growth potential in a market that’s increasingly focused on utility. While Cheems may still provide short-term profits, its future success will hinge on its ability to innovate beyond its original meme-driven appeal. MEMEX: The Meme Coin ETF MEMEX presents a unique investment opportunity for those looking to diversify their meme coin portfolio. Acting like an ETF for meme coins, MEMEX bundles top-performing tokens into one. This approach removes the guesswork for investors who want exposure to multiple meme coins without tracking each one individually. With automated rebalancing and exposure to trending tokens, MEMEX offers a less risky entry point into the meme coin market. It’s not about betting on a single coin like Dragoin or Cheems, but rather about riding the wave of the broader meme economy. While it may not have the viral potential of standalone meme coins, MEMEX offers a lower-risk alternative for those who want to join the meme coin craze without diving into the complexity of research and tracking. Why Utility-Driven Meme Coins Will Be Winners in Q2 As we move into Q2, the meme coin market is showing a clear shift towards projects that offer more than just fun. With increasing liquidity and a growing number of new crypto users, the demand for meme coins with actual engagement features, community governance, and long-term vision is soaring. Dragoin represents the new breed of meme coins—fun and functional. It’s not just about holding tokens; it’s about playing, earning, and building with the project. From its 25-stage presale to its deflationary mechanics and the upcoming game launch, Dragoin is setting up for a successful Q2. While established names like Cheems and broader options like MEMEX still have their place, Dragoin checks all the boxes for a breakout meme coin this quarter. As more investors shift towards tokens with substance, Dragoin’s chances of becoming one of 2025’s biggest meme phenomena grow stronger every day.

XRP’s dynamic liquidity, strategic market positioning, and high-speed transactions have long made it a powerhouse in digital finance. This latest insight underscores the vast potential within the XRP ecosystem, reinforcing its appeal to forward-thinking investors. With the crypto founder’s revelations, XRP is again at the forefront of high-stakes financial maneuvers. Unveiling The $44,000 To $5.5 Million XRP Investment Strategy ​In a notable development within the cryptocurrency community, a crypto founder, Edward Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, has articulated a compelling vision for XRP’s future valuation. XRP, known for its rapid transaction speeds and scalability, has been a focal point in the digital currency landscape. The crypto founder believes that with the right strategy and timing, a $44,000 investment in XRP could grow into a $5.5 million fortune. According to his calculations, buying XRP at $2.40 now could turn into $5.4 million once the token reaches $300. Farina has always believed that the price of XRP is poised to make grown men cry for the rest of their years, urging individuals to position themselves among those who will celebrate rather than regret. In addition, Amonyx, a social media influencer from X, reveals data citing that investors are buying XRP tokens in massive quantities, further solidifying the crypto founder’s claims. With the crypto founder’s projections of a $44,000 investment skyrocketing to $5.5 million, the excitement surrounding XRP’s potential continues to build. Bridging Traditional Finance And Blockchain Innovation With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Presale While XRP’s momentum buzzes, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is gaining a firm hold on the market with its innovations.

He also believes the crypto community should prioritize open-source funding instead, as public goods funding is still subject to social desirability bias. Meanwhile, his Ethereum network will need to increase its data capacity to accommodate an L2 model release. The network, though, does have an upgrade in the works. Pectra, possibly launching by April 30, could raise blob space to up to 6 units. Moreover, by the end of the year, the network plans to have 72 units through the Fusaka upgrade as well or, at least, bulk up to 12-24 units. Ethereum L2 model will use optimistic, zero-knowledge and trusted execution environment proof types Buterin’s L2 proposal will feature a system with a 2/3 multi-signature mechanism, utilizing optimistic, zero-knowledge (ZK), and trusted execution environment (TEE) proofs. That implies that before any transaction is finalized, it has to pass through ZK and TEE validations. Then, a seven-day optimistic challenge period is provided if the transaction does not meet the former checks’ criteria. Additionally, the system can be upgraded to proof logic, but there will be a 30-day delay per network policy. Generally, the L2 model will maintain properties such as decentralization and trust minimization but improve in terms of speed and network security. However, Buterin cautioned that using common code across ZK rollups might allow bugs to spread between them, increasing the overall risk. Wei Dai, a research partner at 1kxnetwork, detailed, “This means that the finality of rollups can be as fast as zk proving (~ Buterin has encouraged people to take on open-source funding instead of public goods funding Buterin also called for the change to open-source funding from public goods funding. He argued that the term “public good” can be “stretched so easily.” Buterin explained that the word “public good” is often used to describe a ‘good that comes from the government’ and not exactly something great in an economic sense, so the name may create a false perception. He added that people already perceive public good funding as lacking rigour and being cultivated on the basis of social desirability. He insisted that contrary to public goods funding, open-source funding is more transparent and could drive collaboration. He, however, cautioned against taking on any other open-source project, asking people only to support those that add value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Qubetics Is Climbing Fast as Ethereum and Arweave Gain New Ground,https://thecoinrise.com/best-cryptos-with-1000x-potential-right-now-qubetics-is-climbing-fast-as-ethereum-and-arweave-gain-new-ground/,"What if the next crypto that could change your entire financial future isn’t Bitcoin or Ethereum—but something flying under the radar with insane growth potential? Yeah, we’re talkin’ about the kind of plays that early buyers brag about for years. Right now, the crypto space is bubbling with innovation, and two names that keep popping up are Arweave and Ethereum. They’ve both been making waves with their recent updates and tech-forward moves. But there’s a fresh contender stepping into the ring—and it’s not just hyped, it’s solving real-world headaches that these giants couldn’t. Say hello to Qubetics ($TICS)—a beast of a project that’s not here to play around. It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator that brings together major blockchains under one roof, giving users and businesses total freedom without locking them into any one chain. Plus, the Qubetics presale is absolutely exploding right now, with over $15.5 million already raised. And the buzz? It’s not just hype—it’s backed by features, real functionality, and seriously attractive price entry points that make this one of the best cryptos with 1000x potential. If you’ve been watching for the best crypto presale of the year, this might just be it. Qubetics’ Game-Changing Wallet: A Web3 Superpower in Your Pocket So here’s the thing—Web3 sounds cool, but let’s be real: most people still find it confusing, clunky, and full of annoying trade-offs. Qubetics doesn’t just recognize that—it fixes it. Their flagship product? A non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that finally brings everything under one roof. It’s like having Apple Pay, MetaMask, and PayPal all rolled into one—but with the power of blockchain behind it. For an average user, think about being able to swap between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and other blockchains seamlessly—no jumping through hoops, no bridges, no headaches. Everything just works. A college student can use it to pay for their Spotify subscription with $TICS or crypto-backed Visa, while a freelancer can invoice global clients in stablecoins directly from the wallet. Total freedom, total control. Now, imagine a mid-sized eCommerce business trying to accept crypto from customers worldwide. Normally, this would be a nightmare—so many chains, different wallets, compatibility issues. But with Qubetics, they can integrate a single wallet that automatically routes and converts crypto across chains, all while ensuring the customer experience stays buttery smooth. And there’s more—Qubetics has also integrated virtual card functionality. Yup, users can mint a virtual debit card linked to their crypto wallet and use it for real-world purchases just like any Visa card. Everything is on-chain, traceable, and secure. That’s the kind of leap Web3 needed. No more disconnected tools or sketchy third-party platforms. So whether you’re a small biz owner, a full-time crypto trader, or someone who just wants to buy coffee with crypto, Qubetics gives you that flexibility with no compromises. It’s no wonder this project is now being listed among the best cryptos with 1000x potential . Massive ROI Projections from Qubetics Presale Prove Why It’s One of the Best Cryptos with 1000x Potential Let’s get real—everyone wants to know the numbers. And the numbers behind the Qubetics presale? Straight-up insane. Right now, the presale is in its 27th stage, with the token priced at $0.1300. Each stage lasts exactly 7 days and ends at midnight every Sunday, with the price increasing by 10% like clockwork. So yeah, time really is money here. So far, Qubetics has raised over $15.5 million, attracted more than 23,900 holders, and sold 504 million tokens. That’s a serious flex. Now here’s where things get juicy: if you jump in now at $0.1300, here’s what the projected ROI looks like based on where $TICS could go: At $1 post-presale = 669.13% ROI At $5 = 3,745.67% ROI At $6 = 4,514.80% ROI At $10 = 7,591.33% ROI At $15 = 11,437% ROI Let’s break it down: say someone throws in just $1,000 at the current price. If $TICS hits $10, they’re walking away with $76,900. If it touches $15? That’s a clean $115,350. Now compare that to most coins that barely double in price during their presale. This is why Qubetics isn’t just part of the conversation—it is the conversation when people are talking about the best cryptos with 1000x potential. With the Qubetics presale gaining serious traction, this might just be the best crypto presale of 2025. No fluff, no hype—just raw potential backed by utility, tech, and smart economics. Arweave’s Storage Revolution: Data That Lives Forever Let’s talk about Arweave. This one’s been quietly cooking something powerful. Arweave isn’t just a blockchain—it’s permanent data storage on-chain. You upload something once, and it’s there forever. This isn’t just cool for personal files or NFTs—it’s huge for journalism, scientific records, or entire web apps. The real kicker? Arweave recently stepped up their game by optimizing storage costs through a protocol-level upgrade, letting users store more data for way less. Add that to increased adoption through integrations with projects like Bundlr and Kyve, and it’s easy to see why people are getting hyped again. What separates Arweave is its true “set it and forget it” model. You pay once, store forever—no monthly fees, no hosting risks. Developers love it because it’s reliable and censorship-resistant. Think about entire decentralized websites or DeFi dashboards that can live on-chain without needing traditional web servers. While it’s not built for payments or finance like Ethereum or Qubetics, it still lands high on the list of best cryptos with 1000x potential because it’s filling a unique niche—and doing it well. Data is the new gold, and Arweave is building the vault. Ethereum’s Smart Contract Empire Keeps Evolving Ethereum doesn’t need an intro—it’s the OG smart contract platform. But just because it’s a household name doesn’t mean it’s sitting still. Recently, Ethereum devs rolled out updates focused on scaling and slashing gas fees, especially with Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum booming. Plus, the ecosystem is expanding fast. New dApps, DeFi tools, NFT platforms—you name it, it’s happening on Ethereum first. And with the upcoming “Proto-Danksharding” features on the horizon, scalability is only going to get better. The focus is on speed, efficiency, and sustainability. What really gives Ethereum lasting power is the community. It’s massive, always building, and always testing the limits of what’s possible in Web3. From DAOs to decentralized ID systems, Ethereum is the engine behind a huge chunk of the decentralized internet. Is it still one of the best cryptos with 1000x potential? Maybe not at its current size—but that doesn’t mean it won’t 5x or 10x again, especially with global adoption heating up. Ethereum might not be the wildest bet on the board, but it’s one of the most secure. Conclusion: These Are the Coins to Watch—But One Stands Out In a sea of crypto projects, only a few really have the juice to go 1000x—and Qubetics, Arweave, and Ethereum are all bringing serious value to the table. Ethereum continues to lead with its DeFi and smart contract dominance. Arweave is carving out a niche as the go-to for permanent data storage, locking in its spot for long-term relevance. But Qubetics? That’s the dark horse turning heads fast. With a real working product, exploding presale, and powerful utility that bridges multiple blockchains into one seamless ecosystem, Qubetics is clearly positioning itself as one of the best cryptos with 1000x potential. And with time-sensitive presale stages, there’s real urgency for community members to join this crypto presale while it’s still under the radar. This isn’t about hype—it’s about getting in early on something that’s got legs, brains, and serious traction.

The Nasdaq Stock Market submitted a proposal this week to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list and trade shares of Grayscale Avalanche Trust, which would be entirely tied to the price of the layer-1 project’s native asset, AVAX. Grayscale isn’t the first financial giant to file for an Avalanche ETF. Documents submitted to the state of Delaware earlier this month suggest VanEck also hopes to launch a fund tied to the Ethereum ( ETH ) rival. Coinbase Custody will serve as the custodian for Grayscale’s Avalanche ETF if it’s approved. The crypto asset manager also hopes to launch funds tied to Cardano ( ADA ), Solana ( SOL ), XRP and Hedera ( HBAR ). The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ETFs for trading last July. Two financial firms, Franklin Templeton and Hashdex, also launched joint BTC-ETH ETFs earlier this year. AVAX is trading at $20.36 at time of writing. The 17th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 8% in the past 24 hours.

Over 110,000 verified investors—plus waves of developers and miners—are getting early access to what’s being called one of the most community-powered testnets ever launched. While others test in silence, BlockDAG is running a full-scale simulation of what’s coming in 2025. And with $209 million raised in under 10 months, this isn’t just a test—it’s a statement. This isn’t your average trial run. BlockDAG is turning its testnet into an experience, rewarding its early community with a $60,000 giveaway in real BDAG tokens for stress-testing the network before the big mainnet debut. 110,000 Wallets Are Already Live and Testing the Network BlockDAG’s testnet is anything but small-scale. Already, more than 110,000 wallets—straight from its presale community—have been activated. Every one of them gets 10,000 testnet BDAG tokens, automatically dropped through a smart contract that mirrors mainnet’s real vesting engine. CEO Antony Turner didn’t hold back at Keynote 3: “Today marks another significant milestone. We’re excited to announce the official launch of our first Beta Testnet.” This isn’t a dry dev preview. It’s a full-blown blockchain rehearsal—with mining, token creation, wallet activity, and smart contract deployment all live. The setup includes a powerful Beta Explorer, a no-code Token and NFT Wizard, and a fully integrated IDE—giving developers and users everything they need to build, test, and interact in real-time. $60K in Rewards Up for Grabs—Let the Race Begin BlockDAG doesn’t do boring things. That’s why it’s handing out $60,000 in BDAG tokens (based on the $0.05 launch price) to its top testnet contributors. Running until May 31, 2025, the campaign rewards users who go the extra mile. The prize structure includes: Top 10 wallets by transaction volume Top 10 mining nodes by testnet BDAG mined Top 10 wallet holders with the biggest balances Each winner snags $2,000 in real BDAG—not placeholders. Turner nailed it during the keynote: “We’re even going to incentivize you to get involved.” This isn’t fluff—it’s a stress test with real stakes. The setup pushes the smart contracts, vesting mechanics, and infrastructure to perform under pressure. Mainnet Is Coming Fast—And This Testnet Is Paving the Way While the Beta Testnet is already turning heads, it’s just the warm-up act. BlockDAG is preparing for a full mainnet rollout in 2025, and it’s aiming high: 2,000 TPS at launch with scalability to 15,000 TPS within two years. Developers are already building, thanks to the testnet’s no-code wizard, EVM compatibility, and a clean documentation portal. What’s more, this testnet forms the backbone of the DeFi tools BlockDAG plans to release—staking, lending, governance, and cross-chain bridges are all in the pipeline. Turner summed it up best during Keynote 3: “We’re orchestrating every element — from our underlying blockchain to supporting tools like our explorer, integrated development environments, indexers, and oracles — to work seamlessly as one trustless, decentralized network.” Why BlockDAG’s Testnet Isn’t Like the Others BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet isn’t just about checking boxes. Every user is helping build the future. By offering real tokens, live features, and raw on-chain pressure, BlockDAG has ditched the low-energy testnet playbook. With 110,000+ wallets already engaged, hundreds of miners running, and devs actively deploying, the hype isn’t artificial—it’s earned. BlockDAG is proving that its tech, people, and infrastructure can take the heat of a real-world launch. As Turner closed Keynote 3: “This isn’t just a test — it’s the first real step towards our fully operational decentralized ecosystem.” Presale: https://purchase.blockdag.network Website: https://blockdag.network Telegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial Discord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu The post BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet Just Went Public — 110K Users, Real Rewards And An Upcoming Mainnet appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Token Presale and ICO Insights|BlockDAG,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-03-30 00:00:30

Speculation about who might be next is growing as the cryptocurrency community is divided over Trump’s pardons. Names like Roger Ver, SBF, and CZ are dividing the prediction markets. Trump’s pardoning spree has led to heightened discussions within cryptocurrency circles with Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction platform, hosting bets on who might be next. Trump pardons cryptocurrency tycoons who had prior criminal convictions The cryptocurrency community on the Polymarket market, where voters can wager on potential future occurrences of real-life events, is divided among competitors. The “Who Will Trump Pardon in the First 100 Days?” event has seen notable names emerge, including Roger Ver, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Currently, the odds of SBF being pardoned stand at just 3%, while Roger Ver, a cryptocurrency tycoon who says he was the first investor in Bitcoin, has 4% of the vote. Ver, accused of avoiding $50 million in taxes, claimed that on March 2, he was politically targeted for spreading cryptocurrency. Changpeng Zhao, well known as CZ, Binance’s co-founder and former CEO, has about 8% of the votes in the polymarket on the chance to obtain Trump’s pardon. In April 2024, CZ was sentenced to four months imprisonment after pleading guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws. CZ was accused of violating companies’ rules to establish an appropriate anti-money laundering program, which allowed Binance to handle transactions involving the proceeds of illegal activity. On March 27, Trump pardoned three co-founders of the global cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, Samuel Reed, Benjamin Delo, and Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX. This was after they acknowledged in court that they had violated the Bank Secrecy Act more than three months ago. According to the charges, they allowed their business to operate without oversight and failed to establish know-your-customer and anti-money laundering procedures. In addition, apart from three co-founders of BitMEX, on January 21, President Donald Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who the FBI took into custody and seized his laptop on October 1, 2013, one day after becoming the 47th President of the U.S. It was shortly after, in 2015, a judge found him guilty of money laundering, computer hacking, and drug trafficking on the dark web site The Silk Road and sentenced him to life in prison. SBF makes last-ditch effort to secure a Trump pardon for FTX fraud Following his conviction for fraud related to the collapse of FTX, SBF’s family and supporters initially sought to prevent his sentencing. However, after receiving a 25-year prison term, Bankman-Fried has reportedly shifted strategies and is now pursuing a presidential pardon. According to reports, Bankman-Fried consulted a lawyer with ties to the president in addition to Carlson, who is close to Trump. A crypto lobbyist, who spoke while keeping the identity concealed because they were not permitted to comment publicly, responded, “zero,” when asked about the likelihood that Bankman-Fried’s efforts would succeed. On the other hand, several cryptocurrency lobbyists say that due to Trump’s growing connections to the crypto sector and his readiness to freely exercise his pardoning authority, there is still a chance that Bankman-Fried’s plan to get Trump to pardon him will succeed. Trump’s latest moves, including his pardon of Ulbricht and support for cryptocurrency initiatives during his campaign, have reinforced speculation that further crypto-related clemencies could be on the horizon.

XRP struggles above $2.60 while Solana drifts around $145, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes rapid ground during presale, quietly raking in early investors eyeing up possible 34x on return. Now in presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4, having raised $5.7 million so far and with over 7,400 holders in total to date, able buy token at a price of $0.025. The next phase will see a 20% escalation in price to $0.03 — essentially meaning anyone who buys in these early rounds will inevitably have a guaranteed instant profit 140%+ before any listings even occur. Ripple (XRP): Legal Clarity Fails to Maintain Momentum A surge of activity followed on March 19, with the number of active addresses hitting a peak at 626,854 after a recent court ruling spurred good news for XRP in an ongoing legal engagement with the SEC. Interest soon faded, however and active addresses fell to 50,000 by March 23. Significantly, whale transactions languished and veteran investors on the day also showed signs of hesitance. XRP resistance: Medium resistance around 2.60 with current price at 2.4387, momentum is weakly bullish with an RSI at 54.71. If demand does not increase, XRP’s support zone near $2.20-$2.30 may be retested. Solana (SOL): High and Dry Solana was bullish over the past week, rising 15% to $145.11. According to the Binance Futures data, there still is a strong bullish bias, where 78.82% of the traders are holding long positions. However, with the RSI at 69.73, SOL is nearing overbought territory, with further upside muted to a clear break over $150. While Solana is a solid choice, its growth prospects pale in comparison to the explosive growth potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in the short term. Mutuum Finance: The Best Presale With Eyes On Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just any token — that’s a structured DeFi lending platform with real utility, generating constant demand in the presale behind it. With the Phase 4 price of $0.025 versus the confirmed listing price of $0.06, that’s a 140% gain at launch, so you’re getting a bargain. That said analysts believe that post launch targets can be between $1-$5 for its token which would give potential returns of 90x upwards to 100x for those who got it early. The next phase carries a serious 20% hike. Those who do buy in now will see their holdings immediately reflect this increase in valuation once Phase 5 goes live. A Certik audit is underway on top of this; results expected to be published shortly, with increasing trust in the suction of the project’s security. While XRP and Solana tread lightly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are running a marathon with a freeway of exponential gains. Given that the audit is comprehensive and listing on exchanges is imminent, price propagation of MUTM may follow a well-known path in DeFi — meaning early action needed. While XRP hovers at $2.60 and Solana nears $145, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) races ahead in presale. Phase 4 tokens are priced at $0.025, set to rise to $0.03 in the next round, offering a 140% profit before listing at $0.06. Analysts predict post-launch targets between $1-$5, with potential 34x returns. A Certik audit adds security, fueling investor confidence. As XRP and SOL slow down, MUTM’s rapid growth offers a prime opportunity before prices surge again.

Meme Index and Pi Network are both making headlines: one for its curated exposure to meme coins, the other for the uncertainty around massive token unlocks. Each brings something different to the table, but their paths highlight a common investor dilemma—speculation versus structure. Dragoin ($DDGN) , by contrast, positions itself as a more grounded alternative. With a transparent 25-stage presale, real use cases through gaming, and a community-first model, it’s not just another meme coin—it’s one that gives affordable crypto investing a more purposeful direction. Meme Index Presale Nears Completion After Raising Over $4 Million Meme Index ($MEMEX) is approaching the final days of its presale, having successfully raised over $4 million. Meanwhile, this initiative offers investors a structured approach to the meme coin market by providing access to four distinct “baskets” of meme coins, each tailored to different risk preferences. Specifically, these baskets range from the Meme Titan Index, featuring established tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, to the Meme Frenzy Index, which includes newer, high-volatility tokens. Furthermore, by staking MEMEX tokens, investors can gain diversified exposure across these curated selections, aiming to mitigate the inherent volatility of individual meme coins. With that in mind, the presale price is set at $0.0166883, and only a few days remain before MEMEX debuts on exchanges. Thus, this represents a timely opportunity for those seeking diversified exposure in the meme coin sector. Pi Network Faces Price Pressure Amid Token Unlocks Pi Network’s token price has recently dipped below $0.80, marking a 3% decline in the past 24 hours, while trading volume surged by 33% to $327 million. Notably, this downturn coincides with the scheduled release of over 105.96 million Pi tokens (approximately $85 million) into circulation within the next month, averaging about 3.5 million tokens daily. Looking ahead, the outlook remains uncertain as an additional 1.6 billion Pi tokens are set to be unlocked over the coming year, introducing roughly 129 million tokens monthly until May 2028. As a result, analysts express concern that this influx could drive prices down to $0.60. On the other hand, some experts view the current dip as a potential buying opportunity, citing technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index and Fibonacci support levels that suggest a possible rebound. Ultimately, the trajectory of Pi Network’s price will largely depend on the market’s ability to absorb the increased supply and the implementation of strategies to stabilize token circulation. Dragoin Is Perfect for First-Time Crypto Investors Getting started in crypto doesn’t have to mean risking large amounts or diving into complex platforms. In fact, Dragoin ($DDGN) is offering a simple, accessible starting point that’s especially appealing to new or cautious investors. With a current presale price of just $0.0000292, Dragoin presents a low-barrier entry into a project built around real utility, community engagement, and entertainment. To put things in perspective, compare that to its upcoming launch price of $0.002, and early buyers are looking at a potential ROI of over 6700%. Importantly, this isn’t about chasing hype—it’s about seizing a well-structured opportunity early. Dragoin combines meme culture with a rewarding play-to-earn Telegram game and a roadmap full of value-driven milestones. Moreover, with the project still in Stage 1 of its 25-stage presale, this is the ground floor. What’s more, what makes Dragoin stand out isn’t just the price—it’s the purpose behind it. Every stage of the presale is designed to reward early participants with better pricing and exclusive benefits. So, for those who missed early chances on other coins, Dragoin offers a fresh start—with far more upside than risk. All things considered, whether you’re dipping your toes into crypto for the first time or just looking for your next smart move, Dragoin delivers an easy on-ramp with strong growth potential. It’s not just affordable—it’s strategic. Smart Entry Points Matter—And Dragoin Might Just Be One Chasing trends without clear fundamentals can be risky—especially in early-stage crypto projects. Meme Index offers a structured but narrowly focused approach, while Pi Network faces looming supply pressure that could undercut short-term gains. Dragoin, however, strikes a better balance. It keeps entry affordable, outlines a clear roadmap, and integrates real engagement through its play-to-earn model. For new investors looking for a calculated entry point with long-term upside, Dragoin stands out not by hype, but by design. Sometimes, the smarter move isn’t the loudest one—it’s the one that makes the most sense when you step back.

Outside of the technicals, one expert is pinning the blame on Ethereum’s failure to lead and innovate in the Web 3 space. Ethereum Price Continues Its Steep Decline According to CoinMarketCap data , technicals for Ethereum’s price are grim, with the second-largest cryptocurrency slipping below $1,900. At press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,828 and shows no signs of reversing the grim trend. A look at Ethereum’s chart does not indicate any signs of an uptrend or a short bounce to stoke embers of optimism. According to pseudonymous analyst Gum, Ethereum signals “relentless downward price action” that could see the asset fall below $1,800. Over the last day, Ethereum has fallen by nearly 4% while its seven-day chart indicates a decline of nearly 8%. The decline of Ethereum price follows a broader market correction with the global crypto market capitalization losing nearly 3% of its valuation. On the fundamentals side, things are equally grim for the Ethereum price. Unconfirmed reports of a potential Binance delisting ETH threaten to send Ethereum price to $1,500. Standard Chartered has slashed its ETH prediction for 2025 by 60%, projecting $4,000 as a potential price point by the end of the year. Expert Says Network Has Itself To Blame Ryan Watkins, co-founder at Syncracy Capital has taken swipes at Ethereum over its failure to keep pace with its peers. Watkins notes that a failure to capitalize on previous momentum during the last two market cycles is haunting Ethereum’s price. Ethereum has fallen down the pecking order to new blockchains with Solana and Bitcoin tipped to have the upper hand over the network. An inflow of bridged funds from Ethereum to Solana is accentuating the network’s worrying metrics. “No one wants to own a growth stage product that’s falling behind technologically superior competitors and bleeding market share,” said Watkins. Watkins says the only for Ethereum to pull itself from the rut is to “deliver generational leadership and growth.” However, with the Pectra upgrade around the corner, enthusiasts are optimistic that Ethereum can reach $10,000. Hardcore community members are poking holes in Solana’s rise, attributing it a memecoin craze compared to Ethereum’s neck-deep foray into decentralized finance (DeFi).

42613531,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=702507,1743297255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42613531.jpeg,Trump doesn’t care about higher auto prices and won’t fire anyone over Signal leaks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-doesnt-care-higher-auto-prices/,"President Donald Trump told NBC News on Saturday that he has no intention of firing anyone involved in Signal leaks, and he also declared he “couldn’t care less” if foreign car manufacturers raise prices in response to new U.S. tariffs. Speaking by phone from Florida, Trump insisted that he remains confident in the advisers who took part in the chat and argued that higher prices for imported automobiles would only help American automakers. In the interview , which touched on trade, national security, and his aspirations to take over Greenland, Trump insisted he is staying the course on his policy decisions. Trump said he sees no reason to let go of any officials linked to the Signal incident . He added that his administration carried out what he described as a “tremendously successful” strike against Houthi militants earlier in March and that the media should focus on that result rather than any mishaps in communication. “I don’t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” Trump said, adding, “We had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to talk about is nonsense. It’s fake news.” Trump discussing Signal chat leak in a meeting with ambassadors. Source: WFFA Trump also underscored his continued confidence in Waltz and Hegseth, saying, “I do,” when asked if he still has faith in them. “I have no idea what Signal is. I don’t care what Signal is. It’s the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about,” he added. Trump can’t care less about imported car prices going up When the discussion turned to trade, Trump spoke at length about his recent decision to impose 25% tariffs on all foreign-made automobiles. He repeatedly stated that he “couldn’t care less” if car prices for foreign models go up, since, from his perspective, that would only drive more American consumers to buy vehicles made in the United States. He added, “I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars.” Asked if he had warned motor industry executives against increasing prices, the president insisted he did no such thing and said that any company wanting to avoid tariffs should build cars in the United States. “The message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you’re going to make a lot of money. If you don’t, you’re going to have to probably come to the United States,” he stated. The president then confirmed that foreign auto parts will also face a 25% duty even if those parts go into vehicles assembled domestically, with certain exceptions tied to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). According to the White House, those USMCA-compliant components will remain tariff-free until the government establishes a process for imposing the new tax. However, Trump noted that the tariffs themselves are permanent. “Absolutely, they’re permanent, sure. The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we’re doing is being fair, and frankly, I’m being very generous,” he said. Trump’s new tariffs were announced on Wednesday, just weeks before his planned April 2 “ Liberation Day .” On that date, a separate set of tariffs on a range of consumer goods is scheduled to take effect. Several international leaders, such as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, quickly criticized the move. Carney argued that these tariffs were “unjustified” and signaled “the old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over.” Even so, Trump maintained that he does not plan to postpone the April 2 tariffs. When asked if he was open to negotiating, he said, “Only if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there’s no room for negotiation.” His stance on trade has contributed to uncertainty in global financial markets , and he has been accused by some experts of creating volatility on Wall Street. However, Trump dismissed these concerns. He pointed to polling numbers indicating that more Americans feel the country is on the right track than at almost any point in recent decades. “What I see is right track, wrong track. And the right track was the first time in like, 40 years where it was right track,” Trump remarked. Trump is serious about taking over Greenland Another topic raised was Trump’s ongoing pursuit of Greenland , a semi-autonomous territory governed by Denmark. While many observers have regarded the idea of buying Greenland as improbable, Trump insisted he is serious. “We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,” he said. “I don’t take anything off the table,” he continued, mentioning that he sees a “good possibility” the United States can do it without a military approach. JD Vance during a visit to Greenland earlier this week. Source: Sky News Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland on Friday with his wife, Usha. Trump referred to that visit and said he was not especially concerned about how Russia or other nations might perceive an American attempt to acquire the territory. “I don’t really think about that. I don’t really care,” he said. “Greenland’s a very separate subject, very different. It’s international peace. It’s international security and strength.” Trump maintained that the region’s geographic importance could justify American control, warning of ships from Russia, China, and other countries sailing near Greenland. “We’re not going to allow things to happen that are going to hurt the world or the United States,” he said, describing his position as a necessary measure of defense. What’s the takeaway? Throughout Saturday’s conversation, Trump showed no sign of scaling back his recent plans. According to the president, his decisions will strengthen America’s economic base and national security. He accused other nations of exploiting the United States for decades and insisted his administration would continue to put American interests first. “Countries have been taking advantage of us for so many years,” Trump said, underscoring that he believes higher tariffs will encourage companies to produce goods domestically. The president also brushed off the risk of higher consumer costs , economic wars, or strained alliances. Instead, he concluded by saying he has every intention of pressing forward. “People said we couldn’t do many things that we’ve done, and now they’re happening,” Trump said. “It’s been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

While top meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way, a new generation of crypto projects is pushing boundaries with smarter tokenomics, intense community hype, and early-entry rewards. Pepe Coin just bounced back with bullish momentum, and Ponke’s recent listings are generating serious buzz—but neither comes close to what’s unfolding with Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) . Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is capturing massive attention as it moves through an unconventional, location-based presale—now in its 16th phase called Crystal Cove. With weekly token burns, staking rewards, and massive referral incentives, APC is giving early investors not just meme magic but strategic advantages. This article will dive into the latest updates from Arctic Pablo Coin, Pepe Coin, and Ponke—and reveal why Arctic Pablo might just be the Top New Meme Coin to Invest in Now. Token Burn Strategy Heats Up Investor Demand | Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now Arctic Pablo Coin’s explosive appeal begins with one word: scarcity. Through a powerful weekly burn mechanism, unsold tokens are permanently removed during the presale—tightening supply and increasing potential value for holders. Once the presale wraps up, any leftover tokens will also be torched, amplifying APC’s deflationary framework. This strategic burn isn’t just a gimmick—it’s all on-chain, with every token elimination recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for maximum transparency. Arctic Pablo Coin’s commitment to reducing supply positions it among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, giving early adopters a rare opportunity to secure a token designed for longevity. But that’s not all—staking rewards during the presale are boasting an eye-catching 66% APY. Holders can lock up their tokens, watch them grow, and even earn rewards through Arctic Pablo’s community competitions and referral incentives. Whether participating in fun challenges or inviting friends, APC holders are rewarded with real crypto gains. These features make Arctic Pablo Coin far more than just a meme—it’s a movement with momentum. Crystal Cove Is Live—$0.000083 Entry Price Could Be Gone Tomorrow | Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now The current meme coin presale phase, dubbed ” Crystal Cove ” is igniting. The token’s unique no-stage presale model, driven by the character’s travels across iconic locations, means each new stop tightens the window for low entry. Crystal Cove is already generating buzz, and as the token inches closer to its next phase, urgency is peaking. With the price set to rise again soon, APC is commanding serious attention as one of the Top New Meme Coins to invest in now. Don’t be late to the Arctic Pablo party—the presale stage is vanishing fast. Crystal Cove marks the 16th destination in Arctic Pablo Coin’s global journey—and it’s shaping up to be the most pivotal yet. With each new location, APC’s price climbs, and now it’s available for just $0.000083. That’s right: over 9552.41% ROI separates this current price from the expected listing price of $0.008. Arctic Pablo has already raised more than $2 million in its presale, and Crystal Cove could close any moment. Pepe Coin Surges Again as Whale Activity Spikes Pepe Coin has reawakened the crypto scene with a strong surge in trading volume driven by sudden whale activity and renewed retail interest. Over the past week, PEPE climbed over 20% as rumors swirled about an upcoming burn or partnership announcement. Community sentiment is soaring as social media trends spotlight the coin’s comeback narrative. While Pepe still faces volatility, its momentum suggests it’s not ready to bow out of the meme coin spotlight just yet. Ponke Climbs After New Exchange Listings Boost Visibility Ponke is rallying after securing fresh exchange listings, including a mid-tier CEX that pushed its visibility to new heights. The increased accessibility has injected strong liquidity into the project, driving daily trade volumes upward. Ponke’s quirky branding and grassroots community continue to appeal to meme coin fans, and its latest roadmap teaser hints at future NFT integrations. With bullish sentiment building, Ponke is making a strong case for itself in the meme coin arena. Final thoughts Pepe Coin’s return, Ponke’s expansion, and Arctic Pablo Coin ’s bold presale all highlight just how vibrant the meme coin market is in 2025. Each project brings something exciting to the table—but Arctic Pablo Coin is the one turning heads with its creative presale mechanics, aggressive token burns, and game-changing potential ROI. The Crystal Cove phase is live, the clock is ticking, and the price is still just $0.000083. For those hunting the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, Arctic Pablo Coin might just be the golden ticket—available today, but not for long.

IntoTheBlock data shows DOGE, Chainlink, and AVAX exhibited high correlation to BTC price action in the last 30 days. Could these tokens be among the top cryptocurrencies to sell if BTC plunges below the $80,000 mark? Bitcoin Price Tumbles Below $82,000 as Trump’s SEC Chair Nominee Faces Scrutiny Bitcoin (BTC) market sell-off continued on Saturday, as it closed the week with three consecutive days in losses. After a positive start to the week, Trump’s tariffs and controversy surrounding the approval of SEC-chair nominee Paul Atkins sent bearish tailwinds across Bitcoin markets over the last three days. Last Thursday, members of the US Congress raised issues related to “conflict of interests” as Paul Atkins’ confirmation hearing began. Concerns that a less crypto-friendly SEC chair could replace Atkins further accelerating sell-offs across the global cryptocurrency markets, as evidenced by the Bitcoin price 5.7% decline observed since Friday. Bitcoin price analysis | March 30 2025 As seen above, BTC price plunged as low as $81,645 on Saturday, before bulls battled back to reclaim the $82,500 level at press time. However, rising trading volume bars accompanying the downward price action over the last three days suggest bulls will require a strong catalyst to generate sufficient momentum for a major rebound. Chainlink, DOGE, and Avalanche at Risk – Cryptocurrencies to Sell if BTC Drops Below $80,000 Bitcoin price plunged 5.73% lower than the weekly $87,500 local top recorded on Friday. As prices dropped toward $81,200 on Saturday, bulls stepped in to avert cascading leverage liquidations looming at the $80,000 psychological support level. However, BTC traders were not the only ones relieved to see prices back above $82,500. According to on-chain data culled from IntoTheBlock , DOGE, Chainlink, and AVAX exhibited high correlation to BTC price action in the last 30 days. Bitcoin price correlation Matrix (DOGE, LINK, AVAX) | Source: IntoTheBlock This shows that these assets have often moved in the same direction as BTC. The correlation matrix highlights a strong relationship between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ) over the past 30 days. Specifically, LINK (0.93), DOGE (0.80), and AVAX (0.79) exhibit high positive correlations with BTC, meaning their price movements largely mirror Bitcoin’s trajectory. If BTC plunges below $80,000, these altcoins could experience intensified sell-offs as traders attempt to hedge against further losses. Given their historically high correlation, a sustained BTC price downtrend could drag these cryptocurrencies to sell significantly lower, triggering margin calls and forced liquidations in leveraged positions. Strategic traders may consider reducing exposure to these assets or implementing stop-loss orders if BTC continues struggling for traction. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim key resistance levels, a broader market downturn could push these correlated altcoins into deeper losses, reinforcing a bearish outlook. For traders looking to manage risk, these could be among the top cryptocurrencies to sell in a volatile market.

42615831,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=154659,1743300035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/42615831.jpeg,"Solana Faces $100 Risk, Kaspa Gains 42%, But BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 & 800K+ Users Signal Long-Term Strength",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/solana-faces-100-risk-kaspa-gains-42-but-blockdags-keynote-3-800k-users-signal-long-term-strength/,"Solana’s momentum has cracked after rejection at the $146.5 resistance, with price now slipping toward $131. Weakening demand across its network and a drop in active users underline deeper structural concerns. If support at $130 fails, SOL could spiral toward $100—testing psychological lows last seen during broader market corrections. Kaspa, meanwhile, is showing signs of life with a 42% rally in March and renewed attempts to break above $0.10. But its upside hinges entirely on holding support and breaching a long-standing resistance zone—still a technical toss-up. BlockDAG , by contrast, isn’t reacting to market mood swings—it’s building. Keynote 3 unveiled the BlockDAG Academy, a three-tiered learning ecosystem designed to equip developers from beginner to advanced levels. This isn’t education for the sake of optics—it’s a long-term engine for ecosystem expansion. Solana Price Analysis: SOL Faces Breakdown Risks After Key Rejection Solana’s recent rally has run out of steam, with SOL now trading at $131 after failing to break above the $146.5 resistance. This level aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement on the daily chart—a technical rejection that typically signals trend continuation to the downside. As selling pressure intensifies, SOL price could revisit $110, or even test the psychological $100 level. Adding to the bearish setup, Solana’s daily active addresses and transaction volumes are in decline, reflecting fading demand across DeFi and meme coin activity. Momentum indicators like the MACD and RSI are also cooling off, further validating bearish bias. On the hourly chart, SOL is bouncing off $130 support. But this rebound may be short-lived, offering short-sellers an opportunity near the 23.6% or 38.2% Fibonacci retracements. With sentiment still stuck in ‘Fear’ territory, the next move could determine if $100 is back on the table. Kaspa Price Surges 42% in March—Can It Break Above $0.10? Kaspa (KAS) has gained 42% since hitting a low of $0.056 on March 11, sparking hopes of a trend reversal. After months of correction, KAS is testing key resistance near $0.10, which aligns with the descending wedge and Fibonacci retracement levels. If the price breaks above $0.107, it could confirm a bullish breakout, signaling a shift to an uptrend. Momentum indicators like the RSI have recovered from oversold conditions, supporting the case for further upside. But rejection at this level could lead to another dip, potentially retesting the $0.0485 zone. For now, $0.078–$0.080 remains the support to watch. Traders should keep a close eye on how KAS behaves around the $0.10 mark. A breakout could mean a fresh wave of gains. With strong volume and improving structure, Kaspa may be setting the stage for a stronger move higher. BlockDAG Isn’t Just Raising Capital—It’s Raising a Generation of Builders A standout move in Keynote 3 that’s setting BlockDAG apart from every other Layer 1 is the launch of the BlockDAG Academy—a three-tier educational hub designed to onboard the next generation of developers, builders, and Web3 leaders. Unlike most crypto projects that rely on hype alone, BlockDAG is creating the foundation for a self-sustaining ecosystem by educating users at every level—from beginners to advanced smart contract developers. This means more dApps, more utility, and ultimately, more value flowing into the BDAG coin. As more developers are trained and funded (via grants and global hackathons), BlockDAG becomes not just another blockchain—it becomes the preferred environment for building the future of Web3. That’s how the project plans to achieve its $600M presale goal—by creating real demand at the ecosystem level, not just from traders. With over $209 million raised, 19 billion BDAG sold, and 800K+ app users, BlockDAG is scaling with precision. Currently in Batch 27 at $0.0248, the opportunity to join this movement early is rapidly shrinking. The Academy isn’t just an educational tool—it’s a growth engine for the entire network. And it’s already live. Takeaway Solana faces downside risks after failing to clear key resistance levels, and its fading user activity compounds the bearish narrative. Kaspa’s recent 42% rally is promising, but it remains pinned below critical resistance—offering opportunity, yes, but without confirmation of a breakout, it’s still a risky trade. In contrast, BlockDAG is engineering growth that doesn’t depend on price speculation. The BlockDAG Academy—now live—adds an entirely new dimension to its roadmap: a pipeline for developer talent, dApp innovation, and long-term adoption. With over 19 billion BDAG sold and exchange listings ahead, BlockDAG isn’t just chasing volume—it’s creating it. Most projects raise capital and scramble to build after launch. BlockDAG is already rolling out hardware, software, and education—building momentum before its mainnet hits.

42615479,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104330,1743300353,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"Hoskinson Reveals Cardano’s Push to Integrate with Dogecoin, Chainlink, Bitcoin",https://zycrypto.com/hoskinson-reveals-cardanos-push-to-integrate-with-dogecoin-chainlink-bitcoin/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has revealed ongoing efforts to integrate with major blockchain ecosystems, including Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Bitcoin, that could expand Cardano’s reach and use cases. Speaking during a Friday interview with Gokhshtein Media, Hoskinson disclosed that discussions with Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov are progressing, however, emphasizing that integration will take time due to technical challenges. “I spent last night with Sergey Nazarov from Chainlink… and I asked, ‘Hey, what about integrating Chainlink with Cardano?’ He said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re working on it with you guys, but your stack is a bit unusual, so it’ll take some time,’” Hoskinson told David. Chainlink is reportedly developing a more generalized Oracle solution tailored for UTXO-based DeFi applications rather than focusing solely on Cardano. The collaboration extends beyond Cardano, encompassing the broader UTXO-based ecosystem, which includes Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. He also touched on the network’s push into Bitcoin . Notably, Cardano has been advancing its integration with Bitcoin through BitcoinOS, a system enabling trustless BTC transfers via the BOS Grail Bridge. This initiative aims to tap into Bitcoin’s $1.7 trillion ecosystem, bridging its liquidity with Cardano’s DeFi capabilities to enhance interoperability, scalability, and adoption. Cardano’s Lace wallet also supports Bitcoin, providing seamless multichain asset management. Hoskinson further hinted at potential collaborations with Dogecoin but emphasized that discussions are still in their infancy. “They seem open and willing… but we need to determine what makes sense,” he stated. While details remain scarce, integrating Dogecoin into Cardano’s ecosystem could enhance liquidity and expand its use beyond simple transactions. Dogecoin has been widely used for payments, tipping, and microtransactions due to its low fees and fast transaction times. Major companies like Tesla and Newegg accept it for purchases. Another key topic in the interview was Bitcoin’s potential role in national strategic reserves. Hoskinson mentioned that U.S. lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis and former President Donald Trump, are reportedly exploring adding Bitcoin to the country’s reserve assets. However, he acknowledged that details remain uncertain. There were also rumors that ADA might be included in such reserves. Hoskinson addressed these speculations, saying, “I woke up to 150 messages saying, ‘Congrats, bro ADA is up 70% and in the reserve.’ And I was like, ‘Okay, well, that’s awesome—but I didn’t know about it.” Notably, Cardano’s UTXO-based transactions finalize in 20 to 40 seconds. The base layer can process around 250 TPS, and scalability improvements like Hydra aim for 1 million TPS. As of Friday, the network had processed over 110 million transactions, with fees averaging less than 25 cents per transaction. Thus, if integrated with other networks like Bitcoin or Dogecoin, Cardano’s efficient UTXO model could enhance transaction throughput, reduce fees, and improve scalability for broader blockchain interoperability.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cardano|ChainLink|Charles Hoskinson|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|DOGE|LINK|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-30 02:05:53

Regulatory uncertainty surrounding SEC Chair nominee Paul Atkins sparked withdrawal from XRP derivatives markets, signalling more downside risks ahead. Why Is Ripple (XRP) Price Going Down Today? Ripple’ (XRP) latest downturn has been attributed to mounting concerns of “conflict of interest” over the nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair under the Trump administration. While Atkins has long been regarded as a crypto-friendly figure, opposition from U.S. Congress has raised fears of potential regulatory hurdles for Trump’s crypto plans and ongoing altcoin ETF filing reviews. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | March 30 Recently, Ripple secured a major legal victory in its protracted battle with the SEC, bringing long-awaited closure to the case. However, uncertainty surrounding Atkins’ confirmation has cast a shadow over XRP price momentum. As seen in the chart above, Ripple price tumbled a low as $2.06 on Saturday, before rebound towards the $2.15 level at the time of publication. Atkins’ critics within Congress have expressed concerns over potential conflicts of interest, signaling broader resistance to pro-crypto policies. If his confirmation is blocked, it could indicate a more hostile stance toward upcoming legislative initiatives—such as the proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve, which requires congressional approval for federal cryptocurrency acquisitions. Ripple XRP ETF Approval odd plunge 9% in a week, as Congress scrutinizes Paul Atkins | Source: Polymarkets According to Polymarkets data, investors are now pricing 35% chance that the US SEC could approve XRP spot ETFs before July 31. Notably that figure has now declined 7% since the scrutiny around Trump’s SEC chair nominee, Paul Atkins began. More significantly, investors worry that a less crypto-friendly successor could delay or outright reject altcoin ETFs, dealing a major setback to institutional adoption. This uncertainty has contributed to XRP’s recent sell-offs, as market participants brace for potential regulatory headwinds. Traders Withdraw $220M as Market Sentiment Deteriorates XRP’s bearish trend has not been confined to spot market losses alone. In the derivatives sector, traders are aggressively unwinding their positions, signaling a broader loss of confidence in XRP’s short-term recovery prospects. According to CryptoQuant, XRP’s open interest—a key indicator of futures market activity—has fallen sharply from $1.6 billion on March 19 to $1.48 billion at press time, reflecting a $220 million decline in just 10 days. This mass exodus suggests that traders are moving to reduce their exposure rather than betting on a swift rebound. Ripple (XRP) Open Interest, March 30 | Source: CryptoQuant Extended periods of large-scale withdrawals from open interest typically indicate persistent bearish momentum, as market participants either lock in profits or cut their losses ahead of further declines. Unless broader sentiment shifts in favour of crypto regulation, XRP may continue facing selling pressure in the near term. XRP Price Forecast: Bearish Breakdown or Rebound to $2.40? XRP price is struggling to regain bullish momentum after falling below key moving averages, signalling potential downside risks. The XRPUSDT daily chart depicted below reveals XRP is currently trading at $2.17, facing resistance from the 50-day SMA at $2.41 and the 100-day SMA at $2.51, as sellers remain firmly in control. The declining trading volume further reinforces bearish sentiment, indicating weak demand at current levels. XRP Price Forecast The Bearish Breakout Probability is supported by the BBP (Balanced Bollinger Percentage) indicator, which sits at -0.3190, a sign of persistent downward pressure. If XRP fails to reclaim the $2.20 support, the price could slide toward $2.00, a psychologically significant level that could trigger panic selling. A breakdown below this mark could open the floodgates for a further decline toward $1.80. On the flip side, a bullish recovery scenario would require a decisive break above the $2.41 resistance. This would invalidate the bearish outlook and potentially drive XRP toward $2.60, aligning with the 100-day SMA. However, without a surge in buying volume, XRP may remain vulnerable to further sell-offs.

While most people are watching the usual suspects like Bitcoin or chasing hype with gaming coins like Gala, something much more powerful might be unfolding quietly—Qubetics. There’s a major shift happening, and it’s not just about who gets to the moon first, but who’s actually building the rocket with real-world fuel. Bitcoin might be the OG of the crypto world, and Gala’s got its niche in gaming, but the real game-changer might just be $TICS. Qubetics isn’t here to play catch-up. It’s rewriting the rules with serious tech and problem-solving features that most legacy coins never even aimed for. From the ground up, Qubetics was built to tackle actual global problems—like the painfully slow and expensive cross-border payment systems that dominate finance today. And now, during the current 27th presale stage, early buyers are rushing in. With over 504 million tokens already sold and a tally of $15.5 million raised, the buzz around Qubetics presale is becoming impossible to ignore. This isn’t just another coin—this could be the one everyone talks about when they mention the next big crypto. Qubetics Is Rewiring Global Transactions Like Never Before – Truly the Next Big Crypto Let’s get one thing straight—Qubetics isn’t a copy-paste blockchain project. It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, linking together top blockchains and unlocking seamless interoperability that’s been missing in this space for far too long. But where Qubetics really starts flexing is in its real-life application for cross-border transactions. While most crypto projects talk a big game about decentralization, Qubetics actually backs it up with a fully integrated ecosystem that can change the way people and companies move money across the globe. Picture this: A mid-sized tech startup in Austin needs to pay a freelance designer in Tokyo. Traditional banking methods? They’re looking at delays, fees, and paperwork that eats up days and dollars. But with Qubetics, that same transaction can be done within seconds, securely, with zero middlemen and at a fraction of the cost. That’s not some future vision—it’s built into the Qubetics tech right now. This is what makes Qubetics the next big crypto worth talking about. Now zoom out. Think of global companies operating with remote teams in 15 different countries. The headaches they face every month in handling payroll are unreal. Qubetics streamlines all of that, offering an instant, secure, and cost-effective way to settle transactions with full transparency. And for small business owners or content creators receiving international payments, this is a game-changer that can save thousands every year. That’s not just innovation—it’s real value. The trust and speed Qubetics offers comes from its ability to eliminate the traditional red tape and delays that plague international finance. While Bitcoin remains a store of value and Gala focuses on niche gaming use cases, Qubetics delivers a functional application with real utility that directly helps people in daily life. The result? A growing wave of early adopters recognizing it as the next big crypto before it even hits the mainstream radar. Qubetics Presale Numbers and ROI Projections – Why This Next Big Crypto Is Built Different Here’s where things start getting real for those watching the numbers. The Qubetics presale is already deep into its 27th stage, with each stage lasting just 7 days before the price increases by 10%—always hitting on Sunday at midnight. With over $15.5 million already raised, more than 23,900 token holders, and 504 million $TICS tokens sold, the hype isn’t just noise—it’s backed by serious traction. This isn’t just being talked about—it’s being bought into. Now, let’s talk numbers. Right now, $TICS is priced at $0.1300. And if the projections hit anywhere near what’s expected post-mainnet launch in Q2 2025, this could turn small investments into life-changing money. Let’s break it down. If someone throws in $2,500 at the current presale price, they’ll receive around 19,225 tokens. If $TICS hits even $1, that’s a $19,225 return—already up 669.13% ROI. But things get crazy when projections show $TICS could reach $10 or even $15. At $10 per token, that same $2,500 investment could jump to a wild $192,250, delivering a 7,591.33% ROI. If it hits $15, we’re talking $288,375—which is an 11,437% ROI. And remember, that’s all based on just one of the more realistic scenarios outlined by the team. For those who’ve been burned by hype coins with no real product, this is a whole different league. These aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet—they’re backed by a functional ecosystem that solves real financial problems. With its application targeting real-world inefficiencies and its presale metrics smashing expectations, Qubetics has become the next big crypto that’s got both the utility and growth potential that early buyers are always looking for. For anyone scanning for the best crypto presale opportunity, skipping over Qubetics right now might be one of those mistakes people regret when the coin hits full mainnet traction. Bitcoin’s Position as a Digital Store of Value Remains Firm—But It’s No Longer the Only Star Bitcoin will always have that legendary status as the first digital asset that sparked the crypto revolution. No doubt, it’s the digital gold that many still turn to during market uncertainty. But let’s be real—Bitcoin’s not what it used to be in terms of innovation. While the network remains incredibly secure and decentralized, the tech hasn’t evolved much compared to newer, more nimble ecosystems. Right now, the Bitcoin community is watching Layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network gain momentum. These upgrades are designed to tackle the issue of slow transaction speeds and high fees that have long plagued the network. Lightning does bring some relief to smaller, day-to-day transactions, but it’s still in early adoption stages. There’s also growing interest in how Bitcoin might integrate with other DeFi platforms or stablecoin protocols, but that’s mostly speculation for now. What keeps Bitcoin in the conversation is its scarcity model—only 21 million coins will ever exist. That built-in scarcity continues to give it appeal as a hedge against inflation. But for people who are looking to get into a project with 10x, 100x, or even 1000x potential, Bitcoin might not be the go-to anymore. The biggest players already own large chunks, so the upside for everyday folks is a lot smaller. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is still the anchor of the market, but it’s no longer the playground for builders or creators. The real excitement now lies in ecosystems that are faster, more adaptable, and ready to solve real problems. That’s exactly what makes Qubetics stand out as the next big crypto—it’s the tech evolution Bitcoin paved the way for. Gala Keeps the Web3 Gaming Hype Alive—But Can It Deliver? Gala is one of those names that keeps popping up in Web3 gaming circles. With its ambitious push into NFT games, music, and digital entertainment, it’s trying to build an entire media empire on the blockchain. Projects like “Gala Games” and partnerships with big industry names have helped them build a loyal community. But the big question remains—can Gala scale? Right now, Gala is focused on expanding its own layer-1 blockchain and building out an ecosystem of games and metaverse experiences. It’s definitely one of the more exciting players when it comes to blending entertainment and blockchain tech. But there are challenges. The Web3 gaming space is still figuring itself out. Many games are in alpha or beta stages, user retention is low, and the tech often feels clunky. That said, Gala’s making progress. It’s investing heavily into developing AAA-level gaming titles that don’t just use blockchain for the sake of it, but actually enhance the experience. Still, with the whole sector being so experimental, there’s a ton of unpredictability. The value of Gala tokens largely depends on the success of its entertainment ecosystem, which is still a few major releases away from proving itself. So while Gala might end up being a key player in the future of gaming and media, it’s not solving financial or infrastructure problems the way Qubetics is. It’s more of a high-risk, high-reward bet on a niche space. Compared to the real-world application and ROI potential of Qubetics, Gala still feels like a long-term play with more uncertainty attached.

Jump on the Best New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential Right Now,https://thenewscrypto.com/slerf-passed-you-by-jump-on-the-best-new-meme-coins-for-massive-return-potential-right-now/,"The crypto universe never seems to run out of surprises, especially in the meme coin category. In fact, a recent Bloomberg report on digital assets suggested that meme coins now comprise nearly 5% of total crypto trading volume worldwide. That’s massive for a niche often written off as “jokes.” This evolving sector continues to attract novice and seasoned investors, all hunting for the best new meme coins for massive return potential in a fast-changing market. Speculators point to two significant factors fueling the meme coin mania: viral culture and community-centric innovation. Every few weeks, a new project bursts onto the scene and captures the hearts (and wallets) of social media users across the globe. The best part? Some of these tokens, like exclusive events or interactive apps, introduce creative angles that go beyond gimmicky memes. In short, meme coins can no longer be dismissed as mere internet pranks; they’re serious contenders for robust growth and high-impact returns. Taking center stage in the crypto rumor mill is Troller Cat ($TCAT). Hailed as “the next big meme coin with real utility,” this token aims to flip the script on the standard formula. Some say it’s bridging the gap between comedic antics and tangible crypto innovations, including a rumored deflationary Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game Center. Despite the comedic brand, Troller Cat’s unique ecosystem might set it apart from other meme coins. It’s all about pushing boundaries while delivering strong community engagement. Let’s see how $TCAT stands up to this rapidly evolving landscape. Troller Cat ($TCAT) – A New Age of Trolling-Inspired Crypto Crypto communities are buzzing about Troller Cat ($TCAT) as one of the best new meme coins for massive return potential because it doesn’t just rely on catchy memes. Its entire theme revolves around a playful yet cunning approach to internet “trolling.” According to buzz in various Telegram groups, there’s a so-called Troller Walk of Fame, in which each presale stage celebrates a historic trolling moment. While details on those legendary pranks aren’t fully disclosed, observers guess the project might unveil comedic throwbacks to some of history’s most epic online roasts. One highlight generating attention is the rumor of a Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game Center. This isn’t just any mini-game platform. Insiders suggest it might incorporate a buyback-and-burn model that systematically reduces token supply. When tokens are burned, the overall supply shrinks, theoretically boosting the value for holders. That’s why many watchers believe $TCAT is among the best new meme coins for massive return potential: it merges comedic flair with a mechanism that actively fights inflation. If executed well, this approach could deliver both entertainment and economic upside. Beyond the P2E chatter, there’s also talk of staking rewards for early adopters. While no official Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is confirmed, rumor has it that the plan involves a scheme where dedicated community members can lock up tokens and receive an extra $TCAT in return. If that proves true, it could bolster the coin’s reputation as a stable and forward-looking meme coin rather than a short-lived hype project. The real draw, though, is the social layer. People aren’t just buying a coin; they’re joining a subculture filled with witty pranks, collaborative jokes, and an overarching mission to redefine what a meme coin can be. For those scanning the horizon for the best new meme coins with massive return potential, Troller Cat might just fit the bill, given its hybrid entertainment model, rumored burn protocols, and potential staking. How to Get in on $TCAT’s Presale Before It’s Too Late Step-by-Step: Whitelist to Presale Participation in $TCAT’s presale is rumored to be straightforward. Prospective buyers start by joining the whitelist phase, which acts like a VIP pass for early entry. This step might involve signing up on the official website or engaging in certain promotional tasks—though the specific details are still under wraps. Once on the whitelist, investors can access the presale platform, where $TCAT tokens will be offered at what’s expected to be a discounted price. Projects with high potential often limit presale token allocations, so planning ahead can secure a better position when the presale goes live. Though official channels haven’t confirmed any staking APY numbers, the concept is tantalizing: join early, stake tokens, and possibly earn more $TCAT as the coin’s ecosystem flourishes. This approach mirrors past meme coin success stories where the earliest adopters became central community pillars—often enjoying significant returns when mainstream interest peaked. For anyone chasing the best new meme coins with massive return potential, $TCAT’s presale might offer the perfect combination of low entry cost and strong market narrative. Upcoming $TCAT Presale – Gear Up for a Trolling Revolution Troller Cat ($TCAT) isn’t just another coin riding the meme wave; it’s poised to kick off what insiders call a “trolling revolution.” That revolution appears even more intriguing, given the buzz about a presale event that’s set to follow the ongoing whitelist phase. Historically, early-stage meme coins have been known to deliver life-changing returns to investors who spot them before the rest of the world catches on. That’s why $TCAT is increasingly referenced as one of the best new meme coins for massive return potential —the presale could pave the way for significant price action right from the start. For investors searching for the best new meme coins for massive return potential, $TCAT’s upcoming presale deserves attention. Community speculation hints that the event won’t stay under the radar for long, especially if major influencers begin to highlight the project. Whether it’s the comedic spin or the deflationary angle, Troller Cat has crafted a unique narrative that sets it apart from a field saturated with DOGEs, frogs, and pun-based knockoffs. SLERF ($SLERF) – Is It Living Up to Early Hype? SLERF ($SLERF) first made headlines earlier this year when crypto influencers touted it as a can’t-miss meme coin. For a while, it seemed unstoppable. Live reports indicated that $SLERF gained more than 300% in its initial weeks, sparking chatter in Reddit threads and Twitter feeds. Investors were drawn in by a wave of humor-laden marketing that portrayed SLERF as the king of spontaneous crypto gains. Indeed, some watchers crowned it among the best new meme coins for massive return potential, especially during its first month in the limelight. Recent data from popular crypto tracking platforms reveals that SLERF’s volatility remains high. Spikes in trading volume occur whenever there’s a new marketing push or influencer shoutout, but the overall performance has been choppy. Critics argue that a pure meme coin with a limited technical backbone might struggle in a competitive environment, especially as more advanced meme coins like Troller Cat ($TCAT) begin incorporating robust tokenomics or deflationary gaming ecosystems. However, SLERF’s supporters maintain that the coin is “too entertaining to fail.” They believe the brand’s humorous approach continues to attract short-term speculators who love the adrenaline rush of meme coins. If a future update or feature set emerges, SLERF might regain momentum and cement itself as one of the best new meme coins for massive return potential . Yet the jury is still out. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the Troller Cat is set to sparkle in the meme coin space in 2025. The project brings fresh energy, fusing humor with rumored deflationary mechanics that could be a game-changer in meme coin economics. Plus, an active community is already driving the buzz—never a bad sign for tokens aiming for rapid expansion. Meme coin presales don’t wait around, and Troller Cat is no exception. With the whitelist phase currently in motion, the limited presale window could close much sooner than anticipated. For those keen to jump in on a potential gem, the time to act may be now. Keep an eye on official channels, follow the updates, and make an informed decision before Troller Cat’s presale goes live. According to market chatter, this might be a meme coin that can deliver much more than a quick punchline.

This move continues the company’s strategy of getting BTC into the open market through capital raises while adhering to its “Hodl” agenda. MARA secures new ATM equity program to fund Bitcoin purchases According to a Form 8-K and latest prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MARA has set up an at-the-market (ATM) equity program with a group of investment banks, including Barclays, BMO Capital Markets, BTIG, and Cantor Fitzgerald, among others acting as agents . Under the prospectus supplement, the shares will be sold from time to time at MARA Holdings’ discretion. The proceeds of the offering will be used mainly for the acquisition of Bitcoin in the open market. “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital,” MARA said in its prospectus. The company, which specializes in finance services and has a market capitalization of $4.7 billion, maintains a strong liquidity position with a current ratio of 4.94, indicating its ability to meet short-term obligations. The shares’ sale will be conducted through methods deemed to be an “at the market offering” or through other methods upon agreement. The agents are entitled to a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds from each sale. Simultaneously, MARA Holdings has revoked its at-the-market offering agreement dated October 24, 2023, which authorized the sale of up to $1.5 billion in common stock. No additional sales will take place under the previous agreement or its related prospectus supplement. The firm has made it clear that this filing does not constitute an offer to sell the shares, and no sales will occur in states where such an offer or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state. MARA follows Saylor’s playbook as It expands Bitcoin holdings MARA’s current moves follow Michael Saylor’s playbook of issuing equity and convertible bonds to accumulate Bitcoin in the open market. The miner now has 46,376 BTC in its treasury—the second most among publicly listed firms, only behind MicroStrategy’s 506,137 BTC. Despite being a Bitcoin miner, MARA has increasingly relied on buying Bitcoin on the open market. The company adopted this strategy last year amid recognition that mining BTC at a discount to the spot price was becoming increasingly difficult. The industry has come under tremendous pressure following the latest Bitcoin halving event, which halved the rewards for mining and pressured profit margins against surging operational costs. This means that acquiring Bitcoin from the open market has become a comparatively better strategy for miners wanting to increase their holdings and keep their mining operations going. MARA’s action comes at a time when Bitcoin has been subject to increased volatility but ever-strong institutional interest. The last five years have seen MARA Holdings deliver a very large total shareholder return of 2881.63%, reflecting significant strides in transforming its business strategy.

River has no interest in building a “successful crypto casino” Leishman said while there are many “successful crypto casinos,” he has no interest in building one. River Financial is a Bitcoin-only financial institution focusing on buying and selling Bitcoin ( BTC ). Several companies have opted for the Bitcoin-only approach, including Swan Bitcoin, Bull Bitcoin, and decentralized exchange Bisq. Leishman claimed that multi-asset trading platforms prioritize short-term speculation over wealth accumulation: “The casino business model is built around maximal extraction from customers, and the Bitcoin-only model is focused on helping people build long-term wealth.” Critics have voiced this point before, even during the memecoin uptrend in early 2024. In April 2024, A16z chief technology officer Eddy Lazzarin said that memecoins hamper the long-term vision of crypto that has kept so many of the original builders in the space. “At best, it looks like a risky casino,” Lazzarin said. The memecoin market cap is down 27.94% over the past 12 months. Source: CoinMarketCap The overall memecoin market cap has taken a significant downturn since the beginning of 2025. Since Jan. 1, the memecoin market cap has slumped almost 49% to $48.49 billion at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, while altcoins have historically been more volatile than Bitcoin, offering them alongside Bitcoin has been a lucrative move for crypto exchanges and brokers.

Among the 15 memecoins listed by crypto exchange Binance in 2024, 12 saw significant increases in value after going live on the exchange, pseudonymous onchain analyst Ai_9684xtpa said in November .

Arctic Pablo Coin Is That Moment!,https://thecoinrise.com/what-if-you-could-go-back-in-time-and-buy-pepe-coin-early-arctic-pablo-coin-is-that-moment/,"Did you miss out on Pepe Coin’s early days? If so, you’re not alone. Many investors overlooked its potential, only to watch in disbelief as it skyrocketed in value. In its early days, Pepe Coin was seen as just another meme token, trading at fractions of a cent. Those who recognized its potential and got in early now enjoy massive returns, while latecomers can only regret not seizing the opportunity when prices were low. But what if another high-potential meme coin is emerging right now? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making waves with its explosive presale, and this could be the chance to catch a winner before it takes off. The Rise of Pepe Coin: A Missed Opportunity for Many Pepe Coin launched with little fanfare, but it quickly gained traction in the meme coin space. Initially trading at an almost negligible price, it saw a rapid surge as community hype and investor interest grew. As it climbed the ranks of top meme coins, early investors reaped massive gains, while those who hesitated watched its price soar beyond their reach. This scenario plays out repeatedly in crypto: an unknown project takes off, rewarding early believers while leaving others wishing they had acted sooner. But history often repeats itself, and Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the next big name in meme crypto. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Crypto Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s redefining the space with a unique presale structure and strategic tokenomics. Unlike traditional presales that operate in rigid phases, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale follows a location-based journey, making it one of the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now. Currently, it’s in its 16th stage, known as Crystal Cove, with a price of just $0.000083. The meme coin presale has already raised over $2 million, signaling strong investor confidence. With a projected launch price of $0.008, early adopters could see a staggering 9552.41% ROI. Imagine getting in now, while the price is low, instead of regretting it later like many did with Pepe Coin. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Game-Changing Features No Traditional Stages: Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale structure is unique, with locations replacing standard phases. This innovative approach keeps engagement high and fosters a strong community. Deflationary Tokenomics: Unsold tokens are burned weekly, increasing scarcity and long-term value. Any leftover tokens after the presale will also be permanently removed. High Staking Rewards: Investors can stake their APC tokens and earn a massive 66% APY during the presale.

From Pepe derivatives to Solana-fueled absurdity, the meme coin market is alive and kicking in 2025. Projects are popping off left and right, and some of them are more than just punchlines—they’re building actual ecosystems, gamified rewards, and communities that don’t sleep. And with bullish vibes spreading fast, this weekend might be your best shot to grab what’s next before the market catches up. Right in the middle of this chaotic excitement is BTFD Coin, and it’s not playing around. The presale’s in Stage 15, with over $6.43 million raised, 72 billion tokens sold, and more than 11,600 Bulls already charging ahead. But what’s got people talking loudest? The Bulls Squad—a tight-knit, hype-fueled community that’s turning this project into something bigger than just another meme coin presale. With one stage left and the LAUNCH100 bonus code ending March 30, BTFD isn’t just one of the most talked-about tokens—it’s one of the best new meme coins to invest in today , especially for those looking to double their bag before the presale closes. BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad Frenzy, 90% APY, and a 2900% Moonshot Let’s cut to it— BTFD Coin is building something wild. At first glance, it might look like another meme coin, but zoom in and you’ll see it’s got muscle. The Bulls Squad, its ever-growing community, isn’t just shouting into the void—they’re actively playing in a live Play-to-Earn game that launched on January 1, 2025. Gamers and investors are stacking $BTFD rewards by completing missions, unlocking gear, and climbing leaderboards. It’s Web3 fun with real token earnings. No fluff—just vibes and value. But it gets crazier. The staking rewards are a massive 90% APY, giving long-term holders serious incentive to lock in. Add the fact that the LAUNCH100 bonus code—which doubles your tokens—is still live but expires March 30, and you’re looking at the perfect combo of game, rewards, and community-driven chaos. This isn’t just a meme coin presale , it’s a countdown to what might be the most anticipated meme listing of 2025. Let’s throw in some real math. At the current Stage 15 price of $0.0002, a $7,000 investment nets you 35 million BTFD tokens. If the price hits the projected $0.0006 listing, you’re sitting at $21,000. But if it hits its $0.006 moon price, which analysts are already eyeing, that stack becomes $210,000. That’s a 2900% ROI from a single well-timed move. So, how do you get in? Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, fund it with ETH or BNB, head to the BTFD Coin presale site , connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in all caps to activate your 100% bonus, choose your amount, confirm, and you’re done. Your tokens can be claimed post-presale, with rewards from staking and the P2E game unlocked over time. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it’s not just building a token—it’s building a movement. Between the Bulls Squad energy, the 90% APY staking, and a meme coin presale that’s nearly over, BTFD is charging into launch with serious firepower—and this might be your last shot to ride with the herd. Book of Meme (BOME): Where Crypto Culture Gets Archived The Book of Meme (BOME) isn’t trying to reinvent the meme—it’s trying to preserve it. Launched on Solana on March 10, 2024, and created by Darkfarms (the mind behind iconic Pepe memes), this project wants to build a decentralized library where memes, meme tokens, and everything in between live forever. It’s a digital time capsule for the wildest corner of the internet. Solana’s lightning-fast transactions and low fees make BOME’s mission possible. With a strong mix of art, humor, and blockchain-powered archiving, it’s more than a meme coin—it’s a cultural project. And that’s why BOME is gaining traction with the crypto crowd that’s just as nostalgic as they are forward-thinking. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because BOME offers something unique—memes backed by permanence. It’s a fresh take that speaks to Web3’s roots and makes this one of the best new meme coins to invest in today. Dogwifhat (WIF): Pure Meme Energy, Straight from Solana Dogwifhat (WIF) is one of those tokens that exploded because of what it didn’t try to do. It doesn’t overcomplicate things. A Shiba Inu wearing a pink knit hat, no fancy staking, no forced utility—just a vibe, a loyal community, and a fixed supply of nearly 999 million tokens. Sitting on Solana, WIF thrives in an ecosystem where meme coins are breaking out left and right. It’s built entirely on community belief, meme traction, and cult-like engagement from people who just… vibe with the hat. And in 2025, that kind of organic virality still works. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because WIF has become a meme icon without trying too hard, and that’s exactly what makes it one of the best new meme coins to invest in today. Floki Inu (FLOKI): Dog Culture with DeFi Ambitions Floki Inu didn’t start the dog coin trend, but it took it in a new direction. Named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, FLOKI mixes meme magic with real tech ambition. Over time, it’s grown into a project with educational platforms, DeFi tools, and NFT integrations that bring real value beyond the bark. The FLOKI army—its community—is huge and global. Whether it’s sponsoring sports teams or building in the metaverse, FLOKI keeps showing up in places you wouldn’t expect. That visibility, paired with steady development, gives it long-term potential beyond just meme hype. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because FLOKI balances meme energy with legit building, putting it squarely on the radar of anyone looking for the best new meme coins to invest in today. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): The Meme Coin from an AI Oracle Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) isn’t your typical meme coin. This one’s born from a decentralized AI oracle called the Terminal of Truth, making it part performance art, part crypto experiment. It runs on Ethereum and taps into themes of futuristic tech, self-aware systems, and meme-fueled prophecy. It’s bold. It’s weird. And it’s catching fire with Web3 thinkers and meme lovers alike. There’s no roadmap written in stone—GOAT evolves as the oracle spits out truths, predictions, and digital chaos. And people are here for it. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because GOAT adds some weird, wonderful flavor to the meme space and earns its spot among the best new meme coins to invest in today by being totally unpredictable—in the best way. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE): A Familiar Favorite That Still Delivers Baby Doge Coin has been around, and its deflationary tokenomics and huge following keep it relevant. Created by the Dogecoin community and built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BABYDOGE dishes out passive income to holders through its 10% transaction fee, where part goes to holders and the rest boosts liquidity. It’s cute, fast, and backed by one of the most loyal meme communities out there. With continued marketing pushes and NFT tie-ins, Baby Doge has remained a meme token that doesn’t fade away. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because BABYDOGE keeps delivering community value and passive rewards—two reasons it’s still one of the best new meme coins to invest in today. The Final Thoughts There’s no shortage of noise in the meme coin market right now—but the ones that stand out have real momentum, storylines, and communities behind them. Whether it’s WIF’s viral image, BOME’s cultural archiving, or GOAT’s chaotic oracle, each coin on this list has something that sets it apart. But BTFD Coin is the one with all eyes on it right now, and for good reason. With its Bulls Squad community, a live Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a meme coin presale entering its final days, BTFD is putting on a masterclass in Web3 growth. And let’s not forget—LAUNCH100 ends March 30. That’s your last chance to double your tokens before the price climbs and the presale closes for good. Miss this, and you might be watching others stack their wins from the sidelines. Join the BTFD Coin presale now —before the last stage arrives and the bull gates close for good. FAQs What is the LAUNCH100 code for BTFD Coin? It’s a time-limited promo code that doubles your BTFD tokens during the presale. Enter LAUNCH100 in all caps before March 30 to claim it. How does the Bulls Squad work in BTFD Coin? It’s the core community behind the project, powering gameplay, referrals, staking, and social hype. Being part of it offers inside perks and a front-row seat to BTFD’s rise. Is BTFD still in presale? Yes, it’s in Stage 15, with over $6.43 million raised and just one stage left before listing at $0.0006. What’s the potential ROI on BTFD Coin? At a $0.0002 entry and a predicted $0.006 moon price, the ROI potential is up to 2900%—making it a standout pick for the best new meme coins to invest in today.

But here’s the deal: BTFD Coin ’s presale is about to end, and Stage 16 is the final stop before launch.

42619154,https://square.htx.com/?p=43538,1743305588,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,"Justin Sun: Forbes Cover Marks New Beginning, Vows 40-Year Commitment to Crypto Industry",https://square.htx.com/justin-sun-forbes-cover-marks-new-beginning-vows-40-year-commitment-to-crypto-industry/,"Singapore, March 29, 2025 — Justin Sun, Global Advisor of HTX and Founder of TRON, has been featured on the Forbes Digital Assets Daily Cover, which lauds him as a “ Crypto Billionaire Who Helped The Trumps Make $400 Million. ” This marks a historic moment as Sun becomes the second Chinese entrepreneur—after Jack Ma—to be featured on Forbes’ English digital asset spotlight. On the evening of March 28, Sun joined a live broadcast session hosted by HTX titled “Justin Sun Featured on Forbes! Another Legendary Moment for Crypto?” to share his thoughts and experiences. The livestream also featured Molly, Spokesperson of HTX, along with several well-known Chinese crypto influencers and representatives from leading industry media. Showcasing Chinese Leadership on the Global Crypto Stage Sun views this recognition as an opportunity to represent both himself and the broader crypto industry on the global stage. “This helps the public better understand who I am, what the crypto industry stands for, and can potentially reshape public perception,” said Sun. “It’s also a great opportunity for the industry’s growth in China. We can now prove to the world that the crypto sector can represent Chinese voices and interests on a global level.” “This is definitely a milestone, but it’s just the beginning,” he added. Prior to him, only CZ, Brian Armstrong, and SBF had received this level of recognition. “This validates the achievements we’ve made in the industry, and also enhances the visibility and reputation of brands like HTX and TRON. In the business world, Forbes’ endorsement brings credibility and trust to our work.” Forbes Recognition to Accelerate HTX’s Global Expansion The three previously recognized crypto leaders corresponded to Binance, Coinbase, and FTX. Now, Sun represents HTX. “Not long ago, Forbes named HTX one of the world’s most trustworthy crypto exchanges. This, along with the latest feature, strongly supports our global expansion,” said Sun. “Since rebranding to HTX, our platform has become easier for international users to recognize and connect with. I’m very optimistic about HTX’s next phase of growth.” Sun has also praised HTX on social media, citing steady trading volume increases, successful asset launches, and over $100 million in net inflows for three consecutive months. “Based on current liquidity levels, HTX ranks around sixth globally,” he said. “With sustained effort, we have a real opportunity to return to the global top three.” A Vision to Build the Industry for the Next 40 Years March 28 also marks the 10th anniversary of Jack Ma’s Lakeside University. As an alumnus, Sun noted: “The biggest difference is, when Jack Ma appeared on Forbes, Alibaba was already a household name. But blockchain is still in its early stages. Out of 7 billion people worldwide, TRON has only 300 million users—we’re still early.” Looking ahead, Sun remains ambitious. “I believe I can contribute to the industry for at least another 40 years. I entered the crypto space in 2012—it’s been just 13 years. If given three times more time, I’m confident I can help elevate the industry to new heights.” About HTX Founded in 2013, HTX has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses. As a world-leading gateway to Web3, HTX harbors global capabilities that enable it to provide users with safe and reliable services.

That’s where Dragoin ($DDGN) enters—a fiery newcomer with momentum and serious potential. With a strong community, real play-to-earn mechanics, and deflationary tokenomics, it’s turning heads fast. While most meme coins lean on pure hype, Dragoin brings strategy, scarcity, and daily interaction. Crypto circles are buzzing with the idea that Dragoin might be the one coin that breaks out and delivers that rare 100x return this year. Here’s why. 1. Scarcity Built In Through Burn Mechanics Dragoin isn’t copying typical meme coin models. It was crafted with limited supply at its core. The presale runs in 25 phases, each bringing a price increase, rewarding early buyers. Half of the total 200 billion supply is allocated to this sale. Here’s the twist: tokens that don’t sell in each round are permanently burned. As Dragoin gains traction and stages fill, supply drops, tightening the market and raising the floor. Meme coin explosions are often sparked by sudden scarcity. Dragoin bakes that mechanic right in, giving it a serious edge and a built-in engine for potential price surges. 2. 100x Upside Baked into Launch Price Dragoin’s current presale price sits at $0.0000292, while its confirmed launch price is locked in at $0.002. That’s a full 100x built directly into the presale path—no wishful thinking required. As older meme coins chase a comeback, Dragoin is launching into a surging market. Meme coin market cap is already up 16% this month, showing the energy is back. Bitcoin hovering above $85K means more capital is flowing into higher-risk altcoins. With timing, structure, and built-in upside, Dragoin is perfectly placed to benefit from renewed meme coin hype. The opportunity window won’t stay open forever. 3. Game Integration Creates Daily Demand Dragoin stands out with real engagement. It powers a Telegram-based play-to-earn game where players hatch dragons, train them, and battle to earn $DDGN rewards. This isn’t just about buying and holding. It’s interactive. Players need tokens to participate, which keeps demand alive every day. That consistent usage fuels organic growth within the ecosystem. This isn’t your average meme coin—it’s sticky, fun, and rewarding. As more users join and compete, token flow increases. It’s a smart setup. Coins with daily utility build stronger communities, and Dragoin shows that meme coins can be addictive and useful at the same time. 4. Ownership Renounced for True Decentralization Trust is everything in crypto, and Dragoin gets that. After the presale ends, the development team will renounce control of the smart contract, making Dragoin fully decentralized. That means no one—not even the creators—can change token supply, touch the liquidity pool, or influence the roadmap. Everything shifts into the community’s hands. This approach gives $DDGN a level of trust many meme coins lack. It’s becoming rare to find projects that prioritize transparency. Dragoin’s open structure is winning respect, especially from users who’ve been burned before. This time, there’s no central authority—just the power of the crowd. 5. Explosive Community Growth and Viral Potential Dragoin is gaining traction fast. Its Telegram is exploding, social buzz is growing, and key influencers are starting to call it the meme coin to watch in 2025. What sets this apart? It’s spreading organically. No gimmicks, no celebrity stunts—just word-of-mouth and smart fundamentals. Q2 will see staking rewards, referral bonuses, and major marketing campaigns go live. Q3 brings big plans: CEX listings, new in-game features, and the start of community governance. Momentum like this doesn’t sit still. Dragoin’s rise feels real, and when the next meme coin breakout happens, $DDGN could easily be the one leading the charge. Why Dragoin Might Take Over 2025 Meme Coin Market Meme coin runs are wild—but this time, people want more than hype. They’re looking for coins with mechanics that work. Dragoin nails it: deflationary supply, real utility, and full decentralization. It plays into meme culture, but with a smarter model underneath. At $0.0000292, and with the launch set for $0.002, the 100x potential is sitting right there. Not hidden—highlighted. If you missed the early runs of DOGE or SHIB, this could be your second chance. But don’t wait. Once Dragoin takes off, that window slams shut. This might be the meme coin moment everyone’s chasing in 2025.

As Solana and Cardano each attempt to strengthen their foothold—through prediction platform integrations and price consolidation patterns—BlockDAG is taking a different route: rewarding actual participation. While Solana gains attention from Polymarket and Cardano eyes a potential breakout, BlockDAG ’s Beta Testnet adds real stakes with $6,000 in BDAG rewards for developers, miners, and users. This hands-on approach doesn’t just invite interaction—it demands it. With smart contract deployment already underway and presale fundraising at $209 million, BlockDAG is proving that tangible engagement can shape more than just speculation. Polymarket’s Integration of Solana Eyes $170 Milestone Polymarket, a leading crypto prediction platform, has recently incorporated Solana (SOL) deposits, enhancing transaction efficiency and reducing costs for its users. Moreover, this strategic move leverages Solana’s high-speed, low-fee blockchain, offering a compelling alternative to Ethereum’s often congested network. Consequently, Polymarket anticipates attracting a broader user base, thereby increasing platform liquidity. Furthermore, this integration also signifies Polymarket’s commitment to multi-chain compatibility, positioning it competitively within the evolving Web3 landscape. Meanwhile, Solana’s market performance has shown resilience. After encountering resistance at $144, SOL found solid support around $138. Notably, technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reaching oversold levels, suggest diminishing selling pressures and potential for a market rebound. If so, should SOL maintain support above $138, it may challenge resistance levels between $141 and $142, with successful breakthroughs potentially propelling it towards the $144–$146 range. Cardano (ADA) Poised for Potential Breakout Cardano’s native token, ADA, has been trading within a narrow range between $0.695 and $0.75, reflecting a period of consolidation. In particular, a decisive move above $0.756, marked by a daily candle close, could signal a 12% surge toward the $0.85 level. In contrast, a drop below $0.69 may lead to a decline toward $0.65. In terms of technicals, indicators reveal that ADA is contending with resistance from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. Nonetheless, market sentiment appears bullish, with traders holding $17 million in long positions. Additionally, a 40% increase in trading volume over the past 24 hours suggests growing market participation. As such, investors should monitor these key levels and technical signals closely, as they may provide insights into ADA’s next significant price movement. $6K in Rewards Await BlockDAG Beta Testnet Developers BlockDAG’s Beta “Primordial” Testnet isn’t just a technical preview—it’s a fully incentivized playground where early participants can earn real BDAG rewards ahead of the mainnet launch. Specifically, with $6,000 in total prizes on the line, the project is rewarding the top 10 most active wallets, top 10 miner nodes, and top 10 largest wallet balances with $2,000 each in BDAG at a launch valuation of $0.05 per token. Importantly, these aren’t testnet tokens—winners will receive mainnet BDAG, giving users real value for their participation. For developers, this testnet offers more than testing—it’s a chance to deploy smart contracts, test scalability, and get noticed. The platform offers extensive tooling, including an IDE, block explorer, and EVM compatibility, making smart contract development straightforward and seamless. Moreover, this incentive strategy is part of a broader momentum that has seen BlockDAG’s presale raise $209 million to date. Currently, in batch 27, the token is priced at $0.0248, up 2,380% from its first batch. Over 18.9 billion coins have already been sold, highlighting strong early demand and growing trust in the project’s roadmap. Looking ahead, running until May 31, the Beta Testnet not only tests performance under real-world conditions but also invites builders and users to participate with real skin in the game. Ultimately, whether you’re writing code or mining blocks, BlockDAG is rewarding early action now—before the network goes fully live. BlockDAG’s Testnet Sets a Higher Bar Speculation may drive price surges, but sustained value comes from utility and user participation. While Solana benefits from new integrations and Cardano tests resistance levels, BlockDAG is building traction through hands-on engagement and measurable outcomes. With incentives tied directly to testnet activity and over 18.9 billion coins already sold, the project isn’t just promising utility—it’s putting it to the test. As the May 31 deadline approaches, developers, miners, and early adopters aren’t watching from the sidelines—they’re actively shaping what’s next. And in a space driven by proof, BlockDAG is giving everyone the tools to deliver it.

XRP and Solana have shown potential with their recent recoveries and bullish patterns, sparking optimism among traders. XRP’s breakout hints at crossing the $2.50 mark, while Solana eyes a crucial $140 resistance level. Yet, amidst the price speculation and technical indicators, one project stands out for prioritizing transparency over hype— BlockDAG . Unlike others that focus primarily on trading momentum, BlockDAG has solidified its reputation through a transparent vesting system, driven by smart contracts and backed by over 110,000 active users in its Beta Testnet. XRP’s Potential Breakout: Eyeing the $2.50 Threshold XRP has recently demonstrated a robust recovery, trading around $2.45 after a 2.14% increase in the last 24 hours. Notably, the formation of an inverted head and shoulders pattern—a classic indicator of bullish momentum—suggests a potential surge. Specifically, this pattern’s neckline rests at $2.45; therefore, a decisive move above this level could propel XRP towards $2.60 and possibly higher, with the $3.00 mark as a subsequent resistance level. Moreover, market sentiment further bolsters this optimistic outlook. On Binance Futures, an impressive 72.28% of traders are holding long positions, reflecting widespread confidence in XRP’s upward trajectory. Additionally, derivatives data reveals a 60.98% surge in trading volume to $4.52 billion, accompanied by an open interest of $3.97 billion. Furthermore, options volume has also skyrocketed by 167.91%, indicating heightened speculative activity. Solana’s Short-Term Price Targets: Key Levels for Traders Solana (SOL) has shown resilience, rebounding to $138 with a 5.87% gain, though it remains 20% down over the past month. Importantly, the $140 resistance level is pivotal; surpassing it could signal a shift towards bullish sentiment. Additionally, trading volume has surged by 130.42% to $3.33 billion, indicating heightened market engagement. Notably, open interest in Solana futures has risen by 11.01% to $5.25 billion, reflecting increased leveraged trading activity. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 67, suggesting SOL is approaching overbought territory, which may lead to increased selling pressure if it crosses 70. Meanwhile, network activity also shows promise, with active wallets climbing from 1 million to 3 million between March 20 and 23, potentially bolstering demand. Consequently, for sustained upward momentum, SOL must decisively break the $140 barrier on strong volume; otherwise, failure to do so could result in a pullback. BlockDAG Sets Industry Standard with Transparent Vesting System BlockDAG has set a new standard for transparency by implementing a smart contract-driven token vesting system that puts users first. Consequently, this meticulous approach ensures that every token allocation is tracked and accessible, fostering a sense of accountability and building lasting trust. With over 110,000 users participating in the Beta Testnet, BlockDAG has demonstrated that transparency isn’t just an afterthought—it’s a core principle that drives its development forward. During the presale, BlockDAG raised a staggering $209 million, reflecting the immense confidence investors have placed in the project. Currently, the presale has reached Batch 27, with the current batch price standing at $0.0248. This marks a phenomenal return on investment (ROI) of 2,380% since Batch 1, making BlockDAG one of the most promising blockchain ventures on the market. Additionally, over 18.9 billion coins have already been sold, highlighting the sheer scale of community support and investor enthusiasm. What truly sets BlockDAG apart is its commitment to open and honest operations. Notably, the transparent vesting system is fully automated through smart contracts, ensuring that users can track their token allocations without worrying about hidden clauses or unexpected changes. As a result, this practical commitment to integrity not only reassures current investors but also positions BlockDAG as a model for future blockchain projects. Finally, as the mainnet launch approaches, BlockDAG’s transparent vesting mechanism serves as a powerful statement of its commitment to doing things right. By prioritizing clarity and accountability, the project builds a strong foundation for sustained community support and long-term success. Transparency Triumphs While XRP and Solana continue to captivate traders with their promising price movements and bullish signals, the focus on short-term gains often overshadows long-term stability. Market sentiment and trading volumes paint a picture of speculative enthusiasm, but without a clear framework of transparency, the risks remain high. BlockDAG, on the other hand, offers a refreshing contrast with its commitment to clear and accountable token vesting. By leveraging smart contracts and maintaining open access to vesting data, BlockDAG builds trust and demonstrates a practical approach to sustainable growth. As the mainnet launch draws closer, this dedication to transparency may prove more valuable than fleeting market momentum.

The AVAX network is rolling out Visa credit cards now as part of its latest technologies, and the AVAX price has recently gotten better for it. A bullish rally is on the horizon, and many top altcoins are already responding accordingly. Remittix is leading the line of new projects in the market too, as traders have been storming the presale website for some RTX tokens of their own. The new Remittix project is the hottest topic in the crypto market at the moment, even among Avalanche and Solana traders. Here are some reasons behind that. Avalanche Credit Cards to Aid Crypto Adoption The Avalanche network has made a name among the top cryptocurrencies as one of the most innovative ecosystems, possibly after Ethereum. With the growing wave of crypto adoption across economies, Avalanche introduced some new developments last month to stay ahead of the curve. The AVAX blockchain will be issuing Visa credit cards to users through which they can spend their Avalanche assets. All Avalanche-based assets, from the AVAX tokens to wrapped AVAX and stablecoins issued on the network, are available spending options on the credit cards. According to reports from CoinDesk, the Avalanche debit cards were issued in partnership with Rain, the blockchain card issuing platform. The Avalanche Foundation also stated in October 2024 that the credit cards will sign up more users from Latin America and the Caribbean before focusing on other regions, and the adoption process has already seen considerable progress from there, as well as from Africa and Southeast Asia. Avalanche and Solana: What’s Driving Their Price Movements? The credit cards on Avalanche were issued about a month ago, and they might be a contributing factor to the recent spike in the AVAX price. The token is currently trading at $20.03, with a 2.52% spike in the weekly timeframe, even though the token has slumped considerably in the past few days. Many analysts have also pointed out that the AVAX price is finally breaking out of its correction phase. The Avalanche token made a 35% recovery from its $15 low on March 11, and the charts show that the AVAX price has completed an ABC corrective wave. But while Avalanche might have potential for short-term returns, the token is still stuck in limbo. It’s even worse with Solana, as the declining network and DEX activity have contributed to a drop in the Solana price. The Solana token was rejected at the $145 level during the week, and its price has fallen to $126.19, bringing its seven-day charts back into 2.25% losses. For most traders, it’s up to the new projects to set the pace for profits in 2025, and Remittix (RTX) seems to be the best crypto at the moment. Here’s more about the new project and why everyone is trooping to its presale. Remittix to Open APIs for Smooth Withdrawals Crypto traders are often faced with the familiar dilemma of the fastest, cheapest options to get their crypto assets from the blockchain into their fiat accounts for checking. Over the past decade, there hasn’t been a clear pathway for that, but now we have Remittix. The new project is concerned with helping users convert their crypto assets directly into fiat currencies and resolving them into appropriate bank accounts. It’s as easy as transferring tokens from one wallet to the other, and users get to avoid intermediaries in the transaction. That means any crypto trader can pay for tuition fees online, transfer money to relatives abroad, and even clear a cart on Shopify, all directly from their crypto hot wallets. The Remittix API only needs the recipient’s bank account details to make the transfer. The best part is that Remittix is already expanding fast. The platform supports about 30 fiat currencies and over 40 cryptos, so traders can scarcely get stranded for withdrawal options. The world is gradually adopting cryptocurrency as a form of payment, and, like Avalanche, Remittix intends to stay ahead of the curve. Stay Ahead With Remittix! The next best thing is to join the growing Remittix community, and you’d find a lot of traders going there already. The RTX tokens have been the talk of the crypto-verse for the past two months, and they are still selling at bargain rates. Each Remittix token costs only $0.0734, but they are set to rise with each presale stage. Get yours now, and start anticipating the big 130x spike post-launch. Don’t miss out on Remittix today!

It has plunged by over 55% from its highest level in 2024. Why Ethereum price has crashed Ethereum has crashed because of its ecosystem challenges and the ongoing macro factors. Internally, Ethereum has plunged because of the ongoing outflows in the spot Ethereum ETFs. Data by SoSoValue shows that ETH ETFs have had net outflows in all days this month other than March 2 and 28. These funds have had a cumulative net inflow of just $2.4 billion, bringing their net assets to $6 billion. Ethereum ETFs have largely failed because of a lack of demand from Wall Street investors. Most of these investors prefer holding and staking ETH, which earns them a good staking return of about 3%. Read more: Ethereum price prediction after the $238 billion wipeout ETH price has crashed because of the soaring competition from the layer-1 and layer-2 industry. Most of its competition is coming from companies layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum. These networks are known for having higher transaction speeds and low costs. Ethereum is also seeing more competition from layer-1 networks like Sui, Solana, and BNB Chain. These factors explain why many analysts have warned that ETH price could crash further. For example, Standard Chartered analysts have lowered their target by 60% to $4,000. ETH price also dived because of the recent leadership crisis at the Ethereum Foundation. Ethereum price crashed because of weak technicals ETH price chart by TradingView Further, technicals suggest that ETH price has more downside to go. The weekly chart shows that Ethereum price made a risky pattern known as a triple-top in 2024. This pattern formed as Ether failed to move above the key resistance point at $4,036 three times. It has now crashed below the important support level at $2,113, the neckline of this pattern and its lowest point on August 5. Ethereum price has plunged below the 50-week and 200-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). A crossover of these two averages will be a death cross, one of the riskiest patterns in the market. ETH price has also plunged below the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement, commonly known as the golden ratio at $1,940. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have all pointed downwards. Ethereum coin has also formed a bearish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign. Therefore, Ethereum price will likely continue falling as sellers target the key support at $1,500, a psychological point that is about 20% below the current level. A move above the key resistance point at $2,113 will invalidate the bearish outlook. Read more: Ethereum price prediction March: Is another 50% crash possible?

The trader who earlier forecasted the growth DOGE while it was still under $0.01 now suggests another promising project . The majority of investors assert that these tokens are among the best crypto to invest in. The value of DeFi coins of these tokens today guarantees future gains. Dogecoin Price Prediction: A New Outlook Dogecoin has dropped in recent weeks. Dogecoin Price Prediction now indicates that its price can go even lower. The current latest news indicates that DOGE can go lower than current prices, as the tensions rise in the market. One trader who has been famous for calling DOGE under $0.01 now warns that the coin can fall further. The turn prompts investors to examine the Dogecoin Price Prediction carefully before they conclude what to do. The token still enjoys a healthy community, but market indicators offer poor technical support. There is a fight expected by the majority if the price trend further declines. Investors are curious whether DOGE will bounce back with the current pressure. Coincodex provides a response in the affirmative with Dogecoin price predictions that it will rise by 229.55% and be trading at $0.5710 by April 26. Remittix: A New DeFi Project with Real-World Impact Remittix is an emerging DeFi project. Remittix solves a very huge issue: expensive and time-wasting cross border payments. The world mostly makes use of zero bank accounts. They can take crypto in a wallet, convert it to a money transfer service, and receive cash to use on everyday essentials.

The meme coin market is buzzing again, and while most investors chase what’s already mooning, savvy bulls know the real bag is in getting in before the hype. The final stages of presales like BTFD Coin (BTFD) are drawing thousands of investors ready to ride the next wave. Add wildcards like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) to the mix, and we might just be staring at the wildest meme coin bull run of 2025. If you’ve been hunting for the top new meme coins for exponential returns, this list breaks down the exact projects with moon potential. BTFD Coin , now in Stage 15 at just $0.0002, is offering a rare shot at a 2900% ROI if it hits its $0.006 moon target. The best part? You can double your coins instantly using the bonus code LAUNCH100 before the offer ends on March 30. Let’s dive into what makes these coins worth your attention—and your wallet. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Last Dip Before the Launch Pad with Limited 100% Bonus Ask yourself: What if you had the chance to invest in a fully-loaded crypto ecosystem before it went live—and the entry point was a fraction of a penny? That’s BTFD Coin right now. With just one stage left before listing at $0.0006, the presale is offering BTFD for $0.0002, giving you 2900% ROI potential if the price hits its forecasted moon value of $0.006. Let’s say you toss in $4500 at the current price. You’d receive 22.5 million BTFD tokens. Apply LAUNCH100 , and boom—you’re sitting on 45 million coins. If BTFD reaches just $0.0006 post-listening, that’s a cool $27,000. And if it hits the projected moon price of $0.006, you’re looking at $270,000. That’s not hype. That’s math. And it’s not just about the price. The full version of BTFD’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game went live on January 1, letting users earn while playing across multiple levels. Add in staking rewards with a juicy 90% APY (live since December 2), and you’ve got a passive income machine. Early investors aren’t just hoping for a pump—they’re collecting coins while they wait. Here’s what the numbers look like: Current Stage : 15 Price : $0.0002 Coins Sold : 72+ billion Holders : Over 11,600 Bulls Presale Raised : $6.43 million and counting Major Alert: Use Code LAUNCH100 and DOUBLE Your Tokens Instantly! How to claim this limited offer: Head to the BTFD Platform Click “Connect Wallet” (supports MetaMask, Trust Wallet) Find the Bonus Code Field, type in LAUNCH100, and hit Apply Enter your purchase amount Smash that “Buy Now” button and approve it in your wallet Don’t sleep on the referral game either! If you make it into the top 20 referrers by the end of the month, you score 10% in BTFD tokens from the raised amount. No fluff, no gimmicks—just a solid meme coin presale that’s stacking real utility. P2E, staking, referrals, community. It’s all here. That’s why BTFD Coin is the #1 pick on this list of the top new meme coins for exponential returns. 2. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) – The Audacious $2.3B Meme Machine Known for its outrageous gas-powered branding, Fartcoin is far from a joke in market cap. This Solana-based token offers humor, hype, and liquidity all rolled into one. Whales are playing big here. A recent $1.87 million dump by a whale barely dented the momentum, suggesting serious community strength. With built-in “Gas Fee” audio antics and massive weekly gains, Fartcoin’s ability to turn attention into traction keeps it in the spotlight. Why did this coin grab a spot on this list? Its viral mechanics, meme-first brand, and high-volume investor base make it a legit contender among the top new meme coins for exponential returns. 3. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) – Cult Classic Turned Crypto Cult GOAT isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a community-powered juggernaut. Built around a god-tier goat deity with eternal rizz, GOAT has become a digital rallying cry for Gen Z humor and crypto rebellion. The project leans into absurdity, but behind that humor lies a tight-knit community and high engagement rates across Web3 platforms. Unlike most memes, GOAT rewards holders with consistent engagement drops, surprise giveaways, and NFT integrations that evolve. It’s quirky, chaotic, and totally crypto-native. What got GOAT on this list? Its ability to turn community chaos into meme coin demand has given it staying power as one of the top new meme coins for exponential returns. Final Thoughts: Don’t Just Watch The Bulls Charge—Join Them Here’s the thing: timing in crypto isn’t just important—it’s everything. With BTFD Coin’s presale nearing its explosive final stage, investors still have one last shot to grab it for $0.0002 and secure that 100% bonus using LAUNCH100 before March 30.

Ripple dived from the year-to-date high of $3.40 to the current $2.2. This crash has led to a $62 billion wipeout as the market cap has plunged from over $189 billion to $127 billion. XRP price crash despite strong fundamentals The ongoing XRP price crash happened even after Ripple had some substantial positive news recently. Its most important news came earlier this month when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted to end its appeal against Ripple Labs. This was an important thing because it meant that Ripple paid just a fraction of the $2 billion that the agency wanted. Further, the decision means that Ripple Labs will now be at liberty to sign more deals in the United States. According to Brad Garlingouse, Ripple largely stopped making any major deals in the US following the SEC lawsuit, with most of its business coming from other countries. Many American companies cited the ongoing litigation for refusing the deal. Therefore, with the Ripple case done, analysts anticipate that there will be more deals going on. Indeed, Garlinghouse noted that the number of deals signed six weeks after Trump’s election were more than those signed six months before that. XRP price crashed even after Ripple continued its partnerships and regulatory wins. It recently partnered with Chipper Cash , a popular payment network in Africa. The company will now use Ripple’s technology to improve its payment network over time. Ripple ETF odds have risen The XRP price has also crashed as the odds of a Ripple ETF approval have jumped. There are now over 10 XRP ETF applications from popular companies like Grayscale, Canary, and Franklin Templeton. Analysts believe that the SEC has no good reason to reject these funds since it has already accepted Bitcoin and Ethereum. Also, the judiciary has said that XRP is not a security. Indeed, Polymarket odds of an XRP ETF approval have jumped to over 86% this year. Most importantly, Ripple has the resources it needs to build a viable alternative to SWIFT, a payment network that handles over $150 trillion in transactions each year. To succeed, Ripple will need to onboard as many banks as possible, which is now possible now that the company’s legal liabilities have ended. Banks and consumers will prefer the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) because it is a faster and cheaper alternative to SWIFT. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that the XRP price has dropped this year. Its attempts to recover have found substantial resistance in the past few months. It has now plunged below the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level at $2.24, a sign that the downward momentum is continuing. Ripple price has also sunk below the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. Most notably, it has formed a head and shoulders pattern, a popular bearish sign in technical analysis. Therefore, there are odds that the XRP price will continue falling in the coming weeks. This bearish view will become valid if the coin plunges below the support at $1.9770, the neckline of this H&S pattern. The bearish outlook will be invalidated if the coin rises above the key resistance level at $3.0.

Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel shared the video and commented that “so much” of his professional life and net worth depend on Buterin but reiterated that the entertaining interaction makes him “bullish.” Community links video to Ether price speculation Pseudonymous crypto trader Scott Crypto Warrior shared the video with his 514,300 X followers and said, “Pray for our ETH bags.” The short clip shows Buterin on his knees, gesturing at a four-legged robot and letting out what sounds like a “meow” before patting it on the head.

Meanwhile, since Ether reclaimed the $4,000 price level in December 2024, it has dropped nearly 55%. At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $1,841, down 13.34% over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether is trading at $1,841 at the time of publication.

42624824,https://timestabloid.com/?p=62195,1743312614,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Why Remittix Is A Better Investment Than PI, Ripple (XRP) And Trump Coin In April",https://timestabloid.com/why-remittix-is-a-better-investment-than-pi-ripple-xrp-and-trump/,"Surprised that Remittix is a better investment than PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April? The cryptocurrency market continues to fluctuate incredibly, and investors seek strong and promising altcoins. Remittix has been drawing a lot of interest this month with its immense growth prospects and useful application, distinguishing it from mainline coins like PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin. Why Remittix is a better investment than PI and other failing altcoins PI Coin was previously traded at $0.7954, after experiencing a large 4.58% fall. With a market cap of $5.36 billion, PI initially caught the market’s attention with its mining-style model. Investor demand seems to be falling in a rush now, however. PI’s 24-hour trading volume dropped considerably by nearly 30% to $162.8 million, reflecting decreasing investor interest. Uncertainty about the future of the coin and postponed mainnet listings have significantly impacted investor sentiment, which has led them to choose better projects. When looking at why Remittix is a better investment than PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April, Remittix greatly outweighs PI Coin by offering practical solutions in the real world and not speculative future application. With its presale exceeding $14.2 million, Remittix shows strong demand. XRP Faces Challenges: Why Remittix Is a Better Investment Than PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April XRP is trading at $2.10, losing 3.33%. The market cap for XRP stands at a tremendous $122.82 billion and has always captured the interest of investors, particularly with regard to cross-border transactions. However, despite recent lawsuit settlements, its price struggles. The volume on XRP is down slightly at 1.55% to $3.96 billion, indicating investor reservation. While there are use cases for XRP, persistent regulation concerns and the increasing competition for payments limit its short-term growth potential. This situation highlights why Remittix is a superior investment to PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April. Remittix, as compared to XRP, has fewer regulatory challenges and provides a streamlined, low-cost crypto-to-fiat payments solution already enjoying robust user acceptance worldwide. Trump Coin’s Popularity Wanes, Illustrating Why Remittix Is a Superior Investment to PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April Trump Coin now sits at $10.02, losing a precipitous 1.99% and trimming its market cap to some $2 billion. Though an early darling among the base, Trump Coin is panned as having no intrinsic utility other than political leanings. Its trading volume fell 44% to $285.03 million, showing rapidly falling investor demand. Political-tokened coins are likely to be prone to rapid price movements based on the whims of popular sentiments and news cycles, so Trump Coin is incredibly volatile and risky. In the meantime, Remittix provides a solid alternative with clearly defined real-world use and concrete advantages, reiterating that Remittix is a better investment than PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April. Practical Utility Distinguishes Remittix from PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin Apart from speculative tokens, Remittix jumps to address global financial issues by completing efficient crypto-to-fiat conversions. The working utility invites investors seeking tangible, long-term value rather than speculating on unpredictable market trends. For instance, a Latin American mid-sized travel agency can easily get paid by customers worldwide through Remittix. The agency used to only expect delayed bank transfers and high fees, but the agency can now easily get instant crypto payments easily converted into local currency, significantly improving cash flow. Yet another example: An African aid receiving humanitarian services from a European NGO can efficiently exchange crypto donations for local money via Remittix. What it implies is swifter disbursing of donations, less chance of hold-up due to standard banking, and additional fees, which makes the charities an essential gain. Remittix versus PI, Ripple (XRP), Trump Coin in April: Long-Term Value and User Adoption: Why Remittix is a sounder investment choice As PI, XRP, and Trump Coin undergo volatile popularity and lingering issues, Remittix consistently demonstrates strong user adoption. Its token presale has incredibly surpassed over 518 million tokens sold, decidedly pointing to investor confidence and faith. Moreover, Remittix’s easy payment solution addresses the true pain points of international finance, drawing in retail users as well as institutional partners. Such real-time usability fuels mass adoption, providing a sound foundation for sustainable growth. Compared to PI’s uncertain future, XRP’s legal battles, and Trump Coin’s declining popularity, Remittix provides a safer investment path. Investors seeking a cryptocurrency with clear, actionable benefits find Remittix’s model attractive, particularly during periods of market uncertainty. Choose Remittix for Stable and Practical Gains in April In April’s shifting crypto landscape, it’s clear why Remittix is a better investment than PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April. PI’s falling momentum, Ripple’s legal uncertainties, and Trump Coin’s speculative risks make them vulnerable to further declines. On the other hand, Remittix offers a secure, pragmatic investment opportunity with direct benefits. Its crypto-to-fiat model serves real-world needs, providing immediate value and drawing widespread user adoption. Ultimately, investors seeking reliability, stability, and practical benefits in the crypto market will find Remittix a strong contender. Its impressive growth, open utility, and widespread adoption make Remittix a great choice for significant and long-term gains this April and beyond. Want to invest in crypto with real-world utility?

While Toshi’s Bullish Surge and Floki Inu’s Metaverse Moves in Focus: Best Meme Coins to Buy for 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/arctic-pablos-final-presale-days-while-toshis-bullish-surge-and-floki-inus-metaverse-moves-in-focus-best-meme-coins-to-buy-for-2025/,"Crypto markets are buzzing after the March 2025 Core Update and looming U.S. economic turbulence. As traditional assets wobble, meme coins are staging a savage comeback. With Google’s update slapping stale sites and boosting high-engagement, community-driven content, projects like Arctic Pablo Coin are going viral, while inflation fears are driving retail and Gen Z investors into high-APY digital assets. Enter Arctic Pablo—more than just a meme coin. It’s a full-blown mythical expedition. Picture this: a lone explorer on a snowmobile tearing through frozen wastelands, chasing legendary treasure buried in Earth’s hidden realms. New holders are rewarded with increasing value, access, and story-driven hype at every icy stop. That’s not fiction—it’s the Arctic Pablo Coin presale. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) – The Adventure-Powered Meme Coin Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just the best new meme coin to buy for 2025—it’s rewriting the rules of what a meme coin can be. Built on Binance Smart Chain ($BSC) as a BEP20 token, $APC follows an epic presale journey across mysterious global locations instead of basic “stages.” Now, in Location 16—Crystal Cove—Arctic Pablo, it is priced at $0.000083, with over $2 million already raised. With a listing price at $0.008, the potential ROI is absolutely off the charts—up to 9552.41%. That means a $100 investment now turns into $9,638.55. Investors can also rake in 66% APY via the exclusive staking program. The next location drop could happen any moment. Miss this one; the next entry point won’t be this cheap again. Let’s break down the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. Each location represents a new opportunity for holders to get in early before Pablo moves on. What makes this ride irresistible? Weekly token burns. Every time Pablo leaves a location, unsold tokens are torched on-chain, slashing supply and boosting value. Combined with a deflationary tokenomics model and limited presale supply (50%), this coin’s scarcity hits different. The total supply of $APC is 221.2 billion, but only half is public. With strategic allocations to staking (15%), ecosystem growth (20%), and community rewards (10%), Arctic Pablo isn’t just about hype—it’s about long-term sustainability. Investors can also stake their holdings for a massive 66% APY, locked for just two months from launch. That’s compound growth and narrative magic wrapped in one. The buzz is real, and Pablo’s journey is heating up. Crystal Cove could close any day now. The next location? Higher price. Less ROI. The time to jump in is now. Arctic Pablo is hands-down one of the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025 —and this might be your last shot at ground-floor prices. Toshi – The Dogfather-Inspired Coin Backed by Tech-Savvy Community Power Toshi is named after the tech titan himself—Satoshi Nakamoto. But this ain’t no wannabe Bitcoin. Toshi is a meme coin bred for digital domination, built on a decentralised future. It’s got slick branding, sharp tokenomics, and one of the most aggressive community-shilling strategies seen in 2025. That puts it firmly among the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. Toshi’s smart contract is built on Ethereum, making it rock-solid and secure. Its tokenomics model is laser-focused on rewarding holders, with massive liquidity and low slippage. That means easy buys and fewer rug-pull risks. But the magic of Toshi lies in its community—an army of TikTokers, Twitter warriors, and Discord strategists hyping this coin into virality. Between the sharp tech, iconic branding, and grassroots clout, Toshi is making a strong case as one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy for 2025, especially for those betting on community-first crypto plays. Floki Inu – Viking Hype Meets Meme Coin Muscle If there’s one meme coin that refuses to die, it’s Floki Inu. Born from Elon Musk’s legendary Shiba pup, Floki took its early 2021 meme status and evolved into a full-blown DeFi and metaverse powerhouse. In 2025, it’s back in the spotlight—refreshed, reloaded, and tearing up the altcoin charts. If you’re hunting for the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025, Floki Inu deserves another look. With a massive global fanbase, anime-themed merch drops, and real-life marketing in places like London’s Underground, Floki’s comeback tour is in full swing. While the ROI might not match Arctic Pablo’s astronomical leap, it’s got serious blue-chip meme coin potential—and stability that newer tokens envy. Floki Inu mixes hype with heritage, and that combo is the winning formula heading into Q2 2025. For anyone looking to spread risk and still stay deep in meme coin territory, Floki’s legacy and expanding utility make it one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. Final Thoughts: Don’t Let These Opportunities Slip Away Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Toshi, and Floki Inu aren’t just hype—they’re the real deal regarding the Best Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. But out of the three, Arctic Pablo Coin offers the most jaw-dropping upside, thanks to its myth-driven presale journey, weekly token burns, 66% APY staking, and an insane 9552.41% ROI opportunity. The entry point is too good to ignore with Pablo currently at Crystal Cove (Location 16). This location could close anytime, and the next one will come at a higher price. This is the window. Don’t overthink it. Join the Pablo meme coin presale now, before this legendary explorer disappears into the next realm—and takes the low prices with him.

The recent nose has now started showing a new setup that might indicate a significant sell-off could be lurking around. Although analysts believe the Ripple price prediction could be bullish this year, the recent price drop could set a tone for a near-term bear. To add to the pressure of the Ripple price prediction, the new Remittix token is now dubbed XRP 2.0, which could fuel a move away from Ripple. Here are the details of the story. Is The ETF Delay Fueling A Bearish Ripple Price Prediction? Investors rushed to Ripple coins earlier this year with two landmark announcements: the Ripple ETF filing and the US crypto reserve . However, as the days progress and no confirmation date is in sight, investors seem to be getting tired already, and this is already showing in the price setup. More interestingly, while earlier predictions showed that the price could hit a new high this year, the recent trending Ripple price prediction now has a heavy bearish undertone. Could the delay with the ETF filling be a significant setback for the Ripple price prediction? There is a mix of interest regarding the point in focus as many analysts consider the price to be fueled largely by the Ripple solution with settlement and payment rather than mere ETF future. However, from another perspective, many recent investors have continued banking on the Ripple price surging this year, with the ETF approval set as a significant catalyst. Furthermore, the rise in other competitors could also drive more bearish sentiment toward the Ripple price prediction in the future. Why Remittix’s XRP 2.0 Speculation Could Be A Strong Signal To Watch Closely As new solutions continue to join the crypto market, those without stronger backing and widespread utility could be a bubble with short-term growth. However, the recent rise of the Remittix exchange and the discovery of its many solutions have shown that the market might readjust to accommodate a new top altcoin. Funny enough, while this new altcoin is still in presale, top market analysts call it the XRP 2.0. But why is this new player compared to the more established crypto payment giant? Many of these analysts believe the approach the Remittix exchange introduces could revolutionize the crypto payment sector in the coming months. Remittix takes in crypto and helps users convert it to FIAT currencies that can be readily sent across the globe to a desired bank account; It’s that simple! While others seem to do similar, none has a cross-border connection that helps crypto users send money directly to a bank account using their crypto without going through p2p. With Remittix removing the middleman problem, crypto users can now get full control and security over their asset, giving them freedom to do more. But while it has attracted the attention of top investors in the last few months, small investors also stand a chance to take a position now before it’s too late. The presale price, which remained below $0.1, is an opportunity for everyone to get a good entry. Although the Remittix presale raised over $14.2M within the short period it started, the gradual price growth has been an opportunity for continuous growth. Don’t miss the opportunity with the presale price today, as this could be the best opportunity to invest in the future of crypto payments.

Shiba Inu’s massive SHIB burn and Layer-2 activity, alongside Chainlink’s push toward $20, reflect strong narratives—but they remain anchored in price sentiment and market behavior. In contrast, BlockDAG is shifting focus from price to performance. Its Beta Testnet isn’t about speculation—it’s about validating what works. With over 15,000 transactions daily and 200+ mining nodes active, BlockDAG is stress-testing its core systems ahead of a 2025 mainnet launch. While others ride market waves, BlockDAG is defining what readiness looks like. **(Keyword: Beta Testnet)** Shiba Inu’s Burn Rate Skyrockets Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently witnessed a dramatic surge in its burn rate, with over 1 billion tokens incinerated within a 24-hour period—a 57,000% increase. This spike was primarily driven by a single user transferring 1 billion SHIB to a dead address, effectively removing them from circulation. However, despite this aggressive burning activity, SHIB’s price has remained relatively stable, hovering around $0.00001443 after a 55% decline from its yearly high. From a technical perspective, analysis reveals the formation of a megaphone pattern on the weekly chart, suggesting potential for a bullish breakout. If confirmed, this pattern could lead to an upswing of approximately 130%, targeting the $0.00003395 level. At the same time, Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 network, is approaching a milestone of 1 billion transactions, indicating growing utility and engagement within the ecosystem. The network has processed over 975 million transactions, with more than 245,000 accounts and 10.15 million blocks. Chainlink (LINK) Targets $20 with a Bullish Breakout Chainlink’s native token, LINK, is exhibiting a bullish trajectory, having broken out of a descending parallel channel that commenced in February 2025. Currently, LINK maintains support at $15.15 and is aiming to surpass the $20 threshold in the near future. Notably, the recent price surge enabled LINK to breach the 200 EMA, positioning it to potentially reach $19.30. The $20 mark remains a significant psychological level for traders and investors. In support of this, on-chain metrics further validate the optimistic outlook. Data from Santiment indicates that LINK’s social dominance has peaked in recent weeks, suggesting increased market interest. Additionally, development activity has intensified since early March 2025, and a reduction in LINK’s exchange supply implies accumulation by whales and investors. Taken together, these factors point towards a bullish scenario for LINK’s future performance. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Launch Marks Final Phase Before 2025 Mainnet—Here’s What’s Being Tested With its mainnet launch planned for later in 2025, BlockDAG has entered the final proving ground: the Beta “Primordial” Testnet. Rather than serving as a showcase, this phase is a systems check. Every aspect of the network is being actively validated to ensure that what launches later this year meets both performance and security benchmarks. To that end, the testnet is designed to simulate full-capacity conditions. BlockDAG is targeting a minimum of 15,000 daily transactions and over 200 active mining nodes to validate scalability and decentralization. Wallet compatibility is also under scrutiny, with seamless MetaMask integration and cross-platform functionality being closely tested. Developers are deploying smart contracts, users are engaging through dApps, and token vesting is being trialed with over 110,000 investor accounts. Importantly, the real-world feedback and metrics gathered during this period will determine how the system behaves under pressure—critical insight for final mainnet adjustments. Simultaneously, the current rollout ties in with BlockDAG’s presale traction: $209 million raised, over 18.9 billion coins sold, and an ROI of 2,380% since batch 1. Now in batch 27 at $0.0248, the project continues to gain momentum as its infrastructure proves it’s ready. Ultimately, from transaction volume to smart contract deployment to investor token vesting, the testnet is more than a technical milestone—it’s a full simulation of what users and developers can expect once the mainnet goes live. For BlockDAG, it’s the last step before launch becomes reality. From Token Burns to Testnet Proof Momentum can come from price patterns, whale activity, or technical signals—but sustainability comes from systems that actually function under pressure. Shiba Inu’s burn spike and Chainlink’s bullish setup have sparked attention, yet both depend on favorable reactions. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is stress-testing every layer of its infrastructure through a live Beta Testnet—processing thousands of transactions daily, engaging over 200 miners, and integrating smart contracts and wallets in real time. As other projects build narratives around what could happen, BlockDAG is already collecting data on what’s working. The difference lies in what’s measurable.

Learn how these platforms are expanding and gaining traction. The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, with bullish trends emerging as new platforms become prominent. While some platforms wane over time, others ascend, demonstrating their durability and long-term appeal. With the market exhibiting positive trends, users seek platforms that provide stability and potential for significant growth. Among the top crypto platforms currently are Binance Coin (BNB), BlockDAG (BDAG), TRON (TRX), and Toncoin (TON). These platforms have demonstrated consistent growth, burgeoning ecosystems, and growing user bases. As the market progresses, they are positioned for potentially larger increases. Let’s delve into what makes them strong candidates in the current bullish cycle. 1. BlockDAG: Top Crypto Platform with Most Potential Growth in 2025 As market volatility increases, presale platforms have caught the attention of savvy users in 2025. BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with substantial interest. Distinct from traditional blockchains, BlockDAG utilizes a DAG ledger to enhance scalability, transaction speed, and efficiency. BlockDAG has also significantly influenced crypto mining with its X Series miners, especially the X1 Miner App. This app, popular among novices and seasoned miners alike, provides an uncomplicated and effective method for mining BDAG coins. With over 500,000 active miners, the X1 app is rapidly expanding as more individuals seek to capitalize on profits before the rise in mining challenges. BDAG continues to establish itself as a top crypto platform, with its presale exceeding $208.5 million and 18.9 billion coins distributed. Its community of over 170,000 unique holders shows robust market confidence, while early participants have experienced a 2,380% increase in price since the first batch. With the mainnet launch anticipated this year, projections suggest BDAG could reach $1, presenting substantial returns for early purchasers at its current price. 2. Binance Coin: Expanding Utility in a Robust Ecosystem Originally introduced as a utility asset for the Binance platform, Binance Coin (BNB) provided users with discounted trading fees. Over time, BNB has become integral to the crypto marketplace, facilitating transactions, staking, and initial offerings via the Binance Launchpad. As Binance maintains its status as a leading exchange, BNB’s significance remains closely linked to its operational success. With Binance’s ventures into decentralized finance (DeFi) and the growth of its Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem, BNB now powers a variety of applications in dApps, DeFi projects, and smart contracts. Its widening adoption ensures that BNB is a top crypto platform for users seeking assets with enduring value. The ongoing expansion of its ecosystem underscores its potential for further growth. 3. TRON: Pioneering Decentralization in Digital Content TRON (TRX) is crafted to empower content creators by eliminating intermediaries from digital platforms. Emphasizing a decentralized internet, TRON facilitates direct interactions among users, positioning it as a vital component in Web3 developments. Its blockchain is rapidly growing, supporting an increasing number of dApps and DeFi projects. A significant development for TRON was its acquisition of BitTorrent, which brought decentralized file-sharing to its suite of services. As TRON continues to attract developers and its DeFi offerings expand, TRX’s value is on the rise. With its growing ecosystem and practical applications, TRX stands out as a top crypto platform for those interested in blockchain’s evolving domain. 4. Toncoin: Revolutionizing Decentralized Social Media Toncoin (TON) draws attention with its association with Telegram, a major global messaging service. Focused on decentralized social media and secure communications, TON distinguishes itself from conventional blockchain initiatives. Utilizing Telegram’s extensive user base, TON aims to mainstream blockchain technology to a global audience. TON is making strides with new initiatives to integrate dApps and services within Telegram, enhancing its ecosystem continually. Its pivotal role in decentralized communications positions it as a formidable force in Web3 social media. With its user base widening and adoption increasing, TON ranks as a top crypto platform for those monitoring blockchain’s impact on social media. Overview: Top Crypto Platforms to Watch in 2025 In conclusion, let’s review the top crypto platforms for 2025, emphasizing those poised for significant attention this year. Binance Coin is broadening its functionality within DeFi and smart contracts. TRON is transforming the domain of digital content and decentralized applications, whereas Toncoin is advancing by merging blockchain with secure messaging and social media. The BlockDAG presale is notably promising, particularly due to its significant expansion thus far. The presale for BDAG has escalated beyond $208.5 million, with more than 18.9 billion coins distributed. With predictions suggesting a rise to $1, acquiring BDAG now might yield considerable gains at launch, as this platform is expected to experience substantial growth in the upcoming months.

While Hyperliquid’s recent price rebound and NEAR Protocol’s network upgrade have been noteworthy, it’s Dragoin’s token burn strategy that truly merits attention.

With every token not sold in the presale gets burned, Dragoin $DDGN establishes genuine scarcity from the outset, securing a strategic advantage for early investors in a market typically driven by long-term promises and speculative ventures. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Token’s 25% Recovery Surge Following a steep 55% fall from $27.53 to $12.06 between February 18 and March 13, Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) token has made a significant comeback, rising to over $16—a 25% increase within the past week. This surge indicates a resurgence of buying interest, although the technical analysis reveals a more nuanced scenario. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is still negative at -0.30, suggesting that sell-offs continue to dominate. Conversely, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a positive outlook, with the 12-day EMA surpassing the 26-day EMA, signaling bullish prospects. This mixed signal from the indicators points to a possible further appreciation in price, with potential targets at $18.35 and $22.23 if the buying momentum continues. However, should the upward trend not maintain its pace, the token might revisit the support level at $12.06. NEAR Protocol Boosts Network Capacity by 33% NEAR Protocol has successfully increased its mainnet capacity by enlarging it from six to eight shards, resulting in a 33% enhancement in network throughput. This upgrade brings in the capability for single-block resharding, which replaces the previous requirement for hour-long state rebuilds. Validators can now adjust shard states within a single block, reducing downtime and smoothing the transition towards dynamic resharding. This feature allows the network to automatically modify the number of shards to alleviate congestion effectively. Additionally, NEAR has proven its ability to execute multiple shard splits at the same time, marking an essential progression towards its ambitious objective of accommodating fifty shards on the mainnet. Dragoin’s Token Burn Strategy Boosts Early Investor Rewards Dragoin’s presale strategy is designed to enhance early investor value through a decisive token burn of all unsold tokens. Rather than reallocating unsold tokens or saving them for future use, Dragoin completely eliminates them, permanently reducing the total supply. This action immediately constrains supply and introduces deflationary pressure right from the start. The presale is structured into 25 stages, each with a predetermined allocation of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens. Any tokens that remain unsold at the end of each stage are permanently removed, thereby not only clearing out excess supply but also boosting scarcity. This mechanism ensures that early investors benefit from increased token rarity and potential for quicker value growth, as each token burn effectively increases the value of the remaining tokens. Early stage participants gain doubly: they purchase at lower prices and benefit as subsequent stages see further token burns, enhancing the value of their holdings. Unlike models where the supply might increase, Dragoin’s strategy ties value directly to community engagement and actual usage, making scarcity a fundamental economic advantage rather than just a promotional strategy. Currently, at $0.0000292 in the Stage 1 presale, Dragoin is projected to launch at $0.002, offering a potential return of 6,700%. For those undecided, every token not sold is an opportunity lost. The fewer tokens that remain after the presale, the higher the demand will need to be to match the dwindling supply. Dragoin doesn’t just gradually build value—it ignites it with each token burn. Immediate Scarcity Over Speculative Promise While Hyperliquid shows potential technical growth and NEAR Protocol enhances its scale, neither can match the direct, tangible value shift offered by Dragoin’s token burn mechanism. Unlike others that focus on building hype with promises of future enhancements, Dragoin actively diminishes its supply—providing early adopters with tangible benefits right from the start. Scarcity isn’t something Dragoin plans for the future; it’s crafted immediately. For those balancing the allure of short-term gains with solid long-term principles, Dragoin doesn’t merely weave an enticing narrative—it substantiates it with concrete outcomes. In a market where surplus often undermines value, Dragoin takes a different approach by affirming its early supporters’ trust right away.

In a recent video posted on X, Hilton stated his belief that XRP, like all major cryptocurrencies, is subject to daily manipulation and that its price is being deliberately suppressed. Hilton asserted that financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, are regularly manipulated. “Stocks are being manipulated every single day,” he stated, comparing traditional finance to digital assets.

Another notable expert recently drew attention to the role of market makers in suppressing XRP’s price . Hilton emphasized that the relatively low liquidity in the crypto market makes it easier for these forces to influence prices. Regarding XRP specifically, Hilton expressed confidence that its price is being held down. He cited market data and price charts as evidence. He also dismissed claims that manipulation occurs within the XRP Ledger, stating, “I don’t really think there’s manipulation going on in that context.” Instead, he focused on broader financial market forces impacting XRP and other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Cardano.

He reaffirmed his belief in the asset’s long-term potential, stating that he expects it to rise by 20X, 30X, or 40X at some point. His confidence is based on the expectation that regulatory clarity and institutional adoption will eventually drive significant price appreciation. Hilton also described the cryptocurrency market as the “last big financial frontier,” comparing its current stage to the early days of the stock market. In his view, the presence of manipulation does not negate the long-term opportunities within the space. “Am I going to let the fact that this is happening to XRP make me sell my XRP? No,” he said. Experts believe that institutions like BlackRock are looking to accumulate XRP at low prices , and selling tokens now could cost investors significant profits in the future and allow these institutions to dominate the market. Hilton’s position on XRP remains firm despite concerns about price suppression. He shared insights into his personal investment strategy, emphasizing a long-term approach. He stated that he continues to buy and hold tokens, even amid market manipulation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Analysts Weigh In,https://cryptopotato.com/is-eth-dead-as-an-investment-analysts-weigh-in/,"Ether’s (ETH) underperformance as an asset has continued to spark criticism and speculation in the crypto community, with many expressing their displeasure at the Ethereum network’s current trajectory. Quinn Thompson, founder of the discretionary macro hedge fund Lekker Capital, insists that ETH is now completely dead as an investment. While some analysts and market participants do not agree with him, others concur with him, giving reasons for their opinions. ETH is Dead as an Investment To substantiate his stance, Thompson mentioned that ETH, an asset with a market cap of $225 billion, is seeing a decline in transaction activity, user growth, fees, and revenue. Although the Ethereum network still has utility, he believes it is dead as an investment. “There is no investment case here. As a network with utility? Yes. As an investment? Absolutely not,” the Lekker Capital founder stated. In alignment with Thompson’s view, Nic Carter, co-founder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics and partner at the blockchain venture capital firm Castle Island Ventures, explained why ETH is dead as an investment. According to Carter, the main reason is that greedy Ethereum layer-2 networks are siphoning value from the blockchain, and that there is a social consensus that the creation of excess tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem is okay. The analyst said ETH died by its own hand because it had been buried “in an avalanche of its own tokens.” Analysts Blame L2s, VCs, Bitcoin Maxis Responding to Carter’s tweet, Thompson asserted that the social consensus that found the excess token creation okay happened because the emergence of endless layer-2 chains, staking, and restaking protocols enriched the pockets of developers and team members. However, now that the situation has turned awry, no one wants to admit that the concept was wrong, especially with the market saying it was a mistake. Furthermore, a pseudonymous analyst insisted that “Solana scammers” and Bitcoin maximalists cheered the creation of excess tokens on Ethereum. Since venture capitalists could not “shill” ETH, they had to sponsor the development of infinite layer-1 networks so they could dump on retailers. “If we would all come together around ETH as a community, it would be inherently strong and wouldn’t need outside banks or institutions. But bitcoin maxis were and are too afraid of it because it’s everything bitcoin(number go up and down coin) wants to be,” the analyst said. At the time of writing, ETH was worth around $1,830, having lost almost 50% of its value from a year ago. The post Is ETH Dead as an Investment?

Former Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported the development, highlighting that Ripple was not included in the announcement. Terrett noted that while some may have expected Ripple’s case to be addressed simultaneously, the procedural differences make its resolution distinct from the other cases. No @Ripple here but I’m not entirely surprised because, again, it is slightly different to these other cases in that (as @s_alderoty mentioned in his post) the SEC now has to go to the Southern District and ask Judge Torres to lift the standard injunction. Once that is done, they… https://t.co/KVjCsR6l2V — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 27, 2025 SEC’s Legal Actions and Dismissals The SEC’s lawsuits against Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland were part of the agency’s broader enforcement efforts against companies operating in the cryptocurrency space. The decision to dismiss these cases suggests a shift in the SEC’s litigation strategy, though the reasons behind the dismissals remain unspecified in the agency’s announcement. Terrett pointed out that Ripple’s case differs from the others because the SEC must first request Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to lift the standard injunction previously imposed at the SEC’s request. Once that process is completed, the SEC can vote on the final steps in the case, including its appeal withdrawal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Case Nears Final Resolution Terrett referenced a post by Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, which provided additional details on the finalization of the SEC v. Ripple case. According to Alderoty, the SEC has already agreed to drop its appeal without conditions, and Ripple will withdraw its cross-appeal. As part of the resolution, Ripple will pay $50 million of the originally imposed $125 million fine, while the remaining amount will be returned to the company. Alderoty explained that the SEC will now ask the court to lift the injunction, and the process will be subject to the necessary commission vote, drafting of final documents, and standard court procedures. He indicated this should be the last update on the case, signaling that the long-running legal battle between the SEC and Ripple is nearing its conclusion. Broader Implications The SEC’s dismissal of cases against Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland, along with the expected resolution of the Ripple lawsuit, reflects ongoing changes in the agency’s regulatory approach to the cryptocurrency industry. The outcomes of these cases may influence future enforcement actions and provide further clarity on the SEC’s stance regarding digital asset companies. With Ripple’s case requiring additional procedural steps, the company awaits the court’s decision on lifting the injunction before the SEC can finalize its legal actions. While the agency has not publicly explained its rationale for the dismissals, these developments indicate that the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency firms continues to evolve.

For those looking to diversify beyond the usual suspects like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there’s a whole universe of altcoins offering unique opportunities. Among these, Qubetics, Render, and Arbitrum have been making waves, each carving out its own niche and attracting a growing number of backers. Enter Qubetics , a project that’s been turning heads with its ambitious presale and innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization. With impressive milestones under its belt, it’s positioning itself as a strong contender in the altcoin arena. By bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology, Qubetics is unlocking new levels of liquidity and accessibility. As adoption grows, it has the potential to reshape the way assets are bought, sold, and traded globally. Qubetics: The World’s First Web3 Aggregator Qubetics is making headlines with its ongoing crypto presale , currently in its 27th stage. Priced at $0.1300, the project has already raised over $15.5 million, boasting more than 23,900 token holders and over 504 million $TICS tokens sold.

This approach not only democratizes access to investment opportunities but also enhances liquidity and transparency in asset transactions. A $200 Investment in Qubetics Could Be Your Ticket to Massive Gains Let’s break it down with a $200 investment at the current price of $0.1300 per $TICS. That would get you approximately 1,538 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, your $200 turns into $1,538, marking a 669% ROI. If it climbs to $5, that same investment explodes to $7,692, an astonishing 3,745% ROI. At $10 per $TICS, you’re sitting on a massive $15,384, and if it soars to $15, your $200 investment skyrockets to $23,077—a jaw-dropping 11,437% return. With adoption growing and analysts projecting TICS as a major player in the Web3 space, the opportunity to get in at this low price won’t last long. Those who act now could be looking at potentially life-changing gains, while those who hesitate might find themselves priced out when $TICS starts making big moves. These projections have many considering Qubetics as one of the best altcoins to invest in now.

In a recent tweet, the analyst pointed out that XRP typically exhibits two peaks during major bull runs. This pattern was observed in both the 2017 and 2021 market cycles. The tweet emphasizes that 2017 XRP’s second peak occurred 120 days after the initial surge, while in 2021, it took approximately 90 days. Based on this historical data, Egrag Crypto suggests that XRP could follow a similar timeline in the current cycle. The attached chart illustrates XRP’s RSI fluctuations, marking significant peaks in previous cycles. The analysis indicates that XRP is positioned in a phase comparable to past pre-peak periods. If the pattern holds, the next major price movement could align with the projected 90 to 120-day window.

The analyst has identified resistance levels around $66, $70, and $76 while also marking higher targets at $85, $88, and $89. If XRP follows the historical trend, these levels could come into play as the price moves toward a possible ATH. The market sentiment surrounding XRP remains a key factor in determining whether this projection materializes. Historically, XRP’s price movements have been influenced by regulatory developments and overall market conditions. While past trends provide valuable insights, external factors could impact XRP’s trajectory. Egrag Crypto’s tweet concludes with encouragement for the XRP community , urging holders to remain steady as the market progresses. The statement reinforces confidence in the asset’s potential, aligning with the analyst’s long-term bullish outlook. The 90 to 120-day timeframe places the anticipated price action within the middle of 2025. If XRP follows its historical RSI pattern, investors could witness a significant movement in the coming months. However, as with all market predictions, the outcome remains subject to broader market dynamics and investor sentiment.

On the Thinking Crypto podcast, Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic analytics , gave a detailed analysis of what’s happening with XRP and where it could head in the short, mid, and long term. Short-Term Outlook (Next Few Weeks to Months): Right now, XRP is holding strong above its 200-day moving average cloud, which sits between $1.76 and $1.80. This is key because it shows XRP’s resilience even when the broader crypto market is shaky. While the price action isn’t super bullish, the fact that XRP stays above this level is a good sign. (Source: @Wealthmanagerrr ) Some charts even hint at a possible “head and shoulders” pattern, which could mean a pullback. But as long as XRP holds above that $1.76 support, it’s not all bad news. Mid-Term Outlook (Next 6 to 12 Months): Next, XRP’s relative strength stands out compared to other altcoins. While many coins are trading below their 200-day averages, XRP is holding its ground. This could mean a possible breakout if the overall market improves. If XRP manages to break above key resistance levels, we might see a price surge towards $3 or higher. However, the market’s cautious mood means we’ll need to see strong bullish signs before getting too optimistic. Long-Term Outlook (1 to 2 Years and Beyond): For the long haul, XRP’s story is tied to regulatory developments and broader crypto adoption. If the market turns bullish again, XRP could ride that wave. Analysts are watching closely for signs of a sustained trend above the 200-day average, which could lead to a new bull run. In the best-case scenario, XRP could reach $5 or more, but that’s contingent on positive market conditions and potential regulatory clarity.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-30 06:48:03

Either way, a video of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin went viral and not in a good way. The crypto community on X.com, rarely known for decorum, blasted Buterin for kneeling before a robot and emitting what sounds like a “meow” sound. To some, the video underscored why one needs to be “bullish” about Ethereum’s present and future. To others, it was worthy of a Studio Ghibli-style photo edit. Most people kept scrolling. See below. https://twitter.com/Philfog/status/1905634153535541262 In the brief clip, Buterin pats the robot on the head after making the unusual sound. While he has yet to comment on the video, the moment has ignited chatter, particularly given Ether’s recent price struggles. As of publication, Ether has dropped nearly 55% since reclaiming the $4,000 mark in December 2024, now trading at $1,833 — down over 8% in the past week. Source: CoinGecko Some crypto figures have expressed concern, with commentator “The Count of Monte Crypto” humorously noting that the state of Ether’s price was more worrying than Buterin’s quirky behavior. And when Buterin tried posting about “how to fund public goods,” he was trolled by the crypto community with statements like: “NO ONE F–KING CARE[S]” and “YOU ARE THE ONLY FOUNDER THAT IS DOING 0 APART FROM DUMPING YOUR AIRDROPS! WAKE UP VITALIK.” It’s noteworthy that Buterin has long been known for being quirky and, according to a recent Bloomberg feature, “monkish.” But his behavior occasionally invites scrutiny. Iggy Azalea, for example, dissed Buterin for singing at TOKEN2049 in Singapore, calling it “loser s—.” Buterin is also not clear-cut in his political affiliation, which is somewhat refreshing for today’s polarized crypto traders. He has spoken openly against former SEC chair Gary Gensler as well as the dangers of “large-scale political coins” — seemingly a critique at Trump. Indeed, many crypto leaders have embraced Trump’s pro-crypto stance, but Buterin has distanced himself, rejecting what he called the “bronze-aged mindset” favored by some in the crypto community. With Ether facing uncertain prospects and Buterin’s actions fueling speculation, it remains unclear whether his personal brand of decentralization or his refusal to align with Trump’s crypto-friendly policies will shape Ethereum’s path forward.

Pal tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin tends to follow the global liquidity cycle but with a 10-week lag. The macro guru shares a chart suggesting that global M2, or the total money supply across the world, has sharply risen after carving a bottom in late 2024. Based on the data, Pal predicts that Bitcoin will soon end its correction and begin sparking fresh rallies. “The waiting game is almost over…the 10-week lead is my preferred.” Source: Raoul Pal/X While Pal thinks that BTC rallies are imminent, he points out that Global Macro Investor’s (GMI) head of macro research, Julien Bittel, believes that Bitcoin trails the global M2 metric by 12 weeks. According to Bittel, Bitcoin will carve a local bottom this week before moving “higher again.” Earlier this month, Pal predicted that global M2 will continue to rise while Bitcoin and crypto witness a “regular correction.” “This too shall pass… Crypto is still feeling the tightening in liquidity from the stronger dollar and higher rates in Q4 2024. That is almost done and financial conditions are easing fast and M2 is headed back to new highs.” Source: Raoul Pal/X He also predicted that Bitcoin would hit a market cycle top of at least $210,000, but he also notes that it is within the realm of possibility for BTC to climb to $412,000 or $805,000. “Over time, we just keep climbing the log regression channel. Whether we stay at the man (red) or climb above it by another standard deviation or two remains to be seen as the cycle develops.” Source: Raoul Pal/X The logarithmic regression channel is a technical tool that helps traders visualize long-term price trends on a logarithmic scale. At time of writing, BTC is trading for $82,500, down 2.25% in the past day.

In the analysis, Vincent focused on the weekly chart, arguing that a longer time frame provides a clearer picture of the asset’s position within the market cycle. His comments come amid short-term fluctuations that have led to increased speculation among traders. Zooming XRP chart out to a weekly, shows a very different story. From a momentum point of view, the market has been trading sideways after that big increase. I am not trying to predict the future with this chart, just showing the perspective that the market is in a ""wait and… pic.twitter.com/dtGZO09y3P — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 27, 2025 Weekly Chart Perspective Van Code pointed out that zooming out to the weekly timeframe shows a different narrative than what daily movements might suggest. He emphasized that, from a momentum standpoint, the market has been trading sideways following its recent significant price increase. Rather than making a price prediction, he explained that the chart reflects a “wait and see” status, where the market consolidates before its next move. He also addressed the daily price volatility, attributing it to various factors such as market makers, coordinated whale movements , sophisticated bot trading, and manipulation across multiple tokens. He advised long-term holders to focus on the weekly chart instead of reacting emotionally to short-term fluctuations. Market Fundamentals and Outlook Van Code highlighted several key factors that support XRP’s long-term prospects. He stated that the asset’s fundamentals remain strong, regulatory developments are moving in a positive direction , and the problem XRP is designed to solve still exists. Additionally, he noted that no competitors are currently posing a significant challenge and that no ongoing legal issues affect its status. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He drew a parallel between this market phase and his past experiences in stock investments, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. Recalling a situation where he invested in a company developing a new HIV drug, he explained how negative headlines caused the stock price to decline by 60%. However, after conducting thorough research and focusing on long-term fundamentals, he held onto his investment. Eventually, the company’s clinical trials advanced, leading to a 120% increase in stock value. Advice for Investors Van Code backed the importance of focusing on market fundamentals rather than short-term noise. He urged investors to mature in their approach, zoom out on the chart, and filter out unnecessary distractions. While he clarified that his comments were not financial advice, he encouraged others to study the underlying value of XRP and its primary use cases rather than getting caught up in daily speculation. His analysis serves as a reminder that long-term market movements often involve periods of consolidation before resuming their trend. For XRP holders, this perspective may provide reassurance amid current market conditions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This meltdown has translated into some $220 million in market outflows—amid what appears to be increasing anxiety over U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nominee Paul Atkins. ​ Paul Atkins’ crypto holdings spark scrutiny Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, is a proponent of a lighter regulatory approach. President Donald Trump nominated him, and he has come under scrutiny for his significant financial interests in the crypto sector, including between $2 million and $6 million in crypto-related assets. Such holdings include stakes in crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, tokenization firm Securitize, and crypto investment firm Off the Chain Capital. During his confirmation hearing in the Senate, lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, zeroed in on potential conflicts of interest related to Atkins’ extensive background as a regulatory adviser to major financial institutions, including digital asset companies. Senator Warren expressed concerns that Atkins’ former clients, who paid him handsomely to help shape regulators such as the SEC, could unduly profit from his leadership. ​ While Ripple recently won a landmark legal battle against the SEC, Atkins’ confirmation process has raised new questions about the long-term regulatory environment for crypto. These events have been met with some significant volatility in the crypto market. XRP fell to $2.06 earlier today before bouncing back to $2.15 as cautious traders remain unsure of the regulatory landscape. Traders weigh the risks of stricter crypto regulations Traders fear that if they block the appointment of Atkins to the SEC Chair position, a more crypto-unfriendly successor could slide into the position instead. This may result in stricter regulations, postponing or even rejecting XRP and other altcoin ETFs getting approved. According to data from Polymarkets, the odds of an XRP ETF being approved before July 31 have declined from 35% to 28% since the scrutiny surrounding Atkins began. Source: Polymarket XRP open interest, one of the most essential indicators for futures market activity, has reduced from $1.6 billion to $1.48 billion in just 10 days; this $220 million reduction in open interest, based on data shown by CryptoQuant, gives proof of lost confidence in a rapidly upcoming XRP recovery. When traders exit their positions en masse, they either take profits or work to limit their losses to stanch further damage. This also suggests that most players are betting that an extension of selling pressure is likely unless the regulatory landscape radically changes for the better. The outflows in derivatives are a pretty obvious sign of increasing uncertainty. The uncertainty of the near-term price direction leaves a lack of conviction to make anyone bet on a comeback. Bearish momentum pushes XRP toward a drop below $2 According to technical indicators, XRP risks sliding below the key $2 support area. The token faces strong resistance at $2.41 (the 50-day Simple Moving Average) and $2.51 (the 100-day SMA). If XRP loses that level, you would expect it to fall further to $1,50, which is a psychological level. A break below $2 could trigger panic selling, pushing prices down to $1.80. Sustained bearish momentum could even see XRP testing lower support levels in the weeks ahead. Otherwise, a move to the upside would require a breakout above $2.41. If that occurs, XRP can rally to $2.60 and the 100-day SMA. However, given the current market sentiment and regulatory uncertainty, a significant surge in buying volume would be necessary to sustain such an upward move. As the confirmation process for the SEC chair continues, market participants are closely monitoring the situation. Atkins has committed to sell off all of his financial holdings that would otherwise pose a conflict of interest, including those of his consulting firm, Patomak Global Partners. Investor confidence still remains cautious, as many are biding their time, waiting for clearer regulatory signals before committing more funds to XRP and the wider cryptocurrency market.

The world’s leading cryptocurrency is struggling to hold its gains, with technical indicators pointing toward a shift toward bearish territory. Key Support Levels at Risk On the daily chart, Bitcoin has dropped below a critical Fibonacci support level around $83,000, which had previously acted as a strong foundation. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, this move suggests a reversal in the short-term trend. If Bitcoin can’t reclaim this level, the next major support is around the high $70,000 range. Resistance levels remain firm, with $85,000 and $88,000 acting as key obstacles. A daily close below $83,000 would likely turn this support into resistance, adding more downward pressure on the price. Bullish Momentum Fading The bullish momentum that drove optimism in recent weeks is now losing strength. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching a critical threshold, where a drop below this level confirms the end of the bullish trend. This marks a shift in sentiment, showing that Bitcoin’s recent recovery may have reached its peak. What’s Next for Bitcoin? In the short term, traders are focusing on the $81,600 level. A drop below this level could trigger a move toward $80,000 and possibly down to $78,500. Resistance levels to watch include $83,500, $85,000, and $88,000. Despite the current downward pressure, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains uncertain, influenced by macroeconomic factors and overall market sentiment.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-30 07:11:06

Back in its early days, AI16Z was just another tiny player trying to ride the AI hype wave. Fast forward, and it turned average Joes into crypto millionaires. That low entry point—$0.00009 to be exact—was a money-making machine for early believers. Today, it’s trading at more than 35x that price, and the whales are already in. But guess what? History has a wild way of repeating itself—just wearing a different logo. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the next potential moonshot that’s not just selling hype but delivering with a community, utility, and a ridiculously generous presale that’s making waves as the Best New Meme Coins to Join Today. BTFD has already raised over $6.43 million, sold more than 72 billion coins, and now boasts over 11,600 holders. And yep, it’s in Stage 15—the second-to-last round before launch. This ain’t just another meme coin. BTFD is turning heads with its Bulls Squad ecosystem, P2E game, 90% staking APY, and the current $0.0002 price tag. The real kicker?

BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Dip You’ve Been Waiting to Buy BTFD Coin is backed by a community-first vision, this Ethereum-based token has become the talk of the town with a momentum most coins dream of. Let’s talk numbers. At $0.0002, Stage 15 is the last real chance to get in low. The presale ends at $0.0006, offering a straightforward 200% gain. But crypto analysts are calling for a moonshot to $0.006, giving early-stage investors a 2900% ROI. Now imagine this: You throw in $3,000 at the current price of $0.0002. That nets you 15 million BTFD tokens. But wait—drop in LAUNCH100 as your bonus code before March 30, and you get double: 30 million tokens. If BTFD hits $0.006 post-launch, you’re sitting on $180,000. Wild, right? But it’s more than numbers. BTFD’s Play-to-Earn game went live on Jan 1, 2025, giving users the ability to earn while they play. No more idle wallets—this is hands-on earning.

No code, no double tokens. Simple as that. So yeah— BTFD or get left behind . The Bulls are moving, and hesitation costs coins. AI16Z (AI16Z): The Missed Opportunity? Let’s rewind to AI16Z. When this AI-driven meme coin launched at $0.00009, very few took it seriously. “It’s just another AI gimmick,” they said. But the real ones who saw potential and hopped in early? They’re the ones grinning right now. AI16Z hit the market with tight community vibes, deep AI branding, and just the right amount of meme spice to spark interest. Its rise wasn’t instant, but once it took off, it didn’t look back. With the recent updates to its decentralized AI-layer and more integrations with Web3 data tools, AI16Z has solidified its presence. Early adopters who tossed in $3,000 back then are now looking at gains well over $100,000. That train’s left the station. But here’s the upside: you can still get in on the next big thing. And the clock’s ticking. Conclusion: Don’t Fumble This Bag Like AI16Z—Act Before the Bulls Run Without You You already saw what missing out on AI16Z did to your potential portfolio.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours.

PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0000065, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000516. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price has declined over the last few hours as it faced intense selling pressure. The price is aiming for a hold below the $0.0000072 mark. Will Pepe price recover? If buyers strongly defend the $0.000007 mark, we might see a strong recovery above $0.0000075. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news Santiment’s Daily Active Addresses index shows a bearish trend for the frog-based meme coin, PEPE. This index measures network activity and a decrease in active addresses from 7,319 in early February to 3,611 this week suggests falling demand for PEPE’s blockchain. This ongoing decline since mid-November likely signals a negative outlook for PEPE’s price. PEPE Price Prediction March 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.0000059 and $0.0000088, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000015. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) March 2025 0.0000059 0.0000072 0.0000088 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000024. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses.

This development comes amid an impressive market comeback over the past two weeks following the heavy withdrawals seen in early March. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slips Under $84,000 — Key Support Levels To Watch Bitcoin Spot ETFs: 10 Straight Days Of Positive Netflows According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the Bitcoin ETFs registered total net outflows of $93.47 million on Friday, moving its aggregate netflows for the past week to $196.7 million. Prior to Friday’s negative input, these funds recorded a positive flow for 10 consecutive trading days suggesting a high amount of favorable market interest. This development indicates a return of bullish sentiments among Bitcoin institutional investors following the bearish mood seen in February and early March which featured massive asset withdrawals. In a similar fashion, Blackrock’s IBIT accounted for the majority of the inflows from last week by attracting $171.95 million in investments, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $86.84 million. VanEck’s HODL was the only other ETF with a positive inflow of $5 million in new deposits. On the other hand, a large percentage of withdrawals came from Ark Invest’s ARKB which recorded $40.97 million in net outflows. Invesco’s BTCO, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Bitwise’s BITB also experienced moderate levels of redemptions ranging between $6.95 million – $10.22 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC, BTC, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC registered no significant flow.

With Q2 of 2025 fast approaching, the Bitcoin spot ETFs conclude the first quarter of the year on an uncertain note. The year began with strong bullish momentum, driving $5.25 billion in net inflows during January. However, this was followed by a sharp reversal, with cumulative net liquidations of $4.25 billion across February and March. Notably, the resurgence of positive inflows seen in the latter half of March is a sign of renewed market interest and strong market confidence. Furthermore, the crypto-friendly stance being adopted by the Donald Trump administration could encourage institutional investment in the long run. However, macroeconomic factors including potential Fed rate hikes, and ongoing US tariff changes may force investors to move out of high-risk assets or other associated investments. In addition, the uncertainty over the current Bitcoin bull run also draws serious concerns. At the time of writing, the flagship crypto asset trades at $83,359 after a 0.77% decline in the past day. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is down by 49.43% and is valued at $16.88 billion.

As indicated, this pattern, often considered a bullish reversal signal, has led to price targets between $3.7 and $3.9. #XRP – Most Probably Inverse Head & Shoulder: Measured Move is $3.7-$3.9. Let Us Wait and See pic.twitter.com/cd1UscX5mh — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 28, 2025 Key Price Levels and Market Structure The chart accompanying Egrag Crypto’s analysis shows a well-defined ascending channel where XRP has been trading. The inverse head and shoulders pattern is clearly illustrated, with the left shoulder, head, and right shoulder marked. The neckline, a crucial level in confirming the pattern, appears to align with a potential breakout target of approximately $2.97. If this pattern plays out as expected, the projected price movement could reach the $3.7-$3.9 range. Additionally, a broader price target of $4.60 is noted at the upper boundary of the ascending channel. Other key levels on the chart include support at approximately $2.10 and a Fibonacci retracement level around $2.23. These areas may serve as important reference points for traders watching for confirmation of the pattern. Egrag Crypto’s analysis also points to a previously filled fair value gap, suggesting that XRP has completed an essential technical step before making a potential move upward . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Market Conditions According to the chart, XRP is currently trading at around $2.25. The near-term movement will be crucial in determining whether the inverse head and shoulders pattern fully forms and leads to a breakout. Market participants are likely watching for a sustained move above the neckline to confirm the pattern’s validity. Community Reactions Following Egrag Crypto’s post, some users shared their thoughts on the market outlook. One user, XRPinit, mentioned recently purchasing XRP with spare cash and intending to use it while traveling in Sri Lanka. However, they noted that XRP had pulled back after their purchase. Another user, Preston, expressed concern about the prolonged price action, stating that they have been holding since May 2020. They acknowledged selling some of their holdings when XRP previously reached $3.40 but noted that they have been repurchasing since then. Egrag Crypto’s analysis provides a structured technical outlook for XRP, suggesting the possibility of a bullish breakout if key levels hold. The next steps for XRP will depend on whether the market confirms the inverse head and shoulders pattern, with traders closely monitoring price movements around the $2.97 level.

Analytics Company Predicts BTC’s Future,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/when-will-bitcoins-expected-high-volatility-come-analytics-company-predicts-btcs-future/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has published a new report outlining key market indicators that suggest Bitcoin (BTC) could enter a consolidation phase in the coming weeks. According to their findings, Bitcoin's annualized Sharpe Ratio is on the decline, reflecting past market cycles that saw periods of stagnation or correction. The Sharpe Ratio, a metric used to evaluate risk-adjusted returns, has fallen to levels comparable to those seen in 2023, 2020, 2019, and 2016. With the ratio approaching zero, analysts at Alphractal suggest that Bitcoin offers lower returns per unit of risk. Historically, similar trends have been followed by market pauses, suggesting that a consolidation phase may be the most likely outcome. Another key indicator flagged by Alphractal is Bitcoin’s one-year percentage change approaching negative territory. Of the four previous instances where this has occurred, three resulted in bearish moves, while one had no significant impact. Related News: Binance Makes Swift Statement on Hacker Who Claimed to Have Stolen 100 Thousand People's Cryptocurrency Exchange Login Info This decline in Bitcoin’s historical variation could signal a period of lower volatility and less risk, making the market less attractive for short-term speculative trading. If Bitcoin follows the pattern observed in 2020, it may simply be experiencing a routine consolidation phase. However, if the metric continues its downward trend, the possibility of new lows could increase. Commenting on the current market outlook, Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson said those expecting increased volatility in the near term may need to be patient. *This is not investment advice.

Whether you’re chasing wild ROI, crazy cat memes, or a full-blown mythological adventure in the presale space, these three digital gems are stealing the limelight. Let’s dive deep into the Top Crypto to Buy Today: Arctic Pablo Coin , Toshi, and Simon’s Cat. Let’s unpack the hype and show you exactly why now might be your golden ticket moment. Top Crypto to Buy Today – Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Mythic Meme Hunt You Didn’t Expect Strap in, because this isn’t your average crypto story. Arctic Pablo Coin is an absolute game-changer—crafted with a mythical narrative that’s as bold as its tokenomics. At the heart of this frosty adventure is Arctic Pablo, a fearless cartoon explorer sledding through icy wonderlands like Atlantis, the Snowy Caves, and now the 16th location: Crystal Cove. At just $0.000083 per token, it’s an absolute steal. As he ventures deeper into Earth’s coldest corners, Pablo uncovers glowing treasure: the legendary $APC tokens. And this gem is quickly becoming the Top Crypto to Buy Today during an exciting meme coin presale . Here’s the kicker—this presale isn’t just staged. It’s location-based, meaning each week-long presale ties to a new mythical place, making the whole thing feel like a Netflix docuseries mixed with meme coin magic. Right now, you can scoop up $1,204,819 $APC for just $100, and if it hits the planned listing price of $0.008, you’re looking at a mind-melting $9,638.55. That’s over 9552.41% ROI—yeah, you read that right. No cap. The presale’s heating up too—over $2 million raised, and we’re not even at the final destination yet. And here’s where it gets spicy: every single unsold token at the end of each weekly presale? Torched. Burnt. Gone. That burn mechanism creates a juicy deflationary environment, meaning supply shrinks, value pumps, and your bag could swell quicker than you can say “moonshot.” It’s this unique approach that cements Arctic Pablo Coin as the Top Crypto to Buy Today for those chasing serious upside with a twist of storytelling brilliance. But wait—it gets even better. Stake your Arctic Pablo Coin after launch and bag a massive 66% APY—yeah, sixty-six, not sixteen. Just stake your coins, chill through the two-month vesting period, and watch your investment snowball while Pablo uncovers more mystical treasures. It’s passive income with a mythic twist. So if you’ve ever dreamt of joining a meme coin presale that’s got actual lore, a clever roadmap, and a deflationary burn structure that makes sense—mate, this is your shot. Don’t get caught snoozing. Crystal Cove’s closing fast, and Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a coin—it’s a blizzard of hype, making it the Top Crypto to Buy Today if you’re keen to stack while the ice is still fresh. Toshi (TOSHI): The Meme King of the Base Chain That Just Won’t Quit Toshi is your battle-scarred alley cat that just keeps landing on its feet. Built on the Base chain, Toshi brings OG meme vibes, Gen Z banter, and a massive 420.69 billion token supply that’s actively traded by a relentless community. Right now, Toshi is sitting at $0.0003294, with a market cap of $134.42 million, and 408.06 billion tokens in circulation. While it’s down 85.53% from its January 2025 ATH of $0.002273, don’t let that scare ya. It’s still flexing a ludicrous +4,157,848.46% from its ATL, proving that this kitty’s got claws. Its recent 24-hour volume hit $12.27 million, and a volume-to-market cap ratio of 9.14% tells us the community is alive, kicking, and trading like mad. This isn’t just a nostalgia coin—it’s active, volatile, and hungry for a comeback. And when it rallies, it really rallies. Simon’s Cat (CAT): From Viral YouTube Legend to Meme Coin Juggernaut Don’t sleep on this feline—it’s scratching its way into serious investor wallets. Simon’s Cat (CAT) is one of the most recognizable IP-backed meme coins right now, blending childhood nostalgia with serious tokenomics. This cat is quietly sharpening its claws at a live price of $0.05796, a market cap of $53.73 million, and a whopping 6.74 trillion CAT in circulation (out of 9 trillion total). Here’s where things get spicy. CAT’s 24-hour trading volume surged by 75.43% to hit $15.24 million. With a volume-to-market cap ratio of 28.36%, it’s clear the crowd is showing up—and not just for memes. This isn’t a sleeping kitty. This is a prowler. Sure, it’s down 88.41% from its ATH in December 2024, but don’t let the dip scare you off. It’s already rebounded +26.99% from its recent low just two weeks back. Traders are watching, bots are sniffing, and the CAT army is meowing back to life. What makes Simon’s Cat one of the top crypto to buy today? It’s that hybrid appeal—nostalgic IP from the viral Simon’s Cat brand mixed with the meme coin mechanics we all know and love. Plus, it’s on both Solana and BNB Chain, so you’ve got solid infrastructure under the hood. That combo? Kind of a big deal. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the charge as the Top Crypto to Buy Today. With its myth-themed presale journey, deflationary tokenomics, and a jaw-dropping 66% APY staking reward, this project stands out from the crowded meme coin space. Investors are jumping into a narrative-driven adventure that’s still unfolding, with the current presale price sitting at just $0.000083. If it reaches its projected listing price of $0.008, that’s a massive ROI window waiting to be claimed. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement with real potential, making it a standout choice for anyone looking to ride the next big crypto wave. Pair that with the cat-fueled chaos of Toshi, whose community refuses to let go, and the IP-backed, emotionally resonant rise of Simon’s Cat, and you’ve got a killer mix of narrative, utility, and momentum. But if you’re going to make one move today, don’t sleep on Arctic Pablo Coin. This is the meme coin presale people will talk about in crypto bars five years from now. Get in while it’s still snowing opportunity. Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now before the next location melts into legend.

The asset is currently at a key juncture, with short-term and long-term indicators suggesting potential movement in either direction. Traders are closely monitoring key levels to determine ADA’s next momentum shift. Daily Chart Overview On the daily timeframe, ADA faces strong resistance at the $0.73–$0.75 range, aligning with the 200-day EMA. A breakout above this level could indicate a bullish reversal, potentially driving the price toward $0.80 or higher. On the downside, major support lies between $0.68 and $0.70, coinciding with the 200-day SMA. A failure to hold this support could result in a drop toward $0.60. 4-Hour Chart Analysis The 4-hour chart shows ADA consolidating between $0.70 and $0.73, with low trading volume. A decisive breakout above $0.73 could propel the price toward $0.78–$0.80, while a breakdown below $0.70 may trigger a retest of the $0.68 support zone. Short-Term Movements 1-Hour Chart: ADA is trading below the 20, 50, and 200-period EMAs, suggesting bearish momentum. However, the RSI is approaching oversold territory, indicating a potential short-term rebound. 15-Minute Chart: ADA is attempting to stabilize around $0.68. The Money Flow Index (MFI) reading of 35 suggests near-oversold conditions, possibly leading to a brief upward correction. Next Momentum Move Bullish Scenario: A breakout above $0.73 with strong volume could push ADA toward $0.80–$0.82. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bearish Scenario: A failure to hold $0.70 support may lead to a decline toward $0.68, with further downside risk to $0.60 if selling pressure intensifies. ADA’s price action is poised for a decisive move as the month ends. A breakout above $0.73 could signal bullish momentum, while failure to maintain key support may lead to further downside. Traders should watch volume trends and market sentiment closely to anticipate the next major move. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-textbook-resistance-turning-support-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst JD (@jaydee_757) has shared a technical analysis update on XRP, highlighting a critical resistance level turning into support. Using historical price movements and technical indicators, JD outlined key levels that could determine XRP’s next major move . His post included a detailed chart marking crucial price levels, trendlines, and past market cycle behaviors. #XRP – Textbook resistance turning Support! Posting 5 diff charts on Patreon/Discord next week for better confluence, but 100 Retweets, I'll post $XRP /USD on X next week! I called 0.28 bottom, $3.37 Local TOP, 50% crash at $1.90, IM CALLING MARKET CYCLE TOP NEXT USING ONLY TA!… pic.twitter.com/MiPiSHzgCU — JD (@jaydee_757) March 27, 2025 Key Resistance Turning to Support JD emphasized that a major resistance level, previously acting as a ceiling for price movements, has now become support. This level is around $1.99, and JD believes a monthly close above it would indicate further bullish momentum in April. He also pointed out that he previously called key market movements, including the bottom at $0.28, a local top at $3.37, and a 50% crash at $1.90. Based on his analysis, he is now prepared to call the next market cycle top using only technical analysis. Market Direction Based on Key Levels JD explained that if XRP closes above the $1.99 level, he expects a price target to be reached in April. However, he noted that a monthly close below this level would suggest a higher probability of retesting his dollar-cost averaging (DCA) level, which remains unfilled. This level aligns with the top of the symmetrical triangle pattern he has been tracking. He mentioned that his DCA strategy is available on his Patreon and Discord channels. For shorter timeframes, JD identified $1.80 as a crucial support level on the daily chart. If XRP closes below this level, the descending channel pattern could be negated. He reassured followers that he would provide further updates after the weekend’s market close. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Sentiment and Market Psychology JD commented on market behavior, emphasizing that only a small percentage of investors—what he refers to as the “5% (smart money)”—will capitalize on the upcoming move. He suggested that most traders will suffer losses due to emotional decision-making, backing his perspective that the market operates in cycles where inexperienced traders often face losses while more strategic investors capitalize on price movements. A user named DeGenarant asked JD about potential targets if a crash were to occur before a breakout. JD responded by reiterating that as long as XRP does not close below $1.99 on the monthly chart, his targets remain unchanged. He emphasized that price action below $1.80 on the daily chart would be a key factor to monitor. JD’s focus remains on whether XRP can maintain strength above the $1.99 level. If it does, he expects further upward momentum in April. If not, he sees a potential decline to his DCA target before another major move occurs. He assured his followers that he would provide more insights based on upcoming price action, particularly after the next market close.

Aave’s Horizon Plan Under Fire & Mantra Eyes $10,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-ambassador-program-expands-rapidly-presale-reaches-208-5m-aaves-horizon-plan-under-fire-mantra-eyes-10/,"The Mantra (OM) price is entering a pivotal stage, showing stability following a previous drop. With chart indicators hinting at an upcoming breakout, OM appears poised for a potential climb toward the $10 level. Meanwhile, the Aave Horizon proposal is generating interest by aiming to connect real-world assets to decentralized finance. Though this could improve adoption, discussions about new token creation and revenue allocation have stirred conversation within the community. In the crypto presale space, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making a significant mark with its shift in blockchain development. Its active Ambassador Program is accelerating international expansion by broadening its network influence. With $208.5 million already secured, BlockDAG is catching major attention. As its adoption rate increases rapidly, the presale could soon approach $600 million, potentially driving the price up substantially. Mantra (OM) Price Maintains Momentum Amid Bullish Signals Mantra (OM) has recently shown strong support, stabilizing after a previous downturn. At present, OM is trading at $6.82 after rebounding from a monthly low of $5.86. Despite market swings, the price remains above key moving averages, pointing to positive momentum. A bullish chart formation, known as a falling wedge, is taking shape—a pattern often tied to potential price increases. Should OM break past resistance, it may climb toward $9.12, its recent high, and possibly test the $10 zone. For this to happen, OM needs to keep holding its current support levels. Aave Horizon Proposal Divides Community on Institutional DeFi Aave Labs recently unveiled Horizon, a proposal that aims to bring real-world assets (RWAs) into the decentralized finance space. It would allow institutions to use tokenized money market funds (MMFs) as collateral to borrow stablecoins like USDC and GHO, unlocking significant liquidity. While Aave presents this as a step toward merging regulated finance with DeFi, the Horizon proposal has raised concerns. Critics question the fairness of profit distribution and the introduction of new tokens. Still, Aave Labs points to data showing a 408% yearly growth in tokenized U.S. Treasuries as proof of future potential. If the plan passes, Horizon will launch under Aave V3, with goals to move into Aave V4 for enhanced scaling. BlockDAG’s Ambassador Program Pushes Presale Toward $600M Milestone BlockDAG’s Ambassador Program is designed to expand its outreach by involving community members in sharing its goals, bringing in new users, and supporting global knowledge-building around the project. Central to the program is education. Participants benefit from access to exclusive learning sessions and one-on-one engagement with the BlockDAG team. This ensures ambassadors develop a solid understanding of blockchain systems, enabling them to spread insights across their communities with confidence. To keep members motivated, the program includes reward-based incentives like BDAG coin distributions and limited-edition merchandise. These offerings build a strong community atmosphere. Ambassadors who actively promote BlockDAG’s growth may also rise to leadership roles within the network, enhancing their visibility and impact. Having already raised $208.5 million and sold 18.9 billion coins, BlockDAG is making rapid progress toward its $600 million target. With batch 27 pricing BDAG at $0.0248, the coin has jumped 2,380% since its opening rate of $0.001. The Ambassador Program is playing a major role in driving this surge by expanding awareness and drawing new support. As more people join, both demand and pricing pressures are expected to rise significantly. This consistent upward trend is why many now view BlockDAG as the best crypto platform available, raising its profile in the global blockchain space and setting higher benchmarks for decentralized growth. In a Nutshell! The Mantra price has shown bullish potential, with signs pointing toward a climb near the $10 range. However, long-term stability could depend on broader market shifts. At the same time, the Aave Horizon proposal aims to connect real-world finance with DeFi, but questions around profit and token issuance continue to spark mixed reactions. Turning to BlockDAG, currently in batch 27 of its presale, its recent efforts in blockchain expansion through the Ambassador Program are making an impact. With $208.5 million already raised, it’s edging closer to the $600 million goal, which could trigger sharp price increases. As usage grows, BlockDAG is proving to be the best crypto platform , with early supporters potentially seeing major returns in the near future.

Even so, optimism over a trend reversal has the likes of Solana finding their footing. At the same time, internal shortcomings are further weighing on Ethereum price. Amid this chaos, PepeX stands out as one of the attractive meme projects of 2025. Its mission is to restore fairness and transparency to the meme coin space while eliminating gatekeeping. In just one week, it has raised over $1 million and is set for further gains during and post its 90-day presale. Ethereum price plunges as its ecosystem’s shortcomings fuel underwhelming performance Ethereum price extended its previous losses on Saturday’s session to trade at its lowest level since 11th March. As seen on CoinMarketCap, the altcoin’s price has been down by 7.89% over the past 7 days compared to Bitcoin and Solana’s decline of 1.38% and 3.19% respectively. Notably, economic uncertainties continue to weigh on the crypto market. While the market sentiment had improved to a neutral level earlier in the week, the crypto fear & greed index dropped to a fear level of 26 on Saturday before improving slightly to 32. However, beyond these external factors, some analysts blame shortcomings in its ecosystem for the underwhelming performance. In the absence of a major bullish catalyst, Ethereum price will likely remain under pressure in the near term. As seen on its daily price chart, the altcoin will likely remain range-bound in the ensuing sessions as the bulls defend the support zone along the lower Bollinger band. On the upside, it may face resistance along the middle band at around $1,950. However, further decline will invalidate this thesis; pushing Ethereum price to the October 2023’s low retested on 11th March at $1,750. Ethereum price chart | Source: TradingView PepeX: The project bringing back sanity to the meme crypto space Some meme coins like the TRUMP token still propel the culture of a project starting from an internet trend and its virality fueling its growth. However, the subsector is steadily moving away from this concept to become major financial assets operating on real-world use cases. PepeX is one of the fresh crypto projects under the latter category. On its website, PepeX describes itself as being “like pump.fun but fair, easy and open to all”. This is meant to solve the existing challenges related to insider manipulation andthe gatekeeping of token creation. As the world’s first AI-driven meme launchpad, it allows anyone to launch a meme coin in just five minutes. This also includes the branding and marketing of meme tokens; features that allow retail investors to enjoy opportunities that have previously been unattainable to them. Besides, PepeX will ensure that token creators’ holdings are capped at 5% of the total supply, which they can lose to the community should the project fail. This policy, coupled with anti-sniping protections and transparent bubble maps, positions PepeX as the “system rectifier” and investors are taking note of it. Subsequently, it has already raised over $1 million in one week with stage 1 already sold out. In addition to its growth potential in the crypto market, early adopters get to enjoy gains of upto 311% during its presale. What started at a token price of $0.02 is currently at $0.021 as it increases by 5% with every stage. By the end of its presale slated for 22nd June, it will be at $0.0823. Hurry up and buy the PepeX token here . Solana price finds footing as bulls remain optimistic of a trend reversal Solana price chart | Source: TradingView Macroeconomic factors continue to weigh on the cryptocurrency market with Solana price dropping to a two-week low on Saturday’s session. However, it will likely remain above the steady support zone of $118.50 as the bulls remain optimistic of improved risk sentiment and subsequent trend reversal. The entry of more buyers may have Solana price break the resistance along the middle Bollinger band at $130.80. If successful, it would attract even more traders with the next target being at $139.

16066069,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-crypto-backed-mortgages-and-how-do-they-work,1743323700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/16/16066069.jpeg,"What are crypto-backed mortgages, and how do they work?",https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-crypto-backed-mortgages-and-how-do-they-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"What are crypto-based mortgages? Crypto-backed mortgages are a kind of loan where borrowers use their cryptocurrency holdings, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Ether ( ETH ), as collateral to secure financing for real estate purchases. This approach allows you to access funds without selling your digital assets. By retaining crypto ownership, borrowers can still benefit from future price increases. There are various types of crypto-backed mortgages: purchase mortgages, cash-out refinancing and bridge loans. Purchase mortgages: These help you finance real estate using crypto as collateral. Cash-out refinancing: It allows you to refinance your existing mortgages by leveraging your crypto assets to access additional funds. Bridge loans: These loans provide short-term financing, helping you cover the period between purchasing a new property and selling an existing one. Crypto mortgages are particularly appealing if you want to preserve your holdings while securing real-world assets . However, you need to consider the volatility of cryptocurrencies and carefully assess the risks before opting for a crypto-backed mortgage. Lenders usually accept stablecoins such as Tether ( USDt ) and USDC (USDC) or major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Some lenders may accept a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies as collateral, which is known as cross-collateralization. Did you know? With traditional mortgages becoming increasingly difficult to obtain, particularly for younger individuals, alternative solutions are gaining traction. Fintech startups are addressing this demand by offering adjustable or fixed-rate mortgages secured by substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Crypto-based mortgages vs traditional mortgages Crypto-backed and traditional mortgages differ from eligibility requirements to risk factors. Traditional mortgages rely on credit history, income verification and down payments, while crypto-backed mortgages use digital assets as collateral. The approval process for crypto mortgages is often faster, but they come with higher interest rates and volatility risks. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties make crypto-backed loans less widely accepted in real estate markets. A comparison of the two mortgage types is given below: How do crypto-backed mortgages work? The basic mechanism of crypto-backed mortgages is that depositors calculate the value of the crypto the borrower proposes to collateralize and release a loan against the amount . To assess the value of the crypto assets, the lenders may apply a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which indicates the percentage of the collateral value you can borrow. For example, if the LTV ratio is 50%, you can secure a loan of $25,000 for collateralized crypto assets worth $50,000. Overcollateralization helps to create a buffer, which helps the lender if the value of the collateral goes down. Smart contracts are used to automate the execution of loan terms. Here is a step-by-step look at the functioning of crypto-backed mortgages: Step 1: Find a lender – Look for a financial institution or decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that offers crypto-backed mortgages. Compare different lenders based on their interest rates, fees and supported cryptocurrencies. Step 2: Apply and submit proof of ownership – Submit an application for getting a loan against the crypto you hold. You also need to provide proof of ownership of your digital assets. The lender will assess the worth of your crypto holdings to determine your borrowing limit. Some lenders may consider other financial factors, such as credit history. Step 3: Move crypto to escrow account – Once approved, you need to pledge the required amount of crypto by transferring it into an escrow account. This crypto acts as security for the mortgage loan. Step 4: Prep the loan – Complete the loan agreement, which outlines key terms like repayment schedules, interest rates and what happens if your collateral’s value drops. Usually, if the value of the crypto drops, you will need to deposit more crypto in the escrow account so that the loan remains overcollateralized. If you fail to deposit additional crypto, the lender may liquidate your crypto deposits. Step 5: Disbursal of loan – The loan funds are typically disbursed in fiat currency for purchasing the property. Step 6: Make mortgage payments – Repay the loan according to the agreed terms. The interest rate may differ in line with the market value of the collateralized crypto. Step 7: Recover your collateral – If you complete all payments as per the loan agreement, you will get back your cryptocurrency from escrow. If you fail to repay it, the lender may liquidate your collateral to cover the outstanding amount. Did you know? Freddie Mac data shows that when fixed-rate mortgages were introduced in 1971, interest rates were about 7.5%. However, by 1980, they had dramatically increased to almost 20%. Benefits of crypto-backed mortgages Thanks to crypto-backed mortgages, you can access funds to invest in real estate without selling digital assets. You can leverage your crypto assets to take advantage of real estate market growth. Here are some key benefits of using a crypto-backed mortgage: Faster and simpler process: Compared to traditional mortgages, crypto-backed loans generally have a quicker and more streamlined approval process. Lenders use smart contracts to execute loan terms, making the whole process efficient and without prejudice. Liquidity without selling: You can access funds to invest in real estate without liquidating your crypto holdings. This is particularly beneficial during a real estate market upswing as you can retain your crypto assets while securing finances for real estate investment. Investment growth potential: Crypto-backed mortgages enable you to enjoy double growth. You benefit from appreciation in the prices of the real estate and the growth of your crypto assets. Broader accessibility: Crypto-backed mortgages provide financing opportunities for anyone who lacks traditional credit histories. If you have just settled in a country and don’t have financial records there, crypto-backed loans become a viable option. Tax benefits: Since no assets are sold, you can avoid immediate capital gains tax. This allows you to access value without triggering taxable events. Challenges in crypto-backed mortgages While crypto-backed mortgages offer some unique advantages, they also come with several challenges you must consider. From price volatility to regulatory uncertainties, these factors can impact the feasibility and cost of securing a mortgage with cryptocurrency. Here are some key challenges in crypto mortgaging: Higher costs: Compared to conventional mortgages, crypto-backed loans often have steeper interest rates. Since lenders consider these loans riskier, they set higher costs to protect themselves from potential losses. Price volatility: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, meaning their value can fluctuate significantly. If the value of the pledged crypto collateral drops, you may need to add more assets or partially repay the loan to prevent liquidation. Limited market adoption: Many sellers may not be willing to deal with a prospective buyer who has arranged their loan using cryptocurrencies. This might limit your property purchase options. Regulatory uncertainty: The legal framework for crypto-backed mortgages is still evolving. Shifting regulations could impact the availability, terms or tax treatment of these loans, creating uncertainty for borrowers. Did you know? With $12.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt spread across 84 million loans, the average American mortgage holder owes $144,593. These home loans represent a massive 70.2% of all consumer debt in the US, highlighting their crucial importance to the nation’s financial health. How to decide on a crypto-backed mortgage? Before deciding on your cryptocurrency-backed mortgage, you need to make a thorough assessment of your financial status and risk tolerance. Begin by analyzing your cryptocurrency portfolio. Determine how much of your holdings you could pledge and consider how these assets may perform in the future. Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, collateralizing a single asset may be risky. Diversifying your collateral across various cryptocurrencies may help avoid potential losses if prices fluctuate. You also need to carefully analyze the loan terms. Understanding the interest rates, payback plan and any other expenses related to the mortgage is essential. Consider the risks, such as asset liquidation if their value falls dramatically or if you fail to meet repayment terms. As crypto-backed mortgages are a relatively new financial instrument, seeking professional guidance may help if you feel unsure about it. Consulting with financial and real estate experts specializing in crypto lending can assist you in navigating the process, structuring your loan and aligning your mortgage decision with your long-term investment and financial objectives.",Crypto-backed mortgages,EN,0,0,ICO|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-30 08:35:00

Many altcoins have produced notable losses over the past week, led by XRP and ETH from the larger caps. BTC Struggles at $83K Last weekend went in a dull fashion as BTC’s price was stuck at $84,000. However, it started to gain traction on Sunday evening and pumped to $88,800, which became its highest price tag in over two weeks. As the community was preparing for a charge at $90,000, though, the landscape changed and bitcoin started to lose its momentum. After a few days of sideways action around $86,000 and $88,000, the cryptocurrency slumped below the lower boundary on Friday and dropped to $83,400. It managed to sustain that level for a bit, but the bears increased the pressure over the past 24 hours. The result came yesterday evening when BTC dropped to a 12-day low of $81,600 (on Bitstamp). It managed to react well to this Saturday crash and has recovered over a grand, but it’s still in the red on a daily and weekly scale. Its market capitalization has declined to under $1.630 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 59%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out Weekly Although most alts are quite sluggish on a daily scale, the weekly chart is quite painful. ETH, which was close to $2,100 at one point, is down by over 8% since last Sunday and is well below $1,850 now. XRP has dropped by 9% despite the lawsuit closure against the US SEC. BNB, SOL, ADA, TRX, LINK, XLM, HBAR, DOT, and LTC have declined by somewhere between 3-7%, while UNI has plunged by more than 11%. The biggest losers, though, are PI and HYPE, as both are down by over 20% in a week. SUI and TON are among the few exceptions with gains over the past week. TON has risen by nearly 4%, while SUI is up by almost 7%. The total crypto market cap has slipped below $2.8 trillion, which means that it has lost $200 billion since the peak on Monday.

In an interview , Puckrin explained that while a full-fledged recession is not yet the most likely outcome, the odds have increased considerably due to growing macroeconomic instability. He pointed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies, including tariffs on trading partners and budget cuts, as potential recession triggers. “Trump and his advisors have not completely dismissed the possibility of a recession, which makes it a credible risk,” Puckrin noted. However, he clarified that while Trump is not actively pushing for a recession, the administration’s economic strategies could unintentionally lead to one. The growing macro uncertainty has already started to shake markets, with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) slipping as investors seek safer opportunities in European capital markets. According to Puckrin, this flight from the U.S. dollar is contributing to the recent weakness in risk-on assets, including crypto. Tariffs and Macroeconomic Uncertainty The recent trade tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have sent shockwaves through the crypto market, driving down prices across the board. Bitcoin (BTC), which had surged past $109,000 in January 2025, saw a sharp 24% correction following the tariff announcement. Altcoins have fared even worse, with the broader market sentiment shifting from euphoria after Trump’s November 2025 re-election to extreme fear as trade war concerns mount. According to Nansen research analyst Nicolai Sondergaard, crypto markets are likely to remain under pressure from tariffs until at least April 2025. Sondergaard believes that only a diplomatic breakthrough or a softening of the Trump administration’s stance could reverse the downward trend. Crypto Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Policy Shifts Despite the bleak outlook, some analysts see glimmers of hope. 10x Research founder Markus Thielen recently suggested that Bitcoin may have found a price bottom in March 2025, pointing to a slight softening in Trump’s trade rhetoric. Thielen believes this policy shift could signal a potential BTC price reversal, offering a ray of optimism for crypto investors. While the market remains fragile, any sign of de-escalation in the trade war or a shift in monetary policy could reignite risk appetite.

PEPE Bulls Get Major Confidence Boost In Pepe (PEPE) PEPE bulls are on a mission, riding high on the current market sentiment as they watch the Pepe price holding nicely above the support line of a bullish flag pattern. The market conversations among PEPE bulls show their confidence is at an all-time high. Analysts note that if the price maintains its stance above the $0.0000720-$0.0000730 range, another bullish correction move toward the $0.0000860-$0.0000880 region could be imminent. PEPE bulls celebrate this steady support level in trading circles, frequently discussing how the current market setup is primed for a breakout. The sentiment among PEPE bulls is not just about short-term gains; many are pointing to the token’s long-term potential as it defies expectations. With the price action so closely watched by these PEPE bulls, other investors have also become vocal and persistent in their optimism despite market fluctuations. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Meme Token With A Creative Edge FloppyPepe (FPPE) is an exceptional Pepe coin within the same lineage as Matt Furie’s iconic creations, blending a playful aesthetic with real-world impact. FloppyPepe (FPPE), thoroughly audited by blockchain security expert SolidProof, is not just a meme token; it’s a symbol of humor and cultural relevance on the blockchain. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has set its sights on an audacious goal: upon reaching a $100M market Cap milestone, the project plans to create the world’s largest physical Meme Wall, a living masterpiece of creativity and humor, with its location chosen by community members.

Acknowledging the inherent volatility of meme coins, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) team is well aware of the rapid price fluctuations that are common in the space. They openly discuss the risks, including vulnerabilities in smart contracts that could lead to hacks or financial losses.

Shiba Inu’s growing price and Cheems’ Binance listing are exciting, but both rely heavily on speculation. Dragoin offers a different kind of opportunity. With its entry price of just $0.0000292, it gives new and small investors a realistic chance to get into crypto without big risks. What makes Dragoin even more appealing is its step-by-step presale plan, strong community involvement, and built-in interactive features. These qualities make Dragoin a smart option for anyone who wants more than just a quick trend in the meme coin market. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surge Drives $0.001 Speculation Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently gained momentum due to a sharp rise in its burn rate. A major event came when an anonymous wallet burned 1 billion SHIB tokens—worth around $13,050. This move, along with growing activity on the Shibarium layer 2 network, which just reached a two-month TVL high, has sparked fresh discussions about token supply. Adding to this, SHIB’s reserves on crypto exchanges have dropped to a four-year low. Only 100.42 trillion tokens remain on exchanges, creating more talk around a possible supply squeeze. These factors have led some market watchers to believe SHIB could eventually hit the $0.001 mark—giving it a market cap of $589 billion. But this goal depends heavily on continued token burns, the success of Shibarium, and broader market conditions. Cheems Gains Momentum After Binance Listing Cheems (CHEEMS), a meme token based on Solana, has seen a notable 52.4% price jump in the past week, taking its market cap to $210 million. This boost came after its recent listing on Binance, which increased visibility and improved trading volume. Cheems is now priced at $0.00015094, just slightly down 0.00132% from its last close, though still far below its all-time high of $0.0092—suggesting there may be more room to grow. Still, Cheems remains a speculative investment with a history of wild price swings. This reflects the broader uncertainty that often surrounds meme coins. Some analysts expect Cheems to hit $0.000002219 by December 2025 if market momentum continues. As always, it’s important for investors to weigh the risks of meme coins carefully, especially when price action is driven by hype rather than solid fundamentals. Dragoin’s $0.0000292 Presale Offers an Easy Way to Enter Crypto Dragoin stands out by offering an affordable way for new crypto users and small investors to get started. At a presale price of just $0.0000292, it gives people a low-cost entry into the crypto world—perfect for those looking to explore without heavy upfront spending. Unlike many tokens priced much higher, Dragoin keeps things open for those cautious about risk. Beyond affordability, the presale presents a great chance for early participation. With a total supply of 200 billion tokens and a 25-stage pricing model, Dragoin offers early backers the potential to see strong returns as prices rise through each stage. What’s more, Dragoin adds value through community features like a Telegram-based play-to-earn game and staking rewards. These features let investors be active in the ecosystem from the beginning. For anyone looking to start small but still benefit from long-term gains, Dragoin offers a rare mix of low entry cost and strong future potential. Stage 1 of the Dragoin presale is already live at $0.0000292. When it officially launches at $0.002, early buyers could see returns above 6,700%—a huge leap for those who move early. Why Dragoin’s Low-Cost Presale Has Long-Term Appeal Shiba Inu and Cheems may win attention with price spikes and exchange buzz, but Dragoin offers something more solid. Its clear pricing model, strong focus on community, and easy access for new investors help build lasting value. With a simple starting price and real ways to stay involved, Dragoin presents a better choice for those who want steady growth instead of fast hype. For anyone seeking a reliable start in crypto, Dragoin’s presale lays out a clear, engaging path forward.

While most investors still favor stocks ahead of digital assets, this feat is commendable and shows the attention that digital assets are now getting, even from some of the most ardent stock investors. According to reports, a total of 16.29 million individuals had accounts at the top five domestic virtual assets exchanges. In the data submitted to Rep. Cha Gyu-geun of the minor opposition Rebuilding Korea Party, most of these users are on exchanges like Bithumb, Upbit , Gopax, Coinone, and Korbit. According to the reports, the figure was adjusted for users on multiple platforms, counting them just once. According to the report, the total number of crypto holders in the country now accounts for about 32% of its population. The number of crypto investors exceeded the 14 billion mark for the first time in March 2024, before the sector welcomed over 500,000 people with the election of United States President Donald Trump. The development pushed the total number of crypto investors in the country above the 15 million mark. South Korean investor statistics unveiled According to reports, about 15 million South Korean crypto investors on the top exchanges were also categorized by age and gender. The male investors in their 30s and 40s accounted for about 40% of the crypto investors in the country. However, female investors in the 50s also accounted for a huge share of the high-net-worth investors in the crypto sector. The report revealed that 9.2 million South Korean investors were registered on Upbit, while Coinone had 3.2 million investors. Bithump at 2.36 million, Korbit at 770,000, and Gopax at 150,000 represented the remaining figures. Bithumb registered a rise in the number of accounts, seeing a jump to 2.36 million as of March 18, with the rise representing a 77.4% increase in one year following an aggressive marketing push by the company. In the categorization by age, South Korean investors in their 30s accounted for 4.51 million, closely followed by investors in their 40s at 3.97 million. Investors in their 20s or younger at 2.92 million, investors in their 50s at 2.64 million, and investors in their 60s at 1.12 million made up the remaining numbers. A spread of the gender showed males in their 30s and 40s at 3.1 million and 2.67 million, respectively, accounting for about 38.1% of the total investor population. National Assembly officials’ crypto holdings surge 48% YoY According to reports, investors holding less than 1 million won ($680) in crypto are about 12.1 million or 83.1%, while 1.57 million investors held between one million and 10 million won. Investors with assets between 10 million won and 100 million won were about 830,000, while about 160,000 investors held assets over 100 million won. According to the data, 36,000 male investors in their 40s hold digital assets of over 100 million, while 35,000 males in their 50s hold the same. Meanwhile, the crypto holdings in the South Korean National Assembly registered an uptick, tripling in the last year. According to the 2025 property change report released by the National Assembly’s Public Officials Ethics Committee, about 335 senior officials, including members of the South Korean National Assembly and those affiliated with the secretariat, were put at 1.2 billion Korean won. This figure represents a three-fold increase from the 401.63 million that was reported in the same period last year. The number of reported digital asset holdings also rose by 48.4% year-on-year to 46 cases. The reported targets were not only themselves but their spouses and direct descendants. The individual with the highest crypto holdings was Kim In-young, a policy research committee member of the National Assembly, who reported about 530 million won in digital assets.

DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, commonly known as DOG, is a cryptocurrency launched on April 24, 2024, using the Runes protocol. Known for its quick popularity, DOG quickly became the most popular token on the Runes platform. DOG’s quick rise can be traced back to an effective airdrop campaign. On its first day, the developers distributed 100 billion DOG tokens to over 75,000 owners of Runestone Ordinal NFTs.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Tom Lee says that based on historical patterns, the stock market could mount a recovery in early April. “The spike in the VIX (volatility index) or the collapse in investor sentiment or consumer confidence, that all happened around February 2018, so really that coincided with the first low that was made in 2018, and the market began to stage its recovery… But as we start to think about the second half of this year, first of all, we’ve already had the collapse in sentiment. We’ve seen $850 billion of cash raised over the past year in money market balances, and then in the second half, we were looking for tax reform, which really propelled stocks in 2017.” According to Lee, much of the panic in the stock market has already taken place this year, leading him to believe that stocks should start regaining their bullish momentum this week. “So I think that the odds of a V-shaped recovery in stocks that come after April 2nd is just extremely high, because we’ve already sequenced a lot of the panic that people saw in 2018. I think it’s already taking place.” A V-shaped rally is a technical pattern indicating an abrupt bullish reversal and a sharp surge in the market. Earlier this month, both the stock and crypto markets took a hard hit after President Donald Trump announced tariffs and refused to rule out an upcoming economic recession.

Here’s the Bank of America View,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-will-donald-trumps-tariffs-affect-dollar-strength-will-the-us-enter-a-recession-heres-the-bank-of-america-view/,"The strength of the US dollar may not be sustainable if US President Donald Trump moves forward with sweeping tariffs, according to currency analysts at Bank of America. In a recent report, Athanasios Vamvakidis and Claudio Piron noted that targeted tariffs on specific products were already expected by the market, but broader trade restrictions would be a “negative surprise.” They warn that new tariffs could lead to more uncertainty, especially given concerns about a possible economic slowdown in the United States. “We believe the risks are balanced ahead of next week’s deadline. The market already expects tariffs on certain products. Comprehensive tariffs would be a negative surprise. The dollar is not expected to continue to strengthen when comprehensive tariffs are implemented, and the market is still concerned about the slowdown in the US economy,” they said. They also noted that logistics issues could delay the implementation of new tariffs and leave room for potential negotiations. Related News: Giant Altcoin Whale Couldn't Withstand the Fall: Sold Its Altcoins at a Huge Loss Trump’s tariff strategy has sparked widespread concern among economic and business groups, particularly in Japan. On March 26, Trump signed a memorandum at the White House imposing a 25% tariff on imported cars, set to take effect on April 2. The move has drawn criticism from international trade experts and automakers who fear significant disruptions to global supply chains. Such protectionist policies are unlikely to produce economic benefits and could instead pose risks to the broader global economy, warned Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. “The US tariff policy has no positive impact and will bring risks to the global economy,” Kumano said. *This is not investment advice.

Having launched their mainnet not that long ago, the team defied some of the negative expectations and their token is currently solidly in the top 100 coins by means of total market capitalization. Yet, many remain skeptical. In the following, we examine some of the most recent developments, updates, news, and commentary by influential industry participants regarding Pi Network. Pi Network News: Pushing Back Against Controversy Back in February, before the mainnet of Pi Network went live, the CEO of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges – Bybit – Ben Zhou, said in an X post that the project is a scam, citing police reports from 2023 issued by Chinese police authorities describing it as such. He further explained that the exchange wouldn’t list its native token – the Pi coin. Now, according to a recent report by The Defiant, a spokesperson from Pi Network disclaimed these allegations and said that it lacks any of the hallmarks of a multi-level marketing (a.k.a pyrmaid) scheme. Apparently, rather than having multiple levels in its referral program, Pi Network only has one: “If Person A refers Person B, and Person B then refers Person C, Person A and Person C have no relationship and do not receive any mining bonus as a result of them being referred in,” the spokesperson said. Pi Coin Price Tanks 22% Weekly Pi coin’s price has decreased by a considerabl 22.5% for the past two weeks and is currently trading below $0.8%, charting a further 6% decline in the last 24 hours. There seems to be no isolated project-related reason for this as the cryptocurrency follows the trajectory of the broader market, which is mostly covered in red as well. It’s worth noting that it is the wors-performing coin in the top 100, followed by Hyperliquid and Kaspa. Pi Network Updates to Migration and Account Verification In the past, Pi accounts relied predominantly on phone numbers for their unique identification system. According to the team, this has been both expensive and unreliable. Having that in mind, the team is migrating to a new account verification system that will rely on email-based two-factor identification. There are additional details that the users need to go through such as establishing a trusted email.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi disruptor aiming for an audacious $2.5 target. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), trading at just $0.025, is gaining momentum as a high-upside contender. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at just $0.025, is gaining momentum as analysts predict a run to $2.5. MUTM is positioning itself as top performer and could be one of the best bets of 2025 with a $5.7 million funding boost and increasing investor interest hence over 7400 investors have joined. While ADA has long been a heavyweight in the blockchain market, Mutuum’s innovative approach is turning heads, sparking speculation that it could be the next big altcoin breakout. Mutuum Finance: A Rising Performer in DeFi Lending The lending framework of Mutuum Finance has implemented two independent financial models to unlock better accessibility and encourage large-scale societal adoption in decentralized lending systems. More than 7400 investors have backed the platform which obtained $5.7 million through presale funding. The price stands at $0.025 during Phase 4 and investors expect a 20% boost in Phase 5 which suggests promising profit opportunities in the future. Experts expect MUTM to surpass $2.5 after its $0.06 launch because its modern lending approach will satisfy the growing market need for DeFi solutions over the following months. Mutuum Finance differentiates its operations by uniting Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in its approach. Through the P2C system users can generate passive revenue by providing USDT as a loan through automatic liquidity pools based on smart contract technology. Through the P2P model users retain independence in asset transactions because they perform lending deals without intermediaries. Mutuum Finance offers P2C together with P2P features to establish a strong security foundation while simultaneously improving efficiency standards and bringing increased profitability for DeFi yield investors. A Secure and Transparent Financial Ecosystem Mutuum Finance creates a new stablecoin system which provides full USD backing through Ethereum blockchain infrastructure. Users gain stability from the asset’s over-collateralization features since it eliminates the risks that algorithmic stablecoins suffer from insolvency events. Security takes priority at this platform because it conducts an extensive smart contract audit process to establish complete transparency and build trustworthiness. Mutuum Finance achieves financial reliability excellence by resolving crucial weaknesses previously found in Defi projects. Driving Community Engagement with Investor Rewards To accelerate growth, Mutuum Finance has introduced aggressive incentive programs. A $1 million giveaway will reward ten investors with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, while the referral system incentivizes users who bring in new participants. Early adopters gain exclusive benefits, including access to staking pools, governance rights, and VIP updates, strengthening their engagement and influence within the ecosystem. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance sets its tokenomics strategy to manage circulation limits and elevate token worth. The limited presale supply created alongside anti-inflationary practices ensures restricted availability that could potentially drive price appreciation. The platform maintains sustainability through staking mechanisms which also drive token participation toward growth and long-term expansion. The crypto market will likely see substantial growth from Mutuum Finance because of its innovative lending system and strong security measures along with incentives developed by investors. Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as a serious contender in the DeFi space, leveraging its $5.7 million funding and 7,400+ investors to challenge established giants like ADA. With a unique dual-lending model, robust security measures, and a transparent financial ecosystem, MUTM is poised for significant growth. As the presale price stands at $0.025, with an imminent increase to $0.03, early investors have a golden opportunity to capitalize before the projected surge to $2.5.

People might wonder why trust in crypto’s decentralized nature remains a challenge after so many years. While its unpredictable system may attract some risk-tolerant investors, it raises a red flag for more conservative traders. In traditional banking, if an issue arises, the typical course of action is to call customer service. After a lengthy verification process, a representative eventually assists the customer. You might also like: Cross-chain interoperability is the key to scaling DeFAI | Opinion When it comes to crypto, the experience is quite different. Firstly, there are no ‘customer service’ representatives for DeFi and no central authority to help solve issues. If users have lost access to their digital wallet or forgotten their private key, they have no one to turn to for support, as their journey in crypto is entirely self-sufficient. As a result, wallets often remain dormant, as some users lack the technical skills and expertise to navigate the ecosystem. According to a Reuters article, an estimated 20 percent of Bitcoin ( BTC ) total supply is inactive or locked in lost wallets. Recognizing this gap, a new sector of DeFi has emerged called DeFAI, which integrates AI to enhance the user experience with a new type of customer success. While it might not be as personal as calling a bank, AI agents are beginning to fill this void. AI solutions offer valuable guidance for those new to crypto, helping users navigate the often confusing ecosystem. One of the main drivers behind AI’s integration into DeFi is the volatile nature of the crypto market. These fluctuations are typically driven by online speculation, with a single comment or tweet having the power to impact the value of specific tokens or assets. In this unpredictable environment, the need for accessible, AI-powered support has never been more crucial to helping users make data-driven decisions. In January, for example, a fake Barron Trump memecoin quickly amassed a market capitalization of $460 million, mainly due to its alleged association with the Trump family. However, the excitement was short-lived once people realized it had no legitimate connection. This resulted in the coin dropping 95 percent, wiping out millions from investors. However, DeFAI allows users to access more accurate data analysis and improved decision-making tools. AI helps mitigate the impact of market speculations, identifying trends that might not be immediately obvious and ultimately assisting investors in making more informed decisions. While this new sector is still in its early stages, the potential for AI agents to enhance DeFi’s performance is clear. The web3 investment firm DFG recently published a report highlighting the potential of this emerging area of DeFi. The report breaks down the DeFAI ecosystem, exploring the three primary categories: the abstraction layer, autonomous trading agents, and AI-powered dApps. Each category plays a role in this new era of DeFi by offering unique capabilities, ranging from streamlining complex transactions to optimizing trading strategies and improving liquidity management. One key takeaway from the report is that the effectiveness of AI is directly tied to the quality of the data it relies on. In the context of DeFAI, AI agents perform optimally with access to real-time, verifiable data. High-quality datasets allow agents to predict price movements more accurately, leading to better trade recommendations and more informed decisions. Throughout the report, DFG highlights four key data providers that use reliable data: Mode Synth, Chainbase, sqd.ai, and Cookie. While AI agents might not replicate a portfolio manager or financial advisor, they add a new level of support to DeFi that can provide another layer of security for newcomers. As this sector grows, access to quality data and transparent decision-making processes will be crucial for driving broader acceptance.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With XRP’s price at risk of falling below $1.50 in April, investors are shifting toward Remittix, a hyped crypto looking to offer near-instant fiat conversions. Table of Contents XRP’s key downtrend signals Remittix: Why it shines above the rest The road ahead Through the sale of 524 million+ tokens at $0.0734 per token, Remittix achieved a total of over $14.2 million funding, making it a rapidly growing crypto player. Many see its focus on near-instant fiat conversions as a major leap for digital finance. The potential downward movement of XRP prices below $1.50 in April has caused some investors to move their funds to Remittix. XRP’s key downtrend signals The price of XRP currently resides below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) though it’s above the 200-day EMA. The $1.85 support level has prevented XRP’s market value from reaching larger losses in previous events. However, a price break through this threshold could push it toward $1.50. The market will likely experience substantial price drops down to $1.25 when defense fails at $1.50. Analysts point out that increased trading volumes during prices moving downward could provide evidence of stronger bearish momentum. The XRP price has been weakened by the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s trade tariff policy, which continues to shake volatile markets. Analysts suggest that the resolved SEC case against Ripple has already been priced in, leaving XRP without a fresh catalyst for growth. As such, XRP could move below $1.50 in April as crypto investors will explore alternative cryptocurrencies.

Unlike complex systems from many market leaders, Remittix prioritizes user-friendly exchanges. This focus has attracted $14.2 million in investment, as backers recognize its potential to streamline crypto transactions. Remittix’s model is straightforward. The planned platform will enable users to convert their coins directly into regular money with quick processing and reduced costs. The quick access to digital asset liquidity represents a major benefit for users looking to obtain fast money from their cryptocurrencies. Users remember when they had to deal with the inconvenience of token-to-cash transfers, especially network congestion and the need to navigate through various platforms. Remittix aims to eliminate these obstacles, offering a direct and efficient solution. Designed for wide adoption Remittix’s success in raising over $14.2 million demonstrates that users are looking for convenient solutions. Experts suggest that cryptocurrencies which solve basic problems, such as instant fiat conversion, have the potential to draw wide adoption beyond the tight trader groups. Uncertain market conditions demand the ability to sell quickly and this function makes Remittix invaluable. Numerous investors chose Remittix as an alternative to tokens focused on complex or theoretical applications. The road ahead The XRP price forecast shows the potential to give up the $1.85 support level. The absence of significant market changes could lead the price to fall even further to below $1.50. Market conditions are leading potential investors toward projects with clear use cases, like Remittix’s instant trading solutions. The effective execution of Remittix promises will make it an indispensable token for those seeking real-life benefits. For more information on Remittix, visit the website or socials .

According to Nic Puckrin, the founder of Coin Bureau, while a recession isn’t certain, the economic environment could harm risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Puckrin remarked: “Trump and his advisors have said they have not completely dismissed the recession, which means it is definitely possible, but right now, I would not say it is probable, but the odds have climbed a lot.” Impact of Trump Administration’s Economic Policies Puckrin also explained that while Trump is not intentionally pushing for a recession, policies such as job cuts and budget balancing could trigger an economic slowdown. This uncertainty has contributed to a decline in the US Dollar Index (DXY), as investors look to European markets for better opportunities. Crypto Markets Struggle Amid Trade War The U.S. trade war, particularly with China, has already impacted cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin dropping significantly.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XYZVerse is gaining momentum with bold predictions of a surge from $0.003333 to $10, potentially outshining DOGE and SHIB. Table of Contents Demand for XYZ soars as its presale nears $15m milestone Dogecoin price forecast Shiba Inu price movements Conclusion XYZVerse (XYZ) is capturing attention with bold forecasts of its price surging from $0.003333 to $10. Analysts suggest it could overtake well-known coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). What is driving this potential surge and could XYZVerse become the next standout in the cryptocurrency world? Demand for XYZ soars as its presale nears $15m milestone The XYZVerse project, a blend of sports enthusiasm and cryptocurrency, has garnered considerable attention from investors. Setting itself apart, XYZVerse emphasizes long-term viability through a well-defined roadmap and an active, dedicated community. Its recent recognition among the best new meme projects has further enhanced its reputation and appeal. Since its inception, the XYZ token has demonstrated significant growth. Beginning at $0.0001, it has already surged to $0.003333, with the next target price set at $0.005. By the final presale stage, the token will reach a price of $0.02, paving the way for listings on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. Anticipated listings at a price point of $0.10 suggest the potential for returns of up to 1,000x for early investors, contingent upon achieving the projected market capitalization. Investor interest remains robust, with the project swiftly moving past the $10 million funding milestone and quickly approaching the $15 million benchmark. This momentum underscores strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Community engagement is highly valued and actively rewarded in the XYZVerse ecosystem Dedicated community members are recognized through XYZ token airdrops, ensuring those who actively contribute share in the project’s success. XYZVerse’s strategic approach, including robust tokenomics, planned CEX and DEX listings, and routine token burns, positions the XYZ token for sustained growth and long-term success. Every strategic move aims to bolster token value, rallying a committed community poised to achieve legendary status together.

Despite a 0.56% weekly gain, the memecoin has fallen by 8.71% over the past month. However, over the last six months, DOGE has surged by 50.31%, showing strong long-term growth. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $0.19. If it breaks through, it could target the second resistance at $0.20. On the downside, support is at $0.15, with a further support level at $0.13. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 27.88, indicating that DOGE is oversold. This may signal a potential price rebound. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) are at $0.19. This suggests that a move above these levels could trigger bullish momentum. The MACD Level is negative at -0.00303507345, and the Stochastic indicator is low at 5.90, both pointing toward oversold conditions. These technical factors suggest that DOGE may be poised for a price increase, potentially exceeding the resistance levels in the near term. Shiba Inu price movements Shiba Inu has seen mixed price movements lately. In the past week, the price declined by 2.22%, currently ranging between $0.00001248 and $0.00001288. Over the last month, the price decreased by 5.24%. In the past six months, SHIB’s price dropped by 27.85%. Technical indicators suggest possible changes ahead. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 21.95, indicating oversold conditions. The stochastic oscillator is low at 1.750, implying potential for an upward move. However, the MACD level is negative, which may signal continued bearish momentum. If the price rises, SHIB could face resistance at $0.00001427, about 5% above the current price. The next resistance is at $0.00001560, approximately 15% higher. If the price falls, support may be found at $0.00001161, roughly 5% lower, and then at $0.00001028, about 15% down. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are at $0.00001362 and $0.00001398, indicating the price is slightly below these levels. Conclusion Although DOGE and SHIB are strong, XYZVerse unites sports and memes, aiming to surge to $10. For more information on XYZVerse, visit the website , Telegram , or X .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Dogecoin and Solana face potential 30% declines in April, investors are flocking to the Remittix presale, with over $14.2 million already raised. Table of Contents Solana’s price under pressure Dogecoin price looks fragile Remittix gains momentum among new crypto presales Conclusion Remittix has drawn attention with its fundraising of over $14.2 million through the sale of 524 million tokens at $0.0734 per token, encouraging traders to use its easy crypto-to-fiat conversion system. While the altcoin market attracts strong interest in Remittix, some experts suggest Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) could suffer a 30% decline in April. Solana’s price under pressure On March 28, SOL experienced consolidation which ended as it fell from $138 to $131 after Asian markets opened. Volume increased by 4% to reach $3.4 billion although this level did not stop the price decline. Solana has lost important market ground from its rally since March 11, suggesting potential for further declines in the coming weeks. Some blame macro factors for this shift. The decision by President Donald Trump to levy tariffs on imported cars and automotive parts frightened numerous investors, who showed concerns about rising prices. The Federal Reserve’s attention toward inflationary concerns could stop interest rate reductions, which could also negatively impact risk assets including cryptocurrencies. The $146.5 resistance level for Solana corresponds to a 0.500 Fibonacci retracement point. The chart signals bearish signs when prices get rejected at this level. The market direction depends on sellers’ actions, which may push Solana down to $110 before it reaches $100 based on current market trends. Dogecoin price looks fragile Price fluctuations for DOGE remain limited, with Bollinger Bands establishing $0.19 as the resistance zone and $0.178 as the protective boundary against a decline down to $0.16. Volatility rise is likely because the distance between the bands continues to decrease. The eight to nine month substantial price dip that memecoins experience as the market drops requires DOGE to build its price potential using social media attention. Short-term volatile traders invest in DOGE but they also recognize that it has the potential to decrease by 30%. This leads investors toward alternative stable-gain opportunities.

The project achieves fast and easy access through its bridge system, which has enabled it to surpass $14.2 million in funding from investors seeking early access due to its promising nature. Remittix introduces a streamlined process that separates investors from complex withdrawal procedures and time-intensive cashout methods, which provides them with essential token redemption benefits. User-friendly approaches, according to analysts, indicate that Remittix could escape the fate of periodic buzz and reach greater sustainability. Long-term success occurs in projects which resolve practical, everyday challenges. This is because the solutions appeal to diverse user groups, ranging from small-scale holders to institutions. The lack of both complex bridging mechanisms and specialized knowledge needed to utilize Remittix attracts many investors. Major token holders have simple access to purchase Remittix because of its streamlined purchasing process. Many observers anticipate that Remittix’s token price will continue to climb as the presale continues, looking forward to upcoming partnership announcements and exchange listings. Conclusion While market forecasts point to a potential 30% decrease for Solana and Dogecoin, Remittix’s presale continues receiving investment support. Remittix resolves the universal crypto-to-fiat transfer challenge with speed, delivering a solution that attracts both crypto novices and veterans.

A “tailored regulatory approach” for areas including securities laws and removing “obstacles in banking” is a priority for US lawmakers with “more upside” for the industry, Erder told Cointelegraph. “The new Trump administration is clearly all in on crypto and is taking steps that we could have only dreamed about a few years ago (including during his first term),” he said. “It seems likely that crypto regulation will be able to have it all and get much more clear and rational regulation in all areas, including tax.” Still, Erder noted there are limits to what President Donald Trump can accomplish through executive orders and regulatory agency action alone. “At some point, the laws themselves will need to change, and for that, he will need Congress,” he said. Trump’s March 7 executive order , which directed the government to establish a national Bitcoin reserve using crypto assets seized in criminal cases, was seen as a signal of growing federal support for digital assets. Related: Trump turned crypto from ‘oppressed industry’ to ‘centerpiece’ of US strategy Debanking concerns remain Despite the administration’s recent pro-crypto moves, industry experts say crypto firms may continue to face difficulties with banking access until at least January 2026. “It’s premature to say that debanking is over,” as “Trump won’t have the ability to appoint a new Fed governor until January,” Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, said during Cointelegraph’s Chainreaction daily X show. The Crypto Debanking Crisis: #CHAINREACTION https://t.co/nD4qkkzKnB — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 21, 2025 Industry outrage over alleged debanking reached a crescendo when a June 2024 lawsuit spearheaded by ​​Coinbase resulted in the release of letters showing US banking regulators asked certain financial institutions to “pause” crypto banking activities. Related: Bitcoin may benefit from US stablecoin dominance push Stablecoin legislation could unlock new growth David Pakman, managing partner at crypto investment firm CoinFund, said a stablecoin regulatory framework could encourage more traditional finance institutions to adopt blockchain-based payments. “Some of the potentially soon-to-pass legislation in the US, like the stablecoin bill, will unlock many of the traditional banks, financial services and payment companies onto crypto rails,” Pakman said during Cointelegraph’s Chainreaction live X show on March 27. “We hear this firsthand when we talk to them; they want to use crypto rails as a lower-cost, transparent, 24/7, and no middleman-dependent network for transferring money.” The comments come as the industry awaits progress on US stablecoin legislation , which may come as soon as in the next two months, according to Bo Hines, the executive director of the president’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. The GENIUS Act, an acronym for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, would establish collateralization guidelines for stablecoin issuers while requiring full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

A steady flow of consecutive bearish candles on the daily timeframe has pulled the price lower each day, eventually guiding it toward an important support at the time of writing. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Face $14 Billion Options Expiry—Market Impact Ahead? As of now, XRP is pressing against the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle, which could determine whether this dip becomes a deeper fall or the start of a rebound for the cryptocurrency. Symmetrical Triangle Support In Focus The symmetrical triangle on XRP’s daily chart is not a new pattern, but the way its price is currently interacting with its lower trendline is setting the stage for what could be a significant move. This interesting phenomenon was noted by a crypto analyst on the TradingView platform, who highlighted this technical zone as a critical decision point for XRP. As shown in the chart below, the symmetrical triangle has been forming gradually since January, with the price oscillating between a sequence of lower highs and higher lows. This has led to a tightening range that hints at an impending breakout or breakdown. The pattern’s base support line has been tested on three separate occasions over the past couple of months, each time resulting in a bounce upward. However, the persistence of retests also means the current retest might be broken easily. Where Can XRP Go From Here? If XRP manages to hold its ground at this support level and attract buying interest, a bounce could be on the cards. A successful rebound from this trendline might trigger a move toward the triangle’s upper boundary, which is acting as resistance. Such a rally wouldn’t just keep the triangle intact, but it could also bring in bullish sentiment after four weeks of selling pressure. Still, the strength of any bounce will likely hinge on the accompanying trading volume. A bounce without a strong trading volume could result in a fake breakout. However, the opposite scenario is just as likely. If XRP closes the daily candlestick below this support level, it would confirm a breakdown from the triangle structure, opening the door to further downside. As the analyst noted, “losing support may lead to further downside pressure.” A breakdown would not only invalidate the consolidation structure but could also trigger stop-loss orders below support. Given the lack of immediate strong support beneath the current zone, XRP might face a strong decline to $2 if the support level fails to hold.

Interestingly, the price dipped slightly below the lower boundary of the triangle earlier in the day. However, this move was quickly met with buying pressure, pushing the price action back into the triangle’s range. This small yet important action shows that bulls are still active at this level.

With XRP facing a potential drop to $0.50, investors are shifting toward Rollblock, a revenue-sharing altcoin that’s rapidly gaining attention. Table of Contents Rollblock turns heads with its gaming platform This pattern could spell doom for the XRP price The RBLK presale offers a safe haven The XRP price continues to stall as it threatens to breach a critical support level that could lead to a plunge below $1 if buying activity doesn’t pick up. To mitigate risk, XRP investors are rotating funds into undervalued projects with untapped potential that could yield substantial returns as the cycle progresses. One such project is crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK), a new entry in the crypto gaming space. The RBLK presale has attracted tens of thousands of early investors, raising over $11 million in record time. As interest grows, analysts expect Rollblock’s valuation to reach a critical mass and surge once the RBLK token hits the markets. Rollblock turns heads with its gaming platform Rollblock continues to tear through milestones as over 50,000 users joined the viral presale of the RBLK token and are already enjoying the platform’s massive gaming library. Rollblock is set to turn the $450 billion gaming industry on its head with its transformative framework, which leverages the Ethereum blockchain as its foundational layer. By bridging the gap between DeFi and online gaming, Rollblock brings its users the best of both worlds. This means unmatched ease of access and robust security protocols without sacrificing transparency and user privacy. More than 8,000 games await new players, ranging from all-time favorites such as roulette and blackjack to live games for the thrill of a real Vegas experience. In addition to this, sports enthusiasts can enjoy a sports betting option, further expanding the scope of the Rollblock experience. Why Rollblock is ahead of the competition Rollblock has been designed to double as an investment vehicle, and through its revenue-sharing system, users will be able to earn passive income with zero hassles. To sustain this, Rollblock will reinvest up to 30% of its weekly revenue to perform open-market buybacks. A portion of this amount will be redistributed to investors, encouraging long-term holding. The rest will be burned, creating the ideal deflationary environment for scarcity-driven price growth. Until the end of March, users can participate in the Mayhem initiative and earn a 30% bonus for each friend they refer. You might also like: Solana and XRP crash but is the worst yet to come? Investors divert to altcoin up 520% This pattern could spell doom for the XRP price Analyst Peter Brandt shared a bearish outlook regarding the XRP price . He pointed out that a head-and-shoulders pattern is shaping up on the XRP chart, which typically foreshadows a major price breakdown. If this projection plays out, XRP could plunge below $1 in the coming months and potentially bottom out at around $0.50. At press time, XRP is trading at $2.16 after experiencing a sharp rejection at the $2.47 resistance level. On the daily timeframe, XRP has posted a 7.6% loss after fully retracting its recent gains. A glance at the monthly chart reveals that XRP has been range-locked at around $2.30 and is currently testing the lower bound of its price channel. As uncertainty grips the market, futures and perpetual traders are taking a step back from XRP, as reflected by the 1.3% decrease in Open Interest (OI), now standing at $1.6 billion. XRP’s recent dip also resulted in a significant liquidation event, as more than $22 million worth of long positions were wiped out, forcing market participants to tread carefully. The RBLK presale offers a safe haven In stage 10 of the presale, RBLK is currently priced at $0.062 and an 800% rally is expected by the end of the presale as demand keeps growing. But this is just the start of Rollblock’s moon mission — once the token is listed on major exchanges and the crypto gaming narrative starts ramping up, a 100x multiplier could be in the cards.

Analysts suggest it might surpass well-known tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Is XYZVerse set to become the next major player in the digital currency world? Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $10 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million .

Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Took the World by Surprise Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. Its creators used a popular meme of a Shiba Inu dog for its logo, aiming to create a fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. Unlike Bitcoin, which is scarce, Dogecoin is plentiful. There’s no maximum supply, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Despite its playful beginnings, Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021. Fueled by social media buzz and tweets from Elon Musk, it became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, reaching a market value over $50 billion. This rise showed the power of community and social media in today’s financial world. Now, people are curious about Dogecoin’s potential. It’s built on technology similar to Litecoin, allowing for fast transactions with low fees. This could make it useful for everyday payments. While it lacks some advanced features of other coins, its strong community support is a big plus. In the current market, cryptocurrencies are gaining more attention and acceptance. Whether Dogecoin will continue to make waves depends on ongoing community enthusiasm and real-world uses. From a simple joke to a notable digital currency, Dogecoin has shown it can’t be ignored. Shiba Inu Coin: From Meme to Mainstream? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin, but with a twist. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives it access to Ethereum’s vast ecosystem, making it more versatile. Starting with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin as a gesture of trust. Buterin’s donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burning 40% of the supply boosted SHIB’s profile. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans for an NFT platform and DAO governance suggest SHIB could have broader utility. In the current market, SHIB stands out due to its potential beyond being a meme. While memecoins often gain popularity through hype, SHIB’s technological foundation may give it an edge. However, market volatility is a factor to consider. Compared to other coins, its Ethereum base might attract those seeking both meme appeal and functional utility. Conclusion Though DOGE and SHIB are significant, XYZVerse’s unique blend of memes and sports aims to surpass them with ambitious growth and community-driven features, potentially becoming the “G.O.A.T” of memecoins.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading at $83,317. The broader cryptocurrency market has also substantially dropped over the past few sessions. The crypto market cap dropped almost 1% to $2.7 trillion in the past 24 hours. Crypto Market Continues Decline The cryptocurrency market has declined substantially over the weekend, with major cryptocurrencies, including BTC , trading in the red. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped more than 5% over Friday and Saturday before registering a marginal recovery during the ongoing session. According to analysts, the drop is part of a wider derisking move among traders as investors anticipate the impact of President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, set to come into force on April 2. The decline in crypto prices accelerated after core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) numbers came in hotter than expected. Consumer confidence data has dropped more than expected this week, while the index for future expectations came at a 12-year low. The markets also saw over $300 million worth of long positions liquidated on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, while over $38 million worth of shorts were liquidated. All of these factors have led to investors reducing their exposure to risk assets, triggering a flight to safe-haven assets. Robert Kiyosaki Doubles Down On Bitcoin Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling book Rich Dad Poor Dad, believes the world is already in a recession, as he offered his take on the state of the economy. Kiyosaki doubled down on Bitcoin , stating that inflation is theft and fiat money is a trap, and urged investors to switch to Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Kiyosaki shared his thoughts in a post on X, stating, “Is the world in a recession? I say Yes. And I have been doing my best to warn people since I wrote Rich Dad’s Prophecy in 2012. Emphasizing that it’s not too late to pivot and make changes. The facts are the world is in a recession. The facts are inflation is going up, and so is unemployment. The most important question is: What are you going to do about this recession? Will this recession make you richer or poorer? The choice is yours, and your choice of education can be free. Take care, and make this recession the best thing that has ever happened to you. You and only you have that power.” Kiyosaki reiterated his stance on money, adding that he has always advocated that people not save fake money, referring to fiat currency, and recommended saving real gold, silver, and more recently, Bitcoin. Kiyosaki noted, “The rich get richer: For many years, I have been recommending people not save fake money aka fiat government money. For years, I have recommended saving real gold and silver coins, and recently bitcoin. As the prices of gold, silver, and bitcoin go up the purchasing power of those who work for and save fake money get poorer via government theft known as inflation.” The renowned author called silver the most undervalued of the three investments in the short term, stating, “Silver for the next two months is the best of the three. I believe silver may soon be $70 an ounce this year and $200 in a year or two.” Kiyosaki has always spoken against fiat currency, warned of growing inflation, and predicted economic turmoil. The author has consistently championed assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin as tools for financial independence. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp drop on Saturday, dropping over 2% to a low of $81,697 before settling at $82,704. The decline can be attributed to hotter-than-expected inflation data, higher US tariffs, and uncertainty about the Bitcoin Act, adversely impacting market sentiment. Investors also reacted to the US Personal Income and Outlays Report. US spot Bitcoin ETFs also snapped a 10-day inflow streak, with the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) registering net outflows of $93 million. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and other issuers registered zero net flows. Despite Friday’s outflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered $196 million in net inflows for the week ending March 28, indicating short-term bearishness but long-term resilience. CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno stated, “As we keep mentioning, Bitcoin demand remains in contraction mode, declining at the fastest pace since Dec. 2023.” BTC registered a sharp increase on Wednesday, rising above the 20 and 200-day SMAs. However, it lost momentum on Thursday, dropping below the moving averages and settling at $84,215. Price action remained bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $83,822. Sentiment changed on Sunday as BTC rose nearly 3% to move past the 20 and 200-day SMAs and $86,116. Buyers retained control on Monday, and BTC raced to an intraday high of $88,839. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $87,523, ultimately registering an increase of 1.63%. Source: TradingView However, momentum stalled on Tuesday as BTC encountered volatility and selling pressure. As a result, the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $87,417. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC registered another marginal drop, slipping below $87,000 and settling at $86,842. BTC registered a marginal increase on Thursday to reclaim $87,000 and settle at $87,236. However, market sentiment turned bearish on Friday. As a result, BTC plunged over 3%, slipping below the 200-day SMA and settling at $84,422. The price continued to drop on Saturday, falling below the 20-day SMA to $82,704, but not before dropping to a low of $81,697. BTC has recovered during the ongoing session, registering a marginal increase and trading around $83,390. BTC’s near-term outlook depends on macroeconomic indicators and regulatory signals, along with upcoming US jobs data numbers. If ETF inflows resume and bulls retain control, BTC could move back above the 20 and 200-day SMAs and push towards $90,000. A break above this level could see a move to $100,000 materialize. On the other hand, if selling pressure returns, BTC could drop to $80,000 or lower. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42637693,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=389995,1743332062,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/42637693.jpeg,The Truth About Ripple (XRP) ETFs: Should You Be Worried?,https://cryptopotato.com/the-truth-about-ripple-xrp-etfs-should-you-be-worried/,"XRP’s price has been one of the hottest topics for discussion amongst the crypto community for a while now and that’s understandable. After all, it’s an O.G. cryptocurrency that’s here for the past few cycles, but it’s status has been debated at length, especially during Ripple’s legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The outcome of this was long touted as a massive catalyst for XRP’s price and it appears that the dispute has reached a turning point and one that is seemingly in favor of the company. XRP and the Outcome of the Ripple v. SEC Lawsuit Just recently, Brad Garlinghouse, took it to social media to share the big news – the Commission quit the pursue of its appeal, essentially putting a de-facto end to the lawsuit – the moment the community was waiting for. There it was – the massive catalyst everyone was waiting for, so how did the XRP price react? Initially, there was a sruge, but things calmed down almost immediately and the price has since retraced to the levels from before the self-proclaimed victory. Source: CoinGecko This begs the question – what now? Well, it appears that the market is chasing the next potential catalyst – namely, the approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds in the US. XRP ETFs: The Reality Multiple high-profile asset managers have filed applications for the approval of a spot XRP ETF in the United States, the majority of which are awaiting decision by the end of this year. The list includes, but is not limited to Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and so forth. Many industry experts are of the opinion that following Ripple’s de-facto victory in the battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the path to an approval is more or less paved. Why? Well, according to the standing decision of Judge Analisa Torres, XRP sales on the secondary market to regular users do not constitute an investment contract. But is the approval of an XRP ETF a potential catalyst for a surge in its price? This depends on one major factor – demand. BTC has seen a massively healthy flow in spot-based ETF products since their inception (with the occasional market-drive exceptions), but that’s because of its nature and widely-accepted status of a digital store of value. Its supply is fairly distributed with no single entity controling a dominant share, which is the absolute opposite for ripple. XRP’s supply is heavily concentrated and the company behind it – Ripple – controls the market – it’s as simple as that. No locking structures and promises can change the fact that there’s a single centralized entity capable of shifting the market dynamics at any time – something that could be seen as a major deterrent for serious investors even upon the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF. And while a short-term surge is likely a given, the longer-term impact on ETFs on XRP’s price is far from certain.

Now, a new performer is stepping into the spotlight, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a penny crypto with massive upside potential. Currently in its presale stage, this rapidly growing altcoin has already amassed almost $5.7 million, with Phase 4 progressing at $0.025. More than 7400 investors have seized the opportunity, positioning themselves ahead of a 20% price increase in the next phase. Those joining at this stage are poised for a 140% return on investment when Mutuum Finance officially launches at $0.06. The DeFi Breakthrough Attracting Major Attention The decentralized finance market has seen positive performance from Mutuum Finance through its advanced dual-lending structure. Currently in its presale status Mutuum Finance has raised $5.7 in funding from more than 7400 investors. The ongoing phase 4 provides investors an ideal moment to seize higher returns since the price will rise by 20% to $0.025. MUTM emerges as a leading DeFi project because experts believe it is one of the most underappreciated opportunities featuring a distinct lending framework that differentiates it from common rivals. Mutuum Finance uses a dual-model system which unites Peer-to-Contract (P2C) along with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending to redefine decentralized lending operations. Users can benefit from passive returns in P2C model liquidity pools by depositing stablecoins like USDT while borrowers use this system for efficient fund access. Through P2P lending users establish straight deals between each other because this approach avoids using middle groups. Mutuum Finance uses a dual-model structure which merges P2C with P2P lending activities to offer clients improved security together with enhanced efficiency and decentralization capabilities. Users at Mutuum Finance can maintain full control over lending choices which establishes a more flexible system that supports different types of conservative and high-yield investors. A Secure & Stable Ecosystem Mutuum Finance launches a stablecoin on Ethereum that has complete collateral support for maintaining USD price equality. Users must provide more value than the stablecoin value due to its resistance to volatility through over-collateralized methods which protect against any risks of liquidation. The long-term sustainability of the platform receives strong support from this mechanism through its foundation of well-established value principles. Full contract auditing and transparent financial structures at Mutuum Finance reinforce investor confidence thus preventing the risks which led to past issues at other DeFi lending platforms. Strategic Tokenomics for Long-Term Success Mutuum Finance’s tokenomics strategy is designed for sustainable growth, balancing liquidity, security, and partnerships while preventing inflation. A carefully designed token sale process combined with controlled distribution methods establish enduring value. The staking reward system provides users with increased profitability by ensuring consistent yield generation which builds community participation. The system includes mechanisms to reduce token supply which effectively creates scarcity and strengthens token appreciation in both the present and future timescales. Crypto investors who bought Shiba Inu (SHIB) achieved overnight million-dollar fortunes before the emergence of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The prefabricated DeFi drive MUTM operates at presale price of $0.025 and has attracted $5.7 million from 7,400 investors. The upcoming price change will bring a 20% rise but the established launch value stands at $0.06 while delivering an 140% profit to early investors. The dual-lending system, stablecoins with over-collateralization and third-party-audited smart contracts make Mutuum Finance stand as one of the leading DeFi projects. The market forecasts that MUTM tokens will increase more than $1 following its 2025 launch which positions it as an outstanding crypto investment opportunity.

In a March 29 X post , Leishman cautioned that adding non-Bitcoin tokens puts exchanges on a “forever hamster wheel” of memecoin listings . He argued that once platforms introduce a single altcoin, they are effectively bound to expand their token offerings—especially for ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana, where tokens proliferate. “It makes no sense to list ETH if you don’t also list the tokens issued on it, and the same goes for Solana,” Leishman explained. As the head of River Financial, a Bitcoin-only institution that steers clear of altcoins, Leishman drew a sharp distinction between Bitcoin-centric platforms and multi-asset exchanges. He contended that Bitcoin-only services prioritize long-term wealth building, while exchanges catering to altcoins often fuel short-term speculation. “The casino business model is built around maximal extraction from customers,” Leishman wrote, stating that Bitcoin-only platforms like Swan Bitcoin, Bull Bitcoin, and Bisq focus on fostering genuine financial growth rather than speculative trading. Altcoin Listings Spark a Never-Ending Cycle of Speculation Leishman’s concerns echo broader skepticism from industry leaders. In April 2024, A16z CTO Eddy Lazzarin criticized the surge of memecoins, arguing that they detract from the long-term vision of crypto by encouraging risky, casino-like behavior. However, despite criticism, exchanges continue to benefit from the memecoin frenzy. For example, Robinhood, which offers a range of altcoins, reported a 700% year-over-year increase in Q4 2024 crypto revenue—highlighting the lucrative nature of multi-asset trading platforms. Memecoin Market Decline Contrasts with Exchange Profits While exchanges profit from listing memecoins, the market itself is showing signs of weakness. The total memecoin market cap has plunged by 49% since January 1, 2025, now sitting at $48.49 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Still, some traders interpret memecoin listings as a signal of credibility, creating short-term pumps. In 2024, 12 out of 15 memecoins listed by Binance saw significant price surges post-listing, according to onchain analyst Ai_9684xtpa. Despite the current market decline, CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong believes that a few memecoins may endure. He speculated that the market could eventually reflect an “extreme power law”, where 99.99% of tokens collapse, while a handful become long-term winners.

In the clip, Buterin kneels down, petting the head of the robot and saying a cat-like “meow” — which left most members of the crypto community scratching their heads, if not cringeworthy. While others viewed it as harmless whimsy, others called it “sad” and made fun of it with profanity-studded commentary. Memes rapidly filled up timelines, with some remaking the scene to look like something from a Studio Ghibli movie. Ether’s Price Slide Adds to the Noise The timing of the video was not proving beneficial. Ether (ETH) has declined nearly 55% from its high point in December 2024 of $4,000. ETH is currently trading at $1,833 at press time after dropping over 8% in the past week. Some are claiming Buterin’s focus elsewhere where it needs to be. Crypto personality “The Count of Monte Crypto” playfully poked fun at that ETH’s price was a bigger problem than Buterin’s antics — but others were less kind. Community Pushback and Criticism As soon as the video went public, Buterin attempted to divert the topic by posting about subsidizing public goods on Twitter. The crypto community had no patience for it. Some responses ranged from straightforward apathy (“NO ONE F–KING CARE[S]”) to open accusations of abandoning and selling out airdrops. It’s not the first time Buterin’s eccentricity has drawn flames. At TOKEN2049 in Singapore, his singing on-stage was followed by a “loser s—” comment from rapper Iggy Azalea. A Singular Voice in a Polarized Field Despite the criticism, Buterin is still against straightforward allegiances. He has openly criticized former SEC chairman Gary Gensler and warned of political tokens, thus tacitly rejecting Trump-sympathetic crypto projects. This distinguishes him from other crypto figures who have rallied behind Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. Buterin’s self-stated refusal to “bronze-aged mindsets” may alienate some but positions Ethereum on his own vision of decentralization. What’s Next for Ethereum? As the price of Ether drops and its co-founder turns into a meme, Ethereum’s near-term future is uncertain. Whether Buterin’s unorthodox presence will be a blessing or a curse to the brand will ultimately hinge on whether Ethereum can bounce back — both economically and in the eyes of its enthusiasts.",Ethereum|Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|ASIA,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-03-30 11:16:52

This extended period of consolidation suggests that a breakout in either direction could be significant. If bulls push beyond $3.40, XRP may rally toward $4.00, while a breakdown below $2.00 could trigger a decline to $1.80. Daily Chart Analysis The daily chart indicates resistance at $2.64, a crucial level to overcome for further upward momentum. If buyers gain control and break this resistance, XRP could climb toward $2.80, with extended targets near $3.00. Conversely, if $2.00 support fails, a deeper retracement toward $1.85–$1.90 is likely. 4-Hour Chart and Short-Term Movements The 4-hour timeframe shows that XRP is facing resistance between $2.90 and $3.00, with strong support around $2.40–$2.50. A breakout above $3.00 could confirm a bullish trend, potentially pushing XRP toward $3.40. However, falling below $2.40 may indicate weakness, leading to a retest of the $2.15 zone. Predicted Price Action for the Week Bullish Scenario: If XRP clears the $2.64 resistance on the daily chart, expect a move toward $2.80–$3.00. A breakout above $3.00 could lead to $3.40. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bearish Scenario: Failure to hold above $2.15–$2.00 may trigger a downturn toward $1.85. XRP’s price action this week hinges on key resistance and support levels. While a bullish breakout remains possible , traders should monitor market sentiment and volume closely. Given crypto volatility, strategic risk management is essential for navigating potential price swings. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This comes ​in the wake of Galaxy Digital’s recent $200 million settlement with the New York Attorney General (NYAG). Belshe claims that the foundation of his regulation argument is based on the belief that sufficient oversight is the most effective way to address industry problems that might result in overregulation. Belshe condemns Galaxy Digital’s actions, warns of industry-wide consequences In response to a post from SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, Belshe noted that denying NYAG’s strong case against Galaxy Digital was difficult. BitGo’s CEO criticized the company’s pump-and-dump tactics, stating that selling tokens immediately after they vest while publicly promoting them as a long-term hold is unethical. Interestingly, he reaffirmed his admiration for Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, and his industrial contributions. However, Belshe stated Galaxy Digital’s actions were unethical in light of the NYAG’s policies. He said that whether or not it was an overreach of the law, and that kind of behavior damaged the reputation of their entire industry. Therefore, Belshe argued that if left unchecked, it could result in over-regulation and urged users to read the controls placed on Galaxy as part of that settlement. Galaxy Digital settles with NYAG for $200M over Luna promotion controversy The NYAG filed a complaint accusing the Galaxy Digital investment firm of breaking the law by advertising an asset without revealing its intention to sell it. According to the filing, Galaxy did not acknowledge or deny wrongdoing during the transaction. According to Galaxy’s earnings statement released recently, the company and the state authority reached a settlement on March 27 to settle civil claims about specific investments, trading, and public statements it made about Luna between late 2020 and 2022. To illustrate, in 2020, Galaxy and Novogratz started promoting Terraform Labs’ Luna cryptocurrency, which was designed primarily to use algorithmic trading to support the value of its sister coin, TerraUSD. Later, in mid-2022, the market value of both tokens declined sharply to almost nothing, wiping out over $40 billion. As part of a settlement with the New York Attorney General, Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Holdings was given a $200 million penalty to pay for the investment firm’s involvement in promoting the failed Luna cryptocurrency. The $200 million undiscounted monetary penalty will be paid in installments until 2028. Noting the effect of discounting, Galaxy’s full-year results on March 28 included a $166 million legal provision to cover the fine. Novogratz said the decision was difficult, and they had to consider it carefully. He highlighted that Galaxy had cooperated completely with regulators, including the New York Attorney General, over the past few years. He added that the unethical practices they were accused of resulted from the deceit of Luna’s founders, Do Kwon and Terraform, acknowledging that they misled them and several other well-known institutional investors.

42639048,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=389439,1743333980,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/42639048.jpeg,5 Signs Bitcoin Is Primed to Pump Again This Year (Opinion),https://cryptopotato.com/5-signs-bitcoin-is-primed-to-pump-again-this-year-opinion/,"In a blog post on Tuesday, the chief investment officer for the institutional grade Bitcoin ETF issuer wrote: “Two years ago, it was common for Bitwise clients to allocate ~1% of their portfolio to bitcoin and other crypto assets, an amount they could easily afford to lose.” But he’s noticed a big change over the last 24 months: “In today’s environment, it’s a different story. We more frequently see 3% allocations. As more of the world wakes up to the massive derisking we’ve seen in bitcoin, I think you’ll see this number rise to 5% and beyond.” ABC’s “Shark Tank” investing star Kevin O’Leary followed this exact trajectory to massive profits from his Bitcoin investments. Only he was years ahead of the curve. O’Leary devoted 3% of his portfolio to BTC in 2021. A year later he bumped up that balance to 5%. Here are five signal factors driving support for Bitcoin’s price growth in 2025. 1. Bullish BTC Falling Flag Continuation Pattern After correcting from the Jan. 20 historic record high of $109,000, Bitcoin’s price rallied for 14 days starting on Mar. 10, from $78,500 to $87,450 by Mar. 25 (+12% gain). That represents a decisive breakout, confirming the falling flag pattern BTC charted during its correction. This bullish crypto chart pattern often signals the continuation of an uptrend. According to Investopedia, these are some of the most reliable chart signals traders use in markets like crypto and stocks: “These patterns are among the most reliable continuation patterns that traders use because they generate a setup for entering an existing trend that is ready to continue.” The pattern is more reliable as a bull signal if the daily trading volume chart matches the price, tracing a descending rhombus shape that looks like a flag falling in the wind. In this case, Bitcoin’s volume nicely matched the price’s consolidation channel. So it’s a fairly classic example of this bullish sign. Meanwhile, as Bitcoin’s price moved higher into a more sure-footed recovery, the 10-day through 200-day moving average BTC technical indicators all flipped to a Strong Buy recommendation. 2. Bitcoin Price Rally on Trump Tariff Pivot In addition to the Bitcoin’s decisive breakout in March from a 50-day falling flag channel within a steep 16-month uptrend, there’s President Donald Trump’s pivot on tariffs in March. Markets rallied as the Trump relaxed his stance on tariffing imports. Before that, crypto prices fell along with stocks in February over a news cycle heavily focused on tariffs and rumors of more taxes. But, Bitcoin prices began to recover a few days after Trump suspended tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports. It surged again on Mar. 24 and 25 after reports emerged that the White House was about to narrow its tariff agenda significantly. Instead of broad industry tariffs on major trading partners, Trump would focus tariffs in a more targeted plan to be levied on countries with the most severe US trade imbalances. BTC continued to notch gains on Mar. 26 as Trump confirmed the softer tariff stance in an interview: “I’ll probably be more lenient than reciprocal, because if I was reciprocal, that would be very tough for people.” These confluences signal the crypto rout over February was more about global tariff worries than a reversal in Bitcoin’s earthshaking 28-month uptrend since Dec. 2022. 3. Wall St. Bitcoin ETFs Roar Back to Life Another rather bullish signal for a Bitcoin trend continuation is the decisive return of inflows to Bitcoin ETFs over several consecutive days beginning on Mar. 14. Flows were heavy on St. Patrick’s Day (Mar. 17), with a total quarter billion worth of Bitcoin ETF purchases by regulated Wall Street investors. The following day inflows topped another $200 billion. Wall St. is more practical and cautious in its BTC trading than the high-conviction Internet cabal of technology futurists, devout political radicals, and laptop capitalists hooked on crypto market ROIs. So, the institutional crowd’s return to bagging crypto ETFs with issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck potentially represents another bullish tailwind that will support more Bitcoin price growth in 2025’s next quarter. 4. Social Sentiment Score Flips Positive In a solid start to crypto’s week, Bitcoin reached as high as $88.5K for the first time in 17 days. Ethereum also jumped above $2,100 for the first time in 14 days. Comments across social media are becoming quite positive, indicating many expect this rally to continue. pic.twitter.com/3w3ZCs512n — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 24, 2025 As these bullish indicators emerged for Bitcoin’s rally, social sentiment flipped from FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) to FOMO (fear of missing out). Blockchain intelligence company Santiment reported on Mar. 24 that positive Bitcoin sentiment had reached its most bullish levels seen in 6 weeks. “Comments across social media are becoming quite positive, indicating many expect this rally to continue,” Santiment said in a post on the X app. In addition to these other signals, they may be encouraged by the bevy of Bitcoin whales who bought 200,000 BTC over the period of one month in March. 5. White House Floats Gold Sale to Buy Bitcoin Executive Director of the @WhiteHouse crypto working group @BoHines talks $BTC , ways to buy more of it and the thinking behind including $ETH , $XRP , $ADA and $SOL in the separate stockpile. https://t.co/dBe1trxAAH pic.twitter.com/mz5Y5p4HgB — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 21, 2025 Trump and the crypto segment got married last year during his historic presidential reelection bid. During a whirlwind of the first 65 days in office, it appears that the honeymoon is far from over. The president and his appointees continue to give strong assurances of legal clarity and fairness to the crypto industry, while making serious moves toward taking a big bite out of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be mined and holding it in reserve for the United States government and citizens. But, in a shocking development, a White House crypto official in late March suggested that the government may sell gold from its official stockpile to buy BTC with the proceeds. It’s another reminder that Bitcoin is far from a flash in the pan Internet fad, as many have taken pains to point out over the past years. The US government’s embrace signals a sea change in the forward outlook for BTC and support for a stellar secular growth trend on the scale of years and decades. Plus in the more immediate term, the cryptocurrency will likely continue to enjoy price support this year from further developments in the US federal policy agenda.

At present, Ripple (XRP) trades at $2.47 per token. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to grow stronger since its launch. Over $5.7 million has been accumulated and 7400 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025 in phase 4 because the value will reach $0.03 as part of Phase 5. Current investors have the opportunity to achieve a 140% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. Envision allocating $450 into Mutuum Finance will burgeon to $250,000 within short timeframe. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending market through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 7400 investors put $5.7 million into the presale. During Phase 4 which presents the current trading value of $0.025 investors can expect a 20% price increase in Phase 5 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $1 after its release on the market. Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a Stable Secure Environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects. Compensation to its Initial Investors Mutuum Finance implements incentive plans as a method to increase its community reach. By offering a million-dollar giveaway the program will give out 10 thousand dollars worth of MUTM tokens to winners among 10 participants in addition to its innovative referral system that pays users for successful new investor acquisitions. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance obtain both special staking pools and governance rights and VIP access to platform updates which keeps them committed to the platform over the long term. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance implements controlled token supply restrictions and deflationary mechanics throughout presales to build scarcity in its framework thus boosting the token’s potential value growth. The staking program gives crypto users attractive incentives to remain engaged while ensuring token sustainability during long-term development of the platform. Mutuum Finance continues to gain momentum, securing $5.7 million in funding and attracting 7,400+ investors who recognize its high-growth potential. With its dual-lending model, Ethereum-backed stablecoin, and strategic incentives, MUTM is shaping up to be a game-changer in DeFi. At its current presale price of $0.025, with an upcoming increase to $0.03, investors have a limited-time opportunity to maximize returns before its projected surge to $1 and beyond.

A breakout here could ignite a strong rally, pushing prices toward multi-year highs. With a solid uptrend intact and increasing accumulation, the stage is set for a potential surge. Key Price Levels Support: $1.75 (primary), $1.50 (major demand zone) Resistance: $2.25 (immediate), $3.00 (breakout trigger) Target Zones: $3.50, $3.84 (ATH), and $5.00-$6.00 (potential expansion) Sustaining momentum above $3.00 could propel XRP into price discovery, challenging its 2018 all-time high of $3.84.

Beyond this level, the price could enter uncharted territory, eyeing $5.00-$6.00 as new resistance zones. However, if the breakout fails, XRP may retrace to $2.25 before making another attempt.

The meme coin space has seen explosive trends, with projects launching and skyrocketing in value almost overnight. While some investors chase fleeting hype, the smart ones recognize a token with real potential before it takes off. Notcoin and Brett have recently made headlines, with Notcoin trading at $0.002538 and a massive $47.59 million in daily volume, while Brett holds strong at $0.035646 with a market cap of $353.26 million. These numbers reflect the growing appetite for meme coins, but one project is stealing the spotlight: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) . The Arctic Pablo Coin presale has entered Crystal Cove, marking a crucial phase in its journey. With a current price of $0.000083 and an anticipated 9,552.41% ROI upon launch, investors are eyeing its enormous potential. The project has already raised over $2 million, signaling strong market confidence. This article will cover the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Notcoin, and Brett, exploring why Arctic Pablo Coin is among the top new meme coins to invest in now. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Burn Mechanism: Driving Scarcity and Long-Term Value One of the defining features of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is its strategic token burn mechanism, designed to enhance scarcity and value over time. Each week, during the presale, any unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation, making every remaining token even more valuable. But the burn doesn’t stop there—once the presale ends, any leftover supply will also be eliminated, reinforcing the deflationary nature of the project. This isn’t just speculation—the burn process is transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring verifiable transactions. With a shrinking supply and increasing demand, early adopters stand to benefit significantly. As the presale progresses and more tokens disappear, the window for entry is closing fast. Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now Crystal Cove Presale Stage: Last Chance to Buy at $0.000083! Meme coin presale has officially entered Crystal Cove, its 16th presale stage, and the excitement is palpable. Currently priced at just $0.000083, this could be one of the last chances to buy in before the price moves up. With an anticipated launch price of $0.008, early investors stand to gain an eye-watering 9,552.41% ROI. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment today would secure 12,048,190 APC, which would be worth $96,385.52 upon launch. Arctic Pablo Coin has already raised over $2 million, signaling strong investor confidence. Each new stage brings a price increase, so securing tokens now ensures the best possible entry point before the listing surge. As Arctic Pablo Coin moves through its roadmap, securing a position in Crystal Cove could be a defining move for investors looking to maximize their returns. The clock is ticking, and with price jumps at each phase, getting in now could be the smartest play. Notcoin’s Market Performance: Trading Volume Surges to $47.59M Notcoin continues to attract investor attention with its latest price of $0.002538. The token’s 24-hour trading volume has surged to $47,590,116, highlighting strong market engagement and increasing speculation on its future trajectory. While price fluctuations are a common occurrence in the volatile crypto space, Notcoin’s growing transaction volume signals sustained interest from traders and investors. This heightened activity suggests that the token is maintaining its relevance in the market, with buyers and sellers actively participating. Whether Notcoin can sustain this momentum remains uncertain, but current trends indicate strong market participation. As investors monitor its price action closely, Notcoin remains a key player in ongoing crypto discussions, reflecting broader market sentiment and potential growth opportunities. Brett (Based) Gains Momentum as a Leading Meme Coin in the BASE Ecosystem Brett (Based) is rapidly gaining traction in the meme coin space, currently priced at $0.035646 with an impressive market cap of $353.26 million. As a project deeply rooted in the BASE ecosystem, Brett has established itself as a strong, community-driven contender in the evolving crypto landscape. Its growing popularity is fueled by consistent trading activity and increasing attention from investors looking for high-potential meme coins. The coin’s presence in the market reflects the expanding influence of the BASE ecosystem, attracting both seasoned traders and new investors. While meme coins are often volatile, Brett’s sustained engagement and dedicated community suggest it could remain a key player. As interest in meme coins surges, Brett continues to capture attention, positioning itself as a noteworthy competitor in the space. Final Thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge Meme coins continue to dominate the crypto scene, with Notcoin and Brett making headlines with their strong market performances. However, the real spotlight is on Arctic Pablo Coin , whose presale is offering one of the most compelling opportunities right now. With its deflationary token burn strategy, Crystal Cove presale stage, and a projected 9,552.41% ROI, Arctic Pablo Coin is among the top new meme coins to invest in now. With every passing stage, the price increases—meaning those who secure their position today stand to benefit the most.

The legendary trader tells his 781,500 followers on the social media platform X that XRP is forming a head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern on the daily chart. An H&S structure is a bearish pattern indicating that an asset has lost momentum to sustain its uptrend after failing to print new highs. According to Brandt, the bearish structure will be invalidated if XRP climbs above a key resistance level. Otherwise, he says XRP is in danger of breaking support at $1.90 and witnessing a waterfall event. “Don’t shoot the messenger. Your favorite Beanie Baby/Pet Rock crypto displays a classic complex H&S top. This could become bullish if $3.0 is exceeded, otherwise the implications are a decline to $1.07.

Before then, criminals have always had a field day using digital assets like Bitcoin for different illicit activities, including money laundering, tax evasion, and terrorism financing. While there was at least little scrutiny on activities, United Kingdom ministers met in April 2024 to launch a crackdown on the emerging threats in the sector. The crackdown allowed the police, other law enforcements, and the HMRC, the UK’s tax, payments, and customs authority to freeze suspicious funds and cryptocurrency wallets. Under the regulation, the United Kingdom law enforcements were granted the authority to seize ill-gotten gains from suspected criminals elements, granting them the approval to freeze crypto wallets for up to three years. Funds frozen in digital assets can be seized under the condition that a court must be satisfied that the holder acquired the tokens in the wallet under illicit circumstances. United Kingdom authorities crackdown on illicit crypto proceeds According to a MailOnline report, an analysis of the court documents published over the last six months revealed that the biggest crypto freeze and seizure so far was about £1.5 million. The document revealed that the funds were kept in a single wallet hosted on United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase, with the actual owner remaining a mystery. The order filed by the HMRC on March 18 at the Newcastle Upon Tyne Magistrate’s Court revealed that the funds could be related to tax evasion. Digital asset freezes in the last six months. Source: MailOnline. Reports also claimed that more funds could have been frozen between April and September 2024, but the data maintained by Courtdesk, the online database for tracking court proceedings in England and Wales only goes back a year due to legal reasons. According to United Kingdom crypto legal expert Nick Barnard, the figure is quite small compared to the large-scale funds that are exchanged during illicit activities. The partner at Corker Binning mentioned that these actors carry out transactions worth billions every day, noting the amount seized in traditional accounts by authorities. Barnard mentioned that the new regime began their operations in April 2024, so they still need a little bit of time to be up to speed. Meanwhile, lawyer Siobhain Egan mentioned to MailOnline that the government is pooling in more resources to aggressively combat money laundering, hence all the freezing that has been happening. Egan, who represents people whose assets have been frozen, expects “a tsunami of freezing orders” in the coming months. Authorities ramp up efforts to combat illicit acts According to the reports, United Kingdom investigators usually work behind the scenes before applying to freeze the funds in the wallets of alleged criminals. This means they do it without their knowledge to prevent them from moving the funds. “If the police have a major investigation into organized criminals laundering money through crypto, they will go in and seize the assets before they finalize the investigation,” Egan said. She also added that in some cases, the owners of the funds will be invited to answer questions, noting that it will help authorities build their cases. Egan added that United Kingdom authorities have been wary of villains using digital assets for illicit activities, noting that they are right to be worried. She added that the new powers are using the crackdown to plug the investigative gaps, noting that it took them a while to catch up in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrencies. “HMRC is very keen on tackling tax evasion and are getting their act together pretty well. The National Crime Agency (NCA) has also been very aggressive,” she said. She also added that most of the people who have been subject to seized assets and fund freezes have been foreign nationals. According to public records, digital assets were used in transacting about $51 billion worth of illicit activities last year. This figure is up from the $46 billion that was on record, excluding the billions stolen from FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who is presently in jail for defrauding US customers and investors. Criminals dump Bitcoin for stablecoins According to a Chainalysis report, criminals are now dumping Bitcoin to use stablecoins for their illicit activities. Up until about 2020, Bitcoin was the most used asset, with the criminals now switching to tokens pegged to a currency, which in this case is usually the dollar. Barnard mentioned that most of the police and finance investigators have limited knowledge of the crypto industry and not much resources are being dedicated by the United Kingdom to understanding or investigating them. He added that more resources are being put towards investigating money laundering using cash and other traditional methods than cryptocurrencies. He also said that some of the proceeds from crimes like drugs, and weapons are always laundered using crypto, while most of the proceeds are usually in cash. Bernard stated that it is practical to freeze funds on known exchanges, knowing that the United Kingdom has connections to enforce it. A big case in the United Kingdom saw about £4.5 billion in Bitcoin seized from a Chinese takeaway worker last year. The 42-year-old used the funds, which she got from laundering £5 billion from an investment fraud, to furnish her lavish lifestyle. According to authorities, she bought a vehicle worth £30,000 and enrolled her child in a £6,000-a-term school near her £5 million home. She was apprehended when she attempted to build a global property empire, trying to buy a Hampstead mansion worth £23 million, a Tuscan villa worth £10 million, and apartments in Dubai. She was sentenced to jail for six years in May 2024. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Stablecoin rules needed in US before crypto tax reform, experts say United States cryptocurrency regulations need more clarity on stablecoins and banking relationships before lawmakers prioritize tax reform, according to industry leaders and legal experts. “In my view, tax isn’t necessarily the priority for upgrading US crypto regulation,” according to Mattan Erder, general counsel at layer-3 decentralized blockchain network Orbs. A “tailored regulatory approach” for areas including securities laws and removing “obstacles in banking” is a priority for US lawmakers with “more upside” for the industry, Erder told Cointelegraph. “The new Trump administration is clearly all in on crypto and is taking steps that we could have only dreamed about a few years ago (including during his first term),” he said. “It seems likely that crypto regulation will be able to have it all and get much more clear and rational regulation in all areas, including tax.” Still, Erder noted there are limits to what President Donald Trump can accomplish through executive orders and regulatory agency action alone. “At some point, the laws themselves will need to change, and for that, he will need Congress,” he said. Trump’s March 7 executive order , which directed the government to establish a national Bitcoin reserve using crypto assets seized in criminal cases, was seen as a signal of growing federal support for digital assets. Vitalik Buterin meows at a robot, and the crypto world loses it A video of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin kneeling in front of a robot and seemingly letting out a “meow” sound has gone viral — and, as usual, the crypto industry is already speculating what it might mean for Ether’s future. “The future of Ethereum is in this man’s hands… Meow,” crypto influencer Wendy O said in a March 29 X post. Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel shared the video and commented that “so much” of his professional life and net worth depend on Buterin but reiterated that the entertaining interaction makes him “bullish.” Source: Rinor Pseudonymous crypto trader Scott Crypto Warrior shared the video with his 514,300 X followers and said, “Pray for our ETH bags.” The short clip shows Buterin on his knees, gesturing at a four-legged robot and letting out what sounds like a “meow” before patting it on the head. At the time of publication, Buterin has yet to address the video on social media himself. Kalshi prediction market files lawsuits against gaming commissions in two US states Kalshi, the onchain prediction market, has filed a lawsuit against gaming regulators in the US states of Nevada and New Jersey after both states sent cease and desist orders for Kalshi to pause its sports event contracts.

Since January, bulls have failed to regain control, and ETH has continued to bleed value in a market increasingly dominated by fear and uncertainty. With no clear signs of a reversal, the coming weeks could bring more pain for investors holding long positions. Related Reading: Solana Bears Eye $113 Target If Ascending Structure Breaks Down – Details Global financial markets remain on edge as trade war fears and geopolitical tensions intensify. This hostile macro environment has driven investors away from high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum has been one of the hardest hit. The weakness in price reflects not only technical breakdowns but also a broader lack of confidence in short-term recovery. Top analyst Big Cheds recently shared a technical analysis showing Ethereum is now trading at $1,840 — a staggering drop from its $3,400 level earlier this year. According to Cheds, this confirms the continuation of the current downtrend, with ETH now moving into lower demand zones that could offer limited support. Unless bulls step in with strength, Ethereum’s outlook remains bearish. The market is watching closely to see if $1,800 can hold — or if deeper losses lie ahead as momentum continues to favor the downside. Ethereum Under Pressure As Key Levels Collapse Ethereum is in a critical position as it continues to lose key support levels under mounting selling pressure. After briefly reclaiming the $2,000 mark in recent weeks, ETH has once again fallen below this crucial threshold — a failure that has intensified bearish sentiment and placed bulls in a defensive stance. With each failed recovery attempt, investor confidence weakens, and analysts are now calling for a deeper correction in the coming weeks. The situation is particularly delicate as Ethereum serves as the backbone for much of the crypto ecosystem. A sustained downtrend in ETH doesn’t just impact its own holders but also influences the broader altcoin market and DeFi sectors that rely on Ethereum’s price strength for momentum. The continued decline has heightened concerns that a prolonged bear phase may be unfolding. Big Cheds shared a bearish technical outlook, pointing to the severity of ETH’s drop from its $3,400 local high to the current $1,840 level. According to Cheds, if the downtrend continues, the next key accumulation zone to watch could be between $1,200 and $1,300 — a range that previously acted as a strong base during earlier cycles. If Ethereum falls to that zone, it would represent a correction of over 60% from its recent peak. Such a move would signal a major breakdown in structure and test long-term investor conviction. For now, bulls must fight to hold the $1,800 level and attempt to reclaim lost ground. Without a shift in momentum soon, the road ahead for ETH looks increasingly challenging — and the broader market may follow its lead downward. Related Reading: Bitcoin OTC Desks Are Draining – Supply Squeeze On The Horizon? Key Resistance Levels Remain Untouched Ethereum is currently trading at $1,840, continuing to show weakness after failing to reclaim the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), both sitting near the $2,100 level. These indicators have acted as strong dynamic resistance since December 2024, and ETH has consistently traded below them — a clear sign that bears remain in control of the trend. This prolonged weakness below the 200 MA and EMA has reinforced the bearish momentum, with bulls unable to regain any meaningful ground in recent months. Until Ethereum can break back above these key technical levels, any attempt at a sustained recovery is likely to fall short. A reclaim of the 200 MA and EMA could trigger a significant upside move, as it would signal a shift in short-term market structure and potentially spark renewed buying interest. However, even before that happens, bulls must focus on reclaiming the psychological $2,000 level — a major price zone that has repeatedly defined the battle between buyers and sellers.

However, recent price developments and shifting investor interest indicate that a correction may be underway. While Solana (SOL) remains a respected name in crypto, attention is quickly shifting toward Coldware (COLD) , a Layer-1 blockchain project that has already surged by 230% and is gaining traction for its real-world applications and hardware integrations. Coldware Surges Ahead As Solana Cools Off Coldware (COLD) is taking the spotlight with a 230% price surge, driven by its robust Layer-1 architecture and its ecosystem of real-world Web3 tools. Coldware’s offering includes hardware devices tailored for decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePin), a modular dApp Store, and the powerful PayFi financial suite. Unlike hype-driven projects, Coldware (COLD) focuses on functionality and long-term utility, positioning itself as a scalable, secure solution for global finance and infrastructure. Coldware’s momentum contrasts sharply with Solana (SOL)’s current market performance. Investors are beginning to shift capital from established Layer-1s like Solana (SOL) toward promising utility-based ecosystems like Coldware (COLD) , which continues to show early-stage strength and expanding adoption. Solana (SOL) Price Pressure Builds Solana (SOL), after reaching a brief high, now faces mounting pressure as the price dips from previous resistance levels. The recent wave of community excitement around meme coins and rapid trading volume has cooled off, and Solana (SOL) has dropped roughly 8% since March 25. With the price unable to reclaim the $150 level, concerns are growing that Solana (SOL) could fall below the psychological $100 barrier. Investors are responding by looking elsewhere for growth, and Coldware (COLD) is one of the most mentioned alternatives. Its growth is not driven by speculation but by tangible utility: smart contract compatibility, NFT integration, hardware-secured wallets, and cross-border DeFi payments. Solana (SOL) Still Holds Value—But Coldware Offers More Solana (SOL) still boasts impressive performance metrics, including ultra-fast transaction speeds and low-cost smart contract execution. Its flexibility in programming languages continues to attract developers. But many investors are reassessing their positions, seeing limited upside in the near term. Coldware (COLD) , by contrast, offers new tools for builders and users alike, including the Freeze.Mint platform for Web3 token creation and a rapidly growing DePin infrastructure. This positions Coldware not only as a strong competitor but as a foundational piece of the next phase of blockchain adoption. Conclusion: Coldware Leads as Solana Stumbles While Solana (SOL) has earned its place as a foundational Layer-1 blockchain, current market momentum suggests a pause or even decline in growth. Coldware (COLD) is stepping in to fill that gap with tangible utility, cutting-edge technology, and a commitment to real-world scalability. With a 230% surge and increasing whale investor activity, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming the go-to Layer-1 project for serious investors seeking long-term gains.

Recent price action shows SOL unable to break out of its downward trend, even as new developments continue on its network. As Solana (SOL) struggles, Coldware (COLD) emerges as a leading Layer-1 blockchain project with a distinct advantage in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and decentralized infrastructure. Coldware Takes the Lead in Real-World Crypto Integration Coldware (COLD) is not just another Layer-1 token. It’s an entire ecosystem combining decentralized payments (PayFi), secure IoT devices, and Freeze.Mint, a Web3 creation platform that empowers users to build tokens, games, and tools without code. Coldware (COLD) also bridges the gap between physical and digital infrastructure by offering hardware products that support on-chain authentication and finance—making it the ideal foundation for scaling RWA in crypto. As investors look for meaningful exposure to real-world assets and blockchain-backed economic activity, Coldware (COLD) stands at the forefront of this evolution. Solana (SOL) Struggles With Momentum Despite Innovations Despite a strong community and new Layer-2 projects like Solaxy, Solana (SOL) is still underperforming. After peaking near $147, Solana (SOL) has dropped 8% and shows signs of stagnation. The meme coin boom that previously energized the network has cooled, with declining on-chain activity raising concerns among analysts. While Solana (SOL) has launched new projects like zBTC and improved DeFi access through APOLLO, market sentiment remains mixed. Traders now seek alternative Layer-1s that offer utility beyond performance benchmarks—and Coldware (COLD) is answering that call. Why Investors Are Turning to Coldware (COLD) Coldware’s growth is driven by innovation and utility. Investors are no longer chasing hype—they want products and infrastructure. Coldware’s modular hardware devices, IoT integrations, and mobile-first blockchain tooling offer a way to bridge Web3 with physical applications. This is what sets Coldware apart from Solana (SOL), which, despite its speed, remains software-bound. Furthermore, Coldware’s PayFi platform is designed to reach unbanked regions, deliver stablecoins, and provide peer-to-peer lending solutions—all built on its Layer-1 chain. These are practical use cases investors believe will drive long-term adoption. Solana (SOL) Remains Respected, But Coldware Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) continues to be a top player in the blockchain world with its high throughput and massive developer base. However, real-world application remains the new gold standard. Coldware (COLD) is leading the RWA race by connecting hardware, smart contracts, and end-user accessibility—something Solana (SOL) has yet to fully achieve. Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) Is the Best Buy at This Moment As Solana (SOL) holds around $126 and attempts to recover, the spotlight is moving rapidly toward Coldware (COLD). With a unique blend of Layer-1 performance, real-world utility, and scalable applications across sectors, Coldware (COLD) is not just another blockchain—it’s the infrastructure for the next digital economy. Investors looking for the best crypto to buy in 2025 are finding their answer in Coldware (COLD) .

With whispers of a $25 price target for Coldware (COLD) echoing through private trading circles, aggressive investors are now reallocating from legacy plays like Solana (SOL) into Coldware’s expanding utility ecosystem. Coldware (COLD): A New Standard in Blockchain Utility Coldware (COLD) is not just another blockchain token—it’s a complete Web3 ecosystem built from the ground up to serve real-world needs. Its PayFi infrastructure enables decentralized payments, while its hardware suite includes IoT devices tailored for identity, remittance, and micro-transactions. Coldware’s Freeze.Mint protocol is designed to make token creation seamless and verifiable, especially for builders aiming to innovate without technical bottlenecks. With all systems built natively on a Layer-1 blockchain, Coldware (COLD) eliminates the congestion and fragmentation seen on networks like Solana (SOL). It’s no wonder that whales from both the Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) camps are making substantial moves into Coldware (COLD). Solana (SOL) Whales Eye Coldware for Future Returns Recent data suggests that early investors in Solana (SOL), who once capitalized on its lightning-fast transaction layer, are looking to diversify into Coldware. Why? Scalability on Solana (SOL) has plateaued for some use cases, while Coldware (COLD) is bringing fresh firepower to the market with its dApp store, modular blockchain devices, and native payment layer. Solana (SOL) may still dominate certain DeFi verticals, but Coldware is now being seen as the emerging tech play of this cycle—especially by those who recall Solana’s (SOL) meteoric rise from obscurity to top-ten market cap status. Aggressive ROI Targets Trigger Whale Activity Rumors of Coldware (COLD) reaching $25 in 2025 have been spreading fast. With its native utility token powering staking, governance, and dApp interactions, Coldware is already achieving exponential interest. The combination of Web3 infrastructure and embedded finance capabilities is what Solana (SOL) holders see as the next phase of blockchain evolution. Coldware is also appealing because it’s built for long-term use—not short-term speculation. The team’s focus on PayFi solutions directly responds to global financial accessibility challenges, especially in underbanked regions. This real-world utility is a feature some say Solana (SOL) never fully achieved. Solana (SOL) Comparison: Past Potential vs. Present Innovation While Solana (SOL) remains respected for its innovations in high-speed transactions, many now see Coldware (COLD) as the logical next move. Solana (SOL)’s smart contract architecture paved the way for a better dApp experience, but Coldware (COLD) has extended this by integrating plug-and-play blockchain tools like the ColdBook® and Larna 2400® devices—offering not just software innovation but actual physical blockchain utility. Tenured investors from Solana (SOL) circles are pivoting toward Coldware (COLD) ’s infrastructure-focused ecosystem. With rising excitement surrounding Coldware’s expansion into mobile payments, staking systems, and native minting protocols, SOL veterans are preparing for Coldware to follow a similar growth trajectory—possibly even surpassing it. Shiba Inu Whales Follow Coldware’s Utility-First Vision Early Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors—many of whom gained significant returns during SHIB’s meteoric rise—are now shifting their strategy. With Coldware (COLD) offering tangible use cases and long-term growth prospects, SHIB whales see an opportunity to move beyond meme-driven cycles and into infrastructure-grade blockchain innovation. Unlike the speculative momentum that originally powered SHIB, Coldware’s ecosystem is built around PayFi tools, DePin integration, and a hardware-backed Layer-1. This approach is resonating with Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders who recognize that market cycles now reward functionality and sustainability over hype alone. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues its push into DeFi and NFTs, Coldware (COLD) delivers something fundamentally different: real-world blockchain utility. For investors who once believed in SHIB’s early viral appeal, Coldware offers a more mature, technically advanced avenue for generating long-term returns—without abandoning the community-driven ethos that made SHIB successful. As a result, an increasing number of Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales are positioning themselves within the Coldware ecosystem, anticipating that its utility-based approach could redefine what success looks like in the next phase of crypto evolution. Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) Is the New Whale Magnet As rumors of a $25 price prediction gain traction, Coldware (COLD) is becoming a central narrative in whale investment strategies. Solana (SOL) holders—many of whom saw 100x gains in 2021—are now making Coldware their go-to hedge for 2025. With Coldware surging 230% in recent weeks and outperforming Solana (SOL) in utility growth, the writing is on the wall. For those who once believed in the early promise of Solana (SOL), Coldware (COLD) now offers a more advanced, real-world-driven bet on blockchain’s future.

The move reflects renewed optimism across the broader crypto market—but for XRP bulls, the next test is just ahead. Ripple now faces a key technical barrier at $2.23, marked by the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the 2-hour chart. This level has previously capped upside momentum and will likely determine whether the current rally has legs. From a price action perspective, the recent rebound from $2.06 offers short-term encouragement. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains muted at 44.57, suggesting momentum is not yet on the bulls’ side. If XRP can break above $2.23 with conviction, it could open the door to the next resistance zones at $2.29 and $2.38—areas where sellers have historically stepped in. That said, the broader trend remains technically fragile. A descending trendline from mid-March continues to suppress higher moves, underscoring the need for a confirmed breakout to shift sentiment meaningfully. Long-Term Fundamentals Remain Constructive While technicals remain mixed , Ripple’s fundamentals are showing signs of stability . The number of Ripple wallets holding over 1 million tokens—a proxy for whale activity—has stayed relatively stable. As of March 29, there are 1,986 such wallets, only slightly down from 2,013 earlier in the year. Despite the minor drop, the resilience of this metric during turbulent market conditions reflects long-term conviction among high-stake holders. These wallets often represent institutional or strategic investors, suggesting that the recent pullback hasn’t triggered widespread panic selling. Instead, it may signal ongoing accumulation at key support zones. Ripple’s push to expand its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform continues to enhance its utility in cross-border payments, adding fundamental value to the token. $XRP just bounced from $2.06 to $2.16—but here’s the catch: RSI = 44.57 (weak momentum) Descending trendline still in play $2.23 = key resistance (50 EMA) Breakout above = $2.29/$2.38 next What’s your call? pic.twitter.com/KHV5VKViBt — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) March 30, 2025 Meanwhile, the market is also eyeing a potential catalyst: the nearing conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC. A favorable ruling could not only remove legal uncertainty but also pave the way for XRP’s relisting on U.S. exchanges, unlocking fresh capital inflows. Key Levels to Watch For now, XRP’s short-term outlook hinges on how price action reacts to key levels: $2.23 – Immediate resistance (50 EMA) $2.29 / $2.38 – Next upside targets $2.11 / $2.06 / $2.00 – Support zones RSI: 44.57 – Subdued momentum; no strong divergence A clean breakout above $2.23, ideally supported by rising volume, could kickstart a more sustainable recovery. Without that confirmation, XRP remains vulnerable to profit-taking and renewed selling pressure, particularly if broader macro or crypto-specific headwinds persist. Final Thoughts Ripple’s XRP/USD is showing signs of short-term strength, but the rally remains on fragile ground. All eyes are now on the $2.23 level. A confirmed breakout could flip the short-term trend bullish, but until then, resistance remains a battleground—and traders would be wise to stay cautious.

Instead, a video of him kneeling before a robot and seemingly letting out a “meow” sound has gone viral, triggering a wave of speculation about Ether’s future. The lighthearted clip, which surfaced on March 29, shows Buterin on his knees, gesturing toward a four-legged robot before making the feline-like sound and giving it a gentle pat. The video, though playful, has stirred mixed reactions across the crypto space. “The future of Ethereum is in this man’s hands… Meow,” crypto influencer Wendy O wrote in an X post, hinting at the absurdity of how much of the market relies on Buterin. Similarly, Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel shared the clip, joking that while “so much” of his professional life and net worth depends on Buterin, the interaction somehow made him “bullish” on Ether. Meanwhile, Scott Crypto Warrior, a pseudonymous trader, posted the video alongside a plea: “Pray for our ETH bags.” Crypto Community Reacts The video, while seemingly harmless, comes at a time when Ether’s market performance is causing unease. The token’s strength against Bitcoin has slumped to its lowest level in nearly five years, adding to the community’s anxieties. “While Ethereum is doing -5% 1-minute candles, Vitalik is busy meowing at a robot,” crypto trader “sgp” commented , highlighting the contrast between Buterin’s playful antics and ETH’s recent price volatility. Buterin’s eccentric behavior is nothing new. At Token2049 Singapore in September 2024, he famously called out “cringe” crypto anthems and even broke into song on stage, earning both laughs and applause from the crowd. Ether Price Struggles Despite Long-Term Optimism Since reclaiming the $4,000 mark in December 2024, Ether has plummeted by nearly 55% , now trading at $1,841, according to CoinMarketCap. The token has also shed 13.34% over the past month. Still, some traders view the downturn as a prime buying opportunity. Crypto influencer Alex Becker declared sub-$2,000 ETH a “biblical” trade, predicting massive profits within two years. However, not all are as optimistic. Castle Island Ventures’ Nic Carter recently warned that L2 networks are siphoning value from Ethereum’s main chain , while a lack of community pushback on token inflation is further weakening its long-term appeal.

The rising tariffs set by President Trump for April 2 along with strong core PCE data, have triggered a severe market drop. As March draws to a close, the cryptocurrency market is set to end the month on a bearish note, marking the second consecutive month of declines. This situation places traders in a crucial spot as they face the upcoming week, wondering whether the market will recover from its recent lows or sink further in April. Bitcoin and Altcoin Market Declined Strongly March saw the cryptocurrency market suffer a notable decline, with its total value dropping by 4.3%, from $2.79 trillion to $2.67 trillion. Bitcoin followed this trend, shedding 4.4% of its value during the same period. Also read: Bitcoin Nears Worst Q1 Close Since 2018: Will Bearish Metrics Push BTC Price Below $80K? Meanwhile, Ethereum, the leading altcoin, experienced a significant slump, with its price plummeting 21% in March. There was a hope for a comeback in the third week when the Ripple vs. SEC case was dismissed. Despite this, XRP struggled to capitalize on the momentum and ended the month on a downward trajectory. Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin recently dipped below the EMA20 level, which pushed its price down to around $81,644. Now, buyers are trying to push it back up towards the ascending resistance channel. On the flip side, the bears are looking to keep the price under the key support level of $83,000. If successful, Bitcoin could drop further to $81,000 next week, and possibly even to $80,000. However, buyers are likely to put up a strong fight to keep the price within the $76,700 to $80,000 range. For a bullish signal, the price needs to climb and stay within the resistance zone. If Bitcoin closes above the 50-day simple moving average at $86,000, it could set off a recovery towards $90,000. Should buying momentum continue, we might see it reach $95,000 in April. Ethereum Price Prediction Ether recently faced rejection at the EMA20 level and is now testing the immediate support line. Sellers are aiming to push the ETH/USDT pair down to the support zone at $1,772. However, buyers are gearing up to strongly defend this level, as falling below it could lead to a continuation of the downward trend, potentially reaching as low as $1.5K. To indicate a shift in momentum, buyers need to drive the price above the descending resistance line. Successfully doing so could send Ether towards $2,109, setting the stage for a bullish April with the potential to reach $2.5K. XRP Price Prediction XRP is experiencing increased volatility just below the EMA20 trend line, with neither buyers nor sellers able to establish a clear direction from the $2 mark. Bears are aiming to push the price down to the $2 support level, but buyers are prepared to defend it vigorously. A break below $2 would form a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, potentially sending the XRP/USDT pair down to $1.8—a level that could be breached easily, leading prices to drop further toward $1.3. Conversely, if XRP manages a strong rebound from the $2 support, it could remain confined within a triangular pattern for some time. A successful defense could position the bulls to drive the price above $2.5.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ETH|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-30 12:28:56

The cryptocurrency’s price tumbled, losing 17% of its value since last Wednesday after Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the case between the SEC and the FinTech firm has ended.

The future of Ethereum is in this man’s hands… Meow pic.twitter.com/75Bpo4ocl0 — Wendy O (@CryptoWendyO) March 29, 2025 Ether drops below $2,000 amid market struggles ETH, which is known for its high volatility, experiences massive spikes, especially if the person involved is from a high profile. Buterin , one of the biggest names in cryptocurrency, draws lots of attention for every move he makes. The “meow” video has been no different. Within hours of going viral, social media and crypto forums teemed with speculation about any possible connection between the video and Ethereum’s market behavior. ETH has been in a downtrend since approximately December 2021, retesting the $4,000 region in December 2024 before witnessing a collapse to a current 55% loss from that price. According to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH is trading at $1,880 at the time of this writing, having lost 13% of its value in a month. While some traders are worried about Ethereum’s sliding price, others see it as a massive buying opportunity. Crypto investor Alex Becker feels the ETH network is undervalued and will yield long-term returns. He wrote on X that he couldn’t imagine that Ethereum, at a price of less than $2,000, wouldn’t generate huge returns in two years unless there was a global bear market. Ethereum faces long-term challenges as Buterin shapes market sentiment Outside of its short-term price action, Ethereum is dealing with much more profound structural issues that could define its long-term future. Some experts are concerned that the growth of layer-2 solutions is devaluing Ethereum’s core network. Nic Carter, a Castle Island Ventures partner, recently observed that many of Ethereum’s most promising projects have moved to second-layer networks, which has caused the demand for main chain transactions to decline. A further key problem to address is Ethereum’s malleable monetary policy. Ethereum’s token issuance model is more dynamic than Bitcoin’s, which has a set supply. Carter argues that the Ethereum community is not appropriately handling concerns over excess token creation that could drain ETH’s long-term value. These concerns should not be surprising, yet Ethereum is still one of the world’s most widely used blockchain networks, enabling decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and DeFi projects. Buterin remains a strong champion of Ethereum’s development, prodding developers and researchers alike to improve it. At the same time, Buterin’s quirky persona also tends to sway market sentiment. His capricious acts, including a recent “meow” at a robot, can amuse the crypto industry and raise questions about Ethereum’s leadership. This is not the first time Buterin’s antics have stirred discussions. In September 2024, at Token2049 Singapore, he blasted “cringe” crypto anthems and even sang live on stage, which received mixed reactions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

That focus on participation and sustainability is exactly why early investors are paying close attention. PRESALE SELLING OUT- JOIN THE BIGGEST PRESALE IN HISTORY! While many tokens focus on short-term attention, MAGACOINFINANCE is engineered for lasting relevance. From its detailed roadmap to its generous presale structure, it stands out as one of the few new projects offering both early access and a sustainable ecosystem. XRP (Ripple) Currently priced near $2.130, XRP continues to make headlines in the global payments sector. Its strong network of financial partnerships, despite legal turbulence, keeps it firmly in the spotlight for enterprise use. SOL (Solana) Solana, trading around $126.67, remains one of the most efficient blockchain platforms. With lightning-fast transaction speeds and growing developer activity, it’s powering a large number of DeFi and NFT projects. KAS (Kaspa) Kaspa is gaining traction as a proof-of-work coin with incredibly fast block times, currently hovering near $0.06. Its unique GHOSTDAG protocol and focus on speed have made it an interesting alternative for miners and developers. TRX (Tron) At roughly $0.23, Tron continues to perform with a strong focus on entertainment content, Web3 applications, and stablecoin transactions. Its high throughput makes it attractive for scalable use cases. The Case for MAGACOINFINANCE Its rising community interest, smart use-case alignment, and reward-based model position it well for a prominent role in 2025’s crypto conversation—especially for those entering early while the token remains undervalued. Conclusion Bitcoin’s legacy, Solana’s speed, and MAGACOINFINANCE’s potential make this trio a compelling mix for investors planning ahead. With unmatched presale benefits, strong utility, and a clear mission, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a serious contender in the space.

Onchain data spotted by blockchain tracking firm Onchain Lens has revealed that a newly created cryptocurrency address recently withdrew 1.77 million Solana (SOL) coins, or approximately $223 million worth of SOL, via Kraken. The fresh whale then staked all of these coins. Related News: Watch Out: We're Entering a Critical Week - Lots of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events - Here's a Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Based on current staking reward rates, assuming the SOL price remains constant at current levels, if this whale stakes all of his coins for a year, he will earn approximately $17 million at the end of the year. This is valid for the native staking model. If he uses liquid retaking models, this whale could earn a SOL reward worth $23 million at the end of a year with the same assumptions. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $125, approximately 36% lower than last year. In other words, despite these staking rewards, there is a possibility that the crypto whale will lose money in dollar terms after staking. *This is not investment advice.

Global tariff fears have led to heightened inflation concerns, limiting appetite for risk assets among investors. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has fallen 18%, and the S&P 500 (SPX) index has fallen more than 7% in the two months following the initial tariff announcement, according to TradingView data, TradingView data shows. “Going forward, April 2 is drawing increased attention as a potential flashpoint for fresh US tariff announcements,” Stella Zlatareva, dispatch editor at digital asset investment platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph.

Here’s Why Best Wallet Token Can 100x",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/hyperliquid-delists-jelly-best-wallet-100x/,"The crypto community was just recovering from the aftermath of the Bybit hack, which saw North Korean hackers loot $1.3B from the exchange’s cold storage, and now we’ve had yet another sensational malicious activity. This time it’s Hyperliquid in the firing line. Read on to find out exactly what went down and how a privacy-first crypto project like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) could potentially 100x as a result? Dissecting the Hyperliquid-Jelly Meltdown The popular decentralized crypto exchange Hyperliquid recently delisted the Jelly-my-Jelly ($JELLY) meme coin on the grounds of suspicious trading activity $JELLY, by the way, fell from $0.21 all the way to $0.01 in just 10 days after its launch on January 30. However, it skyrocketed 400% on March 26, which is when chaos unfolded. Here’s what happened prior to $JELLY’s delisting by Hyperliquid last week: A large crypto whale deposited $7M across three Hyperliquid accounts. Two of those accounts took long positions on $JELLY – one of $2.15M another another of $1.9M respectively. The third account took a $4.1M short position in order to cancel out the two long trades above. As $JELLY’s price rose from $0.01 to nearly $0.45 in a matter of just hours, the short position was liquidated. But the catch is that it was too large a position to be liquidated normally. As a result, the short trade was sent to the Hyperliquidity Provider Vault (HLP) for settlement. However, when Hyperliquid restricted the whale’s withdrawals, they resorted to selling their remaining $JELLY positions. This led to Hyperliquid shutting down the $JELLY market entirely. All in all, the trader deposited a total of $7.17M but was only able to withdraw $6.26M. Around $900K still remains with Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid’s Criticism Big-name crypto personalities, such as the CEO and COO of Bitget, criticized Hyperliquid, saying that the exchange deliberately caused losses to the user. One of them even said that Hyperliquid ‘may be on track to become FTX 2.0.’ Although the world is torn between Hyperliquid’s recent debacle, the fact remains that there’s a dire need for a reliable crypto storage and management solution. Enter Best Wallet . What Is Best Wallet? Best Wallet is a new-age crypto wallet that’s helping users reclaim their privacy. For starters, it’s a non-custodial wallet, meaning you alone have the ownership of your private keys. Therefore, none apart from you will be able to access your crypto assets. The app also comes with Fireblock’s MPC-CMP wallet technology, which uses cutting-edge cryptographic techniques to safeguard your digital wealth. We were also impressed to find out that fantastic in-app and crypto-related security is complemented by excellent app access controls.

In addition to rock-solid security, Best Wallet also hits it out of the park when it comes to being user-friendly. It has sleek apps for both Android and iOS – and a browser extension for desktop is on its way. Last but not least, Best Wallet is also a joy for smart crypto investors who like getting in before the coins are listed on exchanges. That’s because Best Wallet is the only crypto wallet that allows its users to invest in new meme coins on presale directly from within the app. Buy $BEST – The Next Crypto to Explode Apart from the above, Best Wallet’s roadmap suggests that it’s soon going to offer support for over 60 chains.

This way, they’ll be able to become early investors (which means more profits) in some of the best projects going around. Third, $BEST investors will have the opportunity to earn extra income through staking. The current rewards rate is 136%. However, it’s worth noting that this rate is dynamic and will likely reduce as the $BEST presale proceeds. Speaking of the Best Wallet Token presale , it has so far raised over $11.4M, and you can buy each token for just $0.024525 if you get in now. If this is your first presale purchase, here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $BEST . Also, check out our Best Wallet Token price prediction for more details on the crypto’s future.

The measures, introduced in April 2024, allow police, law enforcement agencies, and HMRC to freeze suspicious cryptocurrency wallets for up to three years. You might also like: Kiyosaki: FOMO crowd investing in Bitcoin will ‘accelerate’ into generational wealth Court documents reviewed over the past six months reveal the largest single freezing order was for £1.5 million worth of cryptocurrency held in a wallet hosted by US-based exchange Coinbase. HMRC requested this order and issued it at Newcastle Upon Tyne Magistrates’ Court on March 18. The total frozen amount could be higher, as court data from Courtsdesk only covers the past six months due to legal restrictions. The new powers were designed to address the growing use of digital currencies for money laundering, tax evasion, and terrorism financing. Legal expert says £6 million is a modest amount Legal experts offer differing perspectives on the importance of these seizures. Nick Barnard, a cryptocurrency legal specialist and partner at Corker Binning, described the £6 million figure as relatively modest “in the grand scheme.” Barnard noted that the new enforcement regime started from scratch last April and needs time to develop fully. However, lawyer Siobhain Egan told MailOnline that the government is directing increased resources toward freezing cryptocurrency assets. This is part of an aggressive strategy to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, Egan adds. The freezing process usually involves investigators applying for orders without notifying the alleged criminals. This prevents them from moving Bitcoin ( BTC ) or other crypto. “If police have a major investigation into organized criminals laundering money through crypto, they will go in and seize the assets before they finalize the investigation,” Egan explained . The UK government is improving its cryptocurrency enforcement actions through the Crime and Policing Bill. The legislation includes provisions for valuing cryptocurrency, implementing procedures for courts to recover illicit funds, and granting the Crown Court expanded powers to issue seizure orders.

Looking at on-chain data shows a notable support level between $80,920 and $78,000 that must not be broken. Related Reading: Pi Coin Sinks 47% In 14 Days—What’s Behind The Massive Drop? Particularly, on-chain analytics from Glassnode point to a thinning of support at the $78,000 level, where only minimal cost basis clusters now exist. The insight follows a sharp move that saw savvy traders scoop up nearly 15,000 Bitcoin at the March 10 low before cashing out at the $87,000 local top. Support Cushion Rises With Clusters Between $80,000 And $84,000 Bitcoin started the month of March with a crazy crash that saw its price hit below $77,000 on March 10 and March 11. Most of the month was spent by Bitcoin embarking on a recovery from this level, eventually reaching as high as $88,500 last week. Interestingly, on-chain data from Glassnode shows that some Bitcoin traders took advantage of the crash and bought about 15,000 BTC at this low. However, many addresses from this same cohort sold at the $87,000 local top, leaving behind a depleted buffer zone that may no longer offer the same price stability. Bitcoin’s strongest cost basis clusters have steadily migrated upward from $78,000 throughout the month, with the most prominent support levels now sitting between $80,920 and $84,100. Approximately 20,000 BTC were acquired at $80,920, 50,000 BTC at $82,090, and another 40,000 BTC at around $84,100. These fresh accumulations are now the new zones of confidence among recent buyers that may offer cushions for the recent market dip. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $83,120, meaning that it has lost the zone of 40,000 BTC around $84,100. This puts the onus on $82,090 and, subsequently, the $80,920 price levels. However, if the correction sharpens further, it wouldn’t be until after $78,000 that structural support reappears at $74,000 and $71,000, where long-term conviction buying occurred, estimated at 49,000 BTC and 41,000 BTC, respectively. Image From X: Glassnode $95,000 Cost Basis Cluster Grows With Cooling Demand As support continues to climb gradually, resistance appears to be firming near the $95,000 mark. Investor cost basis data shows an increase of 12,000 BTC clustered at this level since March 24. This implies that some investors now anticipate a top forming around $95,000, and selling activity could become more pronounced if prices approach that zone. This resistance, alongside the support levels, could see Bitcoin confined within a narrowing range in the short term.

This time, he alluded to historical trends to explain why the altcoin can hit a new all-time high (ATH) in 90 to 120 days. Why The XRP Price Can Hit ATH In 90 To 120 Days In an X post , Egrag Crypto alluded to historical patterns to explain why the XRP price can hit a new ATH in the next 90 to 120 days. He noted that the RSI chart shows important historical patterns and stated that the altcoin usually has two peaks during its bull runs. The crypto analyst further revealed that in 2021, the second peak occurred after 90 days, while in 2017, it occurred after 120 days. Based on this, Egrag Crypto affirmed that this historical timeframe provides market participants with a potential for a “great opportunity,” hinting at the altcoin hitting a new ATH. In another post, he raised the possibility of the XRP price reaching a new ATH of $3.9 by May. This came as he identified an Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern, which was forming for the altcoin. The crypto analyst stated that the measured move is $3.7 to $3.9. For now, an XRP analysis has shown that the altcoin is struggling at $2.15 amid regulatory uncertainty over SEC Chair nominee Paul Atkins. In his update on this Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern, Egrag Crypto remarked that a close above $2.24, the Fib 0.888, is the next minor target. He affirmed that the pattern is still unfolding as anticipated. Ripple’s Native Token Could Still Drop Below $2 Crypto analyst Dark Defender has predicted that the XRP price could still drop below $2 before the next leg up. In an X post, he stated that Ripple’s native token is in the 4th Wave of the Monthly Elliott Wave structure. His accompanying chart showed that XRP could drop to as low as $1.88 on this Wave 4 corrective move. Once that is done, the altcoin will witness its next leg up, rallying to as high as $5.8, which would mark a new ATH. Dark Defender assured that Wave 4 will end soon and that XRP will continue to reach its targets. The crypto analyst recently affirmed that the altcoin is the “one” and explained why it would dominate Bitcoin and Ethereum . Crypto analyst CasiTrades also suggested that XRP could further decline before its next leg to the upside. She noted that after the drop to $2.27, the altcoin showed no bullish RSI divergence, which signaled that the drop wasn’t quite done yet. She added that the coin is now likely heading down to test the 0.618 golden retracement at $2.17, or possibly the golden pocket at $2.15 for a final low before “lift-off.” However, CasiTrades also mentioned that RSI is starting to build the bullish divergence and that the selling pressure is exhausting.

The update comes after numerous users complained about issues they had experienced with the text message (SMS) account verification process. Verification Update The blog post by the project explained the team’s decision to pivot from its phone number system due to the challenges it created as it proved to be “both unreliable and costly.” This was mostly due to Pi’s global reach, as its users are based in countless countries worldwide, and “SMS communications between Pioneers and servers have not always worked due to different geographic limitations in telecommunication regulations, carrier policies, individuals’ service subscriptions and costs, and more.” Consequently, the necessary change implemented by the team means that users will be required to rely solely on email-based two-factor authentication (2FA) verification. Later, other changes could be incorporated, such as passkey and biometrics. The new system also presented a challenge, at least at first, as users will have to insert a trusted email, which was never done until now. As a result, the project has to check how users add and verify their emails, and how they complete the 2FA, to ensure the “integrity of these processes and the security of user accounts.” Some users needed to complete further actions, such as liveness checks or additional SMS verifications, which required a “temporary pause in migrations until such system-level checks were made.” This has been cleared out; migrations have resumed and will gradually expand as more email-based 2FAs and system-level checks complete. PI Keeps Dumping No matter what news the team publishes or what updates are implemented as of late, the native token continues to bleed out . PI has lost another 4% in the past 24 hours and now sits at $0.77 on CoinGecko. This means that the asset has dumped by 23% on a weekly scale and more than 65% in a month. PI, which was close to the top 10 altcoins by market cap, has plummeted to the 30th spot on CG, and risks to fall out of that group. Still, its community remains optimistic, posting frequent updates with promising price predictions, which are yet to materialize.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is currently at around $2.7 trillion. That’s down 0.63% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading below the $83,000 level, while Ethereum ( ETH ) has slipped 2.2% to $1,837. Source: CoinGecko FunToken (FUN) has doubled in value over the past 24 hours, while MMX and Enzyme (MLN) have also seen notable price increases. FunToken has surged 101.3% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.006304 from a low of $0.003132. This price action continues a week-long rally that has seen FUN climb nearly 200% in just seven days. FUN 24H price chart Despite the impressive gains, FunToken hasn’t announced any major developments or partnerships that would typically drive such price movement. The token has also surfaced as one of the top gainers on Binance. One market analyst highlighted FUN’s potential on social media, noting its weekly chart pattern and suggesting a possible additional 2x gain due to the current high trading volume.

The token has climbed 79.9% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.5586 from $0.2704. MMX 24H chart Interestingly, MMX’s current rally comes after a period of sustained decline, with the token down approximately 15% over the past week, 40% over the last month, and 73% over the past year. Like FunToken, there are no clear fundamental drivers behind MMX’s sudden price spike. MLN 24H price chart Third on the list is Enzyme (MLN), which has jumped 32.3% in the last 24 hours, trading as high as $11.33 from a low of $8.55.

Grayscale Seeks Approval For AVAX ETF On Nasdaq Grayscale is now starting down the route for an ETF investing in Avalanche’s AVAX token. The 19b-4 form for Grayscale’s AVAX ETF follows its registration as a Delaware Trust entity roughly two weeks ago. Similar to the crypto asset manager’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, if approved, the proposed rule change would transform Grayscale’s existing Avalanche Trust, launched in August 2024, into a spot exchange-traded fund. The new product would give investors regulated exposure to AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche network, which currently ranks as the 17th biggest digital asset by market value, according to CoinGecko data. In the official announcement, Grayscale described the AVAX ETF as a “three-chain smart contract platform” focused on scalability, security, and decentralization. The crypto asset-management company also noted Avalanche’s role in real-world asset tokenization. The AVAX investment vehicle would use Coinbase Custody as its custodian if given the regulatory green light. VanEck also recently applied for its prospective spot Avalanche ETF, signaling increasing interest in offering AVAX-based investment vehicles. Altcoin ETF Race Heats Up The new filings come as the SEC pivots to a friendlier approach to the digital asset industry under the Trump administration, having recently dropped multiple crypto-related investigations, including against Robinhood , Kraken, Coinbase , OpenSea , and Ripple . While different types of altcoin applications pile up, Bloomberg ETF analysts previously speculated that Litecoin ETFs have the highest chance of approval, putting the odds for the spot LTC vehicles going live in the U.S. at 90% . Dogecoin ETFs received a 75% chance of approval, followed by Solana (70%) and XRP (65%) products.

Updating this policy, the FDIC stated that the policy has now been rescinded on the “laws and regulations” column on its website. The FDIC notified institutions under its supervision of the new development in a letter titled “Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities,” issued on April 7, 2022. In the press release published on March 28, 2025, the federal regulator clarified that FDIC-supervised institutions are now free to engage in permissible crypto-activity without FDIC approval. Excerpts from the press release read; “This FIL affirms that FDIC-supervised institutions may engage in permissible activities, including activities involving new and emerging technologies such as crypto-assets and digital assets, provided that they adequately manage the associated risks.” Highlighted crypto activities include crypto and digital asset issuance, crypto-asset custody services, maintenance of stablecoin reserves, and participation in blockchain and distributed ledger-based settlement or payment systems, amongst others. However, eligible institutions are still expected to abide by laws and regulations, as the regulator asserts that all activities must be conducted in accordance with FDIC policies and standards. The regulator further warns of liquidity, operational, market, and cybersecurity risks and suggests that banks consider consumer and anti-money requirements and engage with appropriate supervisory teams. Outlining its plans for establishing regulatory clarity, the FDIC stated its intentions to collaborate with the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to further banks’ engagement in certain crypto-related practices. Conclusively, the FDIC reveals that it will work with banking agencies to replace interagency documents relating to crypto-assets issued in January 2023 and February 2023 with future guidance or regulations. In the long term, the new development could strengthen the existing relationship between banks and the broader cryptocurrency industry, allowing banks to increase their crypto-related services and offerings.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FIL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-30 14:09:13

Citing a recession probability indicator from the market analysis firm Bravos Research, Tapiero says that the Federal Reserve will likely add new liquidity and lower interest rates in order to stimulate the economy. According to the investor, the loose monetary environment will trigger new Bitcoin rallies. “Unlikely recession coming given Fed has room to cut interest rates – 400 basis points possible to 0 if needed… But this indicator has never been higher and a recession not followed. Slowing growth ahead clear, guaranteed by fiscal tightening. Rates must drop. Liquidity needed. BTC.” Source: Dan Tapiero/Bravos Research/X According to Tapiero, the stock market is in for another 10% drop or so before the Federal Reserve cuts rates “regardless of coincidental data.” In a recent interview with crypto personality Scott Melker, Tapiero forecasted a $180,000 price tag for Bitcoin. On when Bitcoin could reach the massive price target, Tapiero says, “I know some people have been more aggressive but I think this bull phase, we can hit that [$180,000] this year or potentially early next year. But I’m thinking more this year… So it’s just the way markets work, right – you got 85% or 90% bulls up at $100,000 and now you’re down at, what is it? 15%? And people are despondent, they think the world is over, and yet it’s at $80,000, which is still up, you know, 2x, 3x from 18 months ago. It’s pretty, pretty incredible.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $82,924.

Therefore, investors’ interest is fading as more than $100M of Solana has been liquidated. On the other hand, an AI altcoin, IntelMarkets , is being recorded to attract investors with its presale success that has already surpassed $12.1M. Currently priced at $0.09, this platform offers the chance for early investors to earn 400% gains after the INTL token’s price surge to $0.42 upon hitting the market. IntelMarkets: Why SOL Investors Are Moving Toward This AI Altcoin? IntelMarkets is becoming a new point of interest for SOL investors, particularly after the Solana price experienced a substantial reversal. This AI-powered platform provides enhanced functionality as compared to its competitors by leveraging tools like AI-driven insights. It can utilize more than 100,000 data points that enable it to identify complex market shifts that might not be visible on price charts. Traders can also generate more effective trading strategies with the help of the AI Trade Advisor. This feature would also allow users to practice their strategies in real time so that they can be well-prepared for the live market. Along with this, IntelMarkets considers customer support as its top priority. Its AI chatbots are designed to handle complex conversations. They can carry out custom inquiries and provide support in a number of different languages to enhance global accessibility. Furthermore, the platform also provides an automated tax calculator facility that gives traders the ultimate peace of mind. Users don’t have to manually input their trading data, it can be automatically tracked by an integrated third-party software. A standout feature of IntelMarkets that could take its utility to the next level is its incorporation of an INTL debit card. This facility will enable users to easily utilize their crypto holdings in real-world transactions while also profiting from 2% cashback. Solana Price Signals a Trend Reversal As The Token Faces $100M Liquidations The Solana price has been subjected to intense fluctuation in March. At the start of the month, the SOL token touched highs at around $178 but also experienced a major dip at below $114. After this plunge the Solana price gained a little momentum by climbing to $147 and targeted its crucial resistance level at around $150. However, the recent price action of the SOL token is indicating a failure to break above this level and a possible trend reversal. At the time of writing, the Solana price is trading at around $131. In the past 30 days, it has lost almost 5% of its value. Source: CoinMarketCap From a technical point of view, the Solana price has been forming a bear flag, and its current price has broken below the lower boundary of this flag, which was around $132. Therefore, the investors' confidence is fading, and the SOL token has reportedly experienced over $100M in liquidations. Meanwhile, on-chain data reveals that traders are rotating toward IntelMarkets , which could promise potentially greater gains than Solana (SOL). IntelMarkets Nears Launch as Its Presale Surges Past $12M IntelMarkets is making traction in the industry because of its robust utility-centric features that enhance the convenience and feasibility for traders. It has just surpassed $12.1M in its presale and is continuing to sell out at an incredible pace. One feature that is contributing significantly to this platform’s exponential growth is its incorporation of the first revolutionary quantum proof protocol, Route X21, in its infrastructure. It can keep all sorts of online threats to users’ assets at bay and provide a safe trading environment for investors. Final Thoughts Technical analysis, along with the recorded $100M plus the SOL token’s liquidations, suggests that the bearish sentiment around the Solana price is going to persist. Therefore, investors are eyeing IntelMarkets because of its revolutionary AI-driven features. Currently at stage 10 of its presale, this platform offers investors the final chance to secure INTL tokens at an exclusive price of $0.09. Those who delay might miss out on the chance to get 400% guaranteed gains after the INTL token hits its listing price of $0.42.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has always been the face of crypto, the first thing that comes to mind when you think of this market. But for years, its role has been largely static—held as a store of value, yet rarely used for anything else. Then BTCFi entered the scene: unlike traditional DeFi, which has been dominated by Ethereum ( ETH ) and other smart contract platforms, BTCFi is built around Bitcoin as the core asset. You might also like: Bitcoin DeFi is the perfect storm for mainstream crypto adoption | Opinion In the last quarter of 2024, BTCFi’s total value saw a massive surge —from $800 million all the way to $6.5 billion. The momentum is impressive, to say the least. More institutional players are taking notice, and analysts predict that by 2030, roughly 2.3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply (about $47 billion) could be actively used in decentralized finance. So clearly, BTCFi is not just a passing trend. But why is it gaining so much traction? Can it really be called the future of Bitcoin’s utility as a financial asset? Let’s try to figure it out. What is BTCFi, and why is it growing now? BTCFi represents the intersection of Bitcoin and decentralized finance, with the first crypto playing the role of the core asset in this case. Typically, DeFi platforms have been built on blockchains like Ethereum, while Bitcoin holders had to wrap their BTC into ERC-20 tokens (like wBTC) to participate in this field. This kind of tokenization started picking up the pace around 2020, allowing BTC holders to access DeFi services that are typically not available on the Bitcoin blockchain. These “wrapped” tokens are built in a way that makes them compatible with other blockchain networks. And so, they effectively extended Bitcoin’s functionality. However, advancements in Bitcoin L2 solutions and LRTs, or layered rollup technologies, are now changing the rules. It is becoming unnecessary for Bitcoin to use “second class citizen” ERC-20 tokens anymore. BTC LRTs, for example, operate on Ethereum and other chains as well, but use Bitcoin as the primary collateral in transactions. This means unlocking the use of Bitcoin as a yield-generating asset in other networks beyond its native chain. The emerging Bitcoin L2s, meanwhile, are tackling this blockchain’s long-standing scalability issues, allowing for faster and more cost-efficient transactions. These innovations are going to fundamentally redefine Bitcoin, turning it from a passive store of value to an actively utilized financial asset. Why is BTCFi the gateway for Bitcoin whales in 2025? Large Bitcoin holders—miners, in particular—have often used CeFi loans backed by their BTCs to fund their operations since they didn’t want to outright sell those assets. This practice is still going on today, but BTCFi promises to make some changes. And that’s where everything will start from, really: by BTCFi enabling new opportunities for Bitcoin holders to put their assets to work. Soon enough, Bitcoin whales will start looking at BTCFi as a powerful gateway that can be used to enter the DeFi space. And the way I see it, there are two key factors in 2025 that will influence that perception. The first is the rise of Bitcoin ETFs. BTC ETFs currently account for almost 6% of all Bitcoin supply, having crossed $100 billion in holdings at the beginning of 2025. With them gaining mainstream traction, Bitcoin is increasingly perceived as the safest and most stable cryptocurrency asset. This makes it a prime choice for DeFi, attracting large-scale holders who want to use their BTC without selling. Earlier in February this year, Goldman Sachs announced that it had invested $1.63 billion in Bitcoin ETFs. That’s easy proof right there. The second major factor is the appearance of BTC L2 technologies, which we’ve already covered earlier. Until recently, the lack of scalability and transaction efficiency held Bitcoin back from DeFi adoption. Now, we are going to see a surge of L2 solutions that will enhance the network’s performance. And here’s the important part: they will do so while preserving Bitcoin’s core principles of decentralization and simplicity (and, hence, its robustness). What DeFi platforms need to do for proper BTCFi integration There are several challenges that will need to be overcome before BTCFi can achieve truly seamless integration. The biggest technical issue will be ensuring that Bitcoin-based L2 solutions become genuinely trustless. At the present time, they are not quite there, often relying on intermediaries and centralized elements, which goes against Bitcoin’s core philosophy. The good news is that there’s a lot of R&D going on to make it happen. If successful, it could make the vast amounts of BTCs that are currently just lying there “collecting dust” be useful in DeFi. Another big challenge is going to stem from people’s trust. Among Bitcoin holders, there are many who do not quite trust Ethereum and the existing Bitcoin tokenization methods. The key to winning them over will lie in creating robust and cost-effective solutions on the native Bitcoin network. Having a fully trustless and inexpensive execution layer on the BTC blockchain could really become the dealbreaker for these people. The future of Bitcoin: More than just ‘digital gold’ For years, Bitcoin has been carrying the moniker of “digital gold”—a safe-haven asset meant for holding rather than using. These days, this is becoming increasingly untrue. As more institutional players enter the crypto space, the potential for BTCFi to become Bitcoin’s next-level evolution is very real. The demand is on the rise, and the infrastructure is already being built. For Bitcoin whales looking to maximize their assets without selling, BTCFi could become the perfect answer.

A positive leaning factor for most traders is the influx of whales in short-term acquisitions. This follows the upturn in Bitcoin and the wider crypto market, with holders expecting similar movements. Whales Accumulation Continues On-chain data shows huge ETH purchases in the last 48 hours marking a direct impact of traders sentiments. An Ethereum whale bought 7,100 ETH worth approximately $14.2 million while another withdrew 4,709 ETH worth $9.47 million from Binance alongside other transactions. Other whales also made similar withdrawals from exchanges, adding to the accumulation spree. Today, a trader withdrew $2.6 million assets from Kraken, while another purchased a larger $5.4 million asset from OKX. The market’s reaction was bullish, with the ETH price gaining ground in hourly trading data. Traditionally, outflows from centralized exchanges show signs of accumulation, with an intention toward long-term holdings. This builds up market confidence and strengthens retail demand rather than increasing exchange reserves. This week, whales purchased 470,000 ETH as bulls set sights on a potential recovery. Institutional optimism for a rebound remained a major morale boost for most traders in the past week. Last year, traditional investors increased their exposure to crypto assets, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the market prepares to recover, traders project similar demand in Q2 2025 despite the previous dip. ETH institutional volumes have also notched a slight recovery compared to past weeks. Digital asset enthusiast Kim added that increased whale activity could position ETH for a breakout. “ Taking into account Ethereum whale activity, key support levels, and market sentiment, ETH appears poised to breakout. The combination of decreasing exchange reserves, increased whale activity, and technical indicators suggest price momentum.” What’s Next For ETH Price? Amid rising sentiments, traders are at the crossroads of the ETH bull peak. The general consensus favors a massive recovery after months of losses occasioned by macro and industry-related factors. Ethereum’s price reclaimed the $2k level, with whales increasing their appetite ahead of the projected $2,500 price in April. This is a fall-off from the anticipated $4k price last year. However, recent developments and a wider market recovery could spur the assets to new heights.

Why Are Holder Turning To This New Viral Crypto Presale Called Remittix?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/ripple-price-prediction-will-xrp-hit-050-or-5-first-why-are-holder-turning-to-this-new-viral-crypto-presale-called-remittix,"Last week, the Ripple charts experienced a short-lived price jump when the SEC reportedly dropped charges against Ripple in the ongoing lawsuit. With the regulatory landscape becoming more favourable, users expected Ripple to have a smooth ride to its ATH in the next few weeks. But there haven't been many improvements since the spike. Instead, the Ripple price has been correcting to lower levels, with the token bouncing between price targets at $0.5 and $5. The XRP price movements leave traders looking for more profitable options, and the Remittixproject is one of the top picks right now. With massive potential for a price rally up to 130x it’s no surprise that users are trooping over to the new PayFi platform . We have information on Remittix and its plans. Ripple Price Still In Market Correction? The Ripple price has been stuck in correction for much of the past seven days, as the token still trades at $2.11, some ways off its weekly peak at $2.48. The peak came after the SEC dropped charges on the sale of unregistered securities against Ripple Labs, after which the token price surged considerably. After the spike, the potential on the Ripple price for a rally increased, and traders anticipated even more bullish signals in the coming days. The actual events in the past few days have been largely disappointing, however, as XRP seems caught up in a bearish slump. The token is 10.7% down on the weekly timeframes, and that's despite the development experienced on Ripple in the past week. Ripple Labs has closed a partnership deal with Chipper Cash, while the probability of XRP ETFs has spiked to 85%, according to popular opinion. What Does The Future Hold For Ripple? The past week has been somewhat underwhelming for Ripple traders, especially given the initial optimism about the Ripple price. Given the latest feed from analysts, speculations around a bullish rally have been suspended. Since its rejection at the $2.48 level, there's been talk of the Ripple price visiting support levels even lower than $1.5 before the token surges again. The token also saw resistance at its 50-day SMA on Thursday, giving credibility to the declining XRP price. Currently, the resistance at the $2.5 and $3 levels will need a stronger trading momentum to breach, making it difficult for Ripple to hit a $5 target. The weak bullish hands have caused more traders to lose faith in Ripple's potential, and the sell-off wave is sinking the Ripple price, bringing it even closer to $0.5. With Ripple facing downtrends, the new PayFi project Remittix (RTX) has the full attention of crypto users in the sector. Here's more on Remittix. Direct Withdrawals, Masked Transfers With Remittix! The PayFi sector has long since been dominated by Ripple and Stellar, as both occupy top positions among the best cryptocurrencies in the market. However, while both PayFi giants cater to huge token transfers, serving corporations more than crypto traders, Remittix is offering utility to the crypto folk. Getting cryptos directly to bank accounts involves the use of intermediaries like exchanges, but not with Remittix. The platform offers a direct payment portal for users to deposit their crypto assets into fiat bank accounts, all at low costs and with no traces. All the traders need to get the tokens across are the details of the recipient bank account, along with the crypto tokens and gas fees. Once the transfer has been approved on the Remittix API, the smart contracts convert the cryptos into the appropriate currency and deposit them in the bank account. A key feature of Remittix transfers is that they will not be traceable to a blockchain. They won't appear as originating from crypto ecosystems. Hence, users' privacy and anonymity are preserved even as they perform cross-country transactions. Remittix is the future of crypto payments. Investors have seen the potential and are already stocking up on RTX tokens. Remittix Presale: 130x Potential Returns For Early Buyers! Like the Ripple traders, you should also be getting your own RTX tokens now. The coins are currently selling for $0.0734 and they only get costlier.

According to local outlet Iran International, the senior officers attached to the country’s Revolutionary Guard’s intelligence organization stole about $21 million in digital assets while investigating a corruption case. According to the report , the agency was investigating the CEO of Cryptoland, Sina Estavi, whose crypto exchange shut down in May 2021 after he was arrested by authorities. At the time of his arrest, no official complaint was lodged. However, once news of his arrest broke out, thousands of aggrieved customers lodged complaints against him and his platform. After his arrest, another local outlet, Mizan news reported that about 51,000 plaintiffs submitted different degrees of complaints against the CEO. The BRG token, which was developed by Estavi and his platform, collapsed after he was arrested. Blockchain records also showed that a day after he was arrested, six billion BRG tokens were moved from his wallet before news of his arrest broke out to the general public. Iran intelligence agency accused of crypto theft According to reports, the moved tokens were then sold off by IRGC officials, netting them tens of millions of dollars, which they kept for themselves. An expert appointed by the court identified two key figures in the operation, Mehdi Hajipour and Mehdi Badi, who are both senior interrogators in the economic branch of the IRGC. The expert revealed that a wallet under the control of Hajipour sold about $21 million worth of BRG tokens. In March 2022, Iran’s IRGC counterintelligence agents apprehended Hajipour in a sting operation. He was caught accepting $10,000 from Estavi, who he had tricked into thinking he was buying back the stolen tokens from a third party. Unknown to Estavi, the third-party was a fake identity that was created by Hajipour. According to court documents, before the theft, Hajipour’s assets were worth about 10 billion rials ($40,000). Four months after the theft, his fortune had climbed 600 billion rials, which he had spent on real estate, gold, and luxury vehicles. According to the court documents, after he was apprehended, Hajipour was detained in Ward 66, a prison used to hold IRGC personnel. The documents also showed that he had a network of senior interrogators in Iran’s IRGC intelligence organization working alongside him. Meanwhile, the second suspect in the case, Mehdi Badi was a senior interrogator who had been operating under the alias Dr. Ebadi. His name appeared in many cases related to corruption investigations at the IRGC economic department. Court documents unveil other suspects According to court documents, two other interrogators from the intelligence organization of the IRGC, Majid Jahan Parto and Majid Tabatabaei were also named as members of the network. The document also listed four other accomplices who provided help to the gang of interrogators, usually assisting them by forging documents. The fates of the individuals are still hanging in the balance, with Hajipour’s appeal rejected by the court in September 2022. However, Sina Estavi has been sentenced to 15 years in prison and ordered by the court to return the embezzled funds. He had initially fled the country after being under pressure from the group of investigators, who had stolen the funds the victims reported. Three months after Hajipour was arrested, the IRGC dismissed Hossein Taeb from his position as the head of the intelligence organization. He has since been replaced by Mohammad Kazemi. Half of the victims have received their funds, with the funds, which was approximately $14 million paid from Estavi’s account while he was in prison. Meanwhile, around 25,000 others are still being owed with no signs of a repayment nearby. Most of the remaining funds meant to pay the creditors are from the stolen tokens, which are yet to be returned by the group of interrogators that sold them for profit.

Why Am I Investing In To This CRYPTO PRESALE?! | Rollblock Review (It's HUGE!) Chat GPT Predicts That Cardano Will See Further Declines Cardano (ADA) is dangerously close to a breakdown, as its price has been lingering on support for the past few weeks. As of right now, Cardano trades at around $0.70, following a 3% intraday decrease. While over the past few days, Cardano managed to regain some ground, the $0.77 proved to be a tough obstacle, and a rejection followed as selling pressure intensified. Source: CoinMarketCap Cardano’s technical indicators offer more insights into ChatGPT’s reasoning, as most of them are now flashing red. According to TradingView data, Cardano is also moving below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages , which paints a bearish picture for its mid-term price action. Cardano’s 4-hour RSI is now at 36 points, indicating that there could be more downside in store. Source: CryptoWaves XRP Could Dip Below $2 In Q2 Ripple (XRP) played a protagonist role over the past few months, and while it posted impressive gains in late 2024, the XRP price is now in hibernation. At press time, XRP sells for $2.12, with a 4.2% decline on the daily timeframe, bringing its total weekly losses to 7%. Source: CoinMarketCap On the other hand, on-chain analysis suggests that whales are taking advantage of the slump to accumulate more XRP at discounted prices. Crypto influencer John Squire has revealed that in the past days, a single high-profile investor scooped up over 8 million XRP, roughly valued at $17 million. This goes to show that whales are confident in Ripple’s long-term prospects despite the current state of the market. However, this doesn’t mean that Ripple is out of the woods. Trader EuroSniper expects Ripple to breach the $2 support and revisit the key $1.45 level in the coming weeks. The RBLK Presale - The Millionaire Maker Play Of 2025 As Cardano and Ripple continue to stall, Rollblock is emerging as an intriguing investment opportunity with the potential to become one of the biggest surprises of the year. Stage 10 of the RBLK presale is underway and tokens are priced at just $0.062. This is the perfect entry point for early buyers who want to be on the winning side of the Rollblock revolution. An 800% surge is expected by the end of the presale alone, and analysts anticipate a gigantic 100x rally once RBLK is available on major exchanges and the bull run is in full swing.

With traditional banks showing more interest, he believes the real institutional adoption of XRP has yet to begin, and the involvement of JP Morgan and other notable financial institutions could cause a major increase in institutional adoption. The #XRP skeptics are about to get steamrolled. I've never been more confident. Ripple isn't just a payment network – it's becoming the foundation of global tokenized finance.

The real money… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) March 28, 2025 Legal Clarity Strengthens XRP’s Position The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently withdrew its appeal against Ripple, marking a significant legal victory for the company. Initially, Ripple was ordered to pay $125 million in penalties, but the final settlement amount has been reduced to $50 million . This outcome provides further clarity for XRP’s regulatory status and eliminates a key source of uncertainty for investors. The SEC’s handling of ETF applications has also become a focal point for market observers. Several financial firms have submitted ETF proposals involving XRP, and the regulator has acknowledged many of these . If approved, these ETFs could drive increased institutional demand and investment in the digital asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bullish Sentiment Surrounding XRP Claver’s assertion that JPMorgan is considering an XRP ETF adds to the growing speculation around institutional involvement. If confirmed, such a development could lead to a surge in adoption as major financial institutions integrate XRP into their investment products. In early 2025, a crypto expert drew attention to a JP Morgan analysis that highlighted XRP’s potential to attract up to $8 billion . The prospect of increased institutional participation is viewed as a catalyst for price appreciation and broader market acceptance. Market analysts have also observed multiple bullish formations on XRP’s price chart, reinforcing the optimism surrounding the asset. The asset is at a crucial juncture, and we could see major moves from XRP in the coming weeks. With a favorable legal outcome, increasing institutional interest, and technical indicators pointing to potential price gains, XRP’s market outlook appears strong. Claver’s confidence in XRP’s trajectory reflects a broader sentiment that the asset is well-positioned for growth. He believes skeptics are about to get steamrolled, and if ETF approvals move forward and financial institutions expand their use of XRP, its role in the global financial system could expand significantly.

42647755,https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoins-are-powering-deobanks,1743346800,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Stablecoins are powering deobanks,https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoins-are-powering-deobanks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Opinion by: Maksym Sakharov, co-founder and group CEO of WeFi The current markets are experiencing tailwinds as a result of the tariffs imposed by the US administration and retaliatory measures from trading partners. So far, however, market proponents say that Trump’s tariffs are primarily a negotiation strategy, and their effect on businesses and consumers will remain manageable. Market uncertainty drives institutional interest Adding to the uncertainty are the inflationary pressures that could challenge the US Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting outlook. Besides that, an impending fiscal debate in Washington over the federal budget is also causing jitters in the market. Resolving the debt ceiling remains a pressing issue, as the Treasury currently relies upon “extraordinary measures” to meet US financial obligations. The exact timeline for when these measures will be exhausted is unclear, but analysts anticipate they may run out after the first quarter. While the administration has proposed eliminating the debt ceiling, this could face resistance from fiscal conservatives in Congress. According to a recent report, one sector experiencing steady growth is stablecoins despite this macroeconomic uncertainty. Much of the volume is driven by flows in Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ). Dollar-pegged stablecoins dominate the market Stablecoins started as an experiment — a programmable digital currency that would make it easier for users to enter the crypto market and trade different digital assets. A decade later, they are a critical part of the broader digital financial infrastructure. The stablecoin market cap currently stands at a record $226 billion and continues to expand. Demand in emerging markets drives this growth. A recent ARK Invest report states that dollar-pegged stablecoins dominate the market. They account for over 98% of the stablecoin supply, with gold- and euro-backed stablecoins only sharing a small portion of the market. In addition to this, Tether’s USDt accounts for over 60% of the total market. ARK’s research suggests that the market will expand and include Asian currency-backed stablecoins. Recent: US will use stablecoins to ensure dollar hegemony — Scott Bessent Besides that, digital assets are going through a shift marked by “stablecoinization” and “dollarization.” Asian nations like China and Japan have offloaded record amounts of US Treasurys. Saudi Arabia has ended its 45-year petrodollar agreement, and BRICS nations are increasingly bypassing the SWIFT network to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) were traditionally the primary entry points into the digital asset ecosystem. Stablecoins have, however, taken the lead over the past two years, now representing 35%–50% of onchain transaction volumes. Despite global regulatory headwinds, emerging markets have been adopting stablecoins. In Brazil, 90% of crypto transactions are undertaken via stablecoins, primarily used for international purchases. A Visa report ranks Nigeria, India, Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil as the most active stablecoin markets, and Argentina ranks second in stablecoin holdings. Additionally, six out of every 10 purchases in the country were made using stablecoins pegged to the dollar, with near parity between USDC and USDT. This shift toward stablecoins in Argentina is driven by high inflation and the need to protect against the devaluation of the Argentine peso. People in countries with unstable currencies turn to stablecoins, like USDT, to safeguard their wealth. Deobanks and their role in high-risk areas Stablecoins have paved the way for a new generation of financial services. For example, stablecoins have provided the foundation for decentralized onchain banks, or deobanks, that embrace stablecoins as their native currency. Deobanks make digital banking and financial services accessible to everyone, even people who do not meet strict account opening criteria. They also attract people who do not trust traditional institutions with their money. Users keep complete control of their funds through non-custodial accounts and enjoy real-time transaction transparency. Deobanks’ decentralized nature replaces intermediaries with smart contracts that connect personal wallets directly to digital bank accounts. This approach cuts costs and speeds up transactions. Onchain data transparently preserves every transaction detail. The result is a financial model that is both efficient and inclusive. What lies ahead Analysts predict the stablecoin market cap will surpass $400 billion in 2025 . Deobanks bring a new edge to this growth, using stablecoins to drive economic growth and expand digital payment networks. They open fresh avenues for cross-border commerce and new opportunities for financial inclusion. In the next few years, the combined rise of stablecoins and next-generation onchain banks will transform how money moves across borders and transactions are processed. The blockchain integration at the back end and stablecoin foundation will promote lower fees, faster payments and broader access to financial services . The trend represents a shift away from outdated systems and signals a more resilient financial ecosystem. Opinion by: Maksym Sakharov, co-founder and group CEO of WeFi .

With Ethereum now well-established and priced at $2,068, many are seeking the next big opportunity in decentralized finance (DeFi). Mutuum Finance, still priced under $0.025 in phase 4 of its presale, is generating immense hype as early investors rush in, hoping to ride the next parabolic surge. Mutuum Finance might just be the dark horse that turns small investments into life-changing wealth, with $5.7 million secured and over 7400 investors attracted. Those starting to invest now during this phase means investors can earn 140% return at launch price of $0.06. A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is transforming the decentralized lending market through its revolutionary dual-lending technology which drives its exponential growth. 7400 investors partook in support of the project by investing $5.7 million after recognizing its value potential during its presale period. The current price of Mutuum Finance Token stands at $0.025 in Phase 4 but investors will experience additional value from the upcoming Phase 5 price increase of 20%. Mutuum Finance brings out the revolutionary change to Defi by incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2P provides passive income opportunities to customers by placing them in USDT liquidity pools through smart contract managed automatic lending capabilities. The P2P method enables direct lending relations that allow customers to operate deals without intermediaries while keeping their capital intact. The linkage of P2C and P2P models at Mutuum Finance creates an investment opportunity with enhanced safety alongside improved efficiency and decentralized features as a DeFi investment solution for maximum-yield seekers. A Secure and Trustworthy Financial Ecosystem Mutuum Finance plans to construct a completely collateralized stablecoin backed by USD fixed within the Ethereum blockchain to support its entire ecosystem. This cryptocurrency exceeds algorithmic stablecoins’ requirements by using extra collateral thus reducing both the risks and maintaining stability over time. Such an approach provides complete investor confidence because it combines open financial architecture with audited smart contracts while avoiding the failures that devastated other DeFi projects. Investor Incentives and Community Expansion The company builds its community base through rewarding investors with attractive benefits. The fund will send 10 fortunate participants $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens through its million-dollar token distribution campaign combined with its award-winning referral system that rewards users for acquiring new participants. The platform offers exclusive staking pools and governance rights and VIP update access to its early adopting community members as they develop long-term loyalty with Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The tokenomics system of this project uses mechanisms which control token release and promote price stability for the long-term. Scarcity of tokens and deflationary mechanisms applied during presales lead Mutuum Finance to establish price appreciation potential in the long term. High incentive rewards and active token participation are possible through its staking feature which builds long-term functionality and maintains a healthy ecosystem. Mutuum Finance is emerging as a leading Ethereum alternative, offering early investors a chance to capitalize on the next major DeFi opportunity. Over $5.7 million has been secured, attracting 7,400+ investors who recognize its potential. The presale price of $0.025 will soon rise to $0.03, providing an opportunity for substantial gains before launching at $0.06, delivering a 140% return. A dual-lending model, stablecoin backing, and investor incentives position MUTM as a standout project. Secure your stake in Mutuum Finance today and take advantage of this high-potential investment.

33767162,[object Object],1743346830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Nears Key Signal – Next Major Buying Opportunity Ahead?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mvrv-ratio-nears-key-signal-next-major-buying-opportunity-ahead/,"Bitcoin is facing intense selling pressure once again, with bears now eyeing a move below the critical $80,000 support level. After bulls briefly pushed BTC to $87,000, hopes for a sustained recovery were quickly dashed when the price failed to reclaim the key $90,000 resistance. Since then, momentum has shifted sharply in favor of the bears, dragging the market into deeper uncertainty. Ongoing macroeconomic instability, fueled by escalating trade war fears and weakening global sentiment, continues to weigh heavily on financial markets — and the crypto space has been among the hardest hit. Risk appetite is fading fast, and Bitcoin’s failure to hold higher ground has only added to the pressure. Despite the current weakness, some analysts see a potential buying opportunity on the horizon. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, noting that the next prime Bitcoin accumulation zone could appear when the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Ratio crosses above its 70-day moving average. Historically, such crossovers have marked attractive entry points for long-term investors. Bitcoin Hovers Near $82K As Bulls Face Crucial Test Bitcoin is now facing a key technical and psychological test around the $82,000 level after losing bullish momentum earlier this week. Bulls initially regained control with a push toward $87,000, but the rally stalled as BTC failed to reclaim the critical $90,000 resistance mark. Since then, selling pressure has resumed, erasing recent gains and dragging the price into lower support zones. What started as a minor upswing has now turned into a deeper struggle for bulls trying to stabilize the trend. The renewed weakness comes amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and rising global tensions, which continue to shake financial markets. Risk appetite has faded across the board, and Bitcoin — like many crypto assets — remains highly sensitive to broader economic shifts. Price action has reflected this fragility, with bears now pressing to break below $82K and challenge deeper demand zones. Despite the current downtrend, some analysts believe a meaningful buying opportunity could be approaching. Martinez shared on X that the next prime Bitcoin accumulation zone may emerge when the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Ratio crosses above its 70-day moving average. Historically, this signal has aligned with market bottoms and early stages of recovery. While the short-term trend remains pressured, the approaching MVRV crossover could provide a critical turning point. Bulls now face the urgent task of defending $82K and pushing back above key resistance zones. If they succeed — and if accumulation quietly continues — Bitcoin could soon find the footing needed to begin a stronger recovery phase. Until then, volatility and caution are likely to dominate the market. BTC Down 8% As Bulls Fight To Reclaim Key Moving Averages Bitcoin has dropped 8% since March 24, with price action continuing to show weakness as bulls fail to push past key resistance. After briefly consolidating near $87,000, BTC lost momentum and slipped below both the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and the exponential moving average (EMA), which were clustered in the $87K–$85K range. These moving averages have acted as dynamic support throughout past uptrends, and the recent breakdown reinforces the growing bearish sentiment. For any recovery phase to begin, bulls must reclaim this range and flip it back into support. A sustained move above $85,000 would signal strength and could set the stage for a push toward the $90K resistance level. However, the current rejection suggests that sellers remain firmly in control. If Bitcoin fails to hold above the $82,000 level in the coming sessions, the market could face a more profound correction. A break below $82K would likely open the door to sub-$80K prices, placing Bitcoin back into lower demand zones and triggering renewed fear among investors. With volatility increasing and macroeconomic uncertainty still weighing on the market, bulls are under pressure to act quickly before bearish momentum accelerates further.

Cardano to Surge on The Strength of Bullish News After falling 40% recently, Cardano is getting ready for a presumably significant increase. With average 3.5 favorable comments on social media, the most current news in the crypto market reveals that societal attitudes on the Cardano price are more optimistic. The feelings have been at their strongest since November; this might be a result of the most recent US strategic stockpile build-up on cryptocurrencies. Rumor has it that ADA works on government-funded blockchain projects and traders are projecting Cardano pricing bright days ahead. At the time of writing, Cardano is selling near $0.6714 . Experts predict that the price will climb even further in a few months.

McGlone said that if overall market conditions worsen, ETH could fall to the $1,000 level later this year. However, while continued weakness in Bitcoin (BTC) could exacerbate losses in the altcoin market, a rally in ETH toward $2,000 could signal renewed strength in risk assets. Related News: Watch Out: We're Entering a Critical Week - Lots of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events - Here's a Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List McGlone recently assessed the evolution and current challenges of Bitcoin in a statement. He said that Bitcoin, which emerged in 2009 alongside traditional safe haven assets such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium, has since given rise to a vast cryptocurrency ecosystem. He argued that these digital assets have become expensive and highly speculative. “When a very bullish and speculative asset needs to continue to rise, market authorities have a history of making things difficult,” McGlone said. *This is not investment advice.

The token is set to launch at $0.42, but early investors can still buy at a lower presale price of $0.09, offering a chance for potential 400% gains. This early success has drawn interest from major Ripple holders. As the XRP price struggles with a weekly and monthly decline, Ripple investors are quietly accumulating INTL tokens, seeing it as a high-growth alternative. Analysts predict that INTL could reach a $5 billion valuation, with its price potentially soaring from $0.09 to $2.50. INTL Presale Surges as XRP Whales Show Interest IntelMarkets is among the best ICOs to consider in 2025, as its presale has raised over $12 million. The project's presale defies the broader bearish sentiment that has recently weighed down the crypto market. As its launch date approaches, XRP whales are secretly accumulating the INTL tokens. With its AI-driven technology and advanced trading features, IntelMarkets is gaining traction in the TradFi sector. The platform uses AI trading bots that can analyze market data as a way to enhance traders' strategies based on live market conditions. INTL integrates Ethereum and Solana blockchains, enhancing functionality and maintaining ease of use. Its self-learning Intelli-M™ bots adapt to market conditions, refining trading strategies over time and offering a more effective approach to automated trading. The platform also offers a high-leverage option of up to 1000x, enabling traders to increase their market exposure and potential returns. In its 10th presale stage, IntelMarkets is priced at $0.09, with the token set to launch at $0.42, offering a 400% increase. Experts also predict that INTL could become the next big $5 billion token. This growth target could position INTL as a token to watch closely, especially for Ripple holders seeking substantial returns. IntelMarkets' Rapid Growth Signals $5 Billion Growth Potential Market investors predict that INTL could show the potential for massive valuation, citing its strong performance and rapid expansion. The platform's early growth trajectory is drawing the attention of the XRP whales as they secretly acquire INTL tokens. The project's token presale has raised over $12 million and is still attracting investors. IntelMarkets has shown growth potential similar to crypto giants like Ripple. With IntelMarkets ' growing momentum, experts suggest its token could reach a $5 billion valuation. If IntelMarkets' token achieves the projected $5 billion market cap from its listing price, its value could rise to $2.50 per token. This would mark over 2,600% increase from its current price of $0.09. Ripple (XRP) Struggles with Market Volatility XRP has been on an upward trend driven by institutional adoption and positive technical signals. Ripple's expanding presence in the financial sector reinforces XRP’s position in cross-border payments. The XRP token has consistently traded above $2 since last month, maintaining a strong price level. Analysts suggest that increasing adoption could push the XRP price to $10. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading above $2 and has experienced slight volatility. The XRP price has dropped by 7.35% in the past 7 days, recording a dip from $2.40 to $2.22. Also, the monthly chart records a price dip of 3.90%, maintaining a downward trajectory. Nevertheless, the XRP price is currently trading 21.78% above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $1.83, indicating a strong upward trend. Source: CoinCodexHowever, XRP price sentiment leans bearish, with the Fear Index recording a 44 score, showing fear among investors. The legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC creates uncertainty, prompting some investors to seek other opportunities. As such, investors are quietly accumulating INTL, which shows signs of growth potential amid XRP price volatility. Conclusion XRP’s recent decline has led Ripple whales to secretly accumulate INTL tokens. With the XRP price going down, investors are turning to IntelMarkets, whose presale has raised over $12 million despite market uncertainty. The tokens are currently available for $0.09, with a listing price of $0.42 offering early investors instant 400% gains. Analysts predict INTL could hit a $5 billion valuation. With its AI-driven trading and high-leverage options, IntelMarkets offers a rare opportunity. As the presale nears its final stages, traders must act now or risk missing out on massive gains.

Which One Of These Is Predicted To Rise Over 500% In The Coming Week",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/pepe-shiba-inu-or-remittix-which-one-of-these-is-predicted-to-rise-over-500-in-the-coming-week,"The meme coin craze continues to swirl with the likes of Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), both frequently riding waves of crypto volatility. Meanwhile, an under-the-radar token named Remittix (RTX) at $0.0734, with over $14.2 million raised and 522+ million tokens sold, has quietly built momentum by addressing real-world payment needs. Below, we explore how Pepe’s big whale moves, Shiba Inu’s struggles at key support and Remittix’s cross-border utility position them for gains or losses in the coming week. Finally, we reveal which token analysts expect to surge over 500% soon. Pepe (PEPE): Whale Watch PEPE at around $0.057304. Source: CoinGecko Pepe (PEPE) trades around $0.057304 . A whale known as qianbaidu.eth recently withdrew 506 billion PEPE tokens worth roughly $4.4 million from the Binance exchange on March 26, 2025. This same whale reportedly pocketed $7.34 million in earlier trades of Pepe, hinting at a history of large-scale moves. For many watchers, such whale activity can indicate big trades or potential price swings. If large holders continue amassing PEPE, short-term hype might propel it higher . However, Meme coin rallies can vanish overnight if whales dump tokens or overall market sentiment sours. Pepe’s value often hinges on the presence of big players who can manipulate liquidity. So while we might see a mini price bump, big leaps like 500% in a week are less likely unless new meme mania returns. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Testing Critical Support SHIB at $0.00001272. Source: CoinGecko Shiba Inu (SHIB), currently at around $0.00001272 , enjoyed a solid bounce in March (about 45%) but quickly lost momentum on March 26. Analysts now watch the confluence of support levels near $0.0000113. A breakdown below that zone could lead to a notable sell-off. The longer-term picture shows SHIB riding an ascending trend line since June 2023. That line was validated again in March 2025, but the rebound didn’t hold above the $0.0000156 resistance. Furthermore, SHIB never swept the August 2024 lows , so some market watchers suspect more correction is on the horizon. If the uptrend fails to reclaim higher resistances, the token might remain range-bound for a while, possibly leading to moderate gains or sideways movement, rather than an explosive rally. Remittix (RTX): Real-World Utility at $0.0734 While Pepe wrestles with whale effects and Shiba Inu battles support and resistance lines, Remittix (RTX) sets itself apart by focusing on cross-border remittances. Priced at $0.0734, with $14.2+ million raised and more than 522 million tokens sold, RTX helps families, freelancers, and small stores bypass high wire fees and multi-day waits. People can turn cryptos (BTC, ETH, DOGE, etc.) into local currency, typically receiving funds in normal bank accounts within about 24 hours. By tackling a giant real-world problem, the trillion-dollar remittance market Remittix (RTX) stands to attract mainstream interest. Analysts say if RTX forges ties with big payroll companies or major e-commerce outlets, daily usage could rocket. That direct utility often leads to more stable and sustained demand compared to coins that rely on hype. Observers predict Remittix could see enormous growth, possibly surpassing the 500% mark if mainstream adoption surges into something that’s far more grounded in real-world usage than typical meme coins. Conclusion: Remittix Is Predicted to Rise Over 500% This Coming Week While Pepe might see short-term volatility driven by whale movements and Shiba Inu battles critical support without a clear path above $0.0000156, Remittix (RTX) at $0.0734 looks set for a more remarkable climb. Fueled by $14.2 million in funding and a tangible solution for cross-border payments, RTX stands out from meme-driven tokens. Crypto analysts increasingly point to Remittix as the likeliest candidate for a meteoric 500% gain perhaps even in the coming week provided more partnerships finalize and user adoption accelerates. If the market recognizes its practical edge, Remittix could be the surprise winner, leaving typical meme coins behind in pursuit of serious, real-world growth. Ready to Give Remittix (RTX) a Go?

Viral Altcoin Tipped To Go In Other Direction,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/pepe-price-prediction-is-pepe-heading-out-of-crypto-top-50-viral-altcoin-tipped-to-go-in-other-direction,"The cryptocurrency market continues to tread cautiously following the early February dip, with top altcoins like Pepe to reclaim their 2024 highs and some Pepe Price Predictions lowering. Pepe, despite recent whale accumulation and renewed hype, remains stuck below key resistance levels, reflecting broader market hesitation. In contrast, Rollblock is quickly establishing itself as a powerhouse in blockchain gaming. With a user base exceeding 55,000 and a compelling play-to-earn ecosystem, the platform is riding a wave of momentum as GameFi eyes a potential comeback. Here’s What’s Driving Rollbock’s Immense Hype Rollblock is reshaping the iGaming landscape by blending blockchain technology with top-tier security and a rewarding play-to-earn model. Built on the ERC-20 standard, it offers over 7,000 games, from traditional blackjack to exclusive blockchain titles, making it an ideal space for both casual and experienced gamers.

Pepe Price Prediction: The Rundown On Pepe As April Approaches Pepe is back in focus as it rebounds from recent lows, gaining over 8% in the past week and showing strong signs of a recovery. After months of downward pressure, Pepe has caught investor attention with renewed bullish momentum and a push toward the key $0.000010 psychological level. A major catalyst behind this surge for Pepe is the return of whale investors . One early backer, Qianbaidu.eth, recently withdrew over 500 billion Pepe from Binance, bringing their total holdings to nearly $5.1 million. Additionally, wallets holding between 1 trillion and 10 trillion Pepe have grown significantly, indicating increased confidence among major holders. Further fueling optimism is the massive accumulation by a newly created whale wallet that grabbed another 500 billion Pepe. This move has sparked market excitement and raised expectations for a price breakout, especially as Pepe edges closer to reclaiming earlier highs. Analysts remain optimistic about Pepe’s future, especially with predictions targeting prices as high as $0.00012 . If the momentum continues and investor confidence holds, Pepe may very well knock off another zero and become a standout performer in the 2025 bull cycle. Get Into Rollblock Before It’s Too Late! Priced at just $0.062 during its tenth presale phase, RBLK presents a prime entry into the rapidly expanding blockchain gaming industry. A few analysts are eyeing a potential 150x surge by Q2, with the possibility of hitting 250x as the market hits full stride, making it an attractive option for investors seeking high-upside plays.

ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins.

ARB is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing fear among investors. On the charts, it is moving into consolidation. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year.

Source: Coinstats According to Coinmarketcap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark and crossed in December, trading at $48 The coin crossed into 2025, trading at $35.70. The trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $10 in March.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-30 15:18:00

According to the company’s latest report, the stablecoin outpaced the company’s internal projections when it hit the new market cap record. The token has enjoyed increased institutional interest in the market, providing it with the ingredients it needs for growth. RLUSD witnesses massive growth in February The positive news was shared in a post on X by the Senior Vice President at Ripple, Jack McDonald. He highlighted several aspects of the February attestation, noting that the stablecoin has continued to show strong movements. In the post, he mentioned that RLUSD is now being used in DeFi liquidity pools amid other use cases. McDonald also mentioned that NGOs have now started adopting the token as a means of donation. The Feb monthly independent attestation for $RLUSD is live 👇 — Market cap (~$170M) is outpacing our internal projections – we expect to be a top 5 stablecoin by EOY 🔥 — RLUSD is available on new exchanges including @LMAX with more to come… — New use cases are continuing to… — Jack McDonald (@_JackMcDonald_) March 28, 2025 The token’s increase in market cap has shown that its demand and utility have grown steadily. Launched in December 2024, the stablecoin made its debut on several exchanges, including Uphold, CoinMENA, Archax, and MoonPay. Since then, it has secured listings on exchanges like Bitso, Bullish, Mercado Bitcoin, Independent Reserve, Zero Hash, and Bitstamp. The token was also recently listed on LMAX. The token has recorded relatively solid numbers since its launch, with RLUSD reaching $120 million in just two months. There have also been talks about moving the stablecoin to different blockchains, with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson mentioning plans to add RLUSD into the blockchain. It remains to be seen what exchanges and blockchains the stablecoin will appear on in the future. Ripple CEO makes top five prediction Beyond the growth of the stablecoin, RLUSD is making a play for the top five spot in the stablecoin market. According to the February attestation, there has been a spike in mining activity, with about 17 million tokens minted every day at the RLUSD Treasury. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also given his opinion on the stablecoin, predicting a top-five move by the end of the year. Garlinghouse’s projection comes amid the broader bullish sentiment in the stablecoin market. In a recent Bloomberg interview, the Ripple CEO discussed the future of stablecoins, particularly about its regulation following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ( SEC ) decision to withdraw its lawsuit against the company. He mentioned that RLUSD has what it takes to be among the top tokens in the stablecoin sector. Industry analysts have also noted that the rise of RLUSD could challenge the leaders in the stablecoin market, particularly if its adoption in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry and its use for cross-border activities continues at its current pace. Also, the relationship between Ripple and financial institutions and payment services could give RLUSD the advantage of being used in traditional finance.

Remittix, Fartcoin, Dogecoin Or XRP",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/which-of-these-is-predicted-as-a-better-investment-in-april-and-why-remittix-fartcoin-dogecoin-or-xrp,"Crypto investors now focus their attention on April because they evaluate their holdings between short-term gains and long-term functional value. The daily competition between hype and fundamental value in cryptocurrency markets focuses on four tokens: Remittix (RTX), Fartcoin(FART), Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP. Among the unique stories of these tokens, one stands out due to its potential for the April market rally. Smart investors choose Remittix for pre-exchange acquisition because it offers better investment opportunities throughout April. Fartcoin (FART): Fun, Volatile and Risky Fartcoin stands as a meme coin that recently soared to fame because consumers mix curiosity with memes alongside buy-in from retail investors. FART experienced a huge market surge of 52.76% during the last week as its value approached $628 million thus demonstrating similar market dynamics as Dogecoin did in its early run. Yet, beneath the fun lies fragility. Fartcoin’s price surge primarily results from entertainment value rather than practical purposes and faces major downside risks because of its speculative nature. The high trading volume of $214 million raises doubts about sustainability since Fartcoinlacks clear practical uses. Short-term traders may be attracted to the situation at the moment, while long-term investors display increased conservatism. Dogecoin (DOGE): Legacy Meme Coin Losing Steam? Dogecoin carried the title of esteemed meme coin dominance until 2025 began with a rough commencing year. Introduced at $0.20 in March, DOGE showed resistance, which prevented it from advancing. The current market value of $0.17 puts Dogecoin at risk because it needs Bitcoin to keep its upward trend in Q2. The strong crypto community backing Dogecoin alongside Elon Musk's occasional endorsements fail to counteract the cryptocurrency's constrained potential because of its stagnant development and integration portfolio. The price of DOGE might experience speculative shifts throughout April but additional external events are needed to push its potential beyond current limits. XRP: Legal Wins but Resistance Remains XRP strives to return to higher value after several court decisions that favored the company during its SEC legal dispute. At present, XRP maintains a steady price level of $2.35 but indicates stability in its market value. Market technical indicators show that an overwhelming number of traders have maintained short positions around the $2.60 level causing resistance to an upward breakout. Bull traders speculate that XRP may propel to $3 during Q2, but the market might stay volatile unless major positive sentiment dominates the market outlook. Despite providing institutional-quality solutions for cross-border liquidity, XRP faces competition from Remittix as well as other newer players because Remittix presents a sleek, agile platform that attracts both individual customers and SMEs. Remittix (RTX): Real-World Utility Meets Presale Momentum The rapid market growth of Remittix comes from its solution of fixing both expensive and slow border payments. Users using Remittix can carry out crypto transactions on the platform which transforms into money and deposits to worldwide bank accounts. Remittix offers support for more than thirty FIAT currencies while providing a seamless experience to both business clients and individual users so it successfully unites crypto and fiat currencies despite major altcoin challenges to do the same. Voters in the current presale stage of Remittix have contributed $14.2 million by selling more than 523 million tokens. The token price jumped to $0.0734 while users continued to buy the currency as it increased nearly 380% above its original price of $0.015. Researchers interpret Remittix as an infrastructure solution that can power the $190 trillion international payment network. Numerous investors anticipate that RTX will enter exchanges with immense price potential after early investors achieve substantial returns. The utility-based nature sets Remittix coins apart from other MEME tokens because they provide functional value instead of speculative investments in April this year. Verdict: April Belongs to Remittix The utility-oriented nature of the crypto market positions Remittix as the top choice for April. Success at Remittix stems from its ability to address genuine problems faced by millions of customers across the globe. The prefunding performance of Remittix has achieved returns that surpass what most altcoins normally achieve, and upcoming exchange listings will drive upcoming waves of investor momentum. Fartcoin presents brief profit opportunities for daring investors, yet XRP and DOGE will constantly get attention because of their established market positions. Remittix fulfills all the criteria of momentum + utility + future potential. The token RTX positions itself as a potential breakthrough token since institutions are exploring blockchain payments and developing countries are exploring banking alternatives.

Analysts suggest the token may need to revisit a critical buying level before resuming its long-term uptrend. As market volatility increases, traders are watching closely for a potential reset that could offer a prime entry point ahead of XRP’s next breakout. Why Crypto Investors Are Participating in the Rollblock Presale Rollblock’s presale traction continues to build. Over $1 million was raised in March alone, and 15,000 new users joined the platform. Activity is climbing across the board, from deposits to bids. The project has also drawn support from key Web3 voices like YouTuber Crypto Nautic , helping expand its reach. Rollblock offers players access to over 7,000 games, ranging from classics like blackjack, poker, and roulette to blockchain-first exclusives. Its recent expansion into sports-bidding has broadened its appeal further, allowing users to place wagers on high-profile events such as the Super Bowl and UFC main cards. The platform’s tokenomics are designed for sustainability. Rollblock commits 30% of all platform revenue to buying back RBLK tokens. Of those, 60% are permanently burned to drive scarcity, while the remaining 40% is distributed to stakers—rewarding long-term holders and keeping engagement strong. Transparency and compliance sit at the core of Rollblock’s model. The platform has passed a full audit by SolidProof and operates under an Anjouan Gaming license, establishing credibility in a sector that is often lacking. Security is tight, with advanced encryption ensuring a fair, tamper-proof user experience. With the GameFi market growing again, Rollblock stands out as one of the few projects combining real revenue, clear compliance, and steady user growth. As presale funds approach the $12 million mark, investor momentum shows no signs of slowing. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Drops 41% From Cycle High, but Analysts Still Eye $15 Breakout Ripple’s XRP has been on shaky ground despite a strong start to the year. After briefly hitting $3.40 in mid-January—just before President Donald Trump’s inauguration—the token came within 1% of breaking its all-time high from 2018. Since then, however, XRP has slid sharply. The altcoin trades at $2.18 following a 6.4% daily drop, marking a 45.93% decline from its local high. The drop has pushed XRP out of the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap, with Tether (USDT) reclaiming the third spot. This retracement comes despite several positive developments for Ripple, including regulatory clarity in the wake of the SEC lawsuit and broader optimism in the crypto market. So far, none of these tailwinds have been enough to reignite lasting momentum. Market analyst Ali Martinez flagged $3 as a critical level for XRP to reclaim to invalidate a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. Until that happens, the risk remains skewed to the downside. Martinez noted $2 as the immediate support level to watch—if that breaks, XRP could revisit $1.25, a price not seen in months. Still, not all analysts are bearish. CryptoELITES, a well-followed trader known for catching early moves, remains bullish on the long-term trajectory. In a March 27, 2025, X post, he noted that XRP has already rallied over 600% since he first noticed it at $0.50. CryptoELITES applied Fibonacci extension levels to chart XRP’s next potential targets. His analysis projects a move to $8.41 at the 1.272 extension, followed by $13.59 at 1.414, with a longer-term goal of $15. That would represent a 572.65% gain from current prices and push XRP significantly higher in market cap rankings. Don’t Miss Out on Rollblock March Mayhem Bonus: Buy Now!

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has dropped from the year-to-date high of $109,300 to a 2025 low of $77,396.43 on March 10. Similarly, Ethereum ( ETH ) has plunged below $1,900, while Ripple ( XRP ) and Cardano ( ADA ) have fallen to $2.1 and $0.65, respectively. Most altcoins have crashed this year, with the closely watched altcoin season index moving to 15. The crypto fear and greed index has dropped to the fear zone of 25, while the market cap of all coins has dropped by over $1 trillion. US equities have slumped this year The crypto market and its top players like BTC, XRP, ETH, and ADA may be at risk of a deep dive now that US equities are selling off. The blue-chip S&P 500 index has dropped by almost 10% from its highest point this year. Similarly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has moved to $19,280, down by 13% from its highest level this year. A drop of over 10% from a local top is a sign that an asset has moved into a correction. US equities have dropped for two main reasons. First, there are signs that the artificial intelligence industry that pushed it to a record high is starting to slow down. Most AI stocks, including popular names like NVIDIA, AMD, Microsoft, SoundHound, and C3.ai have all dropped sharply this year. NVIDIA’s market cap has dropped from $3.4 trillion earlier this year to $3.6 trillion. Second, reciprocal tariffs and a global trade war have many economists worried that the U.S. could wind up in a recession.

That’s because, as shown above, the two indices have formed a death cross when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other. The last time that the Nasdaq 100 index formed a death cross was in 2022, and it dropped by almost 40% during the year. Historically, the crypto and stock markets are highly correlated because they are categorized as risky assets. In most periods, cryptocurrencies drop when the stock market is falling. For example, Bitcoin and most altcoins have had a steeper crash this year as the stock market dropped.

The whales, who borrowed millions in DAI from the DeFi lending protocol and pledged ETH as collateral, are now under pressure due to Ether’s continuous decline. According to Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence , who both spotlighted the situation, the whales have a combined 125,603 ETH worth $238 million on the line. One borrowed over $75 million worth of DAI from MakerDAO, using 60,810 ETH worth $110 million as collateral. Ethereum whale facing liquidation on MakerDAO. Source: Arkham Intelligence However, the whale has their liquidation threshold set at $1,793, raising concerns that any sharp drop in ETH price could cause liquidation. Arkham Intelligence noted that the whale has been inactive for three weeks, further justifying the concerns. Meanwhile, the other whale also borrowed over 68 million DAI on the lending platform, putting 64,792.7 ETH worth $122 million as collateral. Their liquidation price is set at $1,787. Interestingly, this second whale avoided liquidation on March 11 by paying off part of the debt. However, the continuous decline in ETH value means they are now at risk again, and many are observing what will happen next. Ethereum struggles look set to continue as DeFi feels impact The struggles of these whales highlight the impact of the ETH price decline on the DeFi sector. With ETH being the major cryptocurrency of transactions for decentralized finance activity, its decline has had a major impact on the sector. ETH has been struggling since reaching its $4,000 peak in December. Even when other major crypto recorded gains at the start of 2025, the token showed signs of future challenges. However, its struggles have reached new levels in the past few weeks, with value crashing below $2,000. It is now down 45% year-to-date. With its performance, the TVL of DeFi protocols has also fallen significantly. Per Defillama data, Ethereum DeFi TVL has fallen to $50 billion from over $66 billion at the start of the year. Out of the top ten protocols on the network, only Aave and Sky (formerly MakerDAO) have seen their TVL increase in the past month. All other protocols, including Lido, EigenLayer, Ethena, Uniswap, and Pendle, have seen TVL declines varying between 5% and 37%. Meanwhile, ETH’s struggles are not unique. Other cryptos have also struggled due to rising US inflation data and President Trump’s tariffs , worsening the country’s economic outlook. However, the extent of its fall compared to other assets is an outlier, and the long-term expectations are not much better. Most analysts note that the token could face more problems ahead, with Bloomberg claiming developers are leaving, and smaller competitors are gaining in on it. Crypto venture capitalist Quinn Thompson also described Ethereum’s value proposition as an investment “ dead ,” noting the decline in transaction activity, fees, and user growth. He noted that the project still has utility as a network but not as an investment. Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter also agreed, noting that the proliferation of tokens and Layer-2 networks killed ETH. He said: “The #1 cause of this is greedy eth L2s siphoning value from the L1 and the social consensus that excess token creation was A-OK. Eth was buried in an avalanche of its own tokens. Died by its own hand.” However, many believe that any focus on Ethereum should not be on the mainnet alone but on the entire ecosystem, including the L2s. Thompson countered that ecosystem growth is not adding value to ETH as other tokens and entities are getting most of this value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Enter Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), a project that’s already making waves in the crypto community. But what about other trending cryptocurrencies like Moo Deng and Floki Inu? While they have their spotlight, Arctic Pablo Coin is a fresh new entry with immense potential. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Floki Inu. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Revolution in Crypto with Staking, Rewards, and Burns Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is rapidly gaining attention with its innovative features that differentiate it from many other meme coins in the market today. One of the standout features is its staking and rewards system. Investors can enjoy an APY of 66% during the presale, where staking APC tokens not only locks in your investment but also guarantees rewards as you hold them. Alongside this, referral incentives give you an extra reason to spread the word about Arctic Pablo, allowing you to earn even more APC tokens by sharing this unique opportunity. Another groundbreaking feature of Arctic Pablo Coin is its token burn mechanism, which is designed to increase the scarcity of the tokens over time. Every week, unsold tokens during the presale are permanently eliminated, creating a deflationary environment that drives up the value of the remaining tokens. This strategic burn is recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and security. As the Arctic Pablo journey progresses through different stages, this continuous token burn guarantees long-term sustainability and heightened value for holders. The Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: A Limited-Time Investment Opportunity As Arctic Pablo Coin has now reached its 16th phase, investors have witnessed the price increase steadily as it travels through various locations. The project is now at Crystal Cove, and the presale price is an unbelievable $0.000083 per token. For those looking to get in on the ground floor, the ROI potential is massive—over 9552.41% from the current price to the launch price of $0.008. The meme con presale has already raised over $2 million, and with every new phase, the price will continue to climb. The question is: Will you wait and watch this opportunity slip away, or will you take action now before the price increases further? Moo Deng: Latest News and Updates Moo Deng has been making headlines recently with its new partnerships aimed at broadening its reach in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The coin’s latest update highlights its upcoming NFT marketplace, where users can buy and sell digital collectibles. Moo Deng has also been expanding its staking opportunities, which are expected to bring higher returns for early investors. As the DeFi sector grows, Moo Deng remains a strong player, though it still has a long way to go before achieving the same level of excitement and growth as Arctic Pablo Coin. Floki Inu: Recent Developments in the Meme Coin World Floki Inu continues to make waves in the meme coin sector, but it’s facing tough competition. The latest development is its new launchpad for Floki-powered projects, which allows new tokens to raise funds directly from the community. While the coin has seen some success, its focus on community-driven projects may not be enough to match the innovative structure and presale excitement surrounding Arctic Pablo Coin. Investors are keeping a close eye on Floki Inu’s movements, but it remains to be seen whether it can keep up with the rapid growth that Arctic Pablo is experiencing. Final Thoughts: The Future of Crypto—Arctic Pablo Coin Takes the Lead In the world of meme coins and emerging crypto projects, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out for its unique approach to tokenomics, presale structure, and long-term sustainability. With exciting features like staking rewards, token burns, and a roadmap filled with potential, Arctic Pablo Coin offers one of the Best Crypto Coin with 100x Potential opportunities for growth in the current market.

Long traders and investors who have endured consecutive losses are now getting to breathe. Solana and other top altcoins have shown signs of recovery and with the pro-crypto stance of the new administration. However, a top analyst believes Solana’s recent uptick would be short-lived and the token might plunge by over 25% in April. Meanwhile, investors are buzzing with excitement after the U.S. SEC has lined up four upcoming roundtables on tokenization, DeFi and custody. And speaking of DeFi, a new payment network is stirring market sentiment with its unique DeFi capabilities: Remittix(RTX). Investors' interest in the project has skyrocketed and since its ICO went live, it has sold over half a billion tokens. Experts are betting big on Remittix and forecast massive profit margins of up to 100x before the final quarter of 2025. But why are these experts bent on the successful market debut of this new payment network and could it rival established networks like Ripple’s XRP and Stellar's XLM? Let's find out. Solana Price Prediction After a protracted period of sideways and downward movements, Solana bulls are starting to gain ground against the bearish pressure the token has suffered for more than a month. Solana’s recent price action clearly indicates a shift in market sentiment. Price charts show SOL is trading above $120 , reflecting a modest 2.48% weekly surge after suffering a 24-H 5.56% correction. Earlier this week, SOL's price hovered around the $145 price point after printing five consecutive green daily candles. Within this timeframe, Solana breached the upper Bollinger Band (BB) for the first time since it peaked at an all-time high in November 2021. However, a renowned analyst believes the recent spike is short-briefed and that the token’s trajectory will reverse. According to him, bears could come out up top early next month, leading to a potential 30% market crash. While data from Santiment shows that sentiment surrounding Solana has flipped positive, fueled by institutional interest and technological advances, he believes the sentiment surrounding the project is not as strong as it used to be. Remittix (RTX): A Successful Market Debut Awaits Remittix strategically combines local payment networks with blockchain technology to create seamless and instant crypto-to-fiat transactions. This innovative method of operation adds weight to the relatively new payment protocol's potential to outperform established global networks like Ripple. Ripple’s XRP, which continues to struggle with regulatory scrutiny, could lose a multi-trillion-dollar market gap to Remittix this year. The arrival of Remittix in the market would flip the current narrative associated with crypto-to-fiat transactions. This innovative platform would put an end to the plague of long waiting days and excessive transfer charges that millions of businesses and entrepreneurs have had to endure when making cross-border payments. In doing so, it would secure a significant stake of the $183 trillion market; hence, it's no surprise that experts are betting big on a successful market debut for Remittix. Experts are confident that Remittix's global economic inclusion is another undisputable factor in its quest for market dominance. The platform covers over 40+ crypto assets and operates in both developed and underbanked regions of the world. This broad range of operation would include certain parts of the world that have been isolated in the use of cryptocurrencies, improving B2B cross-border relationships and crypto adoption on a global scale. Moreover, Remittix uses a flat-fee model, which contradicts how other payment protocols cater to cross-border payments. The strategic inclusion of the flat fee model implies that recipients will receive the exact funds sent without deductions, such as wire charges. Until now, the unavailability of a solution like Remittix with such an inventive model has significantly cost businesses when dealing with multiple transfer charges; RTX will flip this narrative.

Some indicate the sector’s ongoing development, while others point to weak spots that require more action. Let’s examine them to see if the Kremlin will embrace crypto. Table of Contents Crypto investment testing Russia’s oil trade with India and China Garantex vs Tether Digital Ruble launch postponed Crypto investment testing The current status of crypto in Russia is far from loose—residents are allowed to buy and hold crypto, but they cannot pay with it. Crypto holdings are subject to taxation. Also, crypto mining is allowed and regulated but temporarily banned in select regions. On March 12, the Bank of Russia offered to allow a limited number of “particularly qualified” investors to buy and sell cryptocurrency. The investors who fit the status earned over 50 million rubles (over $584,000) in the previous year. They may also have deposits above 100 million rubles (nearly $1.17 million). Crypto trading will also be available for corporate investors. Read more: Russia’s Central Bank to allow limited crypto investments Media outlets lauded this move as a crypto-friendly proposal. However, it’s worth noting that the Bank of Russia offered to explicitly ban deals in crypto between the residents for all the categories of Russian citizens who don’t fit the criteria of the qualified investors. Therefore, it provides some freedom in trading crypto for the multi-millionaires and effectively bans it for all the rest. Currently, it is hard to estimate whether this proposal will be adopted and how repressive the law’s administration will be. Russia’s oil trade with India and China For years, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been discussing de-dollarization. Occasionally, there’s talk that the Chinese yuan could replace the dollar, but strict capital controls present limitations. However, as the pressure from Western sanctions grew and various connections were cut, Russia leaned on Bitcoin in international trade to dodge sanctions. On March 14, Reuters reported that Russia uses Bitcoin, USDT, and Ether in the oil trade with China and India. The goal is to avoid hurdles associated with sanctions and ease conversion between the Russian ruble, Chinese yuan, and Indian rupee. Sources told the news outlet that even if the sanctions are lifted, the use of digital assets is not expected to stop, as cryptocurrencies have smooth operability. Last summer, Russia introduced a bill encouraging businesses to use crypto for international trade to bypass Western sanctions. Currently, only a small share of oil traded by Russia is sold for crypto, but the volume is increasing. This news demonstrates that the legislative background created by the Kremlin appeals to business not only as a way to bypass limitations implied by sanctions but also as a convenient trading tool. Will the government allow the broader usage of crypto? It’s hard to say, given the Kremlin’s cautious approach to crypto in the past. You might also like: Russian oil companies rely on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins for trades with China and India: report Garantex vs Tether While Russia uses Tether’s USDT to dodge sanctions, Tether itself is trying to demonstrate its dedication to following them. One example is Tether freezing all the USDT on the big Russian crypto exchange Garantex, which is sanctioned by Europe and the U.S. The stablecoin operator effectively disabled Garantex’s functioning by freezing $27 million worth of USDT on Mar. 6, around a week after it was sanctioned. The exchange called it “a war on the Russian crypto market” and halted all operations for an unnamed period. The exchange offered to solve issues with each client personally in the exchange’s office. The U.S. sanctioned Gatantex much earlier–in April 2022. Earlier, Binance announced its plans to delist USDT (alongside several other stablecoins) for users from European Economic Area countries, as USDT doesn’t adhere to the new MiCA rules that regulate stablecoins in Europe. Tether’s future becomes increasingly unclear as stablecoin regulation in the U.S. and Europe changes. Such bold action as freezing millions of USDT on sanctioned Garantex is probably an attempt to regain the reputation of a law-abiding company in a time when stablecoins, especially USDT, are subjected to increased scrutiny. It’s worth saying that many other exchanges still provide services to Russian residents. According to the Global Ledger investigation finalized on March 13, Garantex resurfaced as a new exchange called Grinex.

Unlike the U.S., Russia is not going to miss an opportunity to have a national CBDC that gives the government a new tool for surveillance over its citizens. The Digital Ruble should have been launched in the summer of 2025, but the plans changed. Currently, there is no distinct date for the CBDC launch. Finally, we have learned the reasons behind the postponement of the Digital Ruble launch. Unlike the U.S., Russia is not going to miss an opportunity to have a national CBDC that gives the government a new tool for surveillance and pressure over its citizens. The Digital Ruble should have been launched in the summer of 2025, but the plans changed. Currently, there is no distinct date for the CBDC launch. According to Vedomosti’s March 14 report , the postponement was caused by the technical inability of around 30% of banks to work with digital currencies. Only 20% of banks signaled their readiness for launch. However, Russia is not going to reject its CBDC plans. On March 17, it was reported that the pilot testing will take place in the Tatarstan region of Russia in the second half of 2025.

42649636,https://finbold.com/?p=242278,1743350036,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,XRP’s 5-year pattern builds path to $6.5,https://finbold.com/xrps-5-year-pattern-builds-path-to-6-5/,"As XRP consolidates above $2 following a massive capital outflow on the weekly timeframe, the asset’s technical indicators suggest that historical patterns hint at a new record high. In this case, XRP is likely on the verge of a major breakout, following a pattern that closely resembles its 2020–2021 rally while trading in a five-year channel-up formation, according to analysis by Investing Scope , an independent signals and training provider, in a TradingView post on March 28. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView If history is any indication, XRP could surge toward $6.50, potentially by October 2025, a period that will coincide with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ( SEC ) decision on several XRP spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) applications. The analyst backed this outlook by pointing to several key technical indicators. For instance, XRP remains above its one-week moving average ( MA ) of 50, which has historically supported major uptrends. The Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 53 suggests a neutral stance but mirrors the structure seen before XRP’s rally in 2020. Meanwhile, the Average Directional Index (ADX) at 41.023 indicates a strong trend, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) at 0.310 remains in bullish territory, hinting at further upside potential. This setup is compelling because it resembles the March 2020 to April 2021 cycle, when XRP surged 1,648%. If history repeats, XRP could be on the verge of another parabolic move toward $6.50, aligning with the upper resistance of its long-term channel. Currently, the cryptocurrency is consolidating much like it did in March 2021, just before its last breakout. Investing Scope noted that the bullish thesis remains intact as long as XRP stays above the 1W MA50. If the pattern holds, the final leg of this cycle could deliver a major rally over the next year. XRP price grim short-term outlook Although the long-term technical outlook for XRP looks bullish, the near-term sentiment paints a grim picture for the asset. For instance, veteran trading expert Peter Brandt stated that XRP is staring at a possible crash toward the $1 mark. He observed that XRP is forming a complex Head & Shoulders pattern, a bearish reversal signal whose downside lies at $1.07 unless bulls reclaim $3. This formation indicates weakening momentum for XRP as bears seemingly overpower bulls. XRP price analysis chart.

In this line, data shared by prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on March 30 stated that whales offloaded 1.12 billion XRP in 48 hours. XRP whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts This move raises concerns about the cryptocurrency’s short-term outlook, as large-scale sell-offs often signal profit-taking or a shift in sentiment among major holders, potentially leading to increased volatility. Indeed, XRP is trading in line with general market momentum, with the assets witnessing notable capital outflows despite being backed by bullish sentiments. For XRP, the token is still struggling for stability despite receiving a major regulatory boost after the SEC took steps to drop the Ripple case entirely.

While major tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum struggle with resistance zones, others like Toncoin, Chainlink, Cardano, Dogecoin, Solana, and Remittix show signs of growing adoption and fresh momentum. The Market remains active, with traders watching for breakout levels and long-term holders staying patient. Meanwhile, Rollblock has raised an impressive $11.1 million in ICO funding. Here’s why these coins are worth watching in April Rollblock Momentum Builds as Presale Surpasses $11.1M Rollblock’s bullish momentum keeps growing , and it’s clear why. The platform has seen consistent growth in new users and monthly deposits, with presale inflows now crossing $11.1 million—and this is just the beginning. Offering over 7,000 games, including live poker, high-stakes blackjack, and a sports prediction league, Rollblock is quietly redefining Web3 gaming. Every transaction is secured on the Ethereum blockchain, bringing full transparency to an industry worth over $500 billion. Users can now deposit using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard, making onboarding seamless. Trust matters, and Rollblock is checking all the boxes. The platform holds a Gaming Anjouan license and has passed a smart contract audit by Solid Proof, adding credibility to its long-term plans. The deflationary tokenomics model adds more value, and 30% of revenue is used to buy back RBLK. 60% of those tokens are burned, and 40% are paid to stakers, offering returns as high as 30% APY. March Mayhem is in full swing . Investors who refer a friend earn a 30% RBLK bonus plus a 20% bonus on purchases. Stage 10 tokens are currently priced at $0.062, with another price jump on the horizon as Rollblock prepares for major exchange listings. Bitcoin Faces Resistance Despite ETF Inflows Bitcoin is trading at $83,650after a 3.78% drop in the past 24 hours. The $100K barrier remains untouched, with Bitcoin struggling to break through it over the last month. Nonetheless, there’s growing institutional interest. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $89 million in net inflows on March 28, marking the longest positive streak since December 2022. Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the $88,000 to $91,000 range as a major resistance zone. Until Bitcoin clears that level, Bitcoin’s upward momentum could stay limited despite continued buying from institutional players and long-term holders. Ethereum Drops Below Key Support Ahead of Pectra Upgrade Ethereum is trading at $1,880 after a 5.95% drop in the past 24 hours. The altcoin has lost more than 20% over the last month, falling from $2,200 to the $1,800 range. Attention is now turning to the Pectra upgrade, set for April 30 , which promises better Ethereum scalability, improved wallet features, and support for gas fees in multiple cryptocurrencies. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez notes that over 3 million investors bought 6.12 million Ethereum between $1,886 and $1,944—making this the most important support zone Ethereum must hold to avoid further downside. Solana Slips Below $130 as Key Support Level Nears Solana has dropped to $129, down 5% in the last 24 hours after briefly holding above the $140 support level. The decline comes as attention grows around Solana’s role in powering around-the-clock internet capital markets , including BlackRock’s tokenized treasury funds moving on-chain. Despite strong fundamentals, Solana’s price pressure is building. Analyst Ali Martinez highlights $125 as Solana’s most critical support zone. If it breaks below that level, further losses could follow. Solana’s momentum now hinges on holding that key range amid broader market volatility. Dogecoin Drops Below Key Support as Trading Expands Dogecoin is trading at $0.1805 after posting a 4.88% decrease in the past 24 hours, adding to a 10% slide over the last month. Despite the dip, Dogecoin adoption is expanding , with Interactive Brokers now offering Dogecoin trading—a significant step toward wider market access. The project also improves Dogecoin’s long-term stability, guided by input from key industry voices. Analyst Ali Martinez flagged $0.177 as the main support level and $0.207 as the resistance. These price zones will likely shape Dogecoin’s short-term direction. How the market reacts around these levels hinges on whether it experiences a strong bounce or a deeper drop. Remittix Solves Fiat Conversion Problem Converting tokens to fiat is often slow and complicated, with many users navigating clunky withdrawal systems. Remittix changes that by offering direct crypto-to-fiat conversion for seamless cross-border bank transfers—cutting out the wait and simplifying the process entirely. So far, Remittix has raised over $14.1 million during its presale, selling more than 522 million Remittix tokens which are currently selling at $0.0734 each. This strong backing gives Remittix the resources to expand its marketing, improve compliance tools, and form key partnerships as Remittix positions itself as a serious player in global crypto payments. Cardano Holds Key Level as Market Awaits Breakout Cardano is trading at $0.6988 after a 4.79% drop over the past day. Nevertheless, Cardano has remained positive, with a 7% increase in the last 30 days, showing some underlying strength. A recent Cardano listing on Interactive Brokers has improved accessibility, opening the door for more retail and institutional investors to enter the market. According to analyst Ali Martinez , Cardano is trading within a narrow channel. A breakout above $0.77 could trigger a bullish move, while a drop below $0.69 may lead to further losses. Cardano sits near the lower edge of that range, with traders watching closely. Chainlink Slips Below $15 as Whales Accumulate Chainlink is trading at $14.16 after a sharp 8.99% drop in the past 24 hours. Over the last 30 days, Chainlink has slipped just 4%, showing relative stability despite short-term volatility. Chainlink continues to grow its global presence, recently partnering with the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) to support the UAE’s financial sector through its decentralized oracle network. However, Ali Martinez reports that whales have accumulated 2.29 million Chainlink in the past 10 days. According to the analyst, a breakout above $15.50 could push Chainlink to $17 , though some resistance is expected. Toncoin Shows Strength but Faces Short-Term Cooldown Toncoin is trading at $3.92, down 2.06% in the last 24 hours but up 11% over the past 30 days. Despite broader market weakness, Toncoin has shown strong momentum. The network’s growth has been remarkable. Toncoin native accounts have jumped from 4 million to 41 million in just a year, signaling rapid adoption. According to the Toncoin Foundation, the project has over 121 million unique holders . However, analyst Ali Martinez warns that a short-term cooldown may be ahead as the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a sell signal on the daily chart, suggesting a possible Toncoin pullback.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $2,838.30 and a minimum price of $2,483.51. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $4,612.24 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

It lost 0.65% of its value in 24 hours. BNB coin faces the next resistance at $659.8. On 30 March 2025, Binance Coin price analysis revealed a bearish trend. Its value depreciated to $602.2 in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency lost 0.65% through the day. This created unfavorable circumstances for investors, as the cryptocurrency lost value rapidly. BNB/USDT price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day Binance Coin price chart analysis confirmed a declining market trend. Its value dropped to $602.2 in the past 24 hours. The decreasing volatility suggests a lower chance of a reversal in the price movements. The distance between the Bollinger bands determines volatility. This distance is shrinking, as market volatility decreases. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $659.8. Its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $566. BNB/USDT descends to $602.2 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator hovers in the neutral region. The indicator’s value depreciated to 46.14 during the day. This decreasing movement confirms an intensifying bearish swing. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph signifies rising selling pressure. BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Binance Coin confirmed a downward trend for the currency. Its value depreciated to $602 in the last four hours. Red candlesticks on the price chart reflect a growing bearish momentum. The Bollinger bands are widening, leading to an increase in volatility. This increase in volatility signals a higher market unpredictability. The upper Bollinger band has shifted to $645.6, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $591.3, securing the support. Binance Coin descends to $602 The RSI indicator is close to the oversold boundary. Its value reduced to $35.07 over the last four hours. This descent shows growing bearish activity within the market. The rising selling pressure signals an imbalanced trading setup for investors.

BNB/USD value has dropped down to $602.2 low in the last 24 hours. If observed from an overall perspective, the currency has lost up to 0.65% of value today. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to give out a negative verdict with respect to the market scenario. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,612.24 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price decreased over the last 24 hours towards the resistance at $659.8. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; However, the support floor at that level seems stable because the Bulls secured the level this week. In addition, the coin is still trading above the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,612.24 by 2031. Recent news/opinion on BNB Binance founder and ex-CEO CZ reshared his post stressing mental health. He said if the crypto dip is stressful for you, then you should reduce your positions for peace of mind. He was replying to a question by a user who goes by the BillionAirSon, asking him his views on present markets. If you got shaken out during the dip, reduce your size to a level you can handle.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB is trading near the psychological mark of $600.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-30 16:00:00

If it happens, early DOGE holders may have life-changing gains. But where Dogecoin’s rise might make a few hundred millionaires, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a much more volatile opportunity. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.025, its innovative tokenomics and lending utility could quite possibly take this token to over $1—creating thousands of millionaires among early adopters. Dogecoin’s Path to $3: A Narrow Window for Millionaires The 10% Dogecoin (DOGE) return re-ignited bullish predictions. Experts are speaking of historical cycles suggesting a possible 1,160% explosive push to the upside that may Dogecoin (DOGE) to well above $2.28. Reaching $3 for Dogecoin (DOGE) would then need to cross multiple resistance points, including the critical $0.21 level. Even in a successful case, only a tiny fraction of Dogecoin (DOGE)holders who purchased in the sub-$0.01 days would realize million-dollar returns. For many, the Dogecoin (DOGE) ship had long sailed. The volatility of the meme coin remains a double-edged sword. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) speculative hype based dependence could easily see it crash back to the $0.15 level. Also the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator gives a green signal for Dogecoin (DOGE) price momentum. The window for massive returns has almost closed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Presale That is Set To Make Mass Wealth If the upper bound of Dogecoin (DOGE) is restricted to its first whales, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a route to democratized generational wealth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is now in Phase 4 at $0.025 per token, with the next phase paying $0.03 — a huge 20% increase. The lending model of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on organic demand channeled through mtTokens, buy-back mechanisms and staking rewards. While Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has value primarily as a hype vehicle, the value MUTM has is based on real DeFi utility. Imagine the coinage of the “very rich” if instead of the current powered by thousands of higher priced tokens it for every dollar invested in coinage produced in terms of dollars orders of magnitude in value would create millionaires: that would get you 1D more millionaires than the value of a rally of lower pricing coins to 1 doge. The speedy pace of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale reflects FOMO among savvy investors. With 7,400 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders already secured, over $5.7 million has already been raised. When Phase 4 sells out, the cost increases to $0.03 per Mutuum Finance (MUTM), decreasing ROI for later investors. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is in the final stages of a Certik audit, which will further cement the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project’s security in the minds of investors and ignite yet another wave of demand. The Choice is Clear The opportunity for life-changing gains in the crypto market is narrowing, and investors must act decisively. While Dogecoin’s potential $3 surge could reward early adopters, its millionaire-making window is limited. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, presents a far more lucrative opportunity with its presale still at an accessible price of $0.025. With over 7,400 holders and $5.7 million raised, demand continues to rise as the project moves toward its next phase at $0.03. As the Certik audit nears completion, investor confidence is expected to soar even higher. Secure your MUTM tokens today before prices climb, and position yourself for DeFi’s next wave of wealth creation.

Cha Gyu-geun of the Rebuilding Korea Party, South Korea’s cryptocurrency investors reached 16.29 million as of February. This figure represents nearly 32% of the country’s population. The data, compiled from accounts at the country’s top five domestic virtual asset exchanges – Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax – shows consistent growth throughout 2024. The number of crypto investors first surpassed 14 million in March 2024. Following Donald Trump’s election as U.S. President in November, another 500,000 people entered the market, pushing the total beyond 15 million. Industry experts are projecting continued expansion, with some anticipating that the number of cryptocurrency investors will reach 20 million soon. “Some believe the crypto market has reached a saturation point, but there is still an endless possibility for growth compared with the matured stock market,” an industry official told The Korea Herald .

Of 2,047 officials who filed declarations, 411 disclosed direct cryptocurrency holdings or investments. These crypto-holding officials include high-ranking government representatives such as the Secretary General of the Labor-Management Development Foundation, the President of the Korean National Police University, and the Vice President of the Korea Water Resources Corporation. The total value of cryptocurrency assets declared by these officials amounts to 14.41 billion Korean won (approximately $9.8 million), with an average holding of 35.07 million won ($23,927) per official. Seoul City Councilor Kim Hye-young reported the largest cryptocurrency holdings. According to the Government Public Ethics Committee’s publicly disclosed report of personal assets held by the country’s public officials as of 2025, his assets were valued at 1.7 billion KRW. The notable cryptocurrency adoption among government officials potentially shows a more understanding regulatory approach, although South Korea has implemented strict regulations on cryptocurrency trading in recent years. This includes a mandatory real-name verification for exchange accounts and comprehensive anti-money laundering provisions.

But far out in Silicon Valley, Kraken is making waves. Kraken Is a Secure US Crypto Exchange California State University philosophy major Jesse Powell founded Kraken in 2011. After consulting for Mt. Gox, he decided the new Bitcoin sector would need a more secure solution. Mt. Gox famously crashed and burned after a 2014 hack stole 650,000 BTC. Today, the value of the stolen bitcoin has grown to $56 billion. But under the leadership of Powell, who stepped down as CEO a few years ago, Kraken developed a reputation for being a secure platform to trade cryptocurrencies and leave them in third-party custody. “The original ideal was to get Bitcoin to the world, and we’ve achieved a lot of that, opening access to people who have been unbanked by the formal financial system,” Powell said recently . Coinbase Is Popular With Investors Founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong, a former Airbnb engineer, Coinbase leapfrogged Kraken. Today, it is the most popular crypto exchange in the US, and its stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest swiped $9.3 million worth of Coinbase stocks at a discount when markets flipped this Feb. Just like the tech-focused hedge fund did last August when markets wigged out. And, in June 2023. So, Coinbase has been a popular favorite among blockchain sector investors for some time. These recent Kraken news updates, however, may be giving its competitors at Coinbase a run for their money. 1. Kraken to IPO in Q1 2026 The little purple monster is reportedly planning to go public with an IPO in quarter one of 2026. That’s according to a recent Bloomberg report. “We recently disclosed 2024 financial highlights to be more transparent about our business, which is something we started by being first to publish proof of reserves, and we’re going to continue to prioritize going forward. We’ll pursue public markets as it makes sense for our clients, our partners and shareholders.” After the report set off a media buzz among crypto news outlets, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi tried to calm the rumors, clarifying to Axios that there isn’t a date set: “I think the way we think about it is that, if it’s in service to our clients to going public, building that trust as a currency, then we’ll think about doing it. So we’ll always be ready for it, but it may not be that we’ll have it on a specific date.” But, he did note that , “the overall regulatory environment, worldwide, not just in the United States, has become a lot more favorable.” The jump to regulated public markets has been brewing for years now. Back in 2021, Powell said the crypto exchange would be more apt to debut via IPO than a direct listing. Because direct listings issue no new shares and raise no new capital, an IPO could be a way for Kraken to swell the value of the equity on its books. An eventual Kraken IPO would be momentous for the blockchain sector. Crypto insights firm CoinGecko noted in February that Coinbase remains the only publicly traded crypto exchange. Wall Street. Source: CNBC 2. Kraken Explores $1B Debt Note With JPMorgan Meanwhile, Kraken’s finances are looking solid for an IPO stock market debut. The company is exploring a $1 billion corporate debt package with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. Yes, that JP Morgan, the US banking giant whose CEO just 15 months ago said only criminals have a use for Bitcoin. That’s a potentially big change in outlook from the private banking sector. Anonymous sources with knowledge of the proceeding told Bloomberg in late March that both giants had begun conversations with other banks and lenders to put together the massive loan a year or so before Kraken’s anticipated IPO. According to the report, the exchange has over 10 million users in 190 different countries, and it serves $207 billion in trading volume quarterly. If Kraken’s business is anything like Coinbase’s, it can count on future cash flows to float such a hefty loan. This February, Coinbase reported last year’s Q4 revenue of $2.3 billion. Some 60% of its quarterly revenue came from small fees to execute trades. 3. Futures Platform NinjaTrader Acquisition Today, I’m excited to announce @krakenfx ‘s agreement to acquire @NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion. This is about much more than adding another product—it’s a significant step toward our vision of building the most powerful, global platform for the future of finance. @realDonaldTrump … — Arjun Sethi (@arjunsethi) March 20, 2025 Kraken makes a giant quarterly haul of fees for its services, too. But it’s hoping to add to its cash rake with a $1.5 billion purchase of NinjaTrader announced on Mar. 20. In a press release, Kraken called the crypto futures contract brokerage the leading US retail futures trading platform. The unicorn-sized acquisition captures Ninja Trader’s CFTC-registered Futures Commission Merchant licenses, which allow Kraken to broker crypto futures and derivatives contracts in the US. Sethi explained the move fits into Kraken’s ambitions to build a crypto everything app: “This transaction is the first step in our vision of an institutional-grade trading platform where any asset can be traded, anytime.” Coinbase first offered retail crypto futures trading products to customers with Coinbase Advanced accounts in Nov. 2023. 4. SEC Agrees to Dismiss Kraken Lawsuit At the beginning of March, markets added Kraken to a spate of dropped lawsuits at the fearsome US Securities and Exchange Commission. An update on Kraken’s website read : “The SEC staff has agreed in principle to dismiss its lawsuit against Kraken with prejudice, with no admission of wrongdoing, no penalties paid and no changes to our business.” The update noted that the SEC’s previous policy of enforcement by hostility and haphazard lawsuits “undermined a nascent industry that repeatedly urged clear rules of the road.” Once implacable in its opposition to cryptocurrency companies, the SEC has decidedly flipped to a friendly policy under the new Trump Administration. That’s been great news for the industry and no small factor in the euphoric crypto market rally from last November through January. “This dismissal lifts that cloud of uncertainty,” Kraken said. “It reaffirms that businesses like Kraken, which prioritize compliance and consumer protection, should not be subject to arbitrary legal battles.” 5. Kraken Relaunches Crypto Staking Beep, beep: By daily trading volume, Kraken is playing the little Nash Rambler to Coinbase’s Cadillac. Coinbase may have an order of magnitude more daily active users and weekly visits than Kraken in March, but the latter logs daily trading volume a little over a third of its younger competitor. That’s according to the most recent crypto spot exchange data from CoinMarketCap. Many are there to trade altcoins in the expectation of turning profits by arbitraging inefficiencies in these novel Internet currency markets. After Kraken relaunched crypto staking in Q1 this year, its users can also stake their coins, which use a proof-of-stake mechanism to lock in value and earn staking fees from their network. It’s a potentially very lucrative business for Kraken to operate. For comparison, in March, Coinbase held nearly 12% of all staked ETH on Ethereum’s network.

They are famous individuals such as the Secretary General of the Labor-Management Development Foundation and the Vice President of the Korea Water Resources Corporation. Their total holdings are 14.41 billion KRW (approximately $9.8 million), on average 35.07 million KRW ($23,927) per official. Seoul City Councilor Kim Hye-young revealed the biggest crypto holdings, which have a total of 1.7 billion KRW, according to the 2025 Government Public Ethics Committee report. Policy Implications of Growing Adoption The growing crypto involvement of citizens and government officials may form a more sophisticated regulatory strategy in South Korea. Despite the country’s stringent legislation—such as obligatory real-name authentication and strict anti-money laundering regulations—increasing individual involvement by regulators in the cryptocurrency market can shape future policy.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-03-30 16:06:03

Its presale period already collected in excess of $14.2 million and sold more than 523 million tokens, while the token value was at $0.0734. These tremendous gains bring RTX to center stage as a viable in-the-wild offering versus yet another crypto token for speculators. Gains of 50x or more are now being forecast by experts, making Remittix a solid contender among and perhaps leading over mature brands like Avalanche, Litecoin and Hyperliquid. Remittix attracts investors because it addresses age-old inefficiencies in global remittances. Traditional banking infrastructure have usually had high prices and long payment periods, particularly when it comes to cross-border money remittances. Remittix bypasses all of this by efficiently interweaving crypto and fiat without any hassles. It saves customers considerable time and money compared to conventional financial routes, according to a recent payfi solutions guide that notes Remittix's novel technology makes it stand out in a crowded marketplace. Remittix Surges With Real-World Utility Remittix's value proposition is its frictionless PayFi protocol, which marries blockchain characteristics with traditional financial rails. The two-sided nature allows users to exchange digital assets for fiat and bank directly into bank accounts, all in a single transaction. Market analysts call a comprehensive review of top 2025 presales one that proves Remittix can beat out most others by providing real use cases. Still another industry report cites that this payment focus has driven RTX's strong momentum, driving investor enthusiasm. A small business in Latin America can receive crypto from overseas customers and settle it in local currency in a matter of hours without paying through the nose in cross-border fees. Likewise, an overseas student studying abroad can receive tuition paid to him or her instantaneously without involving several go-betweens. Why Remittix Tops Avalanche Avalanche (AVAX) saw occasional rally, with some analysts expecting additional gains if key resistance levels were broken. AVAX's prospects are unclear based on its dependence on network speed improvements and aggregate DeFi utilization, however, according to a recent DeFi market report . While Avalanche's technology is fantastic, most investors are worried that layer-one network competition will constrain its long-term potential. Source: TradingView Remittix, though, is addressing a fundamental world pain point: high-fee cross-border remittances. A top blockchain comparison report indicates that addressing real-world problems, such as remittances, appeals more to mainstream users than technical innovation. Thus, Remittixhas established a niche that is focused on everyday transactions rather than the more esoteric objectives of the majority of layer-one networks, providing a definitive route to mass adoption. Litecoin's Slump vs. Remittix's Ascendancy Litecoin (LTC) has traditionally been defined as Bitcoin's quicker brother, but current market activity presents a bleak picture of decline. Analysts citing a crypto media review indicate that LTC cannot recapture old highs because demand for clean payment coins remains low. Old name however Litecoin is, it does not have the bespoke cross-border architecture Remittix has to offer. Remittix's growing profile is a result of bridging the gap between the world of traditional finance and blockchain seamlessly, making it easy for regular consumers to board. According to a massive presale prediction , Remittix can surpass legacy assets such as LTC if it continues to grow partnerships with remittance providers and businesses. Hyperliquid's Challenges & The Remittix Edge Hyperliquid (HYPE) made headlines as a high-performance decentralized exchange solution with fast transaction times and advanced trading features. But regulatory headwinds and ""liquidation games"" accusations are cited by some analysts, says a comprehensive exchange guide . Those scandals point to the platform's emphasis on leveraged trading, which may scare away risk-averse investors concerned with market manipulation or impending crypto regulations. HYPE/USDT Chart Remittix, by contrast, is more mass-market-oriented. As a result of a recent security audit report , RTX's audited smart contracts and open book transaction model are attractive to individual and institutional stakeholders. Its payment-focused core enabling quick crypto-to-fiat exchanges sidesteps most of the controversy associated with futures or margin trading. Platforms that specialize only in yield farming or trading are bound to experience speculative crashes and bubbles. Remittix is not: it seeks to optimize the very forces of world finance, with the potential to disrupt remittances in emerging markets and beyond. If you're looking for a cryptocurrency that combines solid fundamentals, real user value and huge upside, Remittixmight be the solution. Its presale hype and 50x returns potential make it one of the most sought-after projects in 2025. Come with us into a world where cross-border payments are quicker, cheaper and more convenient: think about investing in Remittix while the door of opportunity is still wide open.
