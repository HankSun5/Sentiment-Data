These support levels might indicate future price movements. Analyzing such patterns can help in predicting which coins hold potential for growth. Curious which ones are gearing up for a surge? Dive into the details and uncover the mid-term outlook. Stacks (STX) Endures Volatility While Key Levels Signal Trading Zones Past month performance saw STX drop nearly 20%, while the six-month decline reached around 67.5%. The coin experienced short-term rebound moves with a 3.08% one-week gain, yet the overall trajectory remains down. Price swings have kept the asset volatile, echoing a pattern of sharp corrections amid sporadic rallies. Technical measures reflect uncertainty, with indicators suggesting a cautious outlook despite brief upward spurts. Current pricing rests between $0.5774 and $1.2145, with support observed near $0.32 and resistance at $1.60, and a secondary ceiling at $2.24. Bears currently hold sway, and the market shows no clear trend. Traders may consider buying nearer support levels, while closely watching resistance for potential breakouts. Injective Analysis: Steep Decline with Support at $6.43 and Resistance near $24.03 Injective recorded a one-week drop of 6.47%, a one-month decline of 30.12%, and a six-month plunge of 61.03%. Price levels ranged between $9.87 and $18.68, showing a clear downward move over time. Data reflects persistent selling pressure and an overall bearish past performance, marking a significant price correction. Current price sits between $9.87 and $18.68 with immediate support around $6.43 and resistance close to $24.03, plus additional resistance at $32.83. Oscillators and momentum indicators are in negative territory, suggesting bears dominate the market with no clear recovery trend apparent. Trading strategies could focus on taking short positions when prices near the resistance levels and watching for any break above to indicate a change in sentiment. JasmyCoin: Key Levels and Market Sentiment in Focus Trading over the past month showed significant losses of around 40%, with a decline of over 50% in the last six months. This indicates a prolonged period of downward movement and mounting weakness in price action. The persistent losses highlight increased risk for traders, emphasizing the need for caution in current market conditions. The current price is fluctuating within a range from approximately $0.012 to $0.030, with immediate support at around $0.005 dollars and resistance near $0.041 dollars. Bears are currently in control, as technical indicators suggest a downward momentum, and there is no clear trend developing. Traders may look for potential bounces at support or breaks above resistance for potential trading opportunities while remaining alert to market volatility. Conclusion STX has shown resilience around its key support levels and could see upward movement if these levels hold. INJ has potential for growth if it confirms a bounce back from its current support points. JASMY requires close observation as it tests its lower bound. Careful monitoring of these support levels will be crucial for understanding the potential price movements of STX, INJ, and JASMY in the mid-term.

The DeFi founder told Cointelegraph that the high transparency of onchain transactions presents a problem for companies that must conceal sensitive information , including trading strategies, payroll information, and business-to-business agreements. Shibtoshi said: ""The main concerns — regulatory uncertainty, privacy limitations, and complex user experience — are real, but solvable. Innovations in privacy-preserving protocols are making DeFi increasingly compatible with enterprise needs. Platforms like SilentSwap are a step in that direction."" Regulatory uncertainty continues to be one of the biggest problems for DeFi and is compounded by a fragmented approach across legal jurisdictions, which prevents institutional adoption, Shibtoshi added. ""Are DeFi tokens securities? What happens if a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) messes up — and who is responsible when it does? It is all still pretty unclear,"" the SilentSwap founder told Cointelegraph. Shibtoshi urged common sense regulations that encourage innovation and preserve the value propositions of decentralized finance, including self-custody, speed, and cost-effective transactions. The total value locked across the DeFi ecosystem has not yet returned to peak levels witnessed in 2021 and 2022. Source: DeFiLlama Related: Specialized purpose DEXs poised for growth in 2025 — Curve founder US Congress overturns archaic DeFi rule, but DeFi still in danger Both chambers of the United States Congress recently voted to overturn the highly unpopular DeFi broker rule requiring decentralized finance protocols and platforms to report customer transactions to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The US Senate repealed the IRS broker rule in a 70 to 27 vote on March 4, followed by members of the US House of Representatives voting to repeal the IRS rule on March 11. Despite the repeal of the archaic rule, overregulation may end up killing a sector that was born as a decentralized, more accessible, and pseudonymous alternative to traditional finance. According to crypto entrepreneur and investor Artem Tolkachev, regulatory compliance is undermining decentralization in DeFi and destroying the value proposition of the nascent sector. The emphasis on regulatory compliance measures increases the potential for censorship and shifts control from the users to third-party intermediaries and large institutions, Tolkachev wrote.

This Hot Presale Is Here—Grab Your Chance to Ride the Next Best Performing Crypto!,https://thecoinrise.com/wishing-you-had-bought-gala-earlier-this-hot-presale-is-here-grab-your-chance-to-ride-the-next-best-performing-crypto/,"Remember when you brushed off Gala Games, thinking it was just another gaming token? And now it’s everywhere—from NFT gaming to massive partnerships—and those early supporters are living large while you’re stuck wishing you’d paid more attention. That’s the thing about crypto: you never realize what you’ve missed until it’s way out of reach. The best performing crypto doesn’t announce itself with a billboard—it shows up quietly, gets picked up by the sharpest minds, and explodes before the masses even understand what it is. If you’re reading this, you’ve got one job: don’t let history repeat itself. Because here comes Qubetics ($TICS)—a name that’s showing all the right signals of becoming the best performing crypto of 2025. Unlike other projects still figuring out their purpose, Qubetics already has a working roadmap, utility-driven applications, and a community that’s growing by the hour. And the Qubetics presale? It’s not just alive—it’s heating up with momentum you can’t ignore. There’s urgency here because every new stage gets pricier. This isn’t just about buying early. It’s about buying smart. If Gala was your missed ticket to wealth, Qubetics could be your redemption arc. You Missed the Early Qubetics Deals—But This Best Performing Crypto Still Has Room to Run Qubetics early supporters who joined its whitelist had the chance to secure $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. Qubetics started its journey on September 29, 2024, and you’ve already missed so many juicy presale stages where prices were ridiculously low. But here’s the good news: Stage 27 is still live, and the current price is $0.1300. With every stage lasting only seven days and a 10% price bump waiting at the next one, this is your last chance to buy in at a low rate before Stage 28 hits. With over $15.5 million already raised, more than 504 million tokens sold, and 23,900+ holders in the community, Qubetics is already acting like the best performing crypto—before even going live. Now let’s break down the numbers that matter. If you invest $2,000 at the current presale price, you’ll receive 15,380 tokens. When $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that’s $15,380 in your pocket—a 669% ROI. If it climbs to $5, that $2K turns into $76,900. At $6, you’re looking at $92,280. If it reaches $10 or $15 after mainnet, that same $2,000 investment becomes $153,800 or even $230,700. These are real projections, backed by the current momentum. That’s why people can’t stop calling it the best performing crypto in the making. And yes, the Qubetics presale is still open for now—but it won’t be for long. Now, what’s backing all this hype? The Qubetics application is no gimmick. It’s a cutting-edge Cross-Border Transaction solution for institutions, businesses, and individuals. For example, say you’re a global logistics firm needing to send high-volume payments to suppliers in other countries. Traditional methods? Expensive, slow, and filled with paperwork. Qubetics changes that. It enables near-instant payments via $TICS tokens with full transparency and zero middlemen. That means lower fees, faster settlement, and streamlined operations—game-changer for any global business. On a smaller scale, imagine you’re a freelancer in the Philippines working for a tech client in Germany. With Qubetics, you’re getting paid in minutes, not days, with none of the usual remittance fees. The wallet’s transparency helps both parties track and confirm transactions with zero stress. Whether you’re a growing company or an individual navigating global payments, Qubetics gives you the speed, control, and cost-efficiency you’ve been wishing for. No wonder it’s getting tagged as the best crypto presale of the year. Gala Was Slept On Too—And Now It’s Among the Best Performing Crypto Projects Gala Games had one of the most overlooked starts in crypto history. Its ICO price? A microscopic $0.0002. But while many dismissed it as just another gaming token, a few visionaries grabbed early access—and they’re the ones sitting on six-figure bags today. Gala’s rise wasn’t overnight, but once it started rolling out Web3 games, NFTs, and partnerships with big players, it blew up. By the time people caught on, it was already among the best performing crypto assets of its niche. Missed that? Yeah, a lot of people did. Since launch, Gala has built an ecosystem that spans entertainment, gaming, and DeFi—building utility where others just push hype. But the real takeaway here isn’t about Gala’s present; it’s about its past. Gala’s story is a blueprint: undervalued start, utility-focused growth, massive returns. It’s a reminder that the next best performing crypto doesn’t always look like a winner right out the gate. Just like Gala, Qubetics is in its early innings—but this time, you know better than to ignore it. Last Chance to Catch the Next Best Performing Crypto Before It Breaks Out The crypto space doesn’t give second chances often, but right now—it’s doing exactly that. Qubetics is sitting in a golden moment: presale open, price still affordable, and an ecosystem that’s already got serious real-world relevance. All the signs are here that this could be the next best performing crypto to dominate headlines. You’ve already watched Gala go from zero to legend—one of the best performing crypto stories of its time. Don’t let another opportunity slide past you while you’re stuck watching it unfold from the sidelines. Time is tight, and the window is closing. With the Qubetics presale still live and the price set to rise again soon, this is your shot to make a move before things go next-level. Every $TICS token bought today could be your bragging rights tomorrow. So if you’re serious about positioning yourself for the next breakout project—join this crypto presale now. Because missing out again? That’s not part of your 2025 success story.

Yotta Technologies is accusing Evolve Bank & Trust of fraud, conspiracy, and negligence. Yotta offered a high-yield savings product, depositing customer money with Evolve for safekeeping. But in May 2024, after Evolve’s fintech partner Synapse filed for bankruptcy, 85,000 Yotta customers lost access to $112 million in savings. Yotta claims Evolve quietly executed over $25 million in unauthorized and hidden transactions, taking the funds from Yotta customers’ accounts, including direct transfers to Synapse. Yotta says this violated banking rules and customer trust and contributed to an overall shortfall of $65 to 95 million. “Yotta’s investigation indicates that Evolve and Synapse conspired to simply take it, in violation of responsible banking practices and basic morality… These transactions were never authorized by customers. Evolve had no right to take this money from customers and never informed Yotta or its customers that it was doing so.” Evolve blames Synapse for the mess, saying Synapse gave inaccurate account data. Evolve has started repaying some customers, with about $11 million of $59 million owed to 13,300 respondents paid out for about 18 cents per dollar.

The viral star, who had been in jail, mentioned that the reason he launched the token was because he had been knee deep in legal bills, with things looking like he had racked up legal fees. According to reports, Tiger King has been in jail for seven years but did not launch the token himself. Instead, the 62-year-old asked his lawyers to help him launch the “Official Tiger King” token off the ground. The token then began trading on Monday under the ticker name EXOTIC. Most celebrity tokens often end up as viral memes, dropping in value as soon as their viral moments fade. According to Tiger King, he hopes his token does not turn out that way, noting that he knows that most celebrity tokens hinge on people’s attention, which can fade, while also mentioning others that have been marred by allegations of insider trading. “I pray to god that they don’t rug it and ruin my reputation,” he said. “I’m hoping that people will see this is legit and it has a purpose.” Tiger King wants his meme coin to be big While celebrity tokens are not new in the crypto industry, the tokens reached a new point last year after several stars, including Caitlyn Jenner, Cardi B, and Jason Derulo, stepped into the space. One of the most controversial projects was the Hawk Tuah token under the ticker name, HAWK. The token was brought to life following the viral moment in an interview featuring Hailey Welch, who is now known as the Hawk Tuah girl. Tiger King’s token EXOTIC was created on a little-known launchpad called pumpkin.fun, with the market cap of the meme coin rising to about $900,000 before falling to rest at over $100,000. According to Blockchain data, the meme coin currently has about 900 users holding the token. Tiger King initially mentioned that the proceeds from the token will also benefit children, noting that donations will be made to a nonprofit called Operation Smile. this right here too. Dont forget all of this. You wont find a more honest celebrity coin. Track the wallets, they are all on https://t.co/NoBlv57TF8 . When @realDonaldTrump pardons me, imagine the market cap then If you heard me on spaces last night, we are just starting. Its… https://t.co/moNCRG63pl — Joe Exotic (@joe_exotic) March 28, 2025 However, the token’s website does not reference the project’s goal of contributing to Operation Smile. Instead, it says some of the tokens will be donated to a foundation supporting Tigers or animal health after he is released from prison. On Friday, Tiger King’s X account mentioned that it had already donated $1,000 to the nonprofit. He mentioned that his lawyers supported his idea to launch the token as a show of commitment to his charitable work. He noted that it is the reason he wants to be free, mentioning that he just sits in prison watching people do drugs all day. Joe Exotic begs President Trump for a pardon Tiger King is currently being held at FMC Forth Worth, an administrative security center, according to the United States Bureau of Prisons. He uses the telephone to connect with the outside world at intervals, keeping his fans up-to-date via podcasts and X Spaces. He mentioned that even though his real-world experience with crypto is limited, he has been able to learn a lot, even from other inmates at the security center. “There’s not a lot to do all day besides sit and talk to people who know shit,” he said. “I do a lot from here, but I don’t even know how to set up a wallet.” He was resentenced to 21 years in federal prison in 2021, according to a post by Associated Press . He was convicted of the murder-for-hire scheme against animal welfare activist Carole Baskin, killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs, and falsifying wildlife records. He has continued to maintain his innocence while urging United States President Donald Trump for a pardon. He mentioned that someone launched an unofficial meme coin called Tiger King Coin in 2021 and was meant to give him 1% of the entire supply of the meme coin, but he never found out the person behind the project. He noted that he fears that the token may influence what people will think about his new token. Exotic hopes that he can use his meme coin as an initiative that benefits children and other people in the future. “People really need to invest in it,” he said. “I would like to be able to get it up there to where I can fix 500 kids’ [faces] and pay my lawyer bills.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

As Bitcoin corrects from recent highs, a crypto analyst expects a rebound to come next. However, if key support fails, the possibility of further downside remains. Bitcoin To Drop To CME Gap Close Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster this year, skyrocketing to new ATHs and experiencing major price breakdowns that pushed it to new lows. Recently the cryptocurrency saw a surge toward $89,000 but faced a rejection. Now the top crypto is pulling back again, with crypto analyst Astronomer on X (formerly Twitter) pinpointing the $83,000 – $84,000 low range as its next critical support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Face $14 Billion Options Expiry—Market Impact Ahead? This crucial support zone in the price chart aligns with the CME gap close, a common phenomenon in the BTC Futures market. BTC revisits price gaps left when the CME price closes over the weekend and opens on Sundays. Astronomer has outlined his long-term trading plan for Bitcoin, expecting the cryptocurrency to consolidate around the support level before bouncing. He believes that the CME gap close is a significant technical development that could determine Bitcoin’s price movements. Supporting the expectations of a short-term pullback, historically, a bearish close on Friday often leads to red Mondays or Tuesdays for Bitcoin. Moreover, the analyst highlights that the market is still in the pre-New York Open (NYO) phase, leaving room for an intraday reversal. However, he anticipates a late-night drop during the NYO trading session due to the lack of liquidations and untested support levels. He also mentions that combined with these factors, Bitcoin’s recent pullback from $89,000 is a strong indication that its price may not be bullish locally. Based on his Bitcoin price chart, Astronomer considers the $81,400 – $82,400 range the worst-case support zone. Bitcoin is expected to revisit this target zone before any attempt at a potential reversal. Can Bitcoin Rebound? Take Profit Levels To Watch While Bitcoin’s short-term price action appears bearish, its macro trend remains somewhat stable, according to Astronomer’s analysis. The analyst has marked a “long entry” zone in the chart, suggesting that the $83,000 – $84,000 zone was a potential buying opportunity if Bitcoin finds support there. Related Reading: Pi Coin Sinks 47% In 14 Days—What’s Behind The Massive Drop? The analyst predicts that if Bitcoin can successfully hold the CME gap close, a bounce toward the weekly open price at $86,000 could be its first step toward a much-anticipated recovery. Beyond this, the analyst has pinpointed key take profit levels marked from TP1 – TP4 on the price chart. These levels suggest that Bitcoin could surge higher to reach a target of $87,000 – $88,000. However, a break below the worst-case support zone could trigger a bearish shift in sentiment, potentially leading to a deeper price correction for Bitcoin.

Kalshi prediction market files lawsuits against gaming commissions in two US states Kalshi, the onchain prediction market, has filed a lawsuit against gaming regulators in the US states of Nevada and New Jersey after both states sent cease and desist orders for Kalshi to pause its sports event contracts. Additionally, the Nevada Gaming Control Board issued a cease and desist order for Kalshi's election event contracts. The contracts gained popularity during the 2024 elections in the United States.

Source: Kalshi The platform's team argued that Kalshi's event contracts, which are two-sided markets trading through swaps, are distinct from sports betting or other types of gambling that rely on the book method controlled by a gaming house. Moreover, Kalshi contends that state-level regulators have no legal jurisdiction over the platform, which is regulated by the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). $1 trillion stablecoin supply could drive next crypto rally — CoinFund’s Pakman The global stablecoin supply could surge to $1 trillion by the end of 2025, potentially becoming a key catalyst for broader cryptocurrency market growth , according to David Pakman, managing partner at crypto-native investment firm CoinFund. “We’re in a stablecoin adoption upswell that’s likely to increase dramatically this year,” Pakman said during Cointelegraph’s Chainreaction live show on X on March 27. “We could go from $225 billion stablecoins to $1 trillion just this calendar year.” He noted that such growth, while modest compared to global financial markets, would represent a “meaningfully significant” shift for blockchain-based finance. Pakman also suggested that the rise in capital flowing onchain, combined with growing interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), could further support decentralized finance (DeFi) activity: “If we have a moment this year where ETFs are permitted to provide staking rewards or yield to holders, that unlocks really meaningful uplift in DeFi activity, broadly defined.” Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETP ‘key’ for EU adoption despite low inflow expectations The aggregate stablecoin supply stood at an all-time high of above $208 billion across the five largest stablecoins on March 28, according to Glassnode data.

The growing stablecoin supply recently surpassed $219 billion and continues to rise, suggesting that the market is “likely still mid-cycle” as opposed to the top of the bull run, according to IntoTheBlock analysts. Elon Musk’s sale of X to xAI just made fraud lawsuit “a lot spicer” Billionaire investor Elon Musk has sold his social media platform X to his AI startup xAI, sparking controversy as it coincides with a US judge rejecting his bid to dismiss a lawsuit tied to the social media platform. The transfer of ownership of X to xAI on March 28 means that the class-action lawsuit against Musk — accusing him of defrauding former Twitter shareholders by delaying the disclosure of his initial investment in the social media platform — has become “a whole lot spicer,” Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran said in a March 28 X post. Source: Grok On the same day that Musk said “xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” a US judge reportedly rejected Musk’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit. Cochran said it has “opened up his AI entity to exposure here too, and it’s a much bigger pie.” Musk said the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, factoring in $12 billion in debt from the $45 billion valuation. He originally bought X, formerly Twitter, for around $44 billion in April 2022 .",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|BCH|ETH|USDT|XRP|MATIC|ZK|ADA|TON|BNB|WLD|SOL|APT|ARB|AVAX|LINK|ASIA|MINING|USDC|FIAT|ARKM|BUSINESS|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-29 21:32:15

Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran noted in a post that the class action lawsuit against Elon Musk, which accuses him of defrauding former Twitter shareholders by delaying disclosure of the initial investment, is now much more heated. The acquisition could increase ”risks” for xAI When Musk announced that ”xAI acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” a U.S. judge rejected Musk's attempt to halt the lawsuit. Cochran emphasized that this ”opened up his AI company to additional risks, with a much larger scale now involved.” Musk said the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, taking into account $12 billion in debt from an initial valuation of $45 billion. He originally bought X, formerly known as Twitter, for about $44 billion in April 2022. ”The future of xAI and X are tightly intertwined, and today we are officially taking a step toward combining data, models, computing power, distribution systems and talent,” Musk said. ”This merger will unlock tremendous potential by combining the advanced artificial intelligence capabilities and expertise of xAI with the massive reach of X,” he added. ”It will allow us to create a platform that doesn't just reflect the world, but actively accelerates human progress.” However, Cochran claims that ”Musk used xAI's artificially inflated stock price to pay several times the real value for X, yet record an $11 billion loss on the deal.” He said Musk was ”defrauding xAI and X investors” and the deal was done to sell xAI's user data. xAI is known for its chat bot ”Grok” integrated into the X platform. When Musk launched it in November 2023, he claimed that the bot outperformed the first version of OpenAI's ChatGPT on several academic tests. Musk explained that the motivation for creating Grok was to develop artificial intelligence tools that would help humanity by supporting research and innovation. While Cochran called Grok's $80 billion valuation ”incredibly stupid,” the cryptocurrency developer known as ”Keef” disagrees. ”The whole situation looks questionable, but given the current moment, Grok is probably really the best model for various tasks,” he said. The issue of social network X being acquired by startup xAI raises serious questions about Musk's corporate strategy and potential legal implications. The merger of these companies could lead to significant changes in the development of artificial intelligence and social media in the near future.",News|Business,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|RESEARCH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-29 21:47:48

While the crypto market is diving into an extensive search for hidden gems, another project is overshadowing the established leaders with the massively accelerated momentum and structured growth model. Chainlink Milestone Meets Modest Momentum Chainlink (LINK) Received an Oracle: First 20 Trillion Transactions. The number of daily active addresses reached multi-year highs, and exchange outflows showed that $4.5 million in LINK was moved to private wallets by investors demonstrating confidence. Despite those metrics however, LINK’s price action has been sluggish, rallying a mere 1% in the past week. Analysts see an ascending triangle pattern that indicates a possible run to $17.67, although immediate resistance at $15.45 and $16.42 may impede progress. But slow, steady price growth makes you question the near-term upside relative to tokens that are in their infancy. Hedera Flicks a Hope Amid The Bearish Reality Hedera (HBAR) gained 5% at one point, bringing it close to $0.20, as short-term moving averages suggested an imminent bullish crossover. Nonetheless, BBTrend continues to stay glued to -1.85, indicative of continued selling pressure. A tentative break above the Tenkan-sen line proved encouraging, yet HBAR finds itself under pressure at the lip of the Ichimoku Cloud — a ceiling that has blocked all recovery efforts since March. If the momentum should fade support at $0.184 could break once more, sparking fresh fears of a continued fall below $0.17. With such meagerness of bullish signs, token which once touted enterprise-grade for its accoutrements from blockchain, seems to have little in way of prospects in anything approaching the short term. Mutuum Finance is Gaining Significant Momentum in its Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in its fourth stage of 11-stage presale, with the tokens being claimed at $0.025 each. Investors are rushing to secure positions ahead of a 20% price jump to $0.03 in Phase 5. The project’s $5.7 million fundraising haul and 7,400-strong holder base reflect surging demand for its decentralized lending model. Such a self-sustaining ecosystem is rarely seen in speculative-driven markets, enabled instead by organic buy pressure from revenue-distributed token buybacks and mtTokens—interest-accruing deposit certificates. Existing presale participants could potentially earn a 140% return at launch, as MUTM will list at $0.06. After launch projections are far more dramatic, though. Catalysts for a possible leap to $1.50 a 7,400% increase on current pricing include overcollateralized loans, peer-to-peer lending features and staking rewards, analysts said. This prediction matches the project’s intentional tokenomics: just 20% of supply goes to presale, while 35% powers liquidity mining for sustained long-term growth. Security and Scalability as The Core Priority Mutuum Finance is completing a smart contract audit with Certik, a step that should increase investors’ confidence. When finished, the audit findings will be published along official channels to counteract potential security fears seen in newer DeFi projects. Along with an overcollateralized stablecoin and dynamic interest rates, these measure put MUTM firmly in the teritory of being a usable substitute for traditional finance, and not simply an idle speculation. A New Challenger Rises As Chainlink and Hedera struggle with the lack of price action compared to their fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines urgency and utility. Its phased presale mechanism establishes scarcity, with each price climb reducing the window for low-entry profits. The project’s emphasis on providing real-world financial solutions — from liquidity provisioning to negotiated P2P loans — is in stark contrast to tokens that rely on nothing but market sentiment. In a saturated market, MUTM’s price point at $0.025 could soon just be a distant memory for investors looking for asymmetric returns.

As digital currencies become easier to access, projects like Litecoin and MANTRA have shown how early planning and clear utility can build lasting relevance. Litecoin has relied on its simplicity and speed for over a decade, while MANTRA has climbed by tapping into DeFi and tokenized real-world assets. Now, BlockDAG is taking a step further. Its X1 mobile miner and hybrid DAG + PoW approach are not just expanding its user base—they’re changing how people access and use crypto. Mining with a phone may be the key to broader adoption. Litecoin’s Ten-Year Track Record of Speed & Practicality Litecoin (LTC) was introduced on October 7, 2011, by Charlie Lee, a former engineer at Google. It was designed to be a lighter, faster version of Bitcoin, offering shorter transaction times and a larger supply. The first block was mined shortly after, on October 13, 2011. Since then, Litecoin has remained among the most valued cryptocurrencies by market cap. Take November 2013 as an example—Litecoin’s price doubled in just 24 hours. By early 2020, it crossed a $10 billion market cap, showing a 100% rise since August 2020. On March 24, 2025, Litecoin traded at $93.67 with a market cap of $7.14 billion. Technologically, Litecoin has often led the way. It adopted Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the Lightning Network before Bitcoin. These updates have helped it stay relevant in a fast-moving crypto space. MANTRA’s Quick Rise Through DeFi & Real-World Assets MANTRA (OM) was first developed in late 2019 and officially launched in early 2021 by founders John Patrick Mullin, Will Corkin, and Rodrigo Quan Miranda. It focuses on decentralized finance, offering tools for staking, lending, and governance. Its OM token has a total supply of 888,888,888 units. When OM launched in August 2020, it was priced around $0.3820. The price dipped to $0.0175 by October 2023, but things turned around dramatically. In February 2025, OM reached a record high of $8.53—an increase of over 15,000% in just a year. As of March 26, 2025, OM trades at $6.53 and holds a market cap of $6.44 billion. What’s powering this surge? MANTRA’s work in bringing real-world assets like real estate and clean energy onto the blockchain, along with its generous staking rewards. Its mainnet launch and key alliances have also added fuel to its growing popularity. BlockDAG X1 App Makes Crypto Mining Easier Than Ever BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has shifted the idea of crypto participation. Now, anyone with a smartphone can mine crypto without needing pricey equipment or deep technical knowledge. Over 800,000 users are already mining through the app, transforming ordinary phone users into active members of a global decentralized network. The secret lies in simplicity. The X1 app offers a straightforward setup, an intuitive interface, and real-time mining rewards. Instead of investing time and money into mining rigs, users only need a phone and a few minutes to get started. This easy access has helped fuel the explosive growth of BlockDAG’s presale, which has now raised $209 million. In batch 27, coins are priced at $0.0248—marking a 2,380% jump from batch 1. So far, over 19 billion coins have been sold, showing the strong backing behind the project and its growing community. By combining phone mining with a dual DAG + PoW consensus, BlockDAG has created a system where contributing to the network is both practical and encouraged. It’s not just attracting users—it’s changing how people think about Web3 participation. And it’s gaining traction. Shifting the Crypto Experience Litecoin built a strong foundation. MANTRA introduced real-world utility. But BlockDAG is changing how people get involved with crypto at a basic level. While Litecoin and MANTRA rely on steady communities and focused tools, BlockDAG removes entry barriers and welcomes anyone—no tech background needed. The X1 app allows smartphones to connect directly to a secure, high-speed network. It proves that making crypto easier to access can also drive real growth. As the industry evolves, the platforms that simplify user entry—without cutting corners on performance—won’t just succeed. They’ll shape what comes next.

Aave showcased this early on by launching a DeFi lending platform that users could immediately benefit from, while Cronos strengthened its presence through direct integration with the Crypto.com network. What made both gain traction was delivering functioning platforms from the start. Rather than wait until launch day, BlockDAG (BDAG) is giving the public full access to its Beta Testnet before the mainnet rollout. This move invites users to explore, test, and interact with its system at an early stage. In a market where working models speak louder than forecasts, BlockDAG’s testnet-first method gives people something real to evaluate. Aave: A Pioneer in DeFi Lending Solutions Since its launch in 2020, Aave has introduced a new way for people to lend and borrow digital assets without needing banks or middlemen. Its system allows users to earn from liquidity pools or take out loans directly using crypto assets. Over the years, Aave included features like flash loans, cross-chain support, and flexible collateral swaps, securing its spot as a DeFi leader. By mid-2024, it held over $11 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), showing strong and steady traction. The AAVE token—used in governance and staking—reached almost $400 in early 2025, partially fueled by major backers like World Liberty Financial. On March 26, 2025, AAVE traded at about $188.72, giving it a market cap near $2.85 billion. Those who joined the platform early have gained significantly, showing how Aave has kept pace in the evolving DeFi space. Cronos: Connecting DeFi with Crypto.com Users Launched in November 2021 by Crypto.com, Cronos (CRO) aimed to link centralized finance to decentralized networks. With its fast processing and low transaction fees, Cronos smoothly integrates Crypto.com’s tools with DeFi apps. Because of this, the network quickly rose among the top 10 chains by TVL, with over 1 million users and more than 500 dApps supported by early 2025. On March 26, 2025, CRO was priced around $0.105981, giving it a market valuation close to $2.82 billion. Looking forward, its 2025 forecast ranges from $0.070 to $0.2644, reflecting cautious hope from experts. Returns have been mixed—some gained from high points, while others faced market dips. Still, Cronos remains central to Crypto.com’s bigger aim of combining traditional and decentralized finance. BlockDAG’s Testnet Rollout Builds Real-Time Trust What makes BlockDAG’s testnet strategy different is how it’s focused on showing real results before anything else. While others talk about what’s coming, BlockDAG is already letting people use its features. With twice the speed of the alpha version, a simple no-code tool for creating NFTs and tokens, and working dApps already being tested by users, the Beta Testnet proves the system is fully active. This open testing approach is catching attention. BlockDAG has raised $209 million through its crypto presale , now in batch 27 at a rate of $0.0248. More than 19 billion coins have already been purchased, delivering a 2,380% return since batch 1. These numbers show people aren’t just interested—they’re participating. What also stands out is the weekly testnet BDAG coin vesting, which keeps users engaged and supports system testing under real-use scenarios. This model builds reliability through direct interaction, not just technical claims. Instead of waiting until everything is finished, BlockDAG has chosen to stay open from the start. Letting users explore its inner workings before the mainnet sets a new bar for what future blockchain projects can do to gain early credibility. Wrapping Up! Aave made its mark by providing real services. Cronos gained ground through its tight links with a popular platform. Both delivered usable solutions. BlockDAG is following the same core principle—early access instead of hype. Its public testnet is more than just a feature—it’s a message that showing working results matters more than future talk. Unlike others waiting until launch day, BlockDAG has made its system available for feedback and testing right now. That shows a focus on openness and responsibility—traits that often matter most in building long-term trust in this space.

While $TRUMP briefly surged due to a presidential endorsement, it quickly collapsed. Dragoin, on the other hand, has steadily grown, backed by a well-structured model with real utility, strong community involvement, and an incentivizing presale system. Although $TRUMP saw a temporary spike after Donald Trump called it “The Greatest of Them All,” the coin has since lost more than 75%. Meanwhile, Dragoin ($DDGN) is gaining momentum and is being recognized by many as the true meme coin of 2025. The $TRUMP Coin Saga: A Surge and Sudden Crash On March 22, 2025, Donald Trump’s post on Truth Social calling $TRUMP “The Greatest of Them All” caused the coin to surge by 12%, reaching a price of $5.67. However, the excitement was short-lived. What seemed like a meme coin miracle quickly became a textbook example of a pump-and-dump scheme. Within 48 hours of the endorsement, $TRUMP lost more than 40% of its value, leading to mass sell-offs and panic among investors. By this week, the coin has seen a 75% drop from its peak, leaving many traders holding a token that once seemed like a winning bet. The market cap, which briefly reached eight figures, has since retraced sharply. $TRUMP is now seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of influencer-backed meme coins. The problem with $TRUMP wasn’t the initial surge—it was the lack of any real utility. Meme coins rely on virality, but $TRUMP had no roadmap, no clear purpose, and no intrinsic value. Once the hype faded, investors were left without anything to hold on to. Enter Dragoin. Dragoin’s Success: Building for the Future Where $TRUMP faltered with a burst of hype, Dragoin ($DDGN) is carefully building for long-term success. Dragoin is more than just another meme coin—it’s a fully immersive experience with real-world engagement and rewards. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Dragoin features a play-to-earn game where users can hatch, train, and battle dragons through Telegram. A standout feature of Dragoin is its presale model. Instead of relying on chaotic hype, Dragoin has implemented a structured 25-stage presale. Each stage sees a gradual price increase, rewarding early buyers and ensuring steady price momentum. Half of Dragoin’s total token supply—200 billion tokens—is reserved for the presale, and any unsold tokens are permanently burned. This deflationary model not only prevents inflation but also creates scarcity, benefiting long-term holders. The presale has proven to be a key growth driver. As new buyers enter at different stages, the buzz around Dragoin builds organically. This grassroots momentum is fueling a committed user base that sees the value in the project and is engaged for the long haul, contributing to its ongoing success. Dragoin’s Real-World Utility and Community Focus Dragoin’s true value lies in its utility, which sets it apart from coins like $TRUMP that rely solely on celebrity endorsements. Dragoin offers users real ways to engage and earn rewards. Built on Telegram, the play-to-earn game allows players to hatch, train, and battle dragons, earning $DDGN tokens as they progress. This creates a dynamic ecosystem where users are actively involved, unlike static coins with no practical use. Beyond the game, Dragoin provides staking rewards, airdrops, referral bonuses, and, most importantly, full decentralization. Once launched, the smart contract will be renounced, putting control in the hands of the community rather than a centralized entity. This transparency and community-driven approach are attracting investors who are tired of meme coins that operate behind closed doors with little accountability. Dragoin’s roadmap is clear, with achievable milestones. In Q2 2025, the game will officially launch, accompanied by staking features and partnerships with key crypto influencers. By Q3, Dragoin aims to be listed on exchanges, introduce new gameplay mechanics, and host seasonal events and competitive tournaments to keep users engaged long-term. These aren’t empty promises—they are tangible actions already being executed. Dragoin is focused on long-term growth, not short-lived hype, making it a more sustainable and promising project compared to $TRUMP. Why Dragoin Beats $TRUMP The stark contrast between $TRUMP and Dragoin highlights how the meme coin market has evolved. In the past, coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu relied solely on social momentum. But in 2025, investors are becoming more discerning. After being burned by empty tokens, traders are seeking coins that offer engagement, mechanics, and lasting value. $TRUMP’s 75% drop proves what happens when a meme coin depends entirely on celebrity hype. Dragoin, on the other hand, is showing what happens when a meme coin has a solid foundation, a growing user base, and a clearly defined roadmap. With a deflationary supply, a thriving play-to-earn system, and a roadmap focused on transparency, Dragoin is reshaping the meme coin landscape. It’s proving that meme coins can be both fun and functional, viral and valuable. Most importantly, it’s showing that the title of “The Greatest of Them All” isn’t earned through a tweet—it’s earned through smart planning and real community participation.

A letter sent by the American embassy in Paris and other embassies around the European Union warns that Donald Trump’s order applies to firms outside the United States if they are suppliers or service providers to the federal government. The embassies also included a questionnaire titled “Certification regarding compliance with applicable federal anti-discrimination law.” This questionnaire instructs recipients to confirm they do not operate any programs that promote DEI in ways that violate anti-discrimination statutes. The document states, “Department of State contractors must certify that they do not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable anti-discrimination laws and agree that such certification is material for purposes of the government’s payment decision and therefore subject to the False Claims Act.” According to the same sources, the letter and questionnaire were dispatched by US diplomats in eastern EU states and Belgium. A senior banker in Paris expressed shock when he read the letter, saying, “It’s crazy . . . but everything is now possible. The rule of the strongest now prevails.” Several companies contacted the French finance ministry about the demand, prompting concern within the government. A person close to France’s economy minister Eric Lombard said, “This practice reflects the values of the new US government. They are not the same as ours. The ministry will remind his counterparts in the US government of that.” Les Échos newspaper first reported the letter’s existence. Some executives will not respond to the request Initial legal reviews suggest that the measure may not be legally enforceable outside the United States. Some executives and their legal teams have chosen not to answer the questionnaire for the time being. This strain has intensified as the United States shifts away from long-standing alliances, particularly over Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this week, Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on auto imports into the United States. He also raised tariffs on European steel and aluminum, prompting the EU to explore reciprocal tariffs. Europe has not yet decided which goods to target. Tensions between Washington and the EU escalated after the recent Signal chat leaks. Vice-President JD Vance wrote, “I just hate bailing Europe out again,” to which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth replied, “It’s PATHETIC.” France has historically not accepted DEI programs. That is because national laws restrict how racial and ethnic data can be collected. Employers are forbidden from using a person’s background when making hiring or promotion decisions. According to Les Échos, the US order said, “If you do not agree to sign this document, we would be grateful if you could kindly provide us with detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal department.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The company announced on Friday that it will launch an online claims portal on March 31. This will allow affected investors to file for compensation for the Terra collapse. Notably, the deadline for submission is April 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET, and late claims will not be accepted. Terraform Labs Unveils Eligibility Criteria The claims process is part of Terraform Labs’ bankruptcy plan and will be handled by Kroll, a third-party company. As announced, investors can submit claims through an official website but must prove they own the assets. Notably, the review may take longer if a claim is based on screenshots or manually uploaded documents. Claims could also be denied if the evidence is not strong enough. To qualify for compensation, investors must have owned specific cryptocurrencies from the Terra ecosystem at the time of the collapse. These assets are listed in the official case documents, and only those who meet the requirements will be considered. The payout will not include assets with less than $100 in liquidity and Terra 2.0’s Luna token. What Happens Next? After submission, claims will be reviewed and verified. Initial decisions will be shared within 90 days after the deadline. If a claim is approved, the investor will receive a share of the available funds. The amount must depend on the total number of approved claims and the money left for payouts. However, it is uncertain how much investors will recover or what percentage of their losses will be paid back. A Look Back at the Terra Collapse The Terra ecosystem collapsed in May 2022, wiping billions of investor funds. Luna’s market capitalization fell from $41 billion to $6 million in just three days, marking one of the worst crashes in crypto history. The TerraUSD stablecoin, which was designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar, lost its value and never recovered. The collapse also led to legal troubles for Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon . Kwon faced multiple lawsuits and regulatory investigations across different countries. The Terraform downfall led to many bankruptcies in the crypto sector, affecting companies exposed to Terra’s ecosystem. This claims process may be the last opportunity for investors who suffered losses to recover a portion of their funds.

Trump doubles down on tariffs despite warnings from economists and Wall Street Trump consistently disregards economic experts and has ignored pushback from congressional Republicans and Wall Street. He believes that aggressive tariffs are the best way to restore American manufacturing and boost federal coffers. His administration has already imposed tariffs on major industries. The move is a huge escalation of Trump’s under-the-radar trade war, which will likely affect U.S. economic policy for years. Advisers to the president are still deciding the exact nature of the tariffs, weighing their potential economic costs against Trump’s vision of a more self-sufficient American economy. Trump’s campaign to raise tariffs has already shaken financial markets. Earlier this week, his administration declared a 25% tariff on all automobile imports , panicking investors and plunging stock prices. Now, he is considering expanding tariffs similar to those of other parts of the economy, including pharmaceuticals and lumber. The market response has been immediate and negative. The three big U.S. stock indices dropped last Friday, and analysts pointed to the uncertainty of Trump’s widening trade war as a key driving force. Economists have cautioned that these retaliatory tariffs will discourage economic growth, inflate prices, and even lead the country into recession. Even Republican lawmakers traditionally bound by free-market orthodoxy have grown nervous. Stephen Moore, a longtime Trump ally and co-founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, said the emphasis on tariffs was eclipsing debate about tax policy. He said imposing tariffs was not the answer to saving manufacturing jobs. Trump pushes tariffs as a win-win strategy for the U.S Still, Trump remains confident that tariffs will bring economic benefits. He thinks they will compel U.S. trading partners to reduce their tariffs and encourage American firms to repatriate manufacturing. People close to Trump say he regrets listening to advisers who talked him out of higher tariffs during his first term. Now, he is determined to act on those instincts. He has revived the debate over a single, across-the-board import duty that would simplify the tariff system and thwart exemptions that could dilute its power. Tariffs are more than just a negotiating tool for Trump; they are a centrepiece​ of his economic policy. He has openly touted import taxes, which he called the “most beautiful” word in the dictionary. He even called for the declaration of April 2 as a day of national celebration, as he believes tariffs will change the economy. Among those allies was former White House strategist Steve Bannon, who pitched the idea. Rather than celebrating Trump’s birthday, Bannon said April 2 should be made “Liberation Day,” a national day of mourning for the lost jobs, skills, and trade he claimed had returned to America and its people. Trump has not been shy about levying tariffs, a position that has divided Republicans. While many in the party support using tariffs as a short-term negotiating tactic, Trump seems more enthusiastic about permanent trade obstacles that would remap the American economy. Trump’s former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, “Any number of options are still under consideration.” He said officials were looking at every option and working hard to make the idea of a reciprocal tariff popular with the American public and functional. However, some Republican lawmakers are uneasy about the long-term consequences. They worry that permanently adding tariffs could upend supply chains, raise consumer prices, and undermine critical industries that depend on worldwide commerce. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) acknowledged the risks and expressed a sense of unease. But he said that overall, many were still inclined to give the president the benefit of the doubt, given his past accomplishments. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) offered a slightly separate view, saying that he didn’t see tariffs as a means of adding to the bottom line but as a means of returning jobs to the U.S. economy. Tariffs disrupt farming and manufacturing industries The agricultural sector is closely monitoring Trump’s next moves. North Dakota farmers, for instance, were mostly insulated from earlier rounds of tariffs but feared the consequences of any further actions. During Trump’s first term, the administration provided $23 billion to farmers affected by the trade war with China. And some lawmakers have begun consultations with the Department of Agriculture on providing similar aid, should it be necessary. Manufacturers are nervous, too. Some believe tariffs could give them an edge by making foreign competition less affordable. In contrast, others worry they will need to raise prices or lay off workers because of higher import costs. The battle over Trump’s trade policy indicates a deep split in his political base. Some right-of-centre economists claim tariffs can be used to pressure other countries to drop trade barriers. Others have come to see them as a permanent solution sufficient to defend American industry. Nick Iacovella, the Coalition for a Prosperous America vice president, advocates permanent tariffs. He justifies using tariffs as a temporary bargaining chip, which contradicts Trump’s vision of reviving American manufacturing. His group has proposed a broad 18% tariff on virtually all products.

However, unlike the hype-driven tokens of past cycles, the leading meme coins this time around bring much more to the table. These tokens mix community engagement with practical utility, scarcity-driven economics, and well-thought-out long-term plans. Meme coins are no longer just jokes—they’re evolving into substantial ecosystems. Among the meme coins making waves for Q2, Dragoin ($DDGN) stands out. It’s not just another meme token but one of the most polished and well-structured projects in the space. While other contenders are still gaining traction, Dragoin’s presale success, utility, and decentralized framework have already set it apart. For those eyeing the next big thing this quarter, Dragoin is undoubtedly a project to watch, along with a few select others. Dragoin: The Meme Coin Set to Dominate Q2 Dragoin is far from your typical meme token with a cute mascot and a few flashy promises. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Dragoin offers something most meme coins lack—active, hands-on engagement. It features an interactive, play-to-earn game directly on Telegram, where players can hatch, train, and battle dragons, earning $DDGN tokens for in-game activity. This gamified approach sets Dragoin apart, turning passive holders into engaged participants. But the game is just the start. Dragoin’s presale is organized into 25 stages, each with a slightly higher price. This structure not only rewards early investors but generates ongoing momentum as each stage sells out. Of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens, 50% are allocated for the presale, and unsold tokens will be permanently burned, tightening the supply. This deflationary model is crucial. It ensures that supply continues to shrink over time as demand rises, especially when the game goes global in Q2. Unlike many meme coins that flood the market with tokens, Dragoin is deliberately reducing supply while fostering a loyal player base—two key factors that are likely to drive up long-term value. When the presale concludes, Dragoin will renounce ownership of its smart contract, making it a fully decentralized token. This transparency, coupled with the absence of any central authority, ensures there will be no rug pulls—just a community-governed token with a sustainable economy. This level of integrity is rare in the meme coin space and has already garnered attention from seasoned traders who are wary of influencer-led projects that disappear overnight. With staking rewards, referral bonuses, airdrops, and major exchange listings planned for the coming quarters, Dragoin is on track for growth. Its combination of meme appeal, gamified functionality, and strategic tokenomics positions it as a leading contender not just for Q2, but for the entire year. Cheems: Reinventing Its Meme Legacy Cheems has been a fan favorite in the meme coin world for years, thanks to its “doge with a speech impediment” persona. But in Q2 2025, Cheems is trying to evolve. It’s shifting towards more serious initiatives, integrating philanthropy and introducing staking incentives for long-term holders. Cheems is still beloved for its strong community ties. Meme contests, giveaways, and collaborations with creators keep the community active and engaged. However, the heavy reliance on nostalgia could limit its growth potential in a market that’s increasingly focused on utility. While Cheems may still provide short-term profits, its future success will hinge on its ability to innovate beyond its original meme-driven appeal. MEMEX: The Meme Coin ETF MEMEX presents a unique investment opportunity for those looking to diversify their meme coin portfolio. Acting like an ETF for meme coins, MEMEX bundles top-performing tokens into one. This approach removes the guesswork for investors who want exposure to multiple meme coins without tracking each one individually. With automated rebalancing and exposure to trending tokens, MEMEX offers a less risky entry point into the meme coin market. It’s not about betting on a single coin like Dragoin or Cheems, but rather about riding the wave of the broader meme economy. While it may not have the viral potential of standalone meme coins, MEMEX offers a lower-risk alternative for those who want to join the meme coin craze without diving into the complexity of research and tracking. Why Utility-Driven Meme Coins Will Be Winners in Q2 As we move into Q2, the meme coin market is showing a clear shift towards projects that offer more than just fun. With increasing liquidity and a growing number of new crypto users, the demand for meme coins with actual engagement features, community governance, and long-term vision is soaring. Dragoin represents the new breed of meme coins—fun and functional. It’s not just about holding tokens; it’s about playing, earning, and building with the project. From its 25-stage presale to its deflationary mechanics and the upcoming game launch, Dragoin is setting up for a successful Q2. While established names like Cheems and broader options like MEMEX still have their place, Dragoin checks all the boxes for a breakout meme coin this quarter. As more investors shift towards tokens with substance, Dragoin’s chances of becoming one of 2025’s biggest meme phenomena grow stronger every day.

XRP’s dynamic liquidity, strategic market positioning, and high-speed transactions have long made it a powerhouse in digital finance. This latest insight underscores the vast potential within the XRP ecosystem, reinforcing its appeal to forward-thinking investors. With the crypto founder’s revelations, XRP is again at the forefront of high-stakes financial maneuvers. Unveiling The $44,000 To $5.5 Million XRP Investment Strategy ​In a notable development within the cryptocurrency community, a crypto founder, Edward Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, has articulated a compelling vision for XRP’s future valuation. XRP, known for its rapid transaction speeds and scalability, has been a focal point in the digital currency landscape. The crypto founder believes that with the right strategy and timing, a $44,000 investment in XRP could grow into a $5.5 million fortune. According to his calculations, buying XRP at $2.40 now could turn into $5.4 million once the token reaches $300. Farina has always believed that the price of XRP is poised to make grown men cry for the rest of their years, urging individuals to position themselves among those who will celebrate rather than regret. In addition, Amonyx, a social media influencer from X, reveals data citing that investors are buying XRP tokens in massive quantities, further solidifying the crypto founder’s claims. With the crypto founder’s projections of a $44,000 investment skyrocketing to $5.5 million, the excitement surrounding XRP’s potential continues to build.

He also believes the crypto community should prioritize open-source funding instead, as public goods funding is still subject to social desirability bias. Meanwhile, his Ethereum network will need to increase its data capacity to accommodate an L2 model release. The network, though, does have an upgrade in the works. Pectra, possibly launching by April 30, could raise blob space to up to 6 units. Moreover, by the end of the year, the network plans to have 72 units through the Fusaka upgrade as well or, at least, bulk up to 12-24 units. Ethereum L2 model will use optimistic, zero-knowledge and trusted execution environment proof types Buterin’s L2 proposal will feature a system with a 2/3 multi-signature mechanism, utilizing optimistic, zero-knowledge (ZK), and trusted execution environment (TEE) proofs. That implies that before any transaction is finalized, it has to pass through ZK and TEE validations. Then, a seven-day optimistic challenge period is provided if the transaction does not meet the former checks’ criteria. Additionally, the system can be upgraded to proof logic, but there will be a 30-day delay per network policy. Generally, the L2 model will maintain properties such as decentralization and trust minimization but improve in terms of speed and network security. However, Buterin cautioned that using common code across ZK rollups might allow bugs to spread between them, increasing the overall risk. Wei Dai, a research partner at 1kxnetwork, detailed, “This means that the finality of rollups can be as fast as zk proving (~ Buterin has encouraged people to take on open-source funding instead of public goods funding Buterin also called for the change to open-source funding from public goods funding. He argued that the term “public good” can be “stretched so easily.” Buterin explained that the word “public good” is often used to describe a ‘good that comes from the government’ and not exactly something great in an economic sense, so the name may create a false perception. He added that people already perceive public good funding as lacking rigour and being cultivated on the basis of social desirability. He insisted that contrary to public goods funding, open-source funding is more transparent and could drive collaboration. He, however, cautioned against taking on any other open-source project, asking people only to support those that add value.

Qubetics Is Climbing Fast as Ethereum and Arweave Gain New Ground,https://thecoinrise.com/best-cryptos-with-1000x-potential-right-now-qubetics-is-climbing-fast-as-ethereum-and-arweave-gain-new-ground/,"What if the next crypto that could change your entire financial future isn’t Bitcoin or Ethereum—but something flying under the radar with insane growth potential? Yeah, we’re talkin’ about the kind of plays that early buyers brag about for years. Right now, the crypto space is bubbling with innovation, and two names that keep popping up are Arweave and Ethereum. They’ve both been making waves with their recent updates and tech-forward moves. But there’s a fresh contender stepping into the ring—and it’s not just hyped, it’s solving real-world headaches that these giants couldn’t. Say hello to Qubetics ($TICS)—a beast of a project that’s not here to play around. It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator that brings together major blockchains under one roof, giving users and businesses total freedom without locking them into any one chain. Plus, the Qubetics presale is absolutely exploding right now, with over $15.5 million already raised. And the buzz? It’s not just hype—it’s backed by features, real functionality, and seriously attractive price entry points that make this one of the best cryptos with 1000x potential. If you’ve been watching for the best crypto presale of the year, this might just be it. Qubetics’ Game-Changing Wallet: A Web3 Superpower in Your Pocket So here’s the thing—Web3 sounds cool, but let’s be real: most people still find it confusing, clunky, and full of annoying trade-offs. Qubetics doesn’t just recognize that—it fixes it. Their flagship product? A non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that finally brings everything under one roof. It’s like having Apple Pay, MetaMask, and PayPal all rolled into one—but with the power of blockchain behind it. For an average user, think about being able to swap between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and other blockchains seamlessly—no jumping through hoops, no bridges, no headaches. Everything just works. A college student can use it to pay for their Spotify subscription with $TICS or crypto-backed Visa, while a freelancer can invoice global clients in stablecoins directly from the wallet. Total freedom, total control. Now, imagine a mid-sized eCommerce business trying to accept crypto from customers worldwide. Normally, this would be a nightmare—so many chains, different wallets, compatibility issues. But with Qubetics, they can integrate a single wallet that automatically routes and converts crypto across chains, all while ensuring the customer experience stays buttery smooth. And there’s more—Qubetics has also integrated virtual card functionality. Yup, users can mint a virtual debit card linked to their crypto wallet and use it for real-world purchases just like any Visa card. Everything is on-chain, traceable, and secure. That’s the kind of leap Web3 needed. No more disconnected tools or sketchy third-party platforms. So whether you’re a small biz owner, a full-time crypto trader, or someone who just wants to buy coffee with crypto, Qubetics gives you that flexibility with no compromises. It’s no wonder this project is now being listed among the best cryptos with 1000x potential . Massive ROI Projections from Qubetics Presale Prove Why It’s One of the Best Cryptos with 1000x Potential Let’s get real—everyone wants to know the numbers. And the numbers behind the Qubetics presale? Straight-up insane. Right now, the presale is in its 27th stage, with the token priced at $0.1300. Each stage lasts exactly 7 days and ends at midnight every Sunday, with the price increasing by 10% like clockwork. So yeah, time really is money here. So far, Qubetics has raised over $15.5 million, attracted more than 23,900 holders, and sold 504 million tokens. That’s a serious flex. Now here’s where things get juicy: if you jump in now at $0.1300, here’s what the projected ROI looks like based on where $TICS could go: At $1 post-presale = 669.13% ROI At $5 = 3,745.67% ROI At $6 = 4,514.80% ROI At $10 = 7,591.33% ROI At $15 = 11,437% ROI Let’s break it down: say someone throws in just $1,000 at the current price. If $TICS hits $10, they’re walking away with $76,900. If it touches $15? That’s a clean $115,350. Now compare that to most coins that barely double in price during their presale. This is why Qubetics isn’t just part of the conversation—it is the conversation when people are talking about the best cryptos with 1000x potential. With the Qubetics presale gaining serious traction, this might just be the best crypto presale of 2025. No fluff, no hype—just raw potential backed by utility, tech, and smart economics. Arweave’s Storage Revolution: Data That Lives Forever Let’s talk about Arweave. This one’s been quietly cooking something powerful. Arweave isn’t just a blockchain—it’s permanent data storage on-chain. You upload something once, and it’s there forever. This isn’t just cool for personal files or NFTs—it’s huge for journalism, scientific records, or entire web apps. The real kicker? Arweave recently stepped up their game by optimizing storage costs through a protocol-level upgrade, letting users store more data for way less. Add that to increased adoption through integrations with projects like Bundlr and Kyve, and it’s easy to see why people are getting hyped again. What separates Arweave is its true “set it and forget it” model. You pay once, store forever—no monthly fees, no hosting risks. Developers love it because it’s reliable and censorship-resistant. Think about entire decentralized websites or DeFi dashboards that can live on-chain without needing traditional web servers. While it’s not built for payments or finance like Ethereum or Qubetics, it still lands high on the list of best cryptos with 1000x potential because it’s filling a unique niche—and doing it well. Data is the new gold, and Arweave is building the vault. Ethereum’s Smart Contract Empire Keeps Evolving Ethereum doesn’t need an intro—it’s the OG smart contract platform. But just because it’s a household name doesn’t mean it’s sitting still. Recently, Ethereum devs rolled out updates focused on scaling and slashing gas fees, especially with Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum booming. Plus, the ecosystem is expanding fast. New dApps, DeFi tools, NFT platforms—you name it, it’s happening on Ethereum first. And with the upcoming “Proto-Danksharding” features on the horizon, scalability is only going to get better. The focus is on speed, efficiency, and sustainability. What really gives Ethereum lasting power is the community. It’s massive, always building, and always testing the limits of what’s possible in Web3. From DAOs to decentralized ID systems, Ethereum is the engine behind a huge chunk of the decentralized internet. Is it still one of the best cryptos with 1000x potential? Maybe not at its current size—but that doesn’t mean it won’t 5x or 10x again, especially with global adoption heating up. Ethereum might not be the wildest bet on the board, but it’s one of the most secure. Conclusion: These Are the Coins to Watch—But One Stands Out In a sea of crypto projects, only a few really have the juice to go 1000x—and Qubetics, Arweave, and Ethereum are all bringing serious value to the table. Ethereum continues to lead with its DeFi and smart contract dominance. Arweave is carving out a niche as the go-to for permanent data storage, locking in its spot for long-term relevance. But Qubetics? That’s the dark horse turning heads fast. With a real working product, exploding presale, and powerful utility that bridges multiple blockchains into one seamless ecosystem, Qubetics is clearly positioning itself as one of the best cryptos with 1000x potential. And with time-sensitive presale stages, there’s real urgency for community members to join this crypto presale while it’s still under the radar. This isn’t about hype—it’s about getting in early on something that’s got legs, brains, and serious traction.

The Nasdaq Stock Market submitted a proposal this week to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list and trade shares of Grayscale Avalanche Trust, which would be entirely tied to the price of the layer-1 project’s native asset, AVAX. Grayscale isn’t the first financial giant to file for an Avalanche ETF. Documents submitted to the state of Delaware earlier this month suggest VanEck also hopes to launch a fund tied to the Ethereum ( ETH ) rival. Coinbase Custody will serve as the custodian for Grayscale’s Avalanche ETF if it’s approved. The crypto asset manager also hopes to launch funds tied to Cardano ( ADA ), Solana ( SOL ), XRP and Hedera ( HBAR ). The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ETFs for trading last July. Two financial firms, Franklin Templeton and Hashdex, also launched joint BTC-ETH ETFs earlier this year. AVAX is trading at $20.36 at time of writing. The 17th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 8% in the past 24 hours.

Over 110,000 verified investors—plus waves of developers and miners—are getting early access to what’s being called one of the most community-powered testnets ever launched. While others test in silence, BlockDAG is running a full-scale simulation of what’s coming in 2025. And with $209 million raised in under 10 months, this isn’t just a test—it’s a statement. This isn’t your average trial run. BlockDAG is turning its testnet into an experience, rewarding its early community with a $60,000 giveaway in real BDAG tokens for stress-testing the network before the big mainnet debut. 110,000 Wallets Are Already Live and Testing the Network BlockDAG’s testnet is anything but small-scale. Already, more than 110,000 wallets—straight from its presale community—have been activated. Every one of them gets 10,000 testnet BDAG tokens, automatically dropped through a smart contract that mirrors mainnet’s real vesting engine. CEO Antony Turner didn’t hold back at Keynote 3: “Today marks another significant milestone. We’re excited to announce the official launch of our first Beta Testnet.” This isn’t a dry dev preview. It’s a full-blown blockchain rehearsal—with mining, token creation, wallet activity, and smart contract deployment all live. The setup includes a powerful Beta Explorer, a no-code Token and NFT Wizard, and a fully integrated IDE—giving developers and users everything they need to build, test, and interact in real-time. $60K in Rewards Up for Grabs—Let the Race Begin BlockDAG doesn’t do boring things. That’s why it’s handing out $60,000 in BDAG tokens (based on the $0.05 launch price) to its top testnet contributors. Running until May 31, 2025, the campaign rewards users who go the extra mile. The prize structure includes: Top 10 wallets by transaction volume Top 10 mining nodes by testnet BDAG mined Top 10 wallet holders with the biggest balances Each winner snags $2,000 in real BDAG—not placeholders. Turner nailed it during the keynote: “We’re even going to incentivize you to get involved.” This isn’t fluff—it’s a stress test with real stakes. The setup pushes the smart contracts, vesting mechanics, and infrastructure to perform under pressure. Mainnet Is Coming Fast—And This Testnet Is Paving the Way While the Beta Testnet is already turning heads, it’s just the warm-up act. BlockDAG is preparing for a full mainnet rollout in 2025, and it’s aiming high: 2,000 TPS at launch with scalability to 15,000 TPS within two years. Developers are already building, thanks to the testnet’s no-code wizard, EVM compatibility, and a clean documentation portal. What’s more, this testnet forms the backbone of the DeFi tools BlockDAG plans to release—staking, lending, governance, and cross-chain bridges are all in the pipeline. Turner summed it up best during Keynote 3: “We’re orchestrating every element — from our underlying blockchain to supporting tools like our explorer, integrated development environments, indexers, and oracles — to work seamlessly as one trustless, decentralized network.” Why BlockDAG’s Testnet Isn’t Like the Others BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet isn’t just about checking boxes. Every user is helping build the future. By offering real tokens, live features, and raw on-chain pressure, BlockDAG has ditched the low-energy testnet playbook. With 110,000+ wallets already engaged, hundreds of miners running, and devs actively deploying, the hype isn’t artificial—it’s earned. BlockDAG is proving that its tech, people, and infrastructure can take the heat of a real-world launch. As Turner closed Keynote 3: “This isn’t just a test — it’s the first real step towards our fully operational decentralized ecosystem.” Presale: https://purchase.blockdag.network Website: https://blockdag.network Telegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial Discord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu The post BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet Just Went Public — 110K Users, Real Rewards And An Upcoming Mainnet appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Token Presale and ICO Insights|BlockDAG,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-03-30 00:00:30

Speculation about who might be next is growing as the cryptocurrency community is divided over Trump’s pardons. Names like Roger Ver, SBF, and CZ are dividing the prediction markets. Trump’s pardoning spree has led to heightened discussions within cryptocurrency circles with Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction platform, hosting bets on who might be next. Trump pardons cryptocurrency tycoons who had prior criminal convictions The cryptocurrency community on the Polymarket market, where voters can wager on potential future occurrences of real-life events, is divided among competitors. The “Who Will Trump Pardon in the First 100 Days?” event has seen notable names emerge, including Roger Ver, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Currently, the odds of SBF being pardoned stand at just 3%, while Roger Ver, a cryptocurrency tycoon who says he was the first investor in Bitcoin, has 4% of the vote. Ver, accused of avoiding $50 million in taxes, claimed that on March 2, he was politically targeted for spreading cryptocurrency. Changpeng Zhao, well known as CZ, Binance’s co-founder and former CEO, has about 8% of the votes in the polymarket on the chance to obtain Trump’s pardon. In April 2024, CZ was sentenced to four months imprisonment after pleading guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws. CZ was accused of violating companies’ rules to establish an appropriate anti-money laundering program, which allowed Binance to handle transactions involving the proceeds of illegal activity. On March 27, Trump pardoned three co-founders of the global cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, Samuel Reed, Benjamin Delo, and Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX. This was after they acknowledged in court that they had violated the Bank Secrecy Act more than three months ago. According to the charges, they allowed their business to operate without oversight and failed to establish know-your-customer and anti-money laundering procedures. In addition, apart from three co-founders of BitMEX, on January 21, President Donald Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who the FBI took into custody and seized his laptop on October 1, 2013, one day after becoming the 47th President of the U.S. It was shortly after, in 2015, a judge found him guilty of money laundering, computer hacking, and drug trafficking on the dark web site The Silk Road and sentenced him to life in prison. SBF makes last-ditch effort to secure a Trump pardon for FTX fraud Following his conviction for fraud related to the collapse of FTX, SBF’s family and supporters initially sought to prevent his sentencing. However, after receiving a 25-year prison term, Bankman-Fried has reportedly shifted strategies and is now pursuing a presidential pardon. According to reports, Bankman-Fried consulted a lawyer with ties to the president in addition to Carlson, who is close to Trump. A crypto lobbyist, who spoke while keeping the identity concealed because they were not permitted to comment publicly, responded, “zero,” when asked about the likelihood that Bankman-Fried’s efforts would succeed. On the other hand, several cryptocurrency lobbyists say that due to Trump’s growing connections to the crypto sector and his readiness to freely exercise his pardoning authority, there is still a chance that Bankman-Fried’s plan to get Trump to pardon him will succeed. Trump’s latest moves, including his pardon of Ulbricht and support for cryptocurrency initiatives during his campaign, have reinforced speculation that further crypto-related clemencies could be on the horizon.

XRP struggles above $2.60 while Solana drifts around $145, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes rapid ground during presale, quietly raking in early investors eyeing up possible 34x on return. Now in presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4, having raised $5.7 million so far and with over 7,400 holders in total to date, able buy token at a price of $0.025. The next phase will see a 20% escalation in price to $0.03 — essentially meaning anyone who buys in these early rounds will inevitably have a guaranteed instant profit 140%+ before any listings even occur. Ripple (XRP): Legal Clarity Fails to Maintain Momentum A surge of activity followed on March 19, with the number of active addresses hitting a peak at 626,854 after a recent court ruling spurred good news for XRP in an ongoing legal engagement with the SEC. Interest soon faded, however and active addresses fell to 50,000 by March 23. Significantly, whale transactions languished and veteran investors on the day also showed signs of hesitance. XRP resistance: Medium resistance around 2.60 with current price at 2.4387, momentum is weakly bullish with an RSI at 54.71. If demand does not increase, XRP’s support zone near $2.20-$2.30 may be retested. Solana (SOL): High and Dry Solana was bullish over the past week, rising 15% to $145.11. According to the Binance Futures data, there still is a strong bullish bias, where 78.82% of the traders are holding long positions. However, with the RSI at 69.73, SOL is nearing overbought territory, with further upside muted to a clear break over $150. While Solana is a solid choice, its growth prospects pale in comparison to the explosive growth potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in the short term. Mutuum Finance: The Best Presale With Eyes On Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just any token — that’s a structured DeFi lending platform with real utility, generating constant demand in the presale behind it. With the Phase 4 price of $0.025 versus the confirmed listing price of $0.06, that’s a 140% gain at launch, so you’re getting a bargain. That said analysts believe that post launch targets can be between $1-$5 for its token which would give potential returns of 90x upwards to 100x for those who got it early. The next phase carries a serious 20% hike. Those who do buy in now will see their holdings immediately reflect this increase in valuation once Phase 5 goes live. A Certik audit is underway on top of this; results expected to be published shortly, with increasing trust in the suction of the project’s security. While XRP and Solana tread lightly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are running a marathon with a freeway of exponential gains. Given that the audit is comprehensive and listing on exchanges is imminent, price propagation of MUTM may follow a well-known path in DeFi — meaning early action needed. While XRP hovers at $2.60 and Solana nears $145, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) races ahead in presale. Phase 4 tokens are priced at $0.025, set to rise to $0.03 in the next round, offering a 140% profit before listing at $0.06. Analysts predict post-launch targets between $1-$5, with potential 34x returns. A Certik audit adds security, fueling investor confidence. As XRP and SOL slow down, MUTM’s rapid growth offers a prime opportunity before prices surge again.

Meme Index and Pi Network are both making headlines: one for its curated exposure to meme coins, the other for the uncertainty around massive token unlocks. Each brings something different to the table, but their paths highlight a common investor dilemma—speculation versus structure. Dragoin ($DDGN) , by contrast, positions itself as a more grounded alternative. With a transparent 25-stage presale, real use cases through gaming, and a community-first model, it’s not just another meme coin—it’s one that gives affordable crypto investing a more purposeful direction. Meme Index Presale Nears Completion After Raising Over $4 Million Meme Index ($MEMEX) is approaching the final days of its presale, having successfully raised over $4 million. Meanwhile, this initiative offers investors a structured approach to the meme coin market by providing access to four distinct “baskets” of meme coins, each tailored to different risk preferences. Specifically, these baskets range from the Meme Titan Index, featuring established tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, to the Meme Frenzy Index, which includes newer, high-volatility tokens. Furthermore, by staking MEMEX tokens, investors can gain diversified exposure across these curated selections, aiming to mitigate the inherent volatility of individual meme coins. With that in mind, the presale price is set at $0.0166883, and only a few days remain before MEMEX debuts on exchanges. Thus, this represents a timely opportunity for those seeking diversified exposure in the meme coin sector. Pi Network Faces Price Pressure Amid Token Unlocks Pi Network’s token price has recently dipped below $0.80, marking a 3% decline in the past 24 hours, while trading volume surged by 33% to $327 million. Notably, this downturn coincides with the scheduled release of over 105.96 million Pi tokens (approximately $85 million) into circulation within the next month, averaging about 3.5 million tokens daily. Looking ahead, the outlook remains uncertain as an additional 1.6 billion Pi tokens are set to be unlocked over the coming year, introducing roughly 129 million tokens monthly until May 2028. As a result, analysts express concern that this influx could drive prices down to $0.60. On the other hand, some experts view the current dip as a potential buying opportunity, citing technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index and Fibonacci support levels that suggest a possible rebound. Ultimately, the trajectory of Pi Network’s price will largely depend on the market’s ability to absorb the increased supply and the implementation of strategies to stabilize token circulation. Dragoin Is Perfect for First-Time Crypto Investors Getting started in crypto doesn’t have to mean risking large amounts or diving into complex platforms. In fact, Dragoin ($DDGN) is offering a simple, accessible starting point that’s especially appealing to new or cautious investors. With a current presale price of just $0.0000292, Dragoin presents a low-barrier entry into a project built around real utility, community engagement, and entertainment.

Dragoin combines meme culture with a rewarding play-to-earn Telegram game and a roadmap full of value-driven milestones.

It’s not just affordable—it’s strategic. Smart Entry Points Matter—And Dragoin Might Just Be One Chasing trends without clear fundamentals can be risky—especially in early-stage crypto projects.

Outside of the technicals, one expert is pinning the blame on Ethereum’s failure to lead and innovate in the Web 3 space. Ethereum Price Continues Its Steep Decline According to CoinMarketCap data , technicals for Ethereum’s price are grim, with the second-largest cryptocurrency slipping below $1,900. At press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,828 and shows no signs of reversing the grim trend. A look at Ethereum’s chart does not indicate any signs of an uptrend or a short bounce to stoke embers of optimism. According to pseudonymous analyst Gum, Ethereum signals “relentless downward price action” that could see the asset fall below $1,800. Over the last day, Ethereum has fallen by nearly 4% while its seven-day chart indicates a decline of nearly 8%. The decline of Ethereum price follows a broader market correction with the global crypto market capitalization losing nearly 3% of its valuation. On the fundamentals side, things are equally grim for the Ethereum price. Unconfirmed reports of a potential Binance delisting ETH threaten to send Ethereum price to $1,500. Standard Chartered has slashed its ETH prediction for 2025 by 60%, projecting $4,000 as a potential price point by the end of the year. Expert Says Network Has Itself To Blame Ryan Watkins, co-founder at Syncracy Capital has taken swipes at Ethereum over its failure to keep pace with its peers. Watkins notes that a failure to capitalize on previous momentum during the last two market cycles is haunting Ethereum’s price. Ethereum has fallen down the pecking order to new blockchains with Solana and Bitcoin tipped to have the upper hand over the network. An inflow of bridged funds from Ethereum to Solana is accentuating the network’s worrying metrics. “No one wants to own a growth stage product that’s falling behind technologically superior competitors and bleeding market share,” said Watkins. Watkins says the only for Ethereum to pull itself from the rut is to “deliver generational leadership and growth.” However, with the Pectra upgrade around the corner, enthusiasts are optimistic that Ethereum can reach $10,000. Hardcore community members are poking holes in Solana’s rise, attributing it a memecoin craze compared to Ethereum’s neck-deep foray into decentralized finance (DeFi).

42613531,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=702507,1743297255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42613531.jpeg,Trump doesn’t care about higher auto prices and won’t fire anyone over Signal leaks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-doesnt-care-higher-auto-prices/,"President Donald Trump told NBC News on Saturday that he has no intention of firing anyone involved in Signal leaks, and he also declared he “couldn’t care less” if foreign car manufacturers raise prices in response to new U.S. tariffs. Speaking by phone from Florida, Trump insisted that he remains confident in the advisers who took part in the chat and argued that higher prices for imported automobiles would only help American automakers. In the interview , which touched on trade, national security, and his aspirations to take over Greenland, Trump insisted he is staying the course on his policy decisions. Trump said he sees no reason to let go of any officials linked to the Signal incident . He added that his administration carried out what he described as a “tremendously successful” strike against Houthi militants earlier in March and that the media should focus on that result rather than any mishaps in communication. “I don’t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” Trump said, adding, “We had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to talk about is nonsense. It’s fake news.” Trump discussing Signal chat leak in a meeting with ambassadors. Source: WFFA Trump also underscored his continued confidence in Waltz and Hegseth, saying, “I do,” when asked if he still has faith in them. “I have no idea what Signal is. I don’t care what Signal is. It’s the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about,” he added. Trump can’t care less about imported car prices going up When the discussion turned to trade, Trump spoke at length about his recent decision to impose 25% tariffs on all foreign-made automobiles. He repeatedly stated that he “couldn’t care less” if car prices for foreign models go up, since, from his perspective, that would only drive more American consumers to buy vehicles made in the United States. He added, “I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars.” Asked if he had warned motor industry executives against increasing prices, the president insisted he did no such thing and said that any company wanting to avoid tariffs should build cars in the United States. “The message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you’re going to make a lot of money. If you don’t, you’re going to have to probably come to the United States,” he stated. The president then confirmed that foreign auto parts will also face a 25% duty even if those parts go into vehicles assembled domestically, with certain exceptions tied to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). According to the White House, those USMCA-compliant components will remain tariff-free until the government establishes a process for imposing the new tax. However, Trump noted that the tariffs themselves are permanent. “Absolutely, they’re permanent, sure. The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we’re doing is being fair, and frankly, I’m being very generous,” he said. Trump’s new tariffs were announced on Wednesday, just weeks before his planned April 2 “ Liberation Day .” On that date, a separate set of tariffs on a range of consumer goods is scheduled to take effect. Several international leaders, such as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, quickly criticized the move. Carney argued that these tariffs were “unjustified” and signaled “the old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over.” Even so, Trump maintained that he does not plan to postpone the April 2 tariffs. When asked if he was open to negotiating, he said, “Only if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there’s no room for negotiation.” His stance on trade has contributed to uncertainty in global financial markets , and he has been accused by some experts of creating volatility on Wall Street. However, Trump dismissed these concerns. He pointed to polling numbers indicating that more Americans feel the country is on the right track than at almost any point in recent decades. “What I see is right track, wrong track. And the right track was the first time in like, 40 years where it was right track,” Trump remarked. Trump is serious about taking over Greenland Another topic raised was Trump’s ongoing pursuit of Greenland , a semi-autonomous territory governed by Denmark. While many observers have regarded the idea of buying Greenland as improbable, Trump insisted he is serious. “We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,” he said. “I don’t take anything off the table,” he continued, mentioning that he sees a “good possibility” the United States can do it without a military approach. JD Vance during a visit to Greenland earlier this week. Source: Sky News Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland on Friday with his wife, Usha. Trump referred to that visit and said he was not especially concerned about how Russia or other nations might perceive an American attempt to acquire the territory. “I don’t really think about that. I don’t really care,” he said. “Greenland’s a very separate subject, very different. It’s international peace. It’s international security and strength.” Trump maintained that the region’s geographic importance could justify American control, warning of ships from Russia, China, and other countries sailing near Greenland. “We’re not going to allow things to happen that are going to hurt the world or the United States,” he said, describing his position as a necessary measure of defense. What’s the takeaway? Throughout Saturday’s conversation, Trump showed no sign of scaling back his recent plans. According to the president, his decisions will strengthen America’s economic base and national security. He accused other nations of exploiting the United States for decades and insisted his administration would continue to put American interests first. “Countries have been taking advantage of us for so many years,” Trump said, underscoring that he believes higher tariffs will encourage companies to produce goods domestically. The president also brushed off the risk of higher consumer costs , economic wars, or strained alliances. Instead, he concluded by saying he has every intention of pressing forward. “People said we couldn’t do many things that we’ve done, and now they’re happening,” Trump said. “It’s been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While top meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way, a new generation of crypto projects is pushing boundaries with smarter tokenomics, intense community hype, and early-entry rewards. Pepe Coin just bounced back with bullish momentum, and Ponke’s recent listings are generating serious buzz—but neither comes close to what’s unfolding with Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) . Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is capturing massive attention as it moves through an unconventional, location-based presale—now in its 16th phase called Crystal Cove. With weekly token burns, staking rewards, and massive referral incentives, APC is giving early investors not just meme magic but strategic advantages. This article will dive into the latest updates from Arctic Pablo Coin, Pepe Coin, and Ponke—and reveal why Arctic Pablo might just be the Top New Meme Coin to Invest in Now. Token Burn Strategy Heats Up Investor Demand | Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now Arctic Pablo Coin’s explosive appeal begins with one word: scarcity. Through a powerful weekly burn mechanism, unsold tokens are permanently removed during the presale—tightening supply and increasing potential value for holders. Once the presale wraps up, any leftover tokens will also be torched, amplifying APC’s deflationary framework. This strategic burn isn’t just a gimmick—it’s all on-chain, with every token elimination recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for maximum transparency. Arctic Pablo Coin’s commitment to reducing supply positions it among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, giving early adopters a rare opportunity to secure a token designed for longevity. But that’s not all—staking rewards during the presale are boasting an eye-catching 66% APY. Holders can lock up their tokens, watch them grow, and even earn rewards through Arctic Pablo’s community competitions and referral incentives. Whether participating in fun challenges or inviting friends, APC holders are rewarded with real crypto gains. These features make Arctic Pablo Coin far more than just a meme—it’s a movement with momentum. Crystal Cove Is Live—$0.000083 Entry Price Could Be Gone Tomorrow | Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now The current meme coin presale phase, dubbed ” Crystal Cove ” is igniting. The token’s unique no-stage presale model, driven by the character’s travels across iconic locations, means each new stop tightens the window for low entry. Crystal Cove is already generating buzz, and as the token inches closer to its next phase, urgency is peaking. With the price set to rise again soon, APC is commanding serious attention as one of the Top New Meme Coins to invest in now. Don’t be late to the Arctic Pablo party—the presale stage is vanishing fast. Crystal Cove marks the 16th destination in Arctic Pablo Coin’s global journey—and it’s shaping up to be the most pivotal yet. With each new location, APC’s price climbs, and now it’s available for just $0.000083. That’s right: over 9552.41% ROI separates this current price from the expected listing price of $0.008. Arctic Pablo has already raised more than $2 million in its presale, and Crystal Cove could close any moment. Pepe Coin Surges Again as Whale Activity Spikes Pepe Coin has reawakened the crypto scene with a strong surge in trading volume driven by sudden whale activity and renewed retail interest. Over the past week, PEPE climbed over 20% as rumors swirled about an upcoming burn or partnership announcement. Community sentiment is soaring as social media trends spotlight the coin’s comeback narrative. While Pepe still faces volatility, its momentum suggests it’s not ready to bow out of the meme coin spotlight just yet. Ponke Climbs After New Exchange Listings Boost Visibility Ponke is rallying after securing fresh exchange listings, including a mid-tier CEX that pushed its visibility to new heights. The increased accessibility has injected strong liquidity into the project, driving daily trade volumes upward. Ponke’s quirky branding and grassroots community continue to appeal to meme coin fans, and its latest roadmap teaser hints at future NFT integrations. With bullish sentiment building, Ponke is making a strong case for itself in the meme coin arena. Final thoughts Pepe Coin’s return, Ponke’s expansion, and Arctic Pablo Coin ’s bold presale all highlight just how vibrant the meme coin market is in 2025. Each project brings something exciting to the table—but Arctic Pablo Coin is the one turning heads with its creative presale mechanics, aggressive token burns, and game-changing potential ROI. The Crystal Cove phase is live, the clock is ticking, and the price is still just $0.000083. For those hunting the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, Arctic Pablo Coin might just be the golden ticket—available today, but not for long.

IntoTheBlock data shows DOGE, Chainlink, and AVAX exhibited high correlation to BTC price action in the last 30 days. Could these tokens be among the top cryptocurrencies to sell if BTC plunges below the $80,000 mark? Bitcoin Price Tumbles Below $82,000 as Trump’s SEC Chair Nominee Faces Scrutiny Bitcoin (BTC) market sell-off continued on Saturday, as it closed the week with three consecutive days in losses. After a positive start to the week, Trump’s tariffs and controversy surrounding the approval of SEC-chair nominee Paul Atkins sent bearish tailwinds across Bitcoin markets over the last three days. Last Thursday, members of the US Congress raised issues related to “conflict of interests” as Paul Atkins’ confirmation hearing began. Concerns that a less crypto-friendly SEC chair could replace Atkins further accelerating sell-offs across the global cryptocurrency markets, as evidenced by the Bitcoin price 5.7% decline observed since Friday. Bitcoin price analysis | March 30 2025 As seen above, BTC price plunged as low as $81,645 on Saturday, before bulls battled back to reclaim the $82,500 level at press time. However, rising trading volume bars accompanying the downward price action over the last three days suggest bulls will require a strong catalyst to generate sufficient momentum for a major rebound. Chainlink, DOGE, and Avalanche at Risk – Cryptocurrencies to Sell if BTC Drops Below $80,000 Bitcoin price plunged 5.73% lower than the weekly $87,500 local top recorded on Friday. As prices dropped toward $81,200 on Saturday, bulls stepped in to avert cascading leverage liquidations looming at the $80,000 psychological support level. However, BTC traders were not the only ones relieved to see prices back above $82,500. According to on-chain data culled from IntoTheBlock , DOGE, Chainlink, and AVAX exhibited high correlation to BTC price action in the last 30 days. Bitcoin price correlation Matrix (DOGE, LINK, AVAX) | Source: IntoTheBlock This shows that these assets have often moved in the same direction as BTC. The correlation matrix highlights a strong relationship between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ) over the past 30 days. Specifically, LINK (0.93), DOGE (0.80), and AVAX (0.79) exhibit high positive correlations with BTC, meaning their price movements largely mirror Bitcoin’s trajectory. If BTC plunges below $80,000, these altcoins could experience intensified sell-offs as traders attempt to hedge against further losses. Given their historically high correlation, a sustained BTC price downtrend could drag these cryptocurrencies to sell significantly lower, triggering margin calls and forced liquidations in leveraged positions. Strategic traders may consider reducing exposure to these assets or implementing stop-loss orders if BTC continues struggling for traction. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim key resistance levels, a broader market downturn could push these correlated altcoins into deeper losses, reinforcing a bearish outlook. For traders looking to manage risk, these could be among the top cryptocurrencies to sell in a volatile market.

The meme coin market never sleeps, and while heavy-hitters like Peanut the Squirrel and Pepe Coin continue to spark conversation, a new contender among the best new meme coin to join for long term gains is rallying the herd with bold offers, real use cases, and a community that charges like there’s no tomorrow. We’re talking about BTFD Coin (BTFD) —a dip-snatching meme coin that’s flipping the script on early-stage investing. In a world of market volatility, inflated gas fees, and pump-and-dump projects, BTFD Coin is handing the power back to believers. It’s offering a full 100% bonus for a limited time, a 90% APY staking opportunity, a live Play2Earn game, and a shot at a massive 2900% ROI at its projected moon price of $0.006. This one’s not just hype—it’s a full-blown movement built by bulls, for bulls. BTFD Coin – Twice the Tokens, Triple the Hype, All Eyes on the Bulls Squad BTFD isn’t some overnight coin that showed up with no plan. It’s the brainchild of real traders who get the thrill—and the pain—of market dips. The name itself says it loud: Buy The Dip . And right now, it’s the best new meme coin to join for long term. Why? Because it’s not just another coin—it’s a full-on ecosystem stacked with utility, rewards, and a community-led mission that’s pulling in over 11,600 holders and counting. Let’s talk numbers. BTFD’s presale is in its 15th stage, sitting at just $0.0002 per coin. Over 72 billion coins have already been snapped up, raising a cool $6.43 million. But here’s the kicker: if you buy now and use the LAUNCH100 code before March 30, you get 100% more tokens—no strings attached. That’s 2x the tokens for the same price. Imagine putting in $4,500 right now. At $0.0002, that lands you 22.5 million BTFD. With the bonus? You’re holding 45 million tokens. And when BTFD hits the end-of-presale price of $0.0006, your bag’s worth $27,000—a clean 200% ROI. But hold tight, because if this thing hits the projected moon price of $0.006, you’re sitting on $270,000. That’s a mind-blowing 2900% return. Still waiting? Don’t. The meme coin presale is moving fast, and the Bulls Squad isn’t slowing down. Speaking of Bulls, the Bulls Squad is the soul of the BTFD community. It’s not just a marketing stunt—it’s a cast of crypto personas that embody what it means to ride the dips with confidence. From Baby Bull’s meme mastery to Nerdy Bull’s tech wizardry, each character connects with the crowd and keeps the project energized, authentic, and fun. But BTFD isn’t only about community vibes. It’s about action. The full version of the Play2Earn game is now live, giving users real-time rewards while they smash levels and collect BTFD tokens. You earn while you play, stake while you wait, and grow your bag without stressing over market dips. BTFD’s 90% APY staking system is built for believers, giving loyal holders the chance to multiply their holdings month after month. What makes meme coins stick in the real world is how they create emotional connections. From retail investors on Reddit to influencers on TikTok, coins like BTFD thrive on culture and shared goals. They’re more than just digital assets—they’re movements. And BTFD is proving it by rewarding its community through the Bulls Squad journey, airdrops, referral challenges, and a rewards program that gives 10% of raise amounts in BTFD tokens to top referrers each month. This isn’t just clever—it’s personal. Hey Bulls—100% bonus code (LAUNCH100) is active. Every single BTFD token you buy during this 15th stage gets DOUBLED. That’s right—2x tokens, just for entering a code. But this ends on March 30. No do-overs. So Here’s Your Cheat Code: Hit the BTFD Presale site . Connect your wallet—MetaMask, Trust Wallet, whatever works. Enter LAUNCH100 in all caps, hit apply. Plug in your amount. Hit buy and confirm the transaction. Simple. Fast. No regrets.

Join the stampede with the best new meme coin to join for long term, or get left eating dust. Peanut the Squirrel – A Community Favorite with a Story That Sticks Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) hit the scene with a narrative that moved people. Based on a real rescue story, PNUT’s rise captured hearts and fueled a passionate following. This Solana-based token taps into emotion-driven investing, combining nostalgia, social justice, and meme power. It’s now seen as a community symbol for those looking to be part of something bigger than charts. As a go-to alternative investment in the meme coin space, PNUT offers more than gains—it offers meaning. Pepe Coin – The Meme Veteran That Still Gets the Crowd Talking Few meme coins hold the cultural weight that Pepe Coin (PEPE) does. From forums to mainstream media, PEPE has long been the face of internet rebellion and crypto enthusiasm. It has no fancy use cases, but its simplicity is its strength. PEPE remains a go-to choice for those who want exposure to meme-driven assets with massive followings and long-standing recognition. It may not be in presale, but its legacy still powers portfolios. Conclusion – This Is Your Window. Don’t Blink. Here’s something wild: Some of the biggest winners in crypto never bought during the peak—they bought during the dip, when no one else was paying attention. That’s where BTFD Coin comes in. It’s the best new meme coin to join for long term not just because it’s fresh, but because it’s loaded with features that actually reward you. From a 2900% ROI potential and 100% token bonus with the LAUNCH100 code to a live P2E game and staking at 90% APY, BTFD is putting the power in your hands before the rest of the market even shows up. More than $6.43 million raised, over 72 billion coins sold, and a community of over 11,600 strong—that’s not just hype. That’s momentum. Peanut the Squirrel and Pepe Coin have earned their stripes. But BTFD is writing the next chapter. If you’ve ever said, “I wish I got in early,” this is that moment. Don’t miss it.

42615831,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=154659,1743300035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/42615831.jpeg,"Solana Faces $100 Risk, Kaspa Gains 42%, But BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 & 800K+ Users Signal Long-Term Strength",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/solana-faces-100-risk-kaspa-gains-42-but-blockdags-keynote-3-800k-users-signal-long-term-strength/,"Solana’s momentum has cracked after rejection at the $146.5 resistance, with price now slipping toward $131. Weakening demand across its network and a drop in active users underline deeper structural concerns. If support at $130 fails, SOL could spiral toward $100—testing psychological lows last seen during broader market corrections. Kaspa, meanwhile, is showing signs of life with a 42% rally in March and renewed attempts to break above $0.10. But its upside hinges entirely on holding support and breaching a long-standing resistance zone—still a technical toss-up. BlockDAG , by contrast, isn’t reacting to market mood swings—it’s building. Keynote 3 unveiled the BlockDAG Academy, a three-tiered learning ecosystem designed to equip developers from beginner to advanced levels. This isn’t education for the sake of optics—it’s a long-term engine for ecosystem expansion. Solana Price Analysis: SOL Faces Breakdown Risks After Key Rejection Solana’s recent rally has run out of steam, with SOL now trading at $131 after failing to break above the $146.5 resistance. This level aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement on the daily chart—a technical rejection that typically signals trend continuation to the downside. As selling pressure intensifies, SOL price could revisit $110, or even test the psychological $100 level. Adding to the bearish setup, Solana’s daily active addresses and transaction volumes are in decline, reflecting fading demand across DeFi and meme coin activity. Momentum indicators like the MACD and RSI are also cooling off, further validating bearish bias. On the hourly chart, SOL is bouncing off $130 support. But this rebound may be short-lived, offering short-sellers an opportunity near the 23.6% or 38.2% Fibonacci retracements. With sentiment still stuck in ‘Fear’ territory, the next move could determine if $100 is back on the table. Kaspa Price Surges 42% in March—Can It Break Above $0.10? Kaspa (KAS) has gained 42% since hitting a low of $0.056 on March 11, sparking hopes of a trend reversal. After months of correction, KAS is testing key resistance near $0.10, which aligns with the descending wedge and Fibonacci retracement levels. If the price breaks above $0.107, it could confirm a bullish breakout, signaling a shift to an uptrend. Momentum indicators like the RSI have recovered from oversold conditions, supporting the case for further upside. But rejection at this level could lead to another dip, potentially retesting the $0.0485 zone. For now, $0.078–$0.080 remains the support to watch. Traders should keep a close eye on how KAS behaves around the $0.10 mark. A breakout could mean a fresh wave of gains. With strong volume and improving structure, Kaspa may be setting the stage for a stronger move higher. BlockDAG Isn’t Just Raising Capital—It’s Raising a Generation of Builders A standout move in Keynote 3 that’s setting BlockDAG apart from every other Layer 1 is the launch of the BlockDAG Academy—a three-tier educational hub designed to onboard the next generation of developers, builders, and Web3 leaders. Unlike most crypto projects that rely on hype alone, BlockDAG is creating the foundation for a self-sustaining ecosystem by educating users at every level—from beginners to advanced smart contract developers. This means more dApps, more utility, and ultimately, more value flowing into the BDAG coin. As more developers are trained and funded (via grants and global hackathons), BlockDAG becomes not just another blockchain—it becomes the preferred environment for building the future of Web3. That’s how the project plans to achieve its $600M presale goal—by creating real demand at the ecosystem level, not just from traders. With over $209 million raised, 19 billion BDAG sold, and 800K+ app users, BlockDAG is scaling with precision. Currently in Batch 27 at $0.0248, the opportunity to join this movement early is rapidly shrinking. The Academy isn’t just an educational tool—it’s a growth engine for the entire network. And it’s already live. Takeaway Solana faces downside risks after failing to clear key resistance levels, and its fading user activity compounds the bearish narrative. Kaspa’s recent 42% rally is promising, but it remains pinned below critical resistance—offering opportunity, yes, but without confirmation of a breakout, it’s still a risky trade. In contrast, BlockDAG is engineering growth that doesn’t depend on price speculation. The BlockDAG Academy—now live—adds an entirely new dimension to its roadmap: a pipeline for developer talent, dApp innovation, and long-term adoption. With over 19 billion BDAG sold and exchange listings ahead, BlockDAG isn’t just chasing volume—it’s creating it. Most projects raise capital and scramble to build after launch. BlockDAG is already rolling out hardware, software, and education—building momentum before its mainnet hits.

42615479,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104330,1743300353,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"Hoskinson Reveals Cardano’s Push to Integrate with Dogecoin, Chainlink, Bitcoin",https://zycrypto.com/hoskinson-reveals-cardanos-push-to-integrate-with-dogecoin-chainlink-bitcoin/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has revealed ongoing efforts to integrate with major blockchain ecosystems, including Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Bitcoin, that could expand Cardano’s reach and use cases. Speaking during a Friday interview with Gokhshtein Media, Hoskinson disclosed that discussions with Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov are progressing, however, emphasizing that integration will take time due to technical challenges. “I spent last night with Sergey Nazarov from Chainlink… and I asked, ‘Hey, what about integrating Chainlink with Cardano?’ He said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re working on it with you guys, but your stack is a bit unusual, so it’ll take some time,’” Hoskinson told David. Chainlink is reportedly developing a more generalized Oracle solution tailored for UTXO-based DeFi applications rather than focusing solely on Cardano. The collaboration extends beyond Cardano, encompassing the broader UTXO-based ecosystem, which includes Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. He also touched on the network’s push into Bitcoin . Notably, Cardano has been advancing its integration with Bitcoin through BitcoinOS, a system enabling trustless BTC transfers via the BOS Grail Bridge. This initiative aims to tap into Bitcoin’s $1.7 trillion ecosystem, bridging its liquidity with Cardano’s DeFi capabilities to enhance interoperability, scalability, and adoption. Cardano’s Lace wallet also supports Bitcoin, providing seamless multichain asset management. Hoskinson further hinted at potential collaborations with Dogecoin but emphasized that discussions are still in their infancy. “They seem open and willing… but we need to determine what makes sense,” he stated. While details remain scarce, integrating Dogecoin into Cardano’s ecosystem could enhance liquidity and expand its use beyond simple transactions. Dogecoin has been widely used for payments, tipping, and microtransactions due to its low fees and fast transaction times. Major companies like Tesla and Newegg accept it for purchases. Another key topic in the interview was Bitcoin’s potential role in national strategic reserves. Hoskinson mentioned that U.S. lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis and former President Donald Trump, are reportedly exploring adding Bitcoin to the country’s reserve assets. However, he acknowledged that details remain uncertain. There were also rumors that ADA might be included in such reserves. Hoskinson addressed these speculations, saying, “I woke up to 150 messages saying, ‘Congrats, bro ADA is up 70% and in the reserve.’ And I was like, ‘Okay, well, that’s awesome—but I didn’t know about it.” Notably, Cardano’s UTXO-based transactions finalize in 20 to 40 seconds. The base layer can process around 250 TPS, and scalability improvements like Hydra aim for 1 million TPS. As of Friday, the network had processed over 110 million transactions, with fees averaging less than 25 cents per transaction. Thus, if integrated with other networks like Bitcoin or Dogecoin, Cardano’s efficient UTXO model could enhance transaction throughput, reduce fees, and improve scalability for broader blockchain interoperability.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cardano|ChainLink|Charles Hoskinson|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|DOGE|LINK|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-30 02:05:53

Regulatory uncertainty surrounding SEC Chair nominee Paul Atkins sparked withdrawal from XRP derivatives markets, signalling more downside risks ahead. Why Is Ripple (XRP) Price Going Down Today? Ripple’ (XRP) latest downturn has been attributed to mounting concerns of “conflict of interest” over the nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair under the Trump administration. While Atkins has long been regarded as a crypto-friendly figure, opposition from U.S. Congress has raised fears of potential regulatory hurdles for Trump’s crypto plans and ongoing altcoin ETF filing reviews. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | March 30 Recently, Ripple secured a major legal victory in its protracted battle with the SEC, bringing long-awaited closure to the case. However, uncertainty surrounding Atkins’ confirmation has cast a shadow over XRP price momentum. As seen in the chart above, Ripple price tumbled a low as $2.06 on Saturday, before rebound towards the $2.15 level at the time of publication. Atkins’ critics within Congress have expressed concerns over potential conflicts of interest, signaling broader resistance to pro-crypto policies. If his confirmation is blocked, it could indicate a more hostile stance toward upcoming legislative initiatives—such as the proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve, which requires congressional approval for federal cryptocurrency acquisitions. Ripple XRP ETF Approval odd plunge 9% in a week, as Congress scrutinizes Paul Atkins | Source: Polymarkets According to Polymarkets data, investors are now pricing 35% chance that the US SEC could approve XRP spot ETFs before July 31. Notably that figure has now declined 7% since the scrutiny around Trump’s SEC chair nominee, Paul Atkins began. More significantly, investors worry that a less crypto-friendly successor could delay or outright reject altcoin ETFs, dealing a major setback to institutional adoption. This uncertainty has contributed to XRP’s recent sell-offs, as market participants brace for potential regulatory headwinds. Traders Withdraw $220M as Market Sentiment Deteriorates XRP’s bearish trend has not been confined to spot market losses alone. In the derivatives sector, traders are aggressively unwinding their positions, signaling a broader loss of confidence in XRP’s short-term recovery prospects. According to CryptoQuant, XRP’s open interest—a key indicator of futures market activity—has fallen sharply from $1.6 billion on March 19 to $1.48 billion at press time, reflecting a $220 million decline in just 10 days. This mass exodus suggests that traders are moving to reduce their exposure rather than betting on a swift rebound. Ripple (XRP) Open Interest, March 30 | Source: CryptoQuant Extended periods of large-scale withdrawals from open interest typically indicate persistent bearish momentum, as market participants either lock in profits or cut their losses ahead of further declines. Unless broader sentiment shifts in favour of crypto regulation, XRP may continue facing selling pressure in the near term. XRP Price Forecast: Bearish Breakdown or Rebound to $2.40? XRP price is struggling to regain bullish momentum after falling below key moving averages, signalling potential downside risks. The XRPUSDT daily chart depicted below reveals XRP is currently trading at $2.17, facing resistance from the 50-day SMA at $2.41 and the 100-day SMA at $2.51, as sellers remain firmly in control. The declining trading volume further reinforces bearish sentiment, indicating weak demand at current levels. XRP Price Forecast The Bearish Breakout Probability is supported by the BBP (Balanced Bollinger Percentage) indicator, which sits at -0.3190, a sign of persistent downward pressure. If XRP fails to reclaim the $2.20 support, the price could slide toward $2.00, a psychologically significant level that could trigger panic selling. A breakdown below this mark could open the floodgates for a further decline toward $1.80. On the flip side, a bullish recovery scenario would require a decisive break above the $2.41 resistance. This would invalidate the bearish outlook and potentially drive XRP toward $2.60, aligning with the 100-day SMA. However, without a surge in buying volume, XRP may remain vulnerable to further sell-offs.

While most people are watching the usual suspects like Bitcoin or chasing hype with gaming coins like Gala, something much more powerful might be unfolding quietly—Qubetics. There’s a major shift happening, and it’s not just about who gets to the moon first, but who’s actually building the rocket with real-world fuel. Bitcoin might be the OG of the crypto world, and Gala’s got its niche in gaming, but the real game-changer might just be $TICS. Qubetics isn’t here to play catch-up. It’s rewriting the rules with serious tech and problem-solving features that most legacy coins never even aimed for. From the ground up, Qubetics was built to tackle actual global problems—like the painfully slow and expensive cross-border payment systems that dominate finance today. And now, during the current 27th presale stage, early buyers are rushing in. With over 504 million tokens already sold and a tally of $15.5 million raised, the buzz around Qubetics presale is becoming impossible to ignore. This isn’t just another coin—this could be the one everyone talks about when they mention the next big crypto. Qubetics Is Rewiring Global Transactions Like Never Before – Truly the Next Big Crypto Let’s get one thing straight—Qubetics isn’t a copy-paste blockchain project. It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, linking together top blockchains and unlocking seamless interoperability that’s been missing in this space for far too long. But where Qubetics really starts flexing is in its real-life application for cross-border transactions. While most crypto projects talk a big game about decentralization, Qubetics actually backs it up with a fully integrated ecosystem that can change the way people and companies move money across the globe. Picture this: A mid-sized tech startup in Austin needs to pay a freelance designer in Tokyo. Traditional banking methods? They’re looking at delays, fees, and paperwork that eats up days and dollars. But with Qubetics, that same transaction can be done within seconds, securely, with zero middlemen and at a fraction of the cost. That’s not some future vision—it’s built into the Qubetics tech right now. This is what makes Qubetics the next big crypto worth talking about. Now zoom out. Think of global companies operating with remote teams in 15 different countries. The headaches they face every month in handling payroll are unreal. Qubetics streamlines all of that, offering an instant, secure, and cost-effective way to settle transactions with full transparency. And for small business owners or content creators receiving international payments, this is a game-changer that can save thousands every year. That’s not just innovation—it’s real value. The trust and speed Qubetics offers comes from its ability to eliminate the traditional red tape and delays that plague international finance. While Bitcoin remains a store of value and Gala focuses on niche gaming use cases, Qubetics delivers a functional application with real utility that directly helps people in daily life. The result? A growing wave of early adopters recognizing it as the next big crypto before it even hits the mainstream radar. Qubetics Presale Numbers and ROI Projections – Why This Next Big Crypto Is Built Different Here’s where things start getting real for those watching the numbers. The Qubetics presale is already deep into its 27th stage, with each stage lasting just 7 days before the price increases by 10%—always hitting on Sunday at midnight. With over $15.5 million already raised, more than 23,900 token holders, and 504 million $TICS tokens sold, the hype isn’t just noise—it’s backed by serious traction. This isn’t just being talked about—it’s being bought into. Now, let’s talk numbers. Right now, $TICS is priced at $0.1300. And if the projections hit anywhere near what’s expected post-mainnet launch in Q2 2025, this could turn small investments into life-changing money. Let’s break it down. If someone throws in $2,500 at the current presale price, they’ll receive around 19,225 tokens. If $TICS hits even $1, that’s a $19,225 return—already up 669.13% ROI. But things get crazy when projections show $TICS could reach $10 or even $15. At $10 per token, that same $2,500 investment could jump to a wild $192,250, delivering a 7,591.33% ROI. If it hits $15, we’re talking $288,375—which is an 11,437% ROI. And remember, that’s all based on just one of the more realistic scenarios outlined by the team. For those who’ve been burned by hype coins with no real product, this is a whole different league. These aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet—they’re backed by a functional ecosystem that solves real financial problems. With its application targeting real-world inefficiencies and its presale metrics smashing expectations, Qubetics has become the next big crypto that’s got both the utility and growth potential that early buyers are always looking for. For anyone scanning for the best crypto presale opportunity, skipping over Qubetics right now might be one of those mistakes people regret when the coin hits full mainnet traction. Bitcoin’s Position as a Digital Store of Value Remains Firm—But It’s No Longer the Only Star Bitcoin will always have that legendary status as the first digital asset that sparked the crypto revolution. No doubt, it’s the digital gold that many still turn to during market uncertainty. But let’s be real—Bitcoin’s not what it used to be in terms of innovation. While the network remains incredibly secure and decentralized, the tech hasn’t evolved much compared to newer, more nimble ecosystems. Right now, the Bitcoin community is watching Layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network gain momentum. These upgrades are designed to tackle the issue of slow transaction speeds and high fees that have long plagued the network. Lightning does bring some relief to smaller, day-to-day transactions, but it’s still in early adoption stages. There’s also growing interest in how Bitcoin might integrate with other DeFi platforms or stablecoin protocols, but that’s mostly speculation for now. What keeps Bitcoin in the conversation is its scarcity model—only 21 million coins will ever exist. That built-in scarcity continues to give it appeal as a hedge against inflation. But for people who are looking to get into a project with 10x, 100x, or even 1000x potential, Bitcoin might not be the go-to anymore. The biggest players already own large chunks, so the upside for everyday folks is a lot smaller. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is still the anchor of the market, but it’s no longer the playground for builders or creators. The real excitement now lies in ecosystems that are faster, more adaptable, and ready to solve real problems. That’s exactly what makes Qubetics stand out as the next big crypto—it’s the tech evolution Bitcoin paved the way for. Gala Keeps the Web3 Gaming Hype Alive—But Can It Deliver? Gala is one of those names that keeps popping up in Web3 gaming circles. With its ambitious push into NFT games, music, and digital entertainment, it’s trying to build an entire media empire on the blockchain. Projects like “Gala Games” and partnerships with big industry names have helped them build a loyal community. But the big question remains—can Gala scale? Right now, Gala is focused on expanding its own layer-1 blockchain and building out an ecosystem of games and metaverse experiences. It’s definitely one of the more exciting players when it comes to blending entertainment and blockchain tech. But there are challenges. The Web3 gaming space is still figuring itself out. Many games are in alpha or beta stages, user retention is low, and the tech often feels clunky. That said, Gala’s making progress. It’s investing heavily into developing AAA-level gaming titles that don’t just use blockchain for the sake of it, but actually enhance the experience. Still, with the whole sector being so experimental, there’s a ton of unpredictability. The value of Gala tokens largely depends on the success of its entertainment ecosystem, which is still a few major releases away from proving itself. So while Gala might end up being a key player in the future of gaming and media, it’s not solving financial or infrastructure problems the way Qubetics is. It’s more of a high-risk, high-reward bet on a niche space. Compared to the real-world application and ROI potential of Qubetics, Gala still feels like a long-term play with more uncertainty attached. Conclusion: Which One Truly Looks Like the Next Big Crypto? Bitcoin holds its ground as the digital gold, providing security and a strong foundation in the crypto market. Gala is making bold moves in the blockchain entertainment space, carving out its identity through games and creative projects. But it’s Qubetics that brings the most complete package to the table—real-world use cases, an already thriving presale, and a tech foundation built to unify blockchains and solve critical problems like international payment delays. For those looking to make the smartest move right now, Qubetics isn’t just hype—it’s functional, it’s growing, and it has serious upside. This is why so many early adopters are lining up to join this crypto presale . Everything points to Qubetics being the next big crypto, and the window to get in early is narrowing fast.

33767162,[object Object],1743303633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Gemini Crypto Exchange Announces Rewards For XRP Users – Here’s How To Get In,https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-crypto-exchange-announces-rewards-for-xrp-users-heres-how-to-get-in/,"Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins , is promoting its previously launched XRP cashback program , which offers crypto rewards to users. This initiative allows eligible participants to earn rewards on their XRP transactions. Here’s a look at the program details and the steps required to join. Gemini Founder Unveils XRP Cashback Rewards On March 27, Tyler Winklevoss reminded the XRP community and Ripple army on X (formerly Twitter) that they can earn rewards in the token whenever they use the Gemini Credit Card for purchases. The Gemini credit card, launched in partnership with Mastercard in 2021 , allows users to choose cryptocurrencies from Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and over 50 other digital assets for cashback. Since adding XRP to its long portfolio of crypto cashback offerings in August 2023, Gemini has continued to support the third-largest cryptocurrency as an option for crypto enthusiasts. The Credit Card reward information announced by Winklevoss was well received by the XRP community . He explained that the Gemini Credit Card allows users to earn crypto back each time they spend fiat. He clarified that this feature is only available to residents in the United States (US) currently. The Gemini founder also revealed that he has been using the Credit Card for years and has had a great experience accumulating significant crypto rewards from the cashback program. Gemini’s Credit Card offers tiered cashback rates depending on the purchase categories. A 4% XRP cashback is offered on gas and EV charging, with up to $200 monthly. A 1% XRP cashback is available for fuel and EV charging after exceeding the monthly limit. Finally, a 3%, 2%, and 1% XRP cashback is provided for dining, groceries, and other purchases, respectively. As XRP continues to push for widespread adoption , this Gemini cashback reward program strengthens its utility and encourages greater usability and investments. Notably, Gemini isn’t the only crypto exchange embracing XRP in its rewards programs. Platforms like WhiteBIT and Bit2Me have also introduced similar programs. By offering an XRP cashback, Gemini and other crypto exchanges can make crypto more accessible, encourage faster adoption, and reinforce XRP’s role as a digital payment solution . How To Participate In Gemini’s XRP Cashback Gemini has specified that users interested in earning XRP rewards from Gemini’s cashback program must first qualify for the exchange’s Credit Card, which depends on their credit score. Approved applicants must secure their cards by June 30, 2025, to participate in the promotional offer. The crypto exchange also stated that new cardholders could earn up to $200 in XRP cashback if they spend at least $3,000 within the first 90 days. Once earned, the XRP reward will be automatically deposited into their trading accounts on Gemini, enabling users to hold, trade, or sell whenever they wish. The Credit Card also comes with no extra annual, exchange, or foreign transaction fees, allowing crypto users to grow their portfolios continually.
