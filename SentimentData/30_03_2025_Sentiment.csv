These support levels might indicate future price movements. Analyzing such patterns can help in predicting which coins hold potential for growth. Curious which ones are gearing up for a surge? Dive into the details and uncover the mid-term outlook. Stacks (STX) Endures Volatility While Key Levels Signal Trading Zones Past month performance saw STX drop nearly 20%, while the six-month decline reached around 67.5%. The coin experienced short-term rebound moves with a 3.08% one-week gain, yet the overall trajectory remains down. Price swings have kept the asset volatile, echoing a pattern of sharp corrections amid sporadic rallies. Technical measures reflect uncertainty, with indicators suggesting a cautious outlook despite brief upward spurts. Current pricing rests between $0.5774 and $1.2145, with support observed near $0.32 and resistance at $1.60, and a secondary ceiling at $2.24. Bears currently hold sway, and the market shows no clear trend. Traders may consider buying nearer support levels, while closely watching resistance for potential breakouts. Injective Analysis: Steep Decline with Support at $6.43 and Resistance near $24.03 Injective recorded a one-week drop of 6.47%, a one-month decline of 30.12%, and a six-month plunge of 61.03%. Price levels ranged between $9.87 and $18.68, showing a clear downward move over time. Data reflects persistent selling pressure and an overall bearish past performance, marking a significant price correction. Current price sits between $9.87 and $18.68 with immediate support around $6.43 and resistance close to $24.03, plus additional resistance at $32.83. Oscillators and momentum indicators are in negative territory, suggesting bears dominate the market with no clear recovery trend apparent. Trading strategies could focus on taking short positions when prices near the resistance levels and watching for any break above to indicate a change in sentiment. JasmyCoin: Key Levels and Market Sentiment in Focus Trading over the past month showed significant losses of around 40%, with a decline of over 50% in the last six months. This indicates a prolonged period of downward movement and mounting weakness in price action. The persistent losses highlight increased risk for traders, emphasizing the need for caution in current market conditions. The current price is fluctuating within a range from approximately $0.012 to $0.030, with immediate support at around $0.005 dollars and resistance near $0.041 dollars. Bears are currently in control, as technical indicators suggest a downward momentum, and there is no clear trend developing. Traders may look for potential bounces at support or breaks above resistance for potential trading opportunities while remaining alert to market volatility. Conclusion STX has shown resilience around its key support levels and could see upward movement if these levels hold. INJ has potential for growth if it confirms a bounce back from its current support points. JASMY requires close observation as it tests its lower bound. Careful monitoring of these support levels will be crucial for understanding the potential price movements of STX, INJ, and JASMY in the mid-term.

The DeFi founder told Cointelegraph that the high transparency of onchain transactions presents a problem for companies that must conceal sensitive information , including trading strategies, payroll information, and business-to-business agreements. Shibtoshi said: ""The main concerns — regulatory uncertainty, privacy limitations, and complex user experience — are real, but solvable. Innovations in privacy-preserving protocols are making DeFi increasingly compatible with enterprise needs. Platforms like SilentSwap are a step in that direction."" Regulatory uncertainty continues to be one of the biggest problems for DeFi and is compounded by a fragmented approach across legal jurisdictions, which prevents institutional adoption, Shibtoshi added. ""Are DeFi tokens securities? What happens if a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) messes up — and who is responsible when it does? It is all still pretty unclear,"" the SilentSwap founder told Cointelegraph. Shibtoshi urged common sense regulations that encourage innovation and preserve the value propositions of decentralized finance, including self-custody, speed, and cost-effective transactions. The total value locked across the DeFi ecosystem has not yet returned to peak levels witnessed in 2021 and 2022. Source: DeFiLlama Related: Specialized purpose DEXs poised for growth in 2025 — Curve founder US Congress overturns archaic DeFi rule, but DeFi still in danger Both chambers of the United States Congress recently voted to overturn the highly unpopular DeFi broker rule requiring decentralized finance protocols and platforms to report customer transactions to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The US Senate repealed the IRS broker rule in a 70 to 27 vote on March 4, followed by members of the US House of Representatives voting to repeal the IRS rule on March 11. Despite the repeal of the archaic rule, overregulation may end up killing a sector that was born as a decentralized, more accessible, and pseudonymous alternative to traditional finance. According to crypto entrepreneur and investor Artem Tolkachev, regulatory compliance is undermining decentralization in DeFi and destroying the value proposition of the nascent sector. The emphasis on regulatory compliance measures increases the potential for censorship and shifts control from the users to third-party intermediaries and large institutions, Tolkachev wrote.

This Hot Presale Is Here—Grab Your Chance to Ride the Next Best Performing Crypto!,https://thecoinrise.com/wishing-you-had-bought-gala-earlier-this-hot-presale-is-here-grab-your-chance-to-ride-the-next-best-performing-crypto/,"Remember when you brushed off Gala Games, thinking it was just another gaming token? And now it’s everywhere—from NFT gaming to massive partnerships—and those early supporters are living large while you’re stuck wishing you’d paid more attention. That’s the thing about crypto: you never realize what you’ve missed until it’s way out of reach. The best performing crypto doesn’t announce itself with a billboard—it shows up quietly, gets picked up by the sharpest minds, and explodes before the masses even understand what it is. If you’re reading this, you’ve got one job: don’t let history repeat itself. Because here comes Qubetics ($TICS)—a name that’s showing all the right signals of becoming the best performing crypto of 2025. Unlike other projects still figuring out their purpose, Qubetics already has a working roadmap, utility-driven applications, and a community that’s growing by the hour. And the Qubetics presale? It’s not just alive—it’s heating up with momentum you can’t ignore. There’s urgency here because every new stage gets pricier. This isn’t just about buying early. It’s about buying smart. If Gala was your missed ticket to wealth, Qubetics could be your redemption arc. You Missed the Early Qubetics Deals—But This Best Performing Crypto Still Has Room to Run Qubetics early supporters who joined its whitelist had the chance to secure $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. Qubetics started its journey on September 29, 2024, and you’ve already missed so many juicy presale stages where prices were ridiculously low. But here’s the good news: Stage 27 is still live, and the current price is $0.1300. With every stage lasting only seven days and a 10% price bump waiting at the next one, this is your last chance to buy in at a low rate before Stage 28 hits. With over $15.5 million already raised, more than 504 million tokens sold, and 23,900+ holders in the community, Qubetics is already acting like the best performing crypto—before even going live. Now let’s break down the numbers that matter. If you invest $2,000 at the current presale price, you’ll receive 15,380 tokens. When $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that’s $15,380 in your pocket—a 669% ROI. If it climbs to $5, that $2K turns into $76,900. At $6, you’re looking at $92,280. If it reaches $10 or $15 after mainnet, that same $2,000 investment becomes $153,800 or even $230,700. These are real projections, backed by the current momentum. That’s why people can’t stop calling it the best performing crypto in the making. And yes, the Qubetics presale is still open for now—but it won’t be for long. Now, what’s backing all this hype? The Qubetics application is no gimmick. It’s a cutting-edge Cross-Border Transaction solution for institutions, businesses, and individuals. For example, say you’re a global logistics firm needing to send high-volume payments to suppliers in other countries. Traditional methods? Expensive, slow, and filled with paperwork. Qubetics changes that. It enables near-instant payments via $TICS tokens with full transparency and zero middlemen. That means lower fees, faster settlement, and streamlined operations—game-changer for any global business. On a smaller scale, imagine you’re a freelancer in the Philippines working for a tech client in Germany. With Qubetics, you’re getting paid in minutes, not days, with none of the usual remittance fees. The wallet’s transparency helps both parties track and confirm transactions with zero stress. Whether you’re a growing company or an individual navigating global payments, Qubetics gives you the speed, control, and cost-efficiency you’ve been wishing for. No wonder it’s getting tagged as the best crypto presale of the year. Gala Was Slept On Too—And Now It’s Among the Best Performing Crypto Projects Gala Games had one of the most overlooked starts in crypto history. Its ICO price? A microscopic $0.0002. But while many dismissed it as just another gaming token, a few visionaries grabbed early access—and they’re the ones sitting on six-figure bags today. Gala’s rise wasn’t overnight, but once it started rolling out Web3 games, NFTs, and partnerships with big players, it blew up. By the time people caught on, it was already among the best performing crypto assets of its niche. Missed that? Yeah, a lot of people did. Since launch, Gala has built an ecosystem that spans entertainment, gaming, and DeFi—building utility where others just push hype. But the real takeaway here isn’t about Gala’s present; it’s about its past. Gala’s story is a blueprint: undervalued start, utility-focused growth, massive returns. It’s a reminder that the next best performing crypto doesn’t always look like a winner right out the gate. Just like Gala, Qubetics is in its early innings—but this time, you know better than to ignore it. Last Chance to Catch the Next Best Performing Crypto Before It Breaks Out The crypto space doesn’t give second chances often, but right now—it’s doing exactly that. Qubetics is sitting in a golden moment: presale open, price still affordable, and an ecosystem that’s already got serious real-world relevance. All the signs are here that this could be the next best performing crypto to dominate headlines. You’ve already watched Gala go from zero to legend—one of the best performing crypto stories of its time. Don’t let another opportunity slide past you while you’re stuck watching it unfold from the sidelines. Time is tight, and the window is closing. With the Qubetics presale still live and the price set to rise again soon, this is your shot to make a move before things go next-level. Every $TICS token bought today could be your bragging rights tomorrow. So if you’re serious about positioning yourself for the next breakout project—join this crypto presale now. Because missing out again? That’s not part of your 2025 success story.

Yotta Technologies is accusing Evolve Bank & Trust of fraud, conspiracy, and negligence. Yotta offered a high-yield savings product, depositing customer money with Evolve for safekeeping. But in May 2024, after Evolve’s fintech partner Synapse filed for bankruptcy, 85,000 Yotta customers lost access to $112 million in savings. Yotta claims Evolve quietly executed over $25 million in unauthorized and hidden transactions, taking the funds from Yotta customers’ accounts, including direct transfers to Synapse. Yotta says this violated banking rules and customer trust and contributed to an overall shortfall of $65 to 95 million. “Yotta’s investigation indicates that Evolve and Synapse conspired to simply take it, in violation of responsible banking practices and basic morality… These transactions were never authorized by customers. Evolve had no right to take this money from customers and never informed Yotta or its customers that it was doing so.” Evolve blames Synapse for the mess, saying Synapse gave inaccurate account data. Evolve has started repaying some customers, with about $11 million of $59 million owed to 13,300 respondents paid out for about 18 cents per dollar.

The viral star, who had been in jail, mentioned that the reason he launched the token was because he had been knee deep in legal bills, with things looking like he had racked up legal fees. According to reports, Tiger King has been in jail for seven years but did not launch the token himself. Instead, the 62-year-old asked his lawyers to help him launch the “Official Tiger King” token off the ground. The token then began trading on Monday under the ticker name EXOTIC. Most celebrity tokens often end up as viral memes, dropping in value as soon as their viral moments fade. According to Tiger King, he hopes his token does not turn out that way, noting that he knows that most celebrity tokens hinge on people’s attention, which can fade, while also mentioning others that have been marred by allegations of insider trading. “I pray to god that they don’t rug it and ruin my reputation,” he said. “I’m hoping that people will see this is legit and it has a purpose.” Tiger King wants his meme coin to be big While celebrity tokens are not new in the crypto industry, the tokens reached a new point last year after several stars, including Caitlyn Jenner, Cardi B, and Jason Derulo, stepped into the space. One of the most controversial projects was the Hawk Tuah token under the ticker name, HAWK. The token was brought to life following the viral moment in an interview featuring Hailey Welch, who is now known as the Hawk Tuah girl. Tiger King’s token EXOTIC was created on a little-known launchpad called pumpkin.fun, with the market cap of the meme coin rising to about $900,000 before falling to rest at over $100,000. According to Blockchain data, the meme coin currently has about 900 users holding the token. Tiger King initially mentioned that the proceeds from the token will also benefit children, noting that donations will be made to a nonprofit called Operation Smile. this right here too. Dont forget all of this. You wont find a more honest celebrity coin. Track the wallets, they are all on https://t.co/NoBlv57TF8 . When @realDonaldTrump pardons me, imagine the market cap then If you heard me on spaces last night, we are just starting. Its… https://t.co/moNCRG63pl — Joe Exotic (@joe_exotic) March 28, 2025 However, the token’s website does not reference the project’s goal of contributing to Operation Smile. Instead, it says some of the tokens will be donated to a foundation supporting Tigers or animal health after he is released from prison. On Friday, Tiger King’s X account mentioned that it had already donated $1,000 to the nonprofit. He mentioned that his lawyers supported his idea to launch the token as a show of commitment to his charitable work. He noted that it is the reason he wants to be free, mentioning that he just sits in prison watching people do drugs all day. Joe Exotic begs President Trump for a pardon Tiger King is currently being held at FMC Forth Worth, an administrative security center, according to the United States Bureau of Prisons. He uses the telephone to connect with the outside world at intervals, keeping his fans up-to-date via podcasts and X Spaces. He mentioned that even though his real-world experience with crypto is limited, he has been able to learn a lot, even from other inmates at the security center. “There’s not a lot to do all day besides sit and talk to people who know shit,” he said. “I do a lot from here, but I don’t even know how to set up a wallet.” He was resentenced to 21 years in federal prison in 2021, according to a post by Associated Press . He was convicted of the murder-for-hire scheme against animal welfare activist Carole Baskin, killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs, and falsifying wildlife records. He has continued to maintain his innocence while urging United States President Donald Trump for a pardon. He mentioned that someone launched an unofficial meme coin called Tiger King Coin in 2021 and was meant to give him 1% of the entire supply of the meme coin, but he never found out the person behind the project. He noted that he fears that the token may influence what people will think about his new token. Exotic hopes that he can use his meme coin as an initiative that benefits children and other people in the future. “People really need to invest in it,” he said. “I would like to be able to get it up there to where I can fix 500 kids’ [faces] and pay my lawyer bills.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

As Bitcoin corrects from recent highs, a crypto analyst expects a rebound to come next. However, if key support fails, the possibility of further downside remains. Bitcoin To Drop To CME Gap Close Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster this year, skyrocketing to new ATHs and experiencing major price breakdowns that pushed it to new lows. Recently the cryptocurrency saw a surge toward $89,000 but faced a rejection. Now the top crypto is pulling back again, with crypto analyst Astronomer on X (formerly Twitter) pinpointing the $83,000 – $84,000 low range as its next critical support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Face $14 Billion Options Expiry—Market Impact Ahead? This crucial support zone in the price chart aligns with the CME gap close, a common phenomenon in the BTC Futures market. BTC revisits price gaps left when the CME price closes over the weekend and opens on Sundays. Astronomer has outlined his long-term trading plan for Bitcoin, expecting the cryptocurrency to consolidate around the support level before bouncing. He believes that the CME gap close is a significant technical development that could determine Bitcoin’s price movements. Supporting the expectations of a short-term pullback, historically, a bearish close on Friday often leads to red Mondays or Tuesdays for Bitcoin. Moreover, the analyst highlights that the market is still in the pre-New York Open (NYO) phase, leaving room for an intraday reversal. However, he anticipates a late-night drop during the NYO trading session due to the lack of liquidations and untested support levels. He also mentions that combined with these factors, Bitcoin’s recent pullback from $89,000 is a strong indication that its price may not be bullish locally. Based on his Bitcoin price chart, Astronomer considers the $81,400 – $82,400 range the worst-case support zone. Bitcoin is expected to revisit this target zone before any attempt at a potential reversal. Can Bitcoin Rebound? Take Profit Levels To Watch While Bitcoin’s short-term price action appears bearish, its macro trend remains somewhat stable, according to Astronomer’s analysis. The analyst has marked a “long entry” zone in the chart, suggesting that the $83,000 – $84,000 zone was a potential buying opportunity if Bitcoin finds support there. Related Reading: Pi Coin Sinks 47% In 14 Days—What’s Behind The Massive Drop? The analyst predicts that if Bitcoin can successfully hold the CME gap close, a bounce toward the weekly open price at $86,000 could be its first step toward a much-anticipated recovery. Beyond this, the analyst has pinpointed key take profit levels marked from TP1 – TP4 on the price chart. These levels suggest that Bitcoin could surge higher to reach a target of $87,000 – $88,000. However, a break below the worst-case support zone could trigger a bearish shift in sentiment, potentially leading to a deeper price correction for Bitcoin.

Kalshi prediction market files lawsuits against gaming commissions in two US states Kalshi, the onchain prediction market, has filed a lawsuit against gaming regulators in the US states of Nevada and New Jersey after both states sent cease and desist orders for Kalshi to pause its sports event contracts. Additionally, the Nevada Gaming Control Board issued a cease and desist order for Kalshi's election event contracts. The contracts gained popularity during the 2024 elections in the United States.

Source: Kalshi The platform's team argued that Kalshi's event contracts, which are two-sided markets trading through swaps, are distinct from sports betting or other types of gambling that rely on the book method controlled by a gaming house. Moreover, Kalshi contends that state-level regulators have no legal jurisdiction over the platform, which is regulated by the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). $1 trillion stablecoin supply could drive next crypto rally — CoinFund’s Pakman The global stablecoin supply could surge to $1 trillion by the end of 2025, potentially becoming a key catalyst for broader cryptocurrency market growth , according to David Pakman, managing partner at crypto-native investment firm CoinFund. “We’re in a stablecoin adoption upswell that’s likely to increase dramatically this year,” Pakman said during Cointelegraph’s Chainreaction live show on X on March 27. “We could go from $225 billion stablecoins to $1 trillion just this calendar year.” He noted that such growth, while modest compared to global financial markets, would represent a “meaningfully significant” shift for blockchain-based finance. Pakman also suggested that the rise in capital flowing onchain, combined with growing interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), could further support decentralized finance (DeFi) activity: “If we have a moment this year where ETFs are permitted to provide staking rewards or yield to holders, that unlocks really meaningful uplift in DeFi activity, broadly defined.” Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETP ‘key’ for EU adoption despite low inflow expectations The aggregate stablecoin supply stood at an all-time high of above $208 billion across the five largest stablecoins on March 28, according to Glassnode data.

The growing stablecoin supply recently surpassed $219 billion and continues to rise, suggesting that the market is “likely still mid-cycle” as opposed to the top of the bull run, according to IntoTheBlock analysts. Elon Musk’s sale of X to xAI just made fraud lawsuit “a lot spicer” Billionaire investor Elon Musk has sold his social media platform X to his AI startup xAI, sparking controversy as it coincides with a US judge rejecting his bid to dismiss a lawsuit tied to the social media platform. The transfer of ownership of X to xAI on March 28 means that the class-action lawsuit against Musk — accusing him of defrauding former Twitter shareholders by delaying the disclosure of his initial investment in the social media platform — has become “a whole lot spicer,” Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran said in a March 28 X post. Source: Grok On the same day that Musk said “xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” a US judge reportedly rejected Musk’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit. Cochran said it has “opened up his AI entity to exposure here too, and it’s a much bigger pie.” Musk said the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, factoring in $12 billion in debt from the $45 billion valuation. He originally bought X, formerly Twitter, for around $44 billion in April 2022 .",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|BCH|ETH|USDT|XRP|MATIC|ZK|ADA|TON|BNB|WLD|SOL|APT|ARB|AVAX|LINK|ASIA|MINING|USDC|FIAT|ARKM|BUSINESS|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-29 21:32:15

Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran noted in a post that the class action lawsuit against Elon Musk, which accuses him of defrauding former Twitter shareholders by delaying disclosure of the initial investment, is now much more heated. The acquisition could increase ”risks” for xAI When Musk announced that ”xAI acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” a U.S. judge rejected Musk's attempt to halt the lawsuit. Cochran emphasized that this ”opened up his AI company to additional risks, with a much larger scale now involved.” Musk said the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, taking into account $12 billion in debt from an initial valuation of $45 billion. He originally bought X, formerly known as Twitter, for about $44 billion in April 2022. ”The future of xAI and X are tightly intertwined, and today we are officially taking a step toward combining data, models, computing power, distribution systems and talent,” Musk said. ”This merger will unlock tremendous potential by combining the advanced artificial intelligence capabilities and expertise of xAI with the massive reach of X,” he added. ”It will allow us to create a platform that doesn't just reflect the world, but actively accelerates human progress.” However, Cochran claims that ”Musk used xAI's artificially inflated stock price to pay several times the real value for X, yet record an $11 billion loss on the deal.” He said Musk was ”defrauding xAI and X investors” and the deal was done to sell xAI's user data. xAI is known for its chat bot ”Grok” integrated into the X platform. When Musk launched it in November 2023, he claimed that the bot outperformed the first version of OpenAI's ChatGPT on several academic tests. Musk explained that the motivation for creating Grok was to develop artificial intelligence tools that would help humanity by supporting research and innovation. While Cochran called Grok's $80 billion valuation ”incredibly stupid,” the cryptocurrency developer known as ”Keef” disagrees. ”The whole situation looks questionable, but given the current moment, Grok is probably really the best model for various tasks,” he said. The issue of social network X being acquired by startup xAI raises serious questions about Musk's corporate strategy and potential legal implications. The merger of these companies could lead to significant changes in the development of artificial intelligence and social media in the near future.",News|Business,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|RESEARCH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-29 21:47:48

While the crypto market is diving into an extensive search for hidden gems, another project is overshadowing the established leaders with the massively accelerated momentum and structured growth model. Chainlink Milestone Meets Modest Momentum Chainlink (LINK) Received an Oracle: First 20 Trillion Transactions. The number of daily active addresses reached multi-year highs, and exchange outflows showed that $4.5 million in LINK was moved to private wallets by investors demonstrating confidence. Despite those metrics however, LINK’s price action has been sluggish, rallying a mere 1% in the past week. Analysts see an ascending triangle pattern that indicates a possible run to $17.67, although immediate resistance at $15.45 and $16.42 may impede progress. But slow, steady price growth makes you question the near-term upside relative to tokens that are in their infancy. Hedera Flicks a Hope Amid The Bearish Reality Hedera (HBAR) gained 5% at one point, bringing it close to $0.20, as short-term moving averages suggested an imminent bullish crossover. Nonetheless, BBTrend continues to stay glued to -1.85, indicative of continued selling pressure. A tentative break above the Tenkan-sen line proved encouraging, yet HBAR finds itself under pressure at the lip of the Ichimoku Cloud — a ceiling that has blocked all recovery efforts since March. If the momentum should fade support at $0.184 could break once more, sparking fresh fears of a continued fall below $0.17. With such meagerness of bullish signs, token which once touted enterprise-grade for its accoutrements from blockchain, seems to have little in way of prospects in anything approaching the short term. Mutuum Finance is Gaining Significant Momentum in its Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in its fourth stage of 11-stage presale, with the tokens being claimed at $0.025 each. Investors are rushing to secure positions ahead of a 20% price jump to $0.03 in Phase 5. The project’s $5.7 million fundraising haul and 7,400-strong holder base reflect surging demand for its decentralized lending model. Such a self-sustaining ecosystem is rarely seen in speculative-driven markets, enabled instead by organic buy pressure from revenue-distributed token buybacks and mtTokens—interest-accruing deposit certificates. Existing presale participants could potentially earn a 140% return at launch, as MUTM will list at $0.06. After launch projections are far more dramatic, though. Catalysts for a possible leap to $1.50 a 7,400% increase on current pricing include overcollateralized loans, peer-to-peer lending features and staking rewards, analysts said. This prediction matches the project’s intentional tokenomics: just 20% of supply goes to presale, while 35% powers liquidity mining for sustained long-term growth. Security and Scalability as The Core Priority Mutuum Finance is completing a smart contract audit with Certik, a step that should increase investors’ confidence. When finished, the audit findings will be published along official channels to counteract potential security fears seen in newer DeFi projects. Along with an overcollateralized stablecoin and dynamic interest rates, these measure put MUTM firmly in the teritory of being a usable substitute for traditional finance, and not simply an idle speculation. A New Challenger Rises As Chainlink and Hedera struggle with the lack of price action compared to their fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines urgency and utility. Its phased presale mechanism establishes scarcity, with each price climb reducing the window for low-entry profits. The project’s emphasis on providing real-world financial solutions — from liquidity provisioning to negotiated P2P loans — is in stark contrast to tokens that rely on nothing but market sentiment. In a saturated market, MUTM’s price point at $0.025 could soon just be a distant memory for investors looking for asymmetric returns.

As digital currencies become easier to access, projects like Litecoin and MANTRA have shown how early planning and clear utility can build lasting relevance. Litecoin has relied on its simplicity and speed for over a decade, while MANTRA has climbed by tapping into DeFi and tokenized real-world assets. Now, BlockDAG is taking a step further. Its X1 mobile miner and hybrid DAG + PoW approach are not just expanding its user base—they’re changing how people access and use crypto. Mining with a phone may be the key to broader adoption. Litecoin’s Ten-Year Track Record of Speed & Practicality Litecoin (LTC) was introduced on October 7, 2011, by Charlie Lee, a former engineer at Google. It was designed to be a lighter, faster version of Bitcoin, offering shorter transaction times and a larger supply. The first block was mined shortly after, on October 13, 2011. Since then, Litecoin has remained among the most valued cryptocurrencies by market cap. Take November 2013 as an example—Litecoin’s price doubled in just 24 hours. By early 2020, it crossed a $10 billion market cap, showing a 100% rise since August 2020. On March 24, 2025, Litecoin traded at $93.67 with a market cap of $7.14 billion. Technologically, Litecoin has often led the way. It adopted Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the Lightning Network before Bitcoin. These updates have helped it stay relevant in a fast-moving crypto space. MANTRA’s Quick Rise Through DeFi & Real-World Assets MANTRA (OM) was first developed in late 2019 and officially launched in early 2021 by founders John Patrick Mullin, Will Corkin, and Rodrigo Quan Miranda. It focuses on decentralized finance, offering tools for staking, lending, and governance. Its OM token has a total supply of 888,888,888 units. When OM launched in August 2020, it was priced around $0.3820. The price dipped to $0.0175 by October 2023, but things turned around dramatically. In February 2025, OM reached a record high of $8.53—an increase of over 15,000% in just a year. As of March 26, 2025, OM trades at $6.53 and holds a market cap of $6.44 billion. What’s powering this surge? MANTRA’s work in bringing real-world assets like real estate and clean energy onto the blockchain, along with its generous staking rewards. Its mainnet launch and key alliances have also added fuel to its growing popularity. BlockDAG X1 App Makes Crypto Mining Easier Than Ever BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has shifted the idea of crypto participation. Now, anyone with a smartphone can mine crypto without needing pricey equipment or deep technical knowledge. Over 800,000 users are already mining through the app, transforming ordinary phone users into active members of a global decentralized network. The secret lies in simplicity. The X1 app offers a straightforward setup, an intuitive interface, and real-time mining rewards. Instead of investing time and money into mining rigs, users only need a phone and a few minutes to get started. This easy access has helped fuel the explosive growth of BlockDAG’s presale, which has now raised $209 million. In batch 27, coins are priced at $0.0248—marking a 2,380% jump from batch 1. So far, over 19 billion coins have been sold, showing the strong backing behind the project and its growing community. By combining phone mining with a dual DAG + PoW consensus, BlockDAG has created a system where contributing to the network is both practical and encouraged. It’s not just attracting users—it’s changing how people think about Web3 participation. And it’s gaining traction. Shifting the Crypto Experience Litecoin built a strong foundation. MANTRA introduced real-world utility. But BlockDAG is changing how people get involved with crypto at a basic level. While Litecoin and MANTRA rely on steady communities and focused tools, BlockDAG removes entry barriers and welcomes anyone—no tech background needed. The X1 app allows smartphones to connect directly to a secure, high-speed network. It proves that making crypto easier to access can also drive real growth. As the industry evolves, the platforms that simplify user entry—without cutting corners on performance—won’t just succeed. They’ll shape what comes next.

Aave showcased this early on by launching a DeFi lending platform that users could immediately benefit from, while Cronos strengthened its presence through direct integration with the Crypto.com network. What made both gain traction was delivering functioning platforms from the start. Rather than wait until launch day, BlockDAG (BDAG) is giving the public full access to its Beta Testnet before the mainnet rollout. This move invites users to explore, test, and interact with its system at an early stage. In a market where working models speak louder than forecasts, BlockDAG’s testnet-first method gives people something real to evaluate. Aave: A Pioneer in DeFi Lending Solutions Since its launch in 2020, Aave has introduced a new way for people to lend and borrow digital assets without needing banks or middlemen. Its system allows users to earn from liquidity pools or take out loans directly using crypto assets. Over the years, Aave included features like flash loans, cross-chain support, and flexible collateral swaps, securing its spot as a DeFi leader. By mid-2024, it held over $11 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), showing strong and steady traction. The AAVE token—used in governance and staking—reached almost $400 in early 2025, partially fueled by major backers like World Liberty Financial. On March 26, 2025, AAVE traded at about $188.72, giving it a market cap near $2.85 billion. Those who joined the platform early have gained significantly, showing how Aave has kept pace in the evolving DeFi space. Cronos: Connecting DeFi with Crypto.com Users Launched in November 2021 by Crypto.com, Cronos (CRO) aimed to link centralized finance to decentralized networks. With its fast processing and low transaction fees, Cronos smoothly integrates Crypto.com’s tools with DeFi apps. Because of this, the network quickly rose among the top 10 chains by TVL, with over 1 million users and more than 500 dApps supported by early 2025. On March 26, 2025, CRO was priced around $0.105981, giving it a market valuation close to $2.82 billion. Looking forward, its 2025 forecast ranges from $0.070 to $0.2644, reflecting cautious hope from experts. Returns have been mixed—some gained from high points, while others faced market dips. Still, Cronos remains central to Crypto.com’s bigger aim of combining traditional and decentralized finance. BlockDAG’s Testnet Rollout Builds Real-Time Trust What makes BlockDAG’s testnet strategy different is how it’s focused on showing real results before anything else. While others talk about what’s coming, BlockDAG is already letting people use its features. With twice the speed of the alpha version, a simple no-code tool for creating NFTs and tokens, and working dApps already being tested by users, the Beta Testnet proves the system is fully active. This open testing approach is catching attention. BlockDAG has raised $209 million through its crypto presale , now in batch 27 at a rate of $0.0248. More than 19 billion coins have already been purchased, delivering a 2,380% return since batch 1. These numbers show people aren’t just interested—they’re participating. What also stands out is the weekly testnet BDAG coin vesting, which keeps users engaged and supports system testing under real-use scenarios. This model builds reliability through direct interaction, not just technical claims. Instead of waiting until everything is finished, BlockDAG has chosen to stay open from the start. Letting users explore its inner workings before the mainnet sets a new bar for what future blockchain projects can do to gain early credibility. Wrapping Up! Aave made its mark by providing real services. Cronos gained ground through its tight links with a popular platform. Both delivered usable solutions. BlockDAG is following the same core principle—early access instead of hype. Its public testnet is more than just a feature—it’s a message that showing working results matters more than future talk. Unlike others waiting until launch day, BlockDAG has made its system available for feedback and testing right now. That shows a focus on openness and responsibility—traits that often matter most in building long-term trust in this space.

While $TRUMP briefly surged due to a presidential endorsement, it quickly collapsed. Dragoin, on the other hand, has steadily grown, backed by a well-structured model with real utility, strong community involvement, and an incentivizing presale system. Although $TRUMP saw a temporary spike after Donald Trump called it “The Greatest of Them All,” the coin has since lost more than 75%. Meanwhile, Dragoin ($DDGN) is gaining momentum and is being recognized by many as the true meme coin of 2025. The $TRUMP Coin Saga: A Surge and Sudden Crash On March 22, 2025, Donald Trump’s post on Truth Social calling $TRUMP “The Greatest of Them All” caused the coin to surge by 12%, reaching a price of $5.67. However, the excitement was short-lived. What seemed like a meme coin miracle quickly became a textbook example of a pump-and-dump scheme. Within 48 hours of the endorsement, $TRUMP lost more than 40% of its value, leading to mass sell-offs and panic among investors. By this week, the coin has seen a 75% drop from its peak, leaving many traders holding a token that once seemed like a winning bet. The market cap, which briefly reached eight figures, has since retraced sharply. $TRUMP is now seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of influencer-backed meme coins. The problem with $TRUMP wasn’t the initial surge—it was the lack of any real utility. Meme coins rely on virality, but $TRUMP had no roadmap, no clear purpose, and no intrinsic value. Once the hype faded, investors were left without anything to hold on to. Enter Dragoin. Dragoin’s Success: Building for the Future Where $TRUMP faltered with a burst of hype, Dragoin ($DDGN) is carefully building for long-term success. Dragoin is more than just another meme coin—it’s a fully immersive experience with real-world engagement and rewards. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Dragoin features a play-to-earn game where users can hatch, train, and battle dragons through Telegram. A standout feature of Dragoin is its presale model. Instead of relying on chaotic hype, Dragoin has implemented a structured 25-stage presale. Each stage sees a gradual price increase, rewarding early buyers and ensuring steady price momentum. Half of Dragoin’s total token supply—200 billion tokens—is reserved for the presale, and any unsold tokens are permanently burned. This deflationary model not only prevents inflation but also creates scarcity, benefiting long-term holders. The presale has proven to be a key growth driver. As new buyers enter at different stages, the buzz around Dragoin builds organically. This grassroots momentum is fueling a committed user base that sees the value in the project and is engaged for the long haul, contributing to its ongoing success. Dragoin’s Real-World Utility and Community Focus Dragoin’s true value lies in its utility, which sets it apart from coins like $TRUMP that rely solely on celebrity endorsements. Dragoin offers users real ways to engage and earn rewards. Built on Telegram, the play-to-earn game allows players to hatch, train, and battle dragons, earning $DDGN tokens as they progress. This creates a dynamic ecosystem where users are actively involved, unlike static coins with no practical use. Beyond the game, Dragoin provides staking rewards, airdrops, referral bonuses, and, most importantly, full decentralization. Once launched, the smart contract will be renounced, putting control in the hands of the community rather than a centralized entity. This transparency and community-driven approach are attracting investors who are tired of meme coins that operate behind closed doors with little accountability. Dragoin’s roadmap is clear, with achievable milestones. In Q2 2025, the game will officially launch, accompanied by staking features and partnerships with key crypto influencers. By Q3, Dragoin aims to be listed on exchanges, introduce new gameplay mechanics, and host seasonal events and competitive tournaments to keep users engaged long-term. These aren’t empty promises—they are tangible actions already being executed. Dragoin is focused on long-term growth, not short-lived hype, making it a more sustainable and promising project compared to $TRUMP. Why Dragoin Beats $TRUMP The stark contrast between $TRUMP and Dragoin highlights how the meme coin market has evolved. In the past, coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu relied solely on social momentum. But in 2025, investors are becoming more discerning. After being burned by empty tokens, traders are seeking coins that offer engagement, mechanics, and lasting value. $TRUMP’s 75% drop proves what happens when a meme coin depends entirely on celebrity hype. Dragoin, on the other hand, is showing what happens when a meme coin has a solid foundation, a growing user base, and a clearly defined roadmap. With a deflationary supply, a thriving play-to-earn system, and a roadmap focused on transparency, Dragoin is reshaping the meme coin landscape. It’s proving that meme coins can be both fun and functional, viral and valuable. Most importantly, it’s showing that the title of “The Greatest of Them All” isn’t earned through a tweet—it’s earned through smart planning and real community participation.

A letter sent by the American embassy in Paris and other embassies around the European Union warns that Donald Trump’s order applies to firms outside the United States if they are suppliers or service providers to the federal government. The embassies also included a questionnaire titled “Certification regarding compliance with applicable federal anti-discrimination law.” This questionnaire instructs recipients to confirm they do not operate any programs that promote DEI in ways that violate anti-discrimination statutes. The document states, “Department of State contractors must certify that they do not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable anti-discrimination laws and agree that such certification is material for purposes of the government’s payment decision and therefore subject to the False Claims Act.” According to the same sources, the letter and questionnaire were dispatched by US diplomats in eastern EU states and Belgium. A senior banker in Paris expressed shock when he read the letter, saying, “It’s crazy . . . but everything is now possible. The rule of the strongest now prevails.” Several companies contacted the French finance ministry about the demand, prompting concern within the government. A person close to France’s economy minister Eric Lombard said, “This practice reflects the values of the new US government. They are not the same as ours. The ministry will remind his counterparts in the US government of that.” Les Échos newspaper first reported the letter’s existence. Some executives will not respond to the request Initial legal reviews suggest that the measure may not be legally enforceable outside the United States. Some executives and their legal teams have chosen not to answer the questionnaire for the time being. This strain has intensified as the United States shifts away from long-standing alliances, particularly over Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this week, Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on auto imports into the United States. He also raised tariffs on European steel and aluminum, prompting the EU to explore reciprocal tariffs. Europe has not yet decided which goods to target. Tensions between Washington and the EU escalated after the recent Signal chat leaks. Vice-President JD Vance wrote, “I just hate bailing Europe out again,” to which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth replied, “It’s PATHETIC.” France has historically not accepted DEI programs. That is because national laws restrict how racial and ethnic data can be collected. Employers are forbidden from using a person’s background when making hiring or promotion decisions. According to Les Échos, the US order said, “If you do not agree to sign this document, we would be grateful if you could kindly provide us with detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal department.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The company announced on Friday that it will launch an online claims portal on March 31. This will allow affected investors to file for compensation for the Terra collapse. Notably, the deadline for submission is April 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET, and late claims will not be accepted. Terraform Labs Unveils Eligibility Criteria The claims process is part of Terraform Labs’ bankruptcy plan and will be handled by Kroll, a third-party company. As announced, investors can submit claims through an official website but must prove they own the assets. Notably, the review may take longer if a claim is based on screenshots or manually uploaded documents. Claims could also be denied if the evidence is not strong enough. To qualify for compensation, investors must have owned specific cryptocurrencies from the Terra ecosystem at the time of the collapse. These assets are listed in the official case documents, and only those who meet the requirements will be considered. The payout will not include assets with less than $100 in liquidity and Terra 2.0’s Luna token. What Happens Next? After submission, claims will be reviewed and verified. Initial decisions will be shared within 90 days after the deadline. If a claim is approved, the investor will receive a share of the available funds. The amount must depend on the total number of approved claims and the money left for payouts. However, it is uncertain how much investors will recover or what percentage of their losses will be paid back. A Look Back at the Terra Collapse The Terra ecosystem collapsed in May 2022, wiping billions of investor funds. Luna’s market capitalization fell from $41 billion to $6 million in just three days, marking one of the worst crashes in crypto history. The TerraUSD stablecoin, which was designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar, lost its value and never recovered. The collapse also led to legal troubles for Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon . Kwon faced multiple lawsuits and regulatory investigations across different countries. The Terraform downfall led to many bankruptcies in the crypto sector, affecting companies exposed to Terra’s ecosystem. This claims process may be the last opportunity for investors who suffered losses to recover a portion of their funds.

Trump doubles down on tariffs despite warnings from economists and Wall Street Trump consistently disregards economic experts and has ignored pushback from congressional Republicans and Wall Street. He believes that aggressive tariffs are the best way to restore American manufacturing and boost federal coffers. His administration has already imposed tariffs on major industries. The move is a huge escalation of Trump’s under-the-radar trade war, which will likely affect U.S. economic policy for years. Advisers to the president are still deciding the exact nature of the tariffs, weighing their potential economic costs against Trump’s vision of a more self-sufficient American economy. Trump’s campaign to raise tariffs has already shaken financial markets. Earlier this week, his administration declared a 25% tariff on all automobile imports , panicking investors and plunging stock prices. Now, he is considering expanding tariffs similar to those of other parts of the economy, including pharmaceuticals and lumber. The market response has been immediate and negative. The three big U.S. stock indices dropped last Friday, and analysts pointed to the uncertainty of Trump’s widening trade war as a key driving force. Economists have cautioned that these retaliatory tariffs will discourage economic growth, inflate prices, and even lead the country into recession. Even Republican lawmakers traditionally bound by free-market orthodoxy have grown nervous. Stephen Moore, a longtime Trump ally and co-founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, said the emphasis on tariffs was eclipsing debate about tax policy. He said imposing tariffs was not the answer to saving manufacturing jobs. Trump pushes tariffs as a win-win strategy for the U.S Still, Trump remains confident that tariffs will bring economic benefits. He thinks they will compel U.S. trading partners to reduce their tariffs and encourage American firms to repatriate manufacturing. People close to Trump say he regrets listening to advisers who talked him out of higher tariffs during his first term. Now, he is determined to act on those instincts. He has revived the debate over a single, across-the-board import duty that would simplify the tariff system and thwart exemptions that could dilute its power. Tariffs are more than just a negotiating tool for Trump; they are a centrepiece​ of his economic policy. He has openly touted import taxes, which he called the “most beautiful” word in the dictionary. He even called for the declaration of April 2 as a day of national celebration, as he believes tariffs will change the economy. Among those allies was former White House strategist Steve Bannon, who pitched the idea. Rather than celebrating Trump’s birthday, Bannon said April 2 should be made “Liberation Day,” a national day of mourning for the lost jobs, skills, and trade he claimed had returned to America and its people. Trump has not been shy about levying tariffs, a position that has divided Republicans. While many in the party support using tariffs as a short-term negotiating tactic, Trump seems more enthusiastic about permanent trade obstacles that would remap the American economy. Trump’s former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, “Any number of options are still under consideration.” He said officials were looking at every option and working hard to make the idea of a reciprocal tariff popular with the American public and functional. However, some Republican lawmakers are uneasy about the long-term consequences. They worry that permanently adding tariffs could upend supply chains, raise consumer prices, and undermine critical industries that depend on worldwide commerce. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) acknowledged the risks and expressed a sense of unease. But he said that overall, many were still inclined to give the president the benefit of the doubt, given his past accomplishments. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) offered a slightly separate view, saying that he didn’t see tariffs as a means of adding to the bottom line but as a means of returning jobs to the U.S. economy. Tariffs disrupt farming and manufacturing industries The agricultural sector is closely monitoring Trump’s next moves. North Dakota farmers, for instance, were mostly insulated from earlier rounds of tariffs but feared the consequences of any further actions. During Trump’s first term, the administration provided $23 billion to farmers affected by the trade war with China. And some lawmakers have begun consultations with the Department of Agriculture on providing similar aid, should it be necessary. Manufacturers are nervous, too. Some believe tariffs could give them an edge by making foreign competition less affordable. In contrast, others worry they will need to raise prices or lay off workers because of higher import costs. The battle over Trump’s trade policy indicates a deep split in his political base. Some right-of-centre economists claim tariffs can be used to pressure other countries to drop trade barriers. Others have come to see them as a permanent solution sufficient to defend American industry. Nick Iacovella, the Coalition for a Prosperous America vice president, advocates permanent tariffs. He justifies using tariffs as a temporary bargaining chip, which contradicts Trump’s vision of reviving American manufacturing. His group has proposed a broad 18% tariff on virtually all products.

However, unlike the hype-driven tokens of past cycles, the leading meme coins this time around bring much more to the table. These tokens mix community engagement with practical utility, scarcity-driven economics, and well-thought-out long-term plans. Meme coins are no longer just jokes—they’re evolving into substantial ecosystems. Among the meme coins making waves for Q2, Dragoin ($DDGN) stands out. It’s not just another meme token but one of the most polished and well-structured projects in the space. While other contenders are still gaining traction, Dragoin’s presale success, utility, and decentralized framework have already set it apart. For those eyeing the next big thing this quarter, Dragoin is undoubtedly a project to watch, along with a few select others. Dragoin: The Meme Coin Set to Dominate Q2 Dragoin is far from your typical meme token with a cute mascot and a few flashy promises. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Dragoin offers something most meme coins lack—active, hands-on engagement. It features an interactive, play-to-earn game directly on Telegram, where players can hatch, train, and battle dragons, earning $DDGN tokens for in-game activity. This gamified approach sets Dragoin apart, turning passive holders into engaged participants. But the game is just the start. Dragoin’s presale is organized into 25 stages, each with a slightly higher price. This structure not only rewards early investors but generates ongoing momentum as each stage sells out. Of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens, 50% are allocated for the presale, and unsold tokens will be permanently burned, tightening the supply. This deflationary model is crucial. It ensures that supply continues to shrink over time as demand rises, especially when the game goes global in Q2. Unlike many meme coins that flood the market with tokens, Dragoin is deliberately reducing supply while fostering a loyal player base—two key factors that are likely to drive up long-term value. When the presale concludes, Dragoin will renounce ownership of its smart contract, making it a fully decentralized token. This transparency, coupled with the absence of any central authority, ensures there will be no rug pulls—just a community-governed token with a sustainable economy. This level of integrity is rare in the meme coin space and has already garnered attention from seasoned traders who are wary of influencer-led projects that disappear overnight. With staking rewards, referral bonuses, airdrops, and major exchange listings planned for the coming quarters, Dragoin is on track for growth. Its combination of meme appeal, gamified functionality, and strategic tokenomics positions it as a leading contender not just for Q2, but for the entire year. Cheems: Reinventing Its Meme Legacy Cheems has been a fan favorite in the meme coin world for years, thanks to its “doge with a speech impediment” persona. But in Q2 2025, Cheems is trying to evolve. It’s shifting towards more serious initiatives, integrating philanthropy and introducing staking incentives for long-term holders. Cheems is still beloved for its strong community ties. Meme contests, giveaways, and collaborations with creators keep the community active and engaged. However, the heavy reliance on nostalgia could limit its growth potential in a market that’s increasingly focused on utility. While Cheems may still provide short-term profits, its future success will hinge on its ability to innovate beyond its original meme-driven appeal. MEMEX: The Meme Coin ETF MEMEX presents a unique investment opportunity for those looking to diversify their meme coin portfolio. Acting like an ETF for meme coins, MEMEX bundles top-performing tokens into one. This approach removes the guesswork for investors who want exposure to multiple meme coins without tracking each one individually. With automated rebalancing and exposure to trending tokens, MEMEX offers a less risky entry point into the meme coin market. It’s not about betting on a single coin like Dragoin or Cheems, but rather about riding the wave of the broader meme economy. While it may not have the viral potential of standalone meme coins, MEMEX offers a lower-risk alternative for those who want to join the meme coin craze without diving into the complexity of research and tracking. Why Utility-Driven Meme Coins Will Be Winners in Q2 As we move into Q2, the meme coin market is showing a clear shift towards projects that offer more than just fun. With increasing liquidity and a growing number of new crypto users, the demand for meme coins with actual engagement features, community governance, and long-term vision is soaring. Dragoin represents the new breed of meme coins—fun and functional. It’s not just about holding tokens; it’s about playing, earning, and building with the project. From its 25-stage presale to its deflationary mechanics and the upcoming game launch, Dragoin is setting up for a successful Q2. While established names like Cheems and broader options like MEMEX still have their place, Dragoin checks all the boxes for a breakout meme coin this quarter. As more investors shift towards tokens with substance, Dragoin’s chances of becoming one of 2025’s biggest meme phenomena grow stronger every day.

XRP’s dynamic liquidity, strategic market positioning, and high-speed transactions have long made it a powerhouse in digital finance. This latest insight underscores the vast potential within the XRP ecosystem, reinforcing its appeal to forward-thinking investors. With the crypto founder’s revelations, XRP is again at the forefront of high-stakes financial maneuvers. Unveiling The $44,000 To $5.5 Million XRP Investment Strategy ​In a notable development within the cryptocurrency community, a crypto founder, Edward Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, has articulated a compelling vision for XRP’s future valuation. XRP, known for its rapid transaction speeds and scalability, has been a focal point in the digital currency landscape. The crypto founder believes that with the right strategy and timing, a $44,000 investment in XRP could grow into a $5.5 million fortune. According to his calculations, buying XRP at $2.40 now could turn into $5.4 million once the token reaches $300. Farina has always believed that the price of XRP is poised to make grown men cry for the rest of their years, urging individuals to position themselves among those who will celebrate rather than regret. In addition, Amonyx, a social media influencer from X, reveals data citing that investors are buying XRP tokens in massive quantities, further solidifying the crypto founder’s claims. With the crypto founder’s projections of a $44,000 investment skyrocketing to $5.5 million, the excitement surrounding XRP’s potential continues to build.

He also believes the crypto community should prioritize open-source funding instead, as public goods funding is still subject to social desirability bias. Meanwhile, his Ethereum network will need to increase its data capacity to accommodate an L2 model release. The network, though, does have an upgrade in the works. Pectra, possibly launching by April 30, could raise blob space to up to 6 units. Moreover, by the end of the year, the network plans to have 72 units through the Fusaka upgrade as well or, at least, bulk up to 12-24 units. Ethereum L2 model will use optimistic, zero-knowledge and trusted execution environment proof types Buterin’s L2 proposal will feature a system with a 2/3 multi-signature mechanism, utilizing optimistic, zero-knowledge (ZK), and trusted execution environment (TEE) proofs. That implies that before any transaction is finalized, it has to pass through ZK and TEE validations. Then, a seven-day optimistic challenge period is provided if the transaction does not meet the former checks’ criteria. Additionally, the system can be upgraded to proof logic, but there will be a 30-day delay per network policy. Generally, the L2 model will maintain properties such as decentralization and trust minimization but improve in terms of speed and network security. However, Buterin cautioned that using common code across ZK rollups might allow bugs to spread between them, increasing the overall risk. Wei Dai, a research partner at 1kxnetwork, detailed, “This means that the finality of rollups can be as fast as zk proving (~ Buterin has encouraged people to take on open-source funding instead of public goods funding Buterin also called for the change to open-source funding from public goods funding. He argued that the term “public good” can be “stretched so easily.” Buterin explained that the word “public good” is often used to describe a ‘good that comes from the government’ and not exactly something great in an economic sense, so the name may create a false perception. He added that people already perceive public good funding as lacking rigour and being cultivated on the basis of social desirability. He insisted that contrary to public goods funding, open-source funding is more transparent and could drive collaboration. He, however, cautioned against taking on any other open-source project, asking people only to support those that add value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Qubetics Is Climbing Fast as Ethereum and Arweave Gain New Ground,https://thecoinrise.com/best-cryptos-with-1000x-potential-right-now-qubetics-is-climbing-fast-as-ethereum-and-arweave-gain-new-ground/,"What if the next crypto that could change your entire financial future isn’t Bitcoin or Ethereum—but something flying under the radar with insane growth potential? Yeah, we’re talkin’ about the kind of plays that early buyers brag about for years. Right now, the crypto space is bubbling with innovation, and two names that keep popping up are Arweave and Ethereum. They’ve both been making waves with their recent updates and tech-forward moves. But there’s a fresh contender stepping into the ring—and it’s not just hyped, it’s solving real-world headaches that these giants couldn’t. Say hello to Qubetics ($TICS)—a beast of a project that’s not here to play around. It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator that brings together major blockchains under one roof, giving users and businesses total freedom without locking them into any one chain. Plus, the Qubetics presale is absolutely exploding right now, with over $15.5 million already raised. And the buzz? It’s not just hype—it’s backed by features, real functionality, and seriously attractive price entry points that make this one of the best cryptos with 1000x potential. If you’ve been watching for the best crypto presale of the year, this might just be it. Qubetics’ Game-Changing Wallet: A Web3 Superpower in Your Pocket So here’s the thing—Web3 sounds cool, but let’s be real: most people still find it confusing, clunky, and full of annoying trade-offs. Qubetics doesn’t just recognize that—it fixes it. Their flagship product? A non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that finally brings everything under one roof. It’s like having Apple Pay, MetaMask, and PayPal all rolled into one—but with the power of blockchain behind it. For an average user, think about being able to swap between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and other blockchains seamlessly—no jumping through hoops, no bridges, no headaches. Everything just works. A college student can use it to pay for their Spotify subscription with $TICS or crypto-backed Visa, while a freelancer can invoice global clients in stablecoins directly from the wallet. Total freedom, total control. Now, imagine a mid-sized eCommerce business trying to accept crypto from customers worldwide. Normally, this would be a nightmare—so many chains, different wallets, compatibility issues. But with Qubetics, they can integrate a single wallet that automatically routes and converts crypto across chains, all while ensuring the customer experience stays buttery smooth. And there’s more—Qubetics has also integrated virtual card functionality. Yup, users can mint a virtual debit card linked to their crypto wallet and use it for real-world purchases just like any Visa card. Everything is on-chain, traceable, and secure. That’s the kind of leap Web3 needed. No more disconnected tools or sketchy third-party platforms. So whether you’re a small biz owner, a full-time crypto trader, or someone who just wants to buy coffee with crypto, Qubetics gives you that flexibility with no compromises. It’s no wonder this project is now being listed among the best cryptos with 1000x potential . Massive ROI Projections from Qubetics Presale Prove Why It’s One of the Best Cryptos with 1000x Potential Let’s get real—everyone wants to know the numbers. And the numbers behind the Qubetics presale? Straight-up insane. Right now, the presale is in its 27th stage, with the token priced at $0.1300. Each stage lasts exactly 7 days and ends at midnight every Sunday, with the price increasing by 10% like clockwork. So yeah, time really is money here. So far, Qubetics has raised over $15.5 million, attracted more than 23,900 holders, and sold 504 million tokens. That’s a serious flex. Now here’s where things get juicy: if you jump in now at $0.1300, here’s what the projected ROI looks like based on where $TICS could go: At $1 post-presale = 669.13% ROI At $5 = 3,745.67% ROI At $6 = 4,514.80% ROI At $10 = 7,591.33% ROI At $15 = 11,437% ROI Let’s break it down: say someone throws in just $1,000 at the current price. If $TICS hits $10, they’re walking away with $76,900. If it touches $15? That’s a clean $115,350. Now compare that to most coins that barely double in price during their presale. This is why Qubetics isn’t just part of the conversation—it is the conversation when people are talking about the best cryptos with 1000x potential. With the Qubetics presale gaining serious traction, this might just be the best crypto presale of 2025. No fluff, no hype—just raw potential backed by utility, tech, and smart economics. Arweave’s Storage Revolution: Data That Lives Forever Let’s talk about Arweave. This one’s been quietly cooking something powerful. Arweave isn’t just a blockchain—it’s permanent data storage on-chain. You upload something once, and it’s there forever. This isn’t just cool for personal files or NFTs—it’s huge for journalism, scientific records, or entire web apps. The real kicker? Arweave recently stepped up their game by optimizing storage costs through a protocol-level upgrade, letting users store more data for way less. Add that to increased adoption through integrations with projects like Bundlr and Kyve, and it’s easy to see why people are getting hyped again. What separates Arweave is its true “set it and forget it” model. You pay once, store forever—no monthly fees, no hosting risks. Developers love it because it’s reliable and censorship-resistant. Think about entire decentralized websites or DeFi dashboards that can live on-chain without needing traditional web servers. While it’s not built for payments or finance like Ethereum or Qubetics, it still lands high on the list of best cryptos with 1000x potential because it’s filling a unique niche—and doing it well. Data is the new gold, and Arweave is building the vault. Ethereum’s Smart Contract Empire Keeps Evolving Ethereum doesn’t need an intro—it’s the OG smart contract platform. But just because it’s a household name doesn’t mean it’s sitting still. Recently, Ethereum devs rolled out updates focused on scaling and slashing gas fees, especially with Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum booming. Plus, the ecosystem is expanding fast. New dApps, DeFi tools, NFT platforms—you name it, it’s happening on Ethereum first. And with the upcoming “Proto-Danksharding” features on the horizon, scalability is only going to get better. The focus is on speed, efficiency, and sustainability. What really gives Ethereum lasting power is the community. It’s massive, always building, and always testing the limits of what’s possible in Web3. From DAOs to decentralized ID systems, Ethereum is the engine behind a huge chunk of the decentralized internet. Is it still one of the best cryptos with 1000x potential? Maybe not at its current size—but that doesn’t mean it won’t 5x or 10x again, especially with global adoption heating up. Ethereum might not be the wildest bet on the board, but it’s one of the most secure. Conclusion: These Are the Coins to Watch—But One Stands Out In a sea of crypto projects, only a few really have the juice to go 1000x—and Qubetics, Arweave, and Ethereum are all bringing serious value to the table. Ethereum continues to lead with its DeFi and smart contract dominance. Arweave is carving out a niche as the go-to for permanent data storage, locking in its spot for long-term relevance. But Qubetics? That’s the dark horse turning heads fast. With a real working product, exploding presale, and powerful utility that bridges multiple blockchains into one seamless ecosystem, Qubetics is clearly positioning itself as one of the best cryptos with 1000x potential. And with time-sensitive presale stages, there’s real urgency for community members to join this crypto presale while it’s still under the radar. This isn’t about hype—it’s about getting in early on something that’s got legs, brains, and serious traction.

The Nasdaq Stock Market submitted a proposal this week to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list and trade shares of Grayscale Avalanche Trust, which would be entirely tied to the price of the layer-1 project’s native asset, AVAX. Grayscale isn’t the first financial giant to file for an Avalanche ETF. Documents submitted to the state of Delaware earlier this month suggest VanEck also hopes to launch a fund tied to the Ethereum ( ETH ) rival. Coinbase Custody will serve as the custodian for Grayscale’s Avalanche ETF if it’s approved. The crypto asset manager also hopes to launch funds tied to Cardano ( ADA ), Solana ( SOL ), XRP and Hedera ( HBAR ). The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ETFs for trading last July. Two financial firms, Franklin Templeton and Hashdex, also launched joint BTC-ETH ETFs earlier this year. AVAX is trading at $20.36 at time of writing. The 17th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 8% in the past 24 hours.

Over 110,000 verified investors—plus waves of developers and miners—are getting early access to what’s being called one of the most community-powered testnets ever launched. While others test in silence, BlockDAG is running a full-scale simulation of what’s coming in 2025. And with $209 million raised in under 10 months, this isn’t just a test—it’s a statement. This isn’t your average trial run. BlockDAG is turning its testnet into an experience, rewarding its early community with a $60,000 giveaway in real BDAG tokens for stress-testing the network before the big mainnet debut. 110,000 Wallets Are Already Live and Testing the Network BlockDAG’s testnet is anything but small-scale. Already, more than 110,000 wallets—straight from its presale community—have been activated. Every one of them gets 10,000 testnet BDAG tokens, automatically dropped through a smart contract that mirrors mainnet’s real vesting engine. CEO Antony Turner didn’t hold back at Keynote 3: “Today marks another significant milestone. We’re excited to announce the official launch of our first Beta Testnet.” This isn’t a dry dev preview. It’s a full-blown blockchain rehearsal—with mining, token creation, wallet activity, and smart contract deployment all live. The setup includes a powerful Beta Explorer, a no-code Token and NFT Wizard, and a fully integrated IDE—giving developers and users everything they need to build, test, and interact in real-time. $60K in Rewards Up for Grabs—Let the Race Begin BlockDAG doesn’t do boring things. That’s why it’s handing out $60,000 in BDAG tokens (based on the $0.05 launch price) to its top testnet contributors. Running until May 31, 2025, the campaign rewards users who go the extra mile. The prize structure includes: Top 10 wallets by transaction volume Top 10 mining nodes by testnet BDAG mined Top 10 wallet holders with the biggest balances Each winner snags $2,000 in real BDAG—not placeholders. Turner nailed it during the keynote: “We’re even going to incentivize you to get involved.” This isn’t fluff—it’s a stress test with real stakes. The setup pushes the smart contracts, vesting mechanics, and infrastructure to perform under pressure. Mainnet Is Coming Fast—And This Testnet Is Paving the Way While the Beta Testnet is already turning heads, it’s just the warm-up act. BlockDAG is preparing for a full mainnet rollout in 2025, and it’s aiming high: 2,000 TPS at launch with scalability to 15,000 TPS within two years. Developers are already building, thanks to the testnet’s no-code wizard, EVM compatibility, and a clean documentation portal. What’s more, this testnet forms the backbone of the DeFi tools BlockDAG plans to release—staking, lending, governance, and cross-chain bridges are all in the pipeline. Turner summed it up best during Keynote 3: “We’re orchestrating every element — from our underlying blockchain to supporting tools like our explorer, integrated development environments, indexers, and oracles — to work seamlessly as one trustless, decentralized network.” Why BlockDAG’s Testnet Isn’t Like the Others BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet isn’t just about checking boxes. Every user is helping build the future. By offering real tokens, live features, and raw on-chain pressure, BlockDAG has ditched the low-energy testnet playbook. With 110,000+ wallets already engaged, hundreds of miners running, and devs actively deploying, the hype isn’t artificial—it’s earned. BlockDAG is proving that its tech, people, and infrastructure can take the heat of a real-world launch. As Turner closed Keynote 3: “This isn’t just a test — it’s the first real step towards our fully operational decentralized ecosystem.” Presale: https://purchase.blockdag.network Website: https://blockdag.network Telegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial Discord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu The post BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet Just Went Public — 110K Users, Real Rewards And An Upcoming Mainnet appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Token Presale and ICO Insights|BlockDAG,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-03-30 00:00:30

Speculation about who might be next is growing as the cryptocurrency community is divided over Trump’s pardons. Names like Roger Ver, SBF, and CZ are dividing the prediction markets. Trump’s pardoning spree has led to heightened discussions within cryptocurrency circles with Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction platform, hosting bets on who might be next. Trump pardons cryptocurrency tycoons who had prior criminal convictions The cryptocurrency community on the Polymarket market, where voters can wager on potential future occurrences of real-life events, is divided among competitors. The “Who Will Trump Pardon in the First 100 Days?” event has seen notable names emerge, including Roger Ver, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Currently, the odds of SBF being pardoned stand at just 3%, while Roger Ver, a cryptocurrency tycoon who says he was the first investor in Bitcoin, has 4% of the vote. Ver, accused of avoiding $50 million in taxes, claimed that on March 2, he was politically targeted for spreading cryptocurrency. Changpeng Zhao, well known as CZ, Binance’s co-founder and former CEO, has about 8% of the votes in the polymarket on the chance to obtain Trump’s pardon. In April 2024, CZ was sentenced to four months imprisonment after pleading guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws. CZ was accused of violating companies’ rules to establish an appropriate anti-money laundering program, which allowed Binance to handle transactions involving the proceeds of illegal activity. On March 27, Trump pardoned three co-founders of the global cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, Samuel Reed, Benjamin Delo, and Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX. This was after they acknowledged in court that they had violated the Bank Secrecy Act more than three months ago. According to the charges, they allowed their business to operate without oversight and failed to establish know-your-customer and anti-money laundering procedures. In addition, apart from three co-founders of BitMEX, on January 21, President Donald Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who the FBI took into custody and seized his laptop on October 1, 2013, one day after becoming the 47th President of the U.S. It was shortly after, in 2015, a judge found him guilty of money laundering, computer hacking, and drug trafficking on the dark web site The Silk Road and sentenced him to life in prison. SBF makes last-ditch effort to secure a Trump pardon for FTX fraud Following his conviction for fraud related to the collapse of FTX, SBF’s family and supporters initially sought to prevent his sentencing. However, after receiving a 25-year prison term, Bankman-Fried has reportedly shifted strategies and is now pursuing a presidential pardon. According to reports, Bankman-Fried consulted a lawyer with ties to the president in addition to Carlson, who is close to Trump. A crypto lobbyist, who spoke while keeping the identity concealed because they were not permitted to comment publicly, responded, “zero,” when asked about the likelihood that Bankman-Fried’s efforts would succeed. On the other hand, several cryptocurrency lobbyists say that due to Trump’s growing connections to the crypto sector and his readiness to freely exercise his pardoning authority, there is still a chance that Bankman-Fried’s plan to get Trump to pardon him will succeed. Trump’s latest moves, including his pardon of Ulbricht and support for cryptocurrency initiatives during his campaign, have reinforced speculation that further crypto-related clemencies could be on the horizon.

XRP struggles above $2.60 while Solana drifts around $145, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes rapid ground during presale, quietly raking in early investors eyeing up possible 34x on return. Now in presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4, having raised $5.7 million so far and with over 7,400 holders in total to date, able buy token at a price of $0.025. The next phase will see a 20% escalation in price to $0.03 — essentially meaning anyone who buys in these early rounds will inevitably have a guaranteed instant profit 140%+ before any listings even occur. Ripple (XRP): Legal Clarity Fails to Maintain Momentum A surge of activity followed on March 19, with the number of active addresses hitting a peak at 626,854 after a recent court ruling spurred good news for XRP in an ongoing legal engagement with the SEC. Interest soon faded, however and active addresses fell to 50,000 by March 23. Significantly, whale transactions languished and veteran investors on the day also showed signs of hesitance. XRP resistance: Medium resistance around 2.60 with current price at 2.4387, momentum is weakly bullish with an RSI at 54.71. If demand does not increase, XRP’s support zone near $2.20-$2.30 may be retested. Solana (SOL): High and Dry Solana was bullish over the past week, rising 15% to $145.11. According to the Binance Futures data, there still is a strong bullish bias, where 78.82% of the traders are holding long positions. However, with the RSI at 69.73, SOL is nearing overbought territory, with further upside muted to a clear break over $150. While Solana is a solid choice, its growth prospects pale in comparison to the explosive growth potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in the short term. Mutuum Finance: The Best Presale With Eyes On Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just any token — that’s a structured DeFi lending platform with real utility, generating constant demand in the presale behind it. With the Phase 4 price of $0.025 versus the confirmed listing price of $0.06, that’s a 140% gain at launch, so you’re getting a bargain. That said analysts believe that post launch targets can be between $1-$5 for its token which would give potential returns of 90x upwards to 100x for those who got it early. The next phase carries a serious 20% hike. Those who do buy in now will see their holdings immediately reflect this increase in valuation once Phase 5 goes live. A Certik audit is underway on top of this; results expected to be published shortly, with increasing trust in the suction of the project’s security. While XRP and Solana tread lightly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are running a marathon with a freeway of exponential gains. Given that the audit is comprehensive and listing on exchanges is imminent, price propagation of MUTM may follow a well-known path in DeFi — meaning early action needed. While XRP hovers at $2.60 and Solana nears $145, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) races ahead in presale. Phase 4 tokens are priced at $0.025, set to rise to $0.03 in the next round, offering a 140% profit before listing at $0.06. Analysts predict post-launch targets between $1-$5, with potential 34x returns. A Certik audit adds security, fueling investor confidence. As XRP and SOL slow down, MUTM’s rapid growth offers a prime opportunity before prices surge again.

Meme Index and Pi Network are both making headlines: one for its curated exposure to meme coins, the other for the uncertainty around massive token unlocks. Each brings something different to the table, but their paths highlight a common investor dilemma—speculation versus structure. Dragoin ($DDGN) , by contrast, positions itself as a more grounded alternative. With a transparent 25-stage presale, real use cases through gaming, and a community-first model, it’s not just another meme coin—it’s one that gives affordable crypto investing a more purposeful direction. Meme Index Presale Nears Completion After Raising Over $4 Million Meme Index ($MEMEX) is approaching the final days of its presale, having successfully raised over $4 million. Meanwhile, this initiative offers investors a structured approach to the meme coin market by providing access to four distinct “baskets” of meme coins, each tailored to different risk preferences. Specifically, these baskets range from the Meme Titan Index, featuring established tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, to the Meme Frenzy Index, which includes newer, high-volatility tokens. Furthermore, by staking MEMEX tokens, investors can gain diversified exposure across these curated selections, aiming to mitigate the inherent volatility of individual meme coins. With that in mind, the presale price is set at $0.0166883, and only a few days remain before MEMEX debuts on exchanges. Thus, this represents a timely opportunity for those seeking diversified exposure in the meme coin sector. Pi Network Faces Price Pressure Amid Token Unlocks Pi Network’s token price has recently dipped below $0.80, marking a 3% decline in the past 24 hours, while trading volume surged by 33% to $327 million. Notably, this downturn coincides with the scheduled release of over 105.96 million Pi tokens (approximately $85 million) into circulation within the next month, averaging about 3.5 million tokens daily. Looking ahead, the outlook remains uncertain as an additional 1.6 billion Pi tokens are set to be unlocked over the coming year, introducing roughly 129 million tokens monthly until May 2028. As a result, analysts express concern that this influx could drive prices down to $0.60. On the other hand, some experts view the current dip as a potential buying opportunity, citing technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index and Fibonacci support levels that suggest a possible rebound. Ultimately, the trajectory of Pi Network’s price will largely depend on the market’s ability to absorb the increased supply and the implementation of strategies to stabilize token circulation. Dragoin Is Perfect for First-Time Crypto Investors Getting started in crypto doesn’t have to mean risking large amounts or diving into complex platforms. In fact, Dragoin ($DDGN) is offering a simple, accessible starting point that’s especially appealing to new or cautious investors. With a current presale price of just $0.0000292, Dragoin presents a low-barrier entry into a project built around real utility, community engagement, and entertainment.

Dragoin combines meme culture with a rewarding play-to-earn Telegram game and a roadmap full of value-driven milestones.

It’s not just affordable—it’s strategic. Smart Entry Points Matter—And Dragoin Might Just Be One Chasing trends without clear fundamentals can be risky—especially in early-stage crypto projects.

Outside of the technicals, one expert is pinning the blame on Ethereum’s failure to lead and innovate in the Web 3 space. Ethereum Price Continues Its Steep Decline According to CoinMarketCap data , technicals for Ethereum’s price are grim, with the second-largest cryptocurrency slipping below $1,900. At press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,828 and shows no signs of reversing the grim trend. A look at Ethereum’s chart does not indicate any signs of an uptrend or a short bounce to stoke embers of optimism. According to pseudonymous analyst Gum, Ethereum signals “relentless downward price action” that could see the asset fall below $1,800. Over the last day, Ethereum has fallen by nearly 4% while its seven-day chart indicates a decline of nearly 8%. The decline of Ethereum price follows a broader market correction with the global crypto market capitalization losing nearly 3% of its valuation. On the fundamentals side, things are equally grim for the Ethereum price. Unconfirmed reports of a potential Binance delisting ETH threaten to send Ethereum price to $1,500. Standard Chartered has slashed its ETH prediction for 2025 by 60%, projecting $4,000 as a potential price point by the end of the year. Expert Says Network Has Itself To Blame Ryan Watkins, co-founder at Syncracy Capital has taken swipes at Ethereum over its failure to keep pace with its peers. Watkins notes that a failure to capitalize on previous momentum during the last two market cycles is haunting Ethereum’s price. Ethereum has fallen down the pecking order to new blockchains with Solana and Bitcoin tipped to have the upper hand over the network. An inflow of bridged funds from Ethereum to Solana is accentuating the network’s worrying metrics. “No one wants to own a growth stage product that’s falling behind technologically superior competitors and bleeding market share,” said Watkins. Watkins says the only for Ethereum to pull itself from the rut is to “deliver generational leadership and growth.” However, with the Pectra upgrade around the corner, enthusiasts are optimistic that Ethereum can reach $10,000. Hardcore community members are poking holes in Solana’s rise, attributing it a memecoin craze compared to Ethereum’s neck-deep foray into decentralized finance (DeFi).

42613531,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=702507,1743297255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42613531.jpeg,Trump doesn’t care about higher auto prices and won’t fire anyone over Signal leaks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-doesnt-care-higher-auto-prices/,"President Donald Trump told NBC News on Saturday that he has no intention of firing anyone involved in Signal leaks, and he also declared he “couldn’t care less” if foreign car manufacturers raise prices in response to new U.S. tariffs. Speaking by phone from Florida, Trump insisted that he remains confident in the advisers who took part in the chat and argued that higher prices for imported automobiles would only help American automakers. In the interview , which touched on trade, national security, and his aspirations to take over Greenland, Trump insisted he is staying the course on his policy decisions. Trump said he sees no reason to let go of any officials linked to the Signal incident . He added that his administration carried out what he described as a “tremendously successful” strike against Houthi militants earlier in March and that the media should focus on that result rather than any mishaps in communication. “I don’t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” Trump said, adding, “We had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to talk about is nonsense. It’s fake news.” Trump discussing Signal chat leak in a meeting with ambassadors. Source: WFFA Trump also underscored his continued confidence in Waltz and Hegseth, saying, “I do,” when asked if he still has faith in them. “I have no idea what Signal is. I don’t care what Signal is. It’s the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about,” he added. Trump can’t care less about imported car prices going up When the discussion turned to trade, Trump spoke at length about his recent decision to impose 25% tariffs on all foreign-made automobiles. He repeatedly stated that he “couldn’t care less” if car prices for foreign models go up, since, from his perspective, that would only drive more American consumers to buy vehicles made in the United States. He added, “I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars.” Asked if he had warned motor industry executives against increasing prices, the president insisted he did no such thing and said that any company wanting to avoid tariffs should build cars in the United States. “The message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you’re going to make a lot of money. If you don’t, you’re going to have to probably come to the United States,” he stated. The president then confirmed that foreign auto parts will also face a 25% duty even if those parts go into vehicles assembled domestically, with certain exceptions tied to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). According to the White House, those USMCA-compliant components will remain tariff-free until the government establishes a process for imposing the new tax. However, Trump noted that the tariffs themselves are permanent. “Absolutely, they’re permanent, sure. The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we’re doing is being fair, and frankly, I’m being very generous,” he said. Trump’s new tariffs were announced on Wednesday, just weeks before his planned April 2 “ Liberation Day .” On that date, a separate set of tariffs on a range of consumer goods is scheduled to take effect. Several international leaders, such as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, quickly criticized the move. Carney argued that these tariffs were “unjustified” and signaled “the old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over.” Even so, Trump maintained that he does not plan to postpone the April 2 tariffs. When asked if he was open to negotiating, he said, “Only if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there’s no room for negotiation.” His stance on trade has contributed to uncertainty in global financial markets , and he has been accused by some experts of creating volatility on Wall Street. However, Trump dismissed these concerns. He pointed to polling numbers indicating that more Americans feel the country is on the right track than at almost any point in recent decades. “What I see is right track, wrong track. And the right track was the first time in like, 40 years where it was right track,” Trump remarked. Trump is serious about taking over Greenland Another topic raised was Trump’s ongoing pursuit of Greenland , a semi-autonomous territory governed by Denmark. While many observers have regarded the idea of buying Greenland as improbable, Trump insisted he is serious. “We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,” he said. “I don’t take anything off the table,” he continued, mentioning that he sees a “good possibility” the United States can do it without a military approach. JD Vance during a visit to Greenland earlier this week. Source: Sky News Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland on Friday with his wife, Usha. Trump referred to that visit and said he was not especially concerned about how Russia or other nations might perceive an American attempt to acquire the territory. “I don’t really think about that. I don’t really care,” he said. “Greenland’s a very separate subject, very different. It’s international peace. It’s international security and strength.” Trump maintained that the region’s geographic importance could justify American control, warning of ships from Russia, China, and other countries sailing near Greenland. “We’re not going to allow things to happen that are going to hurt the world or the United States,” he said, describing his position as a necessary measure of defense. What’s the takeaway? Throughout Saturday’s conversation, Trump showed no sign of scaling back his recent plans. According to the president, his decisions will strengthen America’s economic base and national security. He accused other nations of exploiting the United States for decades and insisted his administration would continue to put American interests first. “Countries have been taking advantage of us for so many years,” Trump said, underscoring that he believes higher tariffs will encourage companies to produce goods domestically. The president also brushed off the risk of higher consumer costs , economic wars, or strained alliances. Instead, he concluded by saying he has every intention of pressing forward. “People said we couldn’t do many things that we’ve done, and now they’re happening,” Trump said. “It’s been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

While top meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way, a new generation of crypto projects is pushing boundaries with smarter tokenomics, intense community hype, and early-entry rewards. Pepe Coin just bounced back with bullish momentum, and Ponke’s recent listings are generating serious buzz—but neither comes close to what’s unfolding with Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) . Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is capturing massive attention as it moves through an unconventional, location-based presale—now in its 16th phase called Crystal Cove. With weekly token burns, staking rewards, and massive referral incentives, APC is giving early investors not just meme magic but strategic advantages. This article will dive into the latest updates from Arctic Pablo Coin, Pepe Coin, and Ponke—and reveal why Arctic Pablo might just be the Top New Meme Coin to Invest in Now. Token Burn Strategy Heats Up Investor Demand | Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now Arctic Pablo Coin’s explosive appeal begins with one word: scarcity. Through a powerful weekly burn mechanism, unsold tokens are permanently removed during the presale—tightening supply and increasing potential value for holders. Once the presale wraps up, any leftover tokens will also be torched, amplifying APC’s deflationary framework. This strategic burn isn’t just a gimmick—it’s all on-chain, with every token elimination recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for maximum transparency. Arctic Pablo Coin’s commitment to reducing supply positions it among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, giving early adopters a rare opportunity to secure a token designed for longevity. But that’s not all—staking rewards during the presale are boasting an eye-catching 66% APY. Holders can lock up their tokens, watch them grow, and even earn rewards through Arctic Pablo’s community competitions and referral incentives. Whether participating in fun challenges or inviting friends, APC holders are rewarded with real crypto gains. These features make Arctic Pablo Coin far more than just a meme—it’s a movement with momentum. Crystal Cove Is Live—$0.000083 Entry Price Could Be Gone Tomorrow | Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now The current meme coin presale phase, dubbed ” Crystal Cove ” is igniting. The token’s unique no-stage presale model, driven by the character’s travels across iconic locations, means each new stop tightens the window for low entry. Crystal Cove is already generating buzz, and as the token inches closer to its next phase, urgency is peaking. With the price set to rise again soon, APC is commanding serious attention as one of the Top New Meme Coins to invest in now. Don’t be late to the Arctic Pablo party—the presale stage is vanishing fast. Crystal Cove marks the 16th destination in Arctic Pablo Coin’s global journey—and it’s shaping up to be the most pivotal yet. With each new location, APC’s price climbs, and now it’s available for just $0.000083. That’s right: over 9552.41% ROI separates this current price from the expected listing price of $0.008. Arctic Pablo has already raised more than $2 million in its presale, and Crystal Cove could close any moment. Pepe Coin Surges Again as Whale Activity Spikes Pepe Coin has reawakened the crypto scene with a strong surge in trading volume driven by sudden whale activity and renewed retail interest. Over the past week, PEPE climbed over 20% as rumors swirled about an upcoming burn or partnership announcement. Community sentiment is soaring as social media trends spotlight the coin’s comeback narrative. While Pepe still faces volatility, its momentum suggests it’s not ready to bow out of the meme coin spotlight just yet. Ponke Climbs After New Exchange Listings Boost Visibility Ponke is rallying after securing fresh exchange listings, including a mid-tier CEX that pushed its visibility to new heights. The increased accessibility has injected strong liquidity into the project, driving daily trade volumes upward. Ponke’s quirky branding and grassroots community continue to appeal to meme coin fans, and its latest roadmap teaser hints at future NFT integrations. With bullish sentiment building, Ponke is making a strong case for itself in the meme coin arena. Final thoughts Pepe Coin’s return, Ponke’s expansion, and Arctic Pablo Coin ’s bold presale all highlight just how vibrant the meme coin market is in 2025. Each project brings something exciting to the table—but Arctic Pablo Coin is the one turning heads with its creative presale mechanics, aggressive token burns, and game-changing potential ROI. The Crystal Cove phase is live, the clock is ticking, and the price is still just $0.000083. For those hunting the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, Arctic Pablo Coin might just be the golden ticket—available today, but not for long.

IntoTheBlock data shows DOGE, Chainlink, and AVAX exhibited high correlation to BTC price action in the last 30 days. Could these tokens be among the top cryptocurrencies to sell if BTC plunges below the $80,000 mark? Bitcoin Price Tumbles Below $82,000 as Trump’s SEC Chair Nominee Faces Scrutiny Bitcoin (BTC) market sell-off continued on Saturday, as it closed the week with three consecutive days in losses. After a positive start to the week, Trump’s tariffs and controversy surrounding the approval of SEC-chair nominee Paul Atkins sent bearish tailwinds across Bitcoin markets over the last three days. Last Thursday, members of the US Congress raised issues related to “conflict of interests” as Paul Atkins’ confirmation hearing began. Concerns that a less crypto-friendly SEC chair could replace Atkins further accelerating sell-offs across the global cryptocurrency markets, as evidenced by the Bitcoin price 5.7% decline observed since Friday. Bitcoin price analysis | March 30 2025 As seen above, BTC price plunged as low as $81,645 on Saturday, before bulls battled back to reclaim the $82,500 level at press time. However, rising trading volume bars accompanying the downward price action over the last three days suggest bulls will require a strong catalyst to generate sufficient momentum for a major rebound. Chainlink, DOGE, and Avalanche at Risk – Cryptocurrencies to Sell if BTC Drops Below $80,000 Bitcoin price plunged 5.73% lower than the weekly $87,500 local top recorded on Friday. As prices dropped toward $81,200 on Saturday, bulls stepped in to avert cascading leverage liquidations looming at the $80,000 psychological support level. However, BTC traders were not the only ones relieved to see prices back above $82,500. According to on-chain data culled from IntoTheBlock , DOGE, Chainlink, and AVAX exhibited high correlation to BTC price action in the last 30 days. Bitcoin price correlation Matrix (DOGE, LINK, AVAX) | Source: IntoTheBlock This shows that these assets have often moved in the same direction as BTC. The correlation matrix highlights a strong relationship between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ) over the past 30 days. Specifically, LINK (0.93), DOGE (0.80), and AVAX (0.79) exhibit high positive correlations with BTC, meaning their price movements largely mirror Bitcoin’s trajectory. If BTC plunges below $80,000, these altcoins could experience intensified sell-offs as traders attempt to hedge against further losses. Given their historically high correlation, a sustained BTC price downtrend could drag these cryptocurrencies to sell significantly lower, triggering margin calls and forced liquidations in leveraged positions. Strategic traders may consider reducing exposure to these assets or implementing stop-loss orders if BTC continues struggling for traction. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim key resistance levels, a broader market downturn could push these correlated altcoins into deeper losses, reinforcing a bearish outlook. For traders looking to manage risk, these could be among the top cryptocurrencies to sell in a volatile market.

The meme coin market never sleeps, and while heavy-hitters like Peanut the Squirrel and Pepe Coin continue to spark conversation, a new contender among the best new meme coin to join for long term gains is rallying the herd with bold offers, real use cases, and a community that charges like there’s no tomorrow. We’re talking about BTFD Coin (BTFD) —a dip-snatching meme coin that’s flipping the script on early-stage investing. In a world of market volatility, inflated gas fees, and pump-and-dump projects, BTFD Coin is handing the power back to believers. It’s offering a full 100% bonus for a limited time, a 90% APY staking opportunity, a live Play2Earn game, and a shot at a massive 2900% ROI at its projected moon price of $0.006. This one’s not just hype—it’s a full-blown movement built by bulls, for bulls. BTFD Coin – Twice the Tokens, Triple the Hype, All Eyes on the Bulls Squad BTFD isn’t some overnight coin that showed up with no plan. It’s the brainchild of real traders who get the thrill—and the pain—of market dips. The name itself says it loud: Buy The Dip . And right now, it’s the best new meme coin to join for long term. Why? Because it’s not just another coin—it’s a full-on ecosystem stacked with utility, rewards, and a community-led mission that’s pulling in over 11,600 holders and counting. Let’s talk numbers. BTFD’s presale is in its 15th stage, sitting at just $0.0002 per coin. Over 72 billion coins have already been snapped up, raising a cool $6.43 million. But here’s the kicker: if you buy now and use the LAUNCH100 code before March 30, you get 100% more tokens—no strings attached. That’s 2x the tokens for the same price. Imagine putting in $4,500 right now. At $0.0002, that lands you 22.5 million BTFD. With the bonus? You’re holding 45 million tokens. And when BTFD hits the end-of-presale price of $0.0006, your bag’s worth $27,000—a clean 200% ROI. But hold tight, because if this thing hits the projected moon price of $0.006, you’re sitting on $270,000. That’s a mind-blowing 2900% return. Still waiting? Don’t. The meme coin presale is moving fast, and the Bulls Squad isn’t slowing down. Speaking of Bulls, the Bulls Squad is the soul of the BTFD community. It’s not just a marketing stunt—it’s a cast of crypto personas that embody what it means to ride the dips with confidence. From Baby Bull’s meme mastery to Nerdy Bull’s tech wizardry, each character connects with the crowd and keeps the project energized, authentic, and fun. But BTFD isn’t only about community vibes. It’s about action. The full version of the Play2Earn game is now live, giving users real-time rewards while they smash levels and collect BTFD tokens. You earn while you play, stake while you wait, and grow your bag without stressing over market dips. BTFD’s 90% APY staking system is built for believers, giving loyal holders the chance to multiply their holdings month after month. What makes meme coins stick in the real world is how they create emotional connections. From retail investors on Reddit to influencers on TikTok, coins like BTFD thrive on culture and shared goals. They’re more than just digital assets—they’re movements. And BTFD is proving it by rewarding its community through the Bulls Squad journey, airdrops, referral challenges, and a rewards program that gives 10% of raise amounts in BTFD tokens to top referrers each month. This isn’t just clever—it’s personal. Hey Bulls—100% bonus code (LAUNCH100) is active. Every single BTFD token you buy during this 15th stage gets DOUBLED. That’s right—2x tokens, just for entering a code. But this ends on March 30. No do-overs. So Here’s Your Cheat Code: Hit the BTFD Presale site . Connect your wallet—MetaMask, Trust Wallet, whatever works. Enter LAUNCH100 in all caps, hit apply. Plug in your amount. Hit buy and confirm the transaction. Simple. Fast. No regrets.

Join the stampede with the best new meme coin to join for long term, or get left eating dust. Peanut the Squirrel – A Community Favorite with a Story That Sticks Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) hit the scene with a narrative that moved people. Based on a real rescue story, PNUT’s rise captured hearts and fueled a passionate following. This Solana-based token taps into emotion-driven investing, combining nostalgia, social justice, and meme power. It’s now seen as a community symbol for those looking to be part of something bigger than charts. As a go-to alternative investment in the meme coin space, PNUT offers more than gains—it offers meaning. Pepe Coin – The Meme Veteran That Still Gets the Crowd Talking Few meme coins hold the cultural weight that Pepe Coin (PEPE) does. From forums to mainstream media, PEPE has long been the face of internet rebellion and crypto enthusiasm. It has no fancy use cases, but its simplicity is its strength. PEPE remains a go-to choice for those who want exposure to meme-driven assets with massive followings and long-standing recognition. It may not be in presale, but its legacy still powers portfolios. Conclusion – This Is Your Window. Don’t Blink. Here’s something wild: Some of the biggest winners in crypto never bought during the peak—they bought during the dip, when no one else was paying attention. That’s where BTFD Coin comes in. It’s the best new meme coin to join for long term not just because it’s fresh, but because it’s loaded with features that actually reward you. From a 2900% ROI potential and 100% token bonus with the LAUNCH100 code to a live P2E game and staking at 90% APY, BTFD is putting the power in your hands before the rest of the market even shows up. More than $6.43 million raised, over 72 billion coins sold, and a community of over 11,600 strong—that’s not just hype. That’s momentum. Peanut the Squirrel and Pepe Coin have earned their stripes. But BTFD is writing the next chapter. If you’ve ever said, “I wish I got in early,” this is that moment. Don’t miss it.

42615831,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=154659,1743300035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/42615831.jpeg,"Solana Faces $100 Risk, Kaspa Gains 42%, But BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 & 800K+ Users Signal Long-Term Strength",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/solana-faces-100-risk-kaspa-gains-42-but-blockdags-keynote-3-800k-users-signal-long-term-strength/,"Solana’s momentum has cracked after rejection at the $146.5 resistance, with price now slipping toward $131. Weakening demand across its network and a drop in active users underline deeper structural concerns. If support at $130 fails, SOL could spiral toward $100—testing psychological lows last seen during broader market corrections. Kaspa, meanwhile, is showing signs of life with a 42% rally in March and renewed attempts to break above $0.10. But its upside hinges entirely on holding support and breaching a long-standing resistance zone—still a technical toss-up. BlockDAG , by contrast, isn’t reacting to market mood swings—it’s building. Keynote 3 unveiled the BlockDAG Academy, a three-tiered learning ecosystem designed to equip developers from beginner to advanced levels. This isn’t education for the sake of optics—it’s a long-term engine for ecosystem expansion. Solana Price Analysis: SOL Faces Breakdown Risks After Key Rejection Solana’s recent rally has run out of steam, with SOL now trading at $131 after failing to break above the $146.5 resistance. This level aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement on the daily chart—a technical rejection that typically signals trend continuation to the downside. As selling pressure intensifies, SOL price could revisit $110, or even test the psychological $100 level. Adding to the bearish setup, Solana’s daily active addresses and transaction volumes are in decline, reflecting fading demand across DeFi and meme coin activity. Momentum indicators like the MACD and RSI are also cooling off, further validating bearish bias. On the hourly chart, SOL is bouncing off $130 support. But this rebound may be short-lived, offering short-sellers an opportunity near the 23.6% or 38.2% Fibonacci retracements. With sentiment still stuck in ‘Fear’ territory, the next move could determine if $100 is back on the table. Kaspa Price Surges 42% in March—Can It Break Above $0.10? Kaspa (KAS) has gained 42% since hitting a low of $0.056 on March 11, sparking hopes of a trend reversal. After months of correction, KAS is testing key resistance near $0.10, which aligns with the descending wedge and Fibonacci retracement levels. If the price breaks above $0.107, it could confirm a bullish breakout, signaling a shift to an uptrend. Momentum indicators like the RSI have recovered from oversold conditions, supporting the case for further upside. But rejection at this level could lead to another dip, potentially retesting the $0.0485 zone. For now, $0.078–$0.080 remains the support to watch. Traders should keep a close eye on how KAS behaves around the $0.10 mark. A breakout could mean a fresh wave of gains. With strong volume and improving structure, Kaspa may be setting the stage for a stronger move higher. BlockDAG Isn’t Just Raising Capital—It’s Raising a Generation of Builders A standout move in Keynote 3 that’s setting BlockDAG apart from every other Layer 1 is the launch of the BlockDAG Academy—a three-tier educational hub designed to onboard the next generation of developers, builders, and Web3 leaders. Unlike most crypto projects that rely on hype alone, BlockDAG is creating the foundation for a self-sustaining ecosystem by educating users at every level—from beginners to advanced smart contract developers. This means more dApps, more utility, and ultimately, more value flowing into the BDAG coin. As more developers are trained and funded (via grants and global hackathons), BlockDAG becomes not just another blockchain—it becomes the preferred environment for building the future of Web3. That’s how the project plans to achieve its $600M presale goal—by creating real demand at the ecosystem level, not just from traders. With over $209 million raised, 19 billion BDAG sold, and 800K+ app users, BlockDAG is scaling with precision. Currently in Batch 27 at $0.0248, the opportunity to join this movement early is rapidly shrinking. The Academy isn’t just an educational tool—it’s a growth engine for the entire network. And it’s already live. Takeaway Solana faces downside risks after failing to clear key resistance levels, and its fading user activity compounds the bearish narrative. Kaspa’s recent 42% rally is promising, but it remains pinned below critical resistance—offering opportunity, yes, but without confirmation of a breakout, it’s still a risky trade. In contrast, BlockDAG is engineering growth that doesn’t depend on price speculation. The BlockDAG Academy—now live—adds an entirely new dimension to its roadmap: a pipeline for developer talent, dApp innovation, and long-term adoption. With over 19 billion BDAG sold and exchange listings ahead, BlockDAG isn’t just chasing volume—it’s creating it. Most projects raise capital and scramble to build after launch. BlockDAG is already rolling out hardware, software, and education—building momentum before its mainnet hits.

42615479,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104330,1743300353,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"Hoskinson Reveals Cardano’s Push to Integrate with Dogecoin, Chainlink, Bitcoin",https://zycrypto.com/hoskinson-reveals-cardanos-push-to-integrate-with-dogecoin-chainlink-bitcoin/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has revealed ongoing efforts to integrate with major blockchain ecosystems, including Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Bitcoin, that could expand Cardano’s reach and use cases. Speaking during a Friday interview with Gokhshtein Media, Hoskinson disclosed that discussions with Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov are progressing, however, emphasizing that integration will take time due to technical challenges. “I spent last night with Sergey Nazarov from Chainlink… and I asked, ‘Hey, what about integrating Chainlink with Cardano?’ He said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re working on it with you guys, but your stack is a bit unusual, so it’ll take some time,’” Hoskinson told David. Chainlink is reportedly developing a more generalized Oracle solution tailored for UTXO-based DeFi applications rather than focusing solely on Cardano. The collaboration extends beyond Cardano, encompassing the broader UTXO-based ecosystem, which includes Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. He also touched on the network’s push into Bitcoin . Notably, Cardano has been advancing its integration with Bitcoin through BitcoinOS, a system enabling trustless BTC transfers via the BOS Grail Bridge. This initiative aims to tap into Bitcoin’s $1.7 trillion ecosystem, bridging its liquidity with Cardano’s DeFi capabilities to enhance interoperability, scalability, and adoption. Cardano’s Lace wallet also supports Bitcoin, providing seamless multichain asset management. Hoskinson further hinted at potential collaborations with Dogecoin but emphasized that discussions are still in their infancy. “They seem open and willing… but we need to determine what makes sense,” he stated. While details remain scarce, integrating Dogecoin into Cardano’s ecosystem could enhance liquidity and expand its use beyond simple transactions. Dogecoin has been widely used for payments, tipping, and microtransactions due to its low fees and fast transaction times. Major companies like Tesla and Newegg accept it for purchases. Another key topic in the interview was Bitcoin’s potential role in national strategic reserves. Hoskinson mentioned that U.S. lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis and former President Donald Trump, are reportedly exploring adding Bitcoin to the country’s reserve assets. However, he acknowledged that details remain uncertain. There were also rumors that ADA might be included in such reserves. Hoskinson addressed these speculations, saying, “I woke up to 150 messages saying, ‘Congrats, bro ADA is up 70% and in the reserve.’ And I was like, ‘Okay, well, that’s awesome—but I didn’t know about it.” Notably, Cardano’s UTXO-based transactions finalize in 20 to 40 seconds. The base layer can process around 250 TPS, and scalability improvements like Hydra aim for 1 million TPS. As of Friday, the network had processed over 110 million transactions, with fees averaging less than 25 cents per transaction. Thus, if integrated with other networks like Bitcoin or Dogecoin, Cardano’s efficient UTXO model could enhance transaction throughput, reduce fees, and improve scalability for broader blockchain interoperability.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cardano|ChainLink|Charles Hoskinson|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|DOGE|LINK|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-30 02:05:53

Regulatory uncertainty surrounding SEC Chair nominee Paul Atkins sparked withdrawal from XRP derivatives markets, signalling more downside risks ahead. Why Is Ripple (XRP) Price Going Down Today? Ripple’ (XRP) latest downturn has been attributed to mounting concerns of “conflict of interest” over the nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair under the Trump administration. While Atkins has long been regarded as a crypto-friendly figure, opposition from U.S. Congress has raised fears of potential regulatory hurdles for Trump’s crypto plans and ongoing altcoin ETF filing reviews. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | March 30 Recently, Ripple secured a major legal victory in its protracted battle with the SEC, bringing long-awaited closure to the case. However, uncertainty surrounding Atkins’ confirmation has cast a shadow over XRP price momentum. As seen in the chart above, Ripple price tumbled a low as $2.06 on Saturday, before rebound towards the $2.15 level at the time of publication. Atkins’ critics within Congress have expressed concerns over potential conflicts of interest, signaling broader resistance to pro-crypto policies. If his confirmation is blocked, it could indicate a more hostile stance toward upcoming legislative initiatives—such as the proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve, which requires congressional approval for federal cryptocurrency acquisitions. Ripple XRP ETF Approval odd plunge 9% in a week, as Congress scrutinizes Paul Atkins | Source: Polymarkets According to Polymarkets data, investors are now pricing 35% chance that the US SEC could approve XRP spot ETFs before July 31. Notably that figure has now declined 7% since the scrutiny around Trump’s SEC chair nominee, Paul Atkins began. More significantly, investors worry that a less crypto-friendly successor could delay or outright reject altcoin ETFs, dealing a major setback to institutional adoption. This uncertainty has contributed to XRP’s recent sell-offs, as market participants brace for potential regulatory headwinds. Traders Withdraw $220M as Market Sentiment Deteriorates XRP’s bearish trend has not been confined to spot market losses alone. In the derivatives sector, traders are aggressively unwinding their positions, signaling a broader loss of confidence in XRP’s short-term recovery prospects. According to CryptoQuant, XRP’s open interest—a key indicator of futures market activity—has fallen sharply from $1.6 billion on March 19 to $1.48 billion at press time, reflecting a $220 million decline in just 10 days. This mass exodus suggests that traders are moving to reduce their exposure rather than betting on a swift rebound. Ripple (XRP) Open Interest, March 30 | Source: CryptoQuant Extended periods of large-scale withdrawals from open interest typically indicate persistent bearish momentum, as market participants either lock in profits or cut their losses ahead of further declines. Unless broader sentiment shifts in favour of crypto regulation, XRP may continue facing selling pressure in the near term. XRP Price Forecast: Bearish Breakdown or Rebound to $2.40? XRP price is struggling to regain bullish momentum after falling below key moving averages, signalling potential downside risks. The XRPUSDT daily chart depicted below reveals XRP is currently trading at $2.17, facing resistance from the 50-day SMA at $2.41 and the 100-day SMA at $2.51, as sellers remain firmly in control. The declining trading volume further reinforces bearish sentiment, indicating weak demand at current levels. XRP Price Forecast The Bearish Breakout Probability is supported by the BBP (Balanced Bollinger Percentage) indicator, which sits at -0.3190, a sign of persistent downward pressure. If XRP fails to reclaim the $2.20 support, the price could slide toward $2.00, a psychologically significant level that could trigger panic selling. A breakdown below this mark could open the floodgates for a further decline toward $1.80. On the flip side, a bullish recovery scenario would require a decisive break above the $2.41 resistance. This would invalidate the bearish outlook and potentially drive XRP toward $2.60, aligning with the 100-day SMA. However, without a surge in buying volume, XRP may remain vulnerable to further sell-offs.

While most people are watching the usual suspects like Bitcoin or chasing hype with gaming coins like Gala, something much more powerful might be unfolding quietly—Qubetics. There’s a major shift happening, and it’s not just about who gets to the moon first, but who’s actually building the rocket with real-world fuel. Bitcoin might be the OG of the crypto world, and Gala’s got its niche in gaming, but the real game-changer might just be $TICS. Qubetics isn’t here to play catch-up. It’s rewriting the rules with serious tech and problem-solving features that most legacy coins never even aimed for. From the ground up, Qubetics was built to tackle actual global problems—like the painfully slow and expensive cross-border payment systems that dominate finance today. And now, during the current 27th presale stage, early buyers are rushing in. With over 504 million tokens already sold and a tally of $15.5 million raised, the buzz around Qubetics presale is becoming impossible to ignore. This isn’t just another coin—this could be the one everyone talks about when they mention the next big crypto. Qubetics Is Rewiring Global Transactions Like Never Before – Truly the Next Big Crypto Let’s get one thing straight—Qubetics isn’t a copy-paste blockchain project. It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, linking together top blockchains and unlocking seamless interoperability that’s been missing in this space for far too long. But where Qubetics really starts flexing is in its real-life application for cross-border transactions. While most crypto projects talk a big game about decentralization, Qubetics actually backs it up with a fully integrated ecosystem that can change the way people and companies move money across the globe. Picture this: A mid-sized tech startup in Austin needs to pay a freelance designer in Tokyo. Traditional banking methods? They’re looking at delays, fees, and paperwork that eats up days and dollars. But with Qubetics, that same transaction can be done within seconds, securely, with zero middlemen and at a fraction of the cost. That’s not some future vision—it’s built into the Qubetics tech right now. This is what makes Qubetics the next big crypto worth talking about. Now zoom out. Think of global companies operating with remote teams in 15 different countries. The headaches they face every month in handling payroll are unreal. Qubetics streamlines all of that, offering an instant, secure, and cost-effective way to settle transactions with full transparency. And for small business owners or content creators receiving international payments, this is a game-changer that can save thousands every year. That’s not just innovation—it’s real value. The trust and speed Qubetics offers comes from its ability to eliminate the traditional red tape and delays that plague international finance. While Bitcoin remains a store of value and Gala focuses on niche gaming use cases, Qubetics delivers a functional application with real utility that directly helps people in daily life. The result? A growing wave of early adopters recognizing it as the next big crypto before it even hits the mainstream radar. Qubetics Presale Numbers and ROI Projections – Why This Next Big Crypto Is Built Different Here’s where things start getting real for those watching the numbers. The Qubetics presale is already deep into its 27th stage, with each stage lasting just 7 days before the price increases by 10%—always hitting on Sunday at midnight. With over $15.5 million already raised, more than 23,900 token holders, and 504 million $TICS tokens sold, the hype isn’t just noise—it’s backed by serious traction. This isn’t just being talked about—it’s being bought into. Now, let’s talk numbers. Right now, $TICS is priced at $0.1300. And if the projections hit anywhere near what’s expected post-mainnet launch in Q2 2025, this could turn small investments into life-changing money. Let’s break it down. If someone throws in $2,500 at the current presale price, they’ll receive around 19,225 tokens. If $TICS hits even $1, that’s a $19,225 return—already up 669.13% ROI. But things get crazy when projections show $TICS could reach $10 or even $15. At $10 per token, that same $2,500 investment could jump to a wild $192,250, delivering a 7,591.33% ROI. If it hits $15, we’re talking $288,375—which is an 11,437% ROI. And remember, that’s all based on just one of the more realistic scenarios outlined by the team. For those who’ve been burned by hype coins with no real product, this is a whole different league. These aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet—they’re backed by a functional ecosystem that solves real financial problems. With its application targeting real-world inefficiencies and its presale metrics smashing expectations, Qubetics has become the next big crypto that’s got both the utility and growth potential that early buyers are always looking for. For anyone scanning for the best crypto presale opportunity, skipping over Qubetics right now might be one of those mistakes people regret when the coin hits full mainnet traction. Bitcoin’s Position as a Digital Store of Value Remains Firm—But It’s No Longer the Only Star Bitcoin will always have that legendary status as the first digital asset that sparked the crypto revolution. No doubt, it’s the digital gold that many still turn to during market uncertainty. But let’s be real—Bitcoin’s not what it used to be in terms of innovation. While the network remains incredibly secure and decentralized, the tech hasn’t evolved much compared to newer, more nimble ecosystems. Right now, the Bitcoin community is watching Layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network gain momentum. These upgrades are designed to tackle the issue of slow transaction speeds and high fees that have long plagued the network. Lightning does bring some relief to smaller, day-to-day transactions, but it’s still in early adoption stages. There’s also growing interest in how Bitcoin might integrate with other DeFi platforms or stablecoin protocols, but that’s mostly speculation for now. What keeps Bitcoin in the conversation is its scarcity model—only 21 million coins will ever exist. That built-in scarcity continues to give it appeal as a hedge against inflation. But for people who are looking to get into a project with 10x, 100x, or even 1000x potential, Bitcoin might not be the go-to anymore. The biggest players already own large chunks, so the upside for everyday folks is a lot smaller. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is still the anchor of the market, but it’s no longer the playground for builders or creators. The real excitement now lies in ecosystems that are faster, more adaptable, and ready to solve real problems. That’s exactly what makes Qubetics stand out as the next big crypto—it’s the tech evolution Bitcoin paved the way for. Gala Keeps the Web3 Gaming Hype Alive—But Can It Deliver? Gala is one of those names that keeps popping up in Web3 gaming circles. With its ambitious push into NFT games, music, and digital entertainment, it’s trying to build an entire media empire on the blockchain. Projects like “Gala Games” and partnerships with big industry names have helped them build a loyal community. But the big question remains—can Gala scale? Right now, Gala is focused on expanding its own layer-1 blockchain and building out an ecosystem of games and metaverse experiences. It’s definitely one of the more exciting players when it comes to blending entertainment and blockchain tech. But there are challenges. The Web3 gaming space is still figuring itself out. Many games are in alpha or beta stages, user retention is low, and the tech often feels clunky. That said, Gala’s making progress. It’s investing heavily into developing AAA-level gaming titles that don’t just use blockchain for the sake of it, but actually enhance the experience. Still, with the whole sector being so experimental, there’s a ton of unpredictability. The value of Gala tokens largely depends on the success of its entertainment ecosystem, which is still a few major releases away from proving itself. So while Gala might end up being a key player in the future of gaming and media, it’s not solving financial or infrastructure problems the way Qubetics is. It’s more of a high-risk, high-reward bet on a niche space. Compared to the real-world application and ROI potential of Qubetics, Gala still feels like a long-term play with more uncertainty attached. Conclusion: Which One Truly Looks Like the Next Big Crypto? Bitcoin holds its ground as the digital gold, providing security and a strong foundation in the crypto market. Gala is making bold moves in the blockchain entertainment space, carving out its identity through games and creative projects. But it’s Qubetics that brings the most complete package to the table—real-world use cases, an already thriving presale, and a tech foundation built to unify blockchains and solve critical problems like international payment delays. For those looking to make the smartest move right now, Qubetics isn’t just hype—it’s functional, it’s growing, and it has serious upside. This is why so many early adopters are lining up to join this crypto presale . Everything points to Qubetics being the next big crypto, and the window to get in early is narrowing fast.

Jump on the Best New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential Right Now,https://thenewscrypto.com/slerf-passed-you-by-jump-on-the-best-new-meme-coins-for-massive-return-potential-right-now/,"The crypto universe never seems to run out of surprises, especially in the meme coin category. In fact, a recent Bloomberg report on digital assets suggested that meme coins now comprise nearly 5% of total crypto trading volume worldwide. That’s massive for a niche often written off as “jokes.” This evolving sector continues to attract novice and seasoned investors, all hunting for the best new meme coins for massive return potential in a fast-changing market. Speculators point to two significant factors fueling the meme coin mania: viral culture and community-centric innovation. Every few weeks, a new project bursts onto the scene and captures the hearts (and wallets) of social media users across the globe. The best part? Some of these tokens, like exclusive events or interactive apps, introduce creative angles that go beyond gimmicky memes. In short, meme coins can no longer be dismissed as mere internet pranks; they’re serious contenders for robust growth and high-impact returns. Taking center stage in the crypto rumor mill is Troller Cat ($TCAT). Hailed as “the next big meme coin with real utility,” this token aims to flip the script on the standard formula. Some say it’s bridging the gap between comedic antics and tangible crypto innovations, including a rumored deflationary Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game Center. Despite the comedic brand, Troller Cat’s unique ecosystem might set it apart from other meme coins. It’s all about pushing boundaries while delivering strong community engagement. Let’s see how $TCAT stands up to this rapidly evolving landscape. Troller Cat ($TCAT) – A New Age of Trolling-Inspired Crypto Crypto communities are buzzing about Troller Cat ($TCAT) as one of the best new meme coins for massive return potential because it doesn’t just rely on catchy memes. Its entire theme revolves around a playful yet cunning approach to internet “trolling.” According to buzz in various Telegram groups, there’s a so-called Troller Walk of Fame, in which each presale stage celebrates a historic trolling moment. While details on those legendary pranks aren’t fully disclosed, observers guess the project might unveil comedic throwbacks to some of history’s most epic online roasts. One highlight generating attention is the rumor of a Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game Center. This isn’t just any mini-game platform. Insiders suggest it might incorporate a buyback-and-burn model that systematically reduces token supply. When tokens are burned, the overall supply shrinks, theoretically boosting the value for holders. That’s why many watchers believe $TCAT is among the best new meme coins for massive return potential: it merges comedic flair with a mechanism that actively fights inflation. If executed well, this approach could deliver both entertainment and economic upside. Beyond the P2E chatter, there’s also talk of staking rewards for early adopters. While no official Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is confirmed, rumor has it that the plan involves a scheme where dedicated community members can lock up tokens and receive an extra $TCAT in return. If that proves true, it could bolster the coin’s reputation as a stable and forward-looking meme coin rather than a short-lived hype project. The real draw, though, is the social layer. People aren’t just buying a coin; they’re joining a subculture filled with witty pranks, collaborative jokes, and an overarching mission to redefine what a meme coin can be. For those scanning the horizon for the best new meme coins with massive return potential, Troller Cat might just fit the bill, given its hybrid entertainment model, rumored burn protocols, and potential staking. How to Get in on $TCAT’s Presale Before It’s Too Late Step-by-Step: Whitelist to Presale Participation in $TCAT’s presale is rumored to be straightforward. Prospective buyers start by joining the whitelist phase, which acts like a VIP pass for early entry. This step might involve signing up on the official website or engaging in certain promotional tasks—though the specific details are still under wraps. Once on the whitelist, investors can access the presale platform, where $TCAT tokens will be offered at what’s expected to be a discounted price. Projects with high potential often limit presale token allocations, so planning ahead can secure a better position when the presale goes live. Though official channels haven’t confirmed any staking APY numbers, the concept is tantalizing: join early, stake tokens, and possibly earn more $TCAT as the coin’s ecosystem flourishes. This approach mirrors past meme coin success stories where the earliest adopters became central community pillars—often enjoying significant returns when mainstream interest peaked. For anyone chasing the best new meme coins with massive return potential, $TCAT’s presale might offer the perfect combination of low entry cost and strong market narrative. Upcoming $TCAT Presale – Gear Up for a Trolling Revolution Troller Cat ($TCAT) isn’t just another coin riding the meme wave; it’s poised to kick off what insiders call a “trolling revolution.” That revolution appears even more intriguing, given the buzz about a presale event that’s set to follow the ongoing whitelist phase. Historically, early-stage meme coins have been known to deliver life-changing returns to investors who spot them before the rest of the world catches on. That’s why $TCAT is increasingly referenced as one of the best new meme coins for massive return potential —the presale could pave the way for significant price action right from the start. For investors searching for the best new meme coins for massive return potential, $TCAT’s upcoming presale deserves attention. Community speculation hints that the event won’t stay under the radar for long, especially if major influencers begin to highlight the project. Whether it’s the comedic spin or the deflationary angle, Troller Cat has crafted a unique narrative that sets it apart from a field saturated with DOGEs, frogs, and pun-based knockoffs. SLERF ($SLERF) – Is It Living Up to Early Hype? SLERF ($SLERF) first made headlines earlier this year when crypto influencers touted it as a can’t-miss meme coin. For a while, it seemed unstoppable. Live reports indicated that $SLERF gained more than 300% in its initial weeks, sparking chatter in Reddit threads and Twitter feeds. Investors were drawn in by a wave of humor-laden marketing that portrayed SLERF as the king of spontaneous crypto gains. Indeed, some watchers crowned it among the best new meme coins for massive return potential, especially during its first month in the limelight. Recent data from popular crypto tracking platforms reveals that SLERF’s volatility remains high. Spikes in trading volume occur whenever there’s a new marketing push or influencer shoutout, but the overall performance has been choppy. Critics argue that a pure meme coin with a limited technical backbone might struggle in a competitive environment, especially as more advanced meme coins like Troller Cat ($TCAT) begin incorporating robust tokenomics or deflationary gaming ecosystems. However, SLERF’s supporters maintain that the coin is “too entertaining to fail.” They believe the brand’s humorous approach continues to attract short-term speculators who love the adrenaline rush of meme coins. If a future update or feature set emerges, SLERF might regain momentum and cement itself as one of the best new meme coins for massive return potential . Yet the jury is still out. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the Troller Cat is set to sparkle in the meme coin space in 2025. The project brings fresh energy, fusing humor with rumored deflationary mechanics that could be a game-changer in meme coin economics. Plus, an active community is already driving the buzz—never a bad sign for tokens aiming for rapid expansion. Meme coin presales don’t wait around, and Troller Cat is no exception. With the whitelist phase currently in motion, the limited presale window could close much sooner than anticipated. For those keen to jump in on a potential gem, the time to act may be now. Keep an eye on official channels, follow the updates, and make an informed decision before Troller Cat’s presale goes live. According to market chatter, this might be a meme coin that can deliver much more than a quick punchline.

This move continues the company’s strategy of getting BTC into the open market through capital raises while adhering to its “Hodl” agenda. MARA secures new ATM equity program to fund Bitcoin purchases According to a Form 8-K and latest prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MARA has set up an at-the-market (ATM) equity program with a group of investment banks, including Barclays, BMO Capital Markets, BTIG, and Cantor Fitzgerald, among others acting as agents . Under the prospectus supplement, the shares will be sold from time to time at MARA Holdings’ discretion. The proceeds of the offering will be used mainly for the acquisition of Bitcoin in the open market. “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital,” MARA said in its prospectus. The company, which specializes in finance services and has a market capitalization of $4.7 billion, maintains a strong liquidity position with a current ratio of 4.94, indicating its ability to meet short-term obligations. The shares’ sale will be conducted through methods deemed to be an “at the market offering” or through other methods upon agreement. The agents are entitled to a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds from each sale. Simultaneously, MARA Holdings has revoked its at-the-market offering agreement dated October 24, 2023, which authorized the sale of up to $1.5 billion in common stock. No additional sales will take place under the previous agreement or its related prospectus supplement. The firm has made it clear that this filing does not constitute an offer to sell the shares, and no sales will occur in states where such an offer or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state. MARA follows Saylor’s playbook as It expands Bitcoin holdings MARA’s current moves follow Michael Saylor’s playbook of issuing equity and convertible bonds to accumulate Bitcoin in the open market. The miner now has 46,376 BTC in its treasury—the second most among publicly listed firms, only behind MicroStrategy’s 506,137 BTC. Despite being a Bitcoin miner, MARA has increasingly relied on buying Bitcoin on the open market. The company adopted this strategy last year amid recognition that mining BTC at a discount to the spot price was becoming increasingly difficult. The industry has come under tremendous pressure following the latest Bitcoin halving event, which halved the rewards for mining and pressured profit margins against surging operational costs. This means that acquiring Bitcoin from the open market has become a comparatively better strategy for miners wanting to increase their holdings and keep their mining operations going. MARA’s action comes at a time when Bitcoin has been subject to increased volatility but ever-strong institutional interest. The last five years have seen MARA Holdings deliver a very large total shareholder return of 2881.63%, reflecting significant strides in transforming its business strategy.

River has no interest in building a “successful crypto casino” Leishman said while there are many “successful crypto casinos,” he has no interest in building one. River Financial is a Bitcoin-only financial institution focusing on buying and selling Bitcoin ( BTC ). Several companies have opted for the Bitcoin-only approach, including Swan Bitcoin, Bull Bitcoin, and decentralized exchange Bisq. Leishman claimed that multi-asset trading platforms prioritize short-term speculation over wealth accumulation: “The casino business model is built around maximal extraction from customers, and the Bitcoin-only model is focused on helping people build long-term wealth.” Critics have voiced this point before, even during the memecoin uptrend in early 2024. In April 2024, A16z chief technology officer Eddy Lazzarin said that memecoins hamper the long-term vision of crypto that has kept so many of the original builders in the space. “At best, it looks like a risky casino,” Lazzarin said. The memecoin market cap is down 27.94% over the past 12 months. Source: CoinMarketCap The overall memecoin market cap has taken a significant downturn since the beginning of 2025. Since Jan. 1, the memecoin market cap has slumped almost 49% to $48.49 billion at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, while altcoins have historically been more volatile than Bitcoin, offering them alongside Bitcoin has been a lucrative move for crypto exchanges and brokers. Related: Waiting for altcoin season? Data suggests it’s already here On Feb. 12, Robinhood, which offers several cryptocurrencies to its customers, reported a 700% year-over-year surge in Q4 2024 cryptocurrency revenue . Some traders seem to interpret a memecoin listing on an exchange as validation of its credibility. Among the 15 memecoins listed by crypto exchange Binance in 2024, 12 saw significant increases in value after going live on the exchange, pseudonymous onchain analyst Ai_9684xtpa said in November . CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong recently speculated that the memecoin market might be headed toward an “extreme case of power law,” where 99.99% fail and a few rise to the top and endure.

Arctic Pablo Coin Is That Moment!,https://thecoinrise.com/what-if-you-could-go-back-in-time-and-buy-pepe-coin-early-arctic-pablo-coin-is-that-moment/,"Did you miss out on Pepe Coin’s early days? If so, you’re not alone. Many investors overlooked its potential, only to watch in disbelief as it skyrocketed in value. In its early days, Pepe Coin was seen as just another meme token, trading at fractions of a cent. Those who recognized its potential and got in early now enjoy massive returns, while latecomers can only regret not seizing the opportunity when prices were low. But what if another high-potential meme coin is emerging right now? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making waves with its explosive presale, and this could be the chance to catch a winner before it takes off. The Rise of Pepe Coin: A Missed Opportunity for Many Pepe Coin launched with little fanfare, but it quickly gained traction in the meme coin space. Initially trading at an almost negligible price, it saw a rapid surge as community hype and investor interest grew. As it climbed the ranks of top meme coins, early investors reaped massive gains, while those who hesitated watched its price soar beyond their reach. This scenario plays out repeatedly in crypto: an unknown project takes off, rewarding early believers while leaving others wishing they had acted sooner. But history often repeats itself, and Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the next big name in meme crypto. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Crypto Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s redefining the space with a unique presale structure and strategic tokenomics. Unlike traditional presales that operate in rigid phases, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale follows a location-based journey, making it one of the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now. Currently, it’s in its 16th stage, known as Crystal Cove, with a price of just $0.000083. The meme coin presale has already raised over $2 million, signaling strong investor confidence. With a projected launch price of $0.008, early adopters could see a staggering 9552.41% ROI. Imagine getting in now, while the price is low, instead of regretting it later like many did with Pepe Coin. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Game-Changing Features No Traditional Stages: Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale structure is unique, with locations replacing standard phases. This innovative approach keeps engagement high and fosters a strong community. Deflationary Tokenomics: Unsold tokens are burned weekly, increasing scarcity and long-term value. Any leftover tokens after the presale will also be permanently removed. High Staking Rewards: Investors can stake their APC tokens and earn a massive 66% APY during the presale. Referral & Community Rewards: Users can earn rewards through referrals and community competitions, adding extra incentives for early adopters. With such a strong setup, Arctic Pablo Coin is attracting significant attention, and those who join now could position themselves for exponential gains. Why Arctic Pablo Coin Could Be the Next Pepe Coin Looking back, Pepe Coin’s rise was fueled by community-driven hype and investor speculation. Arctic Pablo Coin is experiencing a similar surge in excitement, but with a more structured approach and deflationary mechanics that enhance long-term value. The momentum is building, and the presale price won’t last forever. Those who wait might find themselves in the same situation as Pepe Coin’s latecomers—wishing they had acted sooner. Final Thoughts: Secure Your Spot Before It’s Too Late Meme coins have proven time and again that early movers reap the biggest rewards. Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the next big player in the space, and its Best New Meme Coins to Join Now status is gaining traction fast.

From Pepe derivatives to Solana-fueled absurdity, the meme coin market is alive and kicking in 2025. Projects are popping off left and right, and some of them are more than just punchlines—they’re building actual ecosystems, gamified rewards, and communities that don’t sleep. And with bullish vibes spreading fast, this weekend might be your best shot to grab what’s next before the market catches up. Right in the middle of this chaotic excitement is BTFD Coin, and it’s not playing around. The presale’s in Stage 15, with over $6.43 million raised, 72 billion tokens sold, and more than 11,600 Bulls already charging ahead. But what’s got people talking loudest? The Bulls Squad—a tight-knit, hype-fueled community that’s turning this project into something bigger than just another meme coin presale. With one stage left and the LAUNCH100 bonus code ending March 30, BTFD isn’t just one of the most talked-about tokens—it’s one of the best new meme coins to invest in today , especially for those looking to double their bag before the presale closes. BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad Frenzy, 90% APY, and a 2900% Moonshot Let’s cut to it— BTFD Coin is building something wild. At first glance, it might look like another meme coin, but zoom in and you’ll see it’s got muscle. The Bulls Squad, its ever-growing community, isn’t just shouting into the void—they’re actively playing in a live Play-to-Earn game that launched on January 1, 2025. Gamers and investors are stacking $BTFD rewards by completing missions, unlocking gear, and climbing leaderboards. It’s Web3 fun with real token earnings. No fluff—just vibes and value. But it gets crazier. The staking rewards are a massive 90% APY, giving long-term holders serious incentive to lock in. Add the fact that the LAUNCH100 bonus code—which doubles your tokens—is still live but expires March 30, and you’re looking at the perfect combo of game, rewards, and community-driven chaos. This isn’t just a meme coin presale , it’s a countdown to what might be the most anticipated meme listing of 2025. Let’s throw in some real math. At the current Stage 15 price of $0.0002, a $7,000 investment nets you 35 million BTFD tokens. If the price hits the projected $0.0006 listing, you’re sitting at $21,000. But if it hits its $0.006 moon price, which analysts are already eyeing, that stack becomes $210,000. That’s a 2900% ROI from a single well-timed move. So, how do you get in? Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, fund it with ETH or BNB, head to the BTFD Coin presale site , connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 in all caps to activate your 100% bonus, choose your amount, confirm, and you’re done. Your tokens can be claimed post-presale, with rewards from staking and the P2E game unlocked over time. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it’s not just building a token—it’s building a movement. Between the Bulls Squad energy, the 90% APY staking, and a meme coin presale that’s nearly over, BTFD is charging into launch with serious firepower—and this might be your last shot to ride with the herd. Book of Meme (BOME): Where Crypto Culture Gets Archived The Book of Meme (BOME) isn’t trying to reinvent the meme—it’s trying to preserve it. Launched on Solana on March 10, 2024, and created by Darkfarms (the mind behind iconic Pepe memes), this project wants to build a decentralized library where memes, meme tokens, and everything in between live forever. It’s a digital time capsule for the wildest corner of the internet. Solana’s lightning-fast transactions and low fees make BOME’s mission possible. With a strong mix of art, humor, and blockchain-powered archiving, it’s more than a meme coin—it’s a cultural project. And that’s why BOME is gaining traction with the crypto crowd that’s just as nostalgic as they are forward-thinking. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because BOME offers something unique—memes backed by permanence. It’s a fresh take that speaks to Web3’s roots and makes this one of the best new meme coins to invest in today. Dogwifhat (WIF): Pure Meme Energy, Straight from Solana Dogwifhat (WIF) is one of those tokens that exploded because of what it didn’t try to do. It doesn’t overcomplicate things. A Shiba Inu wearing a pink knit hat, no fancy staking, no forced utility—just a vibe, a loyal community, and a fixed supply of nearly 999 million tokens. Sitting on Solana, WIF thrives in an ecosystem where meme coins are breaking out left and right. It’s built entirely on community belief, meme traction, and cult-like engagement from people who just… vibe with the hat. And in 2025, that kind of organic virality still works. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because WIF has become a meme icon without trying too hard, and that’s exactly what makes it one of the best new meme coins to invest in today. Floki Inu (FLOKI): Dog Culture with DeFi Ambitions Floki Inu didn’t start the dog coin trend, but it took it in a new direction. Named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, FLOKI mixes meme magic with real tech ambition. Over time, it’s grown into a project with educational platforms, DeFi tools, and NFT integrations that bring real value beyond the bark. The FLOKI army—its community—is huge and global. Whether it’s sponsoring sports teams or building in the metaverse, FLOKI keeps showing up in places you wouldn’t expect. That visibility, paired with steady development, gives it long-term potential beyond just meme hype. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because FLOKI balances meme energy with legit building, putting it squarely on the radar of anyone looking for the best new meme coins to invest in today. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): The Meme Coin from an AI Oracle Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) isn’t your typical meme coin. This one’s born from a decentralized AI oracle called the Terminal of Truth, making it part performance art, part crypto experiment. It runs on Ethereum and taps into themes of futuristic tech, self-aware systems, and meme-fueled prophecy. It’s bold. It’s weird. And it’s catching fire with Web3 thinkers and meme lovers alike. There’s no roadmap written in stone—GOAT evolves as the oracle spits out truths, predictions, and digital chaos. And people are here for it. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because GOAT adds some weird, wonderful flavor to the meme space and earns its spot among the best new meme coins to invest in today by being totally unpredictable—in the best way. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE): A Familiar Favorite That Still Delivers Baby Doge Coin has been around, and its deflationary tokenomics and huge following keep it relevant. Created by the Dogecoin community and built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BABYDOGE dishes out passive income to holders through its 10% transaction fee, where part goes to holders and the rest boosts liquidity. It’s cute, fast, and backed by one of the most loyal meme communities out there. With continued marketing pushes and NFT tie-ins, Baby Doge has remained a meme token that doesn’t fade away. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because BABYDOGE keeps delivering community value and passive rewards—two reasons it’s still one of the best new meme coins to invest in today. The Final Thoughts There’s no shortage of noise in the meme coin market right now—but the ones that stand out have real momentum, storylines, and communities behind them. Whether it’s WIF’s viral image, BOME’s cultural archiving, or GOAT’s chaotic oracle, each coin on this list has something that sets it apart. But BTFD Coin is the one with all eyes on it right now, and for good reason. With its Bulls Squad community, a live Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a meme coin presale entering its final days, BTFD is putting on a masterclass in Web3 growth. And let’s not forget—LAUNCH100 ends March 30. That’s your last chance to double your tokens before the price climbs and the presale closes for good. Miss this, and you might be watching others stack their wins from the sidelines. Join the BTFD Coin presale now —before the last stage arrives and the bull gates close for good. FAQs What is the LAUNCH100 code for BTFD Coin? It’s a time-limited promo code that doubles your BTFD tokens during the presale. Enter LAUNCH100 in all caps before March 30 to claim it. How does the Bulls Squad work in BTFD Coin? It’s the core community behind the project, powering gameplay, referrals, staking, and social hype. Being part of it offers inside perks and a front-row seat to BTFD’s rise. Is BTFD still in presale? Yes, it’s in Stage 15, with over $6.43 million raised and just one stage left before listing at $0.0006. What’s the potential ROI on BTFD Coin? At a $0.0002 entry and a predicted $0.006 moon price, the ROI potential is up to 2900%—making it a standout pick for the best new meme coins to invest in today.

On the evening of March 28, Sun joined a live broadcast session hosted by HTX titled “Justin Sun Featured on Forbes! Another Legendary Moment for Crypto?” to share his thoughts and experiences. The livestream also featured Molly, Spokesperson of HTX, along with several well-known Chinese crypto influencers and representatives from leading industry media. Showcasing Chinese Leadership on the Global Crypto Stage Sun views this recognition as an opportunity to represent both himself and the broader crypto industry on the global stage. “This helps the public better understand who I am, what the crypto industry stands for, and can potentially reshape public perception,” said Sun. “It’s also a great opportunity for the industry’s growth in China. We can now prove to the world that the crypto sector can represent Chinese voices and interests on a global level.” “This is definitely a milestone, but it’s just the beginning,” he added. Prior to him, only CZ, Brian Armstrong, and SBF had received this level of recognition. “This validates the achievements we’ve made in the industry, and also enhances the visibility and reputation of brands like HTX and TRON. In the business world, Forbes’ endorsement brings credibility and trust to our work.” Forbes Recognition to Accelerate HTX’s Global Expansion The three previously recognized crypto leaders corresponded to Binance, Coinbase, and FTX. Now, Sun represents HTX. “Not long ago, Forbes named HTX one of the world’s most trustworthy crypto exchanges. This, along with the latest feature, strongly supports our global expansion,” said Sun. “Since rebranding to HTX, our platform has become easier for international users to recognize and connect with. I’m very optimistic about HTX’s next phase of growth.” Sun has also praised HTX on social media, citing steady trading volume increases, successful asset launches, and over $100 million in net inflows for three consecutive months. “Based on current liquidity levels, HTX ranks around sixth globally,” he said. “With sustained effort, we have a real opportunity to return to the global top three.” A Vision to Build the Industry for the Next 40 Years March 28 also marks the 10th anniversary of Jack Ma’s Lakeside University. As an alumnus, Sun noted: “The biggest difference is, when Jack Ma appeared on Forbes, Alibaba was already a household name. But blockchain is still in its early stages. Out of 7 billion people worldwide, TRON has only 300 million users—we’re still early.” Looking ahead, Sun remains ambitious. “I believe I can contribute to the industry for at least another 40 years. I entered the crypto space in 2012—it’s been just 13 years. If given three times more time, I’m confident I can help elevate the industry to new heights.” About HTX Founded in 2013, HTX has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses.

That’s where Dragoin ($DDGN) enters—a fiery newcomer with momentum and serious potential. With a strong community, real play-to-earn mechanics, and deflationary tokenomics, it’s turning heads fast. While most meme coins lean on pure hype, Dragoin brings strategy, scarcity, and daily interaction. Crypto circles are buzzing with the idea that Dragoin might be the one coin that breaks out and delivers that rare 100x return this year. Here’s why. 1. Scarcity Built In Through Burn Mechanics Dragoin isn’t copying typical meme coin models. It was crafted with limited supply at its core. The presale runs in 25 phases, each bringing a price increase, rewarding early buyers. Half of the total 200 billion supply is allocated to this sale. Here’s the twist: tokens that don’t sell in each round are permanently burned. As Dragoin gains traction and stages fill, supply drops, tightening the market and raising the floor. Meme coin explosions are often sparked by sudden scarcity. Dragoin bakes that mechanic right in, giving it a serious edge and a built-in engine for potential price surges. 2. 100x Upside Baked into Launch Price Dragoin’s current presale price sits at $0.0000292, while its confirmed launch price is locked in at $0.002. That’s a full 100x built directly into the presale path—no wishful thinking required. As older meme coins chase a comeback, Dragoin is launching into a surging market. Meme coin market cap is already up 16% this month, showing the energy is back. Bitcoin hovering above $85K means more capital is flowing into higher-risk altcoins. With timing, structure, and built-in upside, Dragoin is perfectly placed to benefit from renewed meme coin hype. The opportunity window won’t stay open forever. 3. Game Integration Creates Daily Demand Dragoin stands out with real engagement. It powers a Telegram-based play-to-earn game where players hatch dragons, train them, and battle to earn $DDGN rewards. This isn’t just about buying and holding. It’s interactive. Players need tokens to participate, which keeps demand alive every day. That consistent usage fuels organic growth within the ecosystem. This isn’t your average meme coin—it’s sticky, fun, and rewarding. As more users join and compete, token flow increases. It’s a smart setup. Coins with daily utility build stronger communities, and Dragoin shows that meme coins can be addictive and useful at the same time. 4. Ownership Renounced for True Decentralization Trust is everything in crypto, and Dragoin gets that. After the presale ends, the development team will renounce control of the smart contract, making Dragoin fully decentralized. That means no one—not even the creators—can change token supply, touch the liquidity pool, or influence the roadmap. Everything shifts into the community’s hands. This approach gives $DDGN a level of trust many meme coins lack. It’s becoming rare to find projects that prioritize transparency. Dragoin’s open structure is winning respect, especially from users who’ve been burned before. This time, there’s no central authority—just the power of the crowd. 5. Explosive Community Growth and Viral Potential Dragoin is gaining traction fast. Its Telegram is exploding, social buzz is growing, and key influencers are starting to call it the meme coin to watch in 2025. What sets this apart? It’s spreading organically. No gimmicks, no celebrity stunts—just word-of-mouth and smart fundamentals. Q2 will see staking rewards, referral bonuses, and major marketing campaigns go live. Q3 brings big plans: CEX listings, new in-game features, and the start of community governance. Momentum like this doesn’t sit still. Dragoin’s rise feels real, and when the next meme coin breakout happens, $DDGN could easily be the one leading the charge. Why Dragoin Might Take Over 2025 Meme Coin Market Meme coin runs are wild—but this time, people want more than hype. They’re looking for coins with mechanics that work. Dragoin nails it: deflationary supply, real utility, and full decentralization. It plays into meme culture, but with a smarter model underneath. At $0.0000292, and with the launch set for $0.002, the 100x potential is sitting right there. Not hidden—highlighted. If you missed the early runs of DOGE or SHIB, this could be your second chance. But don’t wait. Once Dragoin takes off, that window slams shut. This might be the meme coin moment everyone’s chasing in 2025.

As Solana and Cardano each attempt to strengthen their foothold—through prediction platform integrations and price consolidation patterns—BlockDAG is taking a different route: rewarding actual participation. While Solana gains attention from Polymarket and Cardano eyes a potential breakout, BlockDAG ’s Beta Testnet adds real stakes with $6,000 in BDAG rewards for developers, miners, and users. This hands-on approach doesn’t just invite interaction—it demands it. With smart contract deployment already underway and presale fundraising at $209 million, BlockDAG is proving that tangible engagement can shape more than just speculation. Polymarket’s Integration of Solana Eyes $170 Milestone Polymarket, a leading crypto prediction platform, has recently incorporated Solana (SOL) deposits, enhancing transaction efficiency and reducing costs for its users. Moreover, this strategic move leverages Solana’s high-speed, low-fee blockchain, offering a compelling alternative to Ethereum’s often congested network. Consequently, Polymarket anticipates attracting a broader user base, thereby increasing platform liquidity. Furthermore, this integration also signifies Polymarket’s commitment to multi-chain compatibility, positioning it competitively within the evolving Web3 landscape. Meanwhile, Solana’s market performance has shown resilience. After encountering resistance at $144, SOL found solid support around $138. Notably, technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reaching oversold levels, suggest diminishing selling pressures and potential for a market rebound. If so, should SOL maintain support above $138, it may challenge resistance levels between $141 and $142, with successful breakthroughs potentially propelling it towards the $144–$146 range. Cardano (ADA) Poised for Potential Breakout Cardano’s native token, ADA, has been trading within a narrow range between $0.695 and $0.75, reflecting a period of consolidation. In particular, a decisive move above $0.756, marked by a daily candle close, could signal a 12% surge toward the $0.85 level. In contrast, a drop below $0.69 may lead to a decline toward $0.65. In terms of technicals, indicators reveal that ADA is contending with resistance from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. Nonetheless, market sentiment appears bullish, with traders holding $17 million in long positions. Additionally, a 40% increase in trading volume over the past 24 hours suggests growing market participation. As such, investors should monitor these key levels and technical signals closely, as they may provide insights into ADA’s next significant price movement. $6K in Rewards Await BlockDAG Beta Testnet Developers BlockDAG’s Beta “Primordial” Testnet isn’t just a technical preview—it’s a fully incentivized playground where early participants can earn real BDAG rewards ahead of the mainnet launch. Specifically, with $6,000 in total prizes on the line, the project is rewarding the top 10 most active wallets, top 10 miner nodes, and top 10 largest wallet balances with $2,000 each in BDAG at a launch valuation of $0.05 per token. Importantly, these aren’t testnet tokens—winners will receive mainnet BDAG, giving users real value for their participation. For developers, this testnet offers more than testing—it’s a chance to deploy smart contracts, test scalability, and get noticed. The platform offers extensive tooling, including an IDE, block explorer, and EVM compatibility, making smart contract development straightforward and seamless. Moreover, this incentive strategy is part of a broader momentum that has seen BlockDAG’s presale raise $209 million to date. Currently, in batch 27, the token is priced at $0.0248, up 2,380% from its first batch. Over 18.9 billion coins have already been sold, highlighting strong early demand and growing trust in the project’s roadmap. Looking ahead, running until May 31, the Beta Testnet not only tests performance under real-world conditions but also invites builders and users to participate with real skin in the game. Ultimately, whether you’re writing code or mining blocks, BlockDAG is rewarding early action now—before the network goes fully live. BlockDAG’s Testnet Sets a Higher Bar Speculation may drive price surges, but sustained value comes from utility and user participation. While Solana benefits from new integrations and Cardano tests resistance levels, BlockDAG is building traction through hands-on engagement and measurable outcomes. With incentives tied directly to testnet activity and over 18.9 billion coins already sold, the project isn’t just promising utility—it’s putting it to the test. As the May 31 deadline approaches, developers, miners, and early adopters aren’t watching from the sidelines—they’re actively shaping what’s next. And in a space driven by proof, BlockDAG is giving everyone the tools to deliver it.

XRP and Solana have shown potential with their recent recoveries and bullish patterns, sparking optimism among traders. XRP’s breakout hints at crossing the $2.50 mark, while Solana eyes a crucial $140 resistance level. Yet, amidst the price speculation and technical indicators, one project stands out for prioritizing transparency over hype— BlockDAG . Unlike others that focus primarily on trading momentum, BlockDAG has solidified its reputation through a transparent vesting system, driven by smart contracts and backed by over 110,000 active users in its Beta Testnet. XRP’s Potential Breakout: Eyeing the $2.50 Threshold XRP has recently demonstrated a robust recovery, trading around $2.45 after a 2.14% increase in the last 24 hours. Notably, the formation of an inverted head and shoulders pattern—a classic indicator of bullish momentum—suggests a potential surge. Specifically, this pattern’s neckline rests at $2.45; therefore, a decisive move above this level could propel XRP towards $2.60 and possibly higher, with the $3.00 mark as a subsequent resistance level. Moreover, market sentiment further bolsters this optimistic outlook. On Binance Futures, an impressive 72.28% of traders are holding long positions, reflecting widespread confidence in XRP’s upward trajectory. Additionally, derivatives data reveals a 60.98% surge in trading volume to $4.52 billion, accompanied by an open interest of $3.97 billion. Furthermore, options volume has also skyrocketed by 167.91%, indicating heightened speculative activity. Solana’s Short-Term Price Targets: Key Levels for Traders Solana (SOL) has shown resilience, rebounding to $138 with a 5.87% gain, though it remains 20% down over the past month. Importantly, the $140 resistance level is pivotal; surpassing it could signal a shift towards bullish sentiment. Additionally, trading volume has surged by 130.42% to $3.33 billion, indicating heightened market engagement. Notably, open interest in Solana futures has risen by 11.01% to $5.25 billion, reflecting increased leveraged trading activity. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 67, suggesting SOL is approaching overbought territory, which may lead to increased selling pressure if it crosses 70. Meanwhile, network activity also shows promise, with active wallets climbing from 1 million to 3 million between March 20 and 23, potentially bolstering demand. Consequently, for sustained upward momentum, SOL must decisively break the $140 barrier on strong volume; otherwise, failure to do so could result in a pullback. BlockDAG Sets Industry Standard with Transparent Vesting System BlockDAG has set a new standard for transparency by implementing a smart contract-driven token vesting system that puts users first. Consequently, this meticulous approach ensures that every token allocation is tracked and accessible, fostering a sense of accountability and building lasting trust. With over 110,000 users participating in the Beta Testnet, BlockDAG has demonstrated that transparency isn’t just an afterthought—it’s a core principle that drives its development forward. During the presale, BlockDAG raised a staggering $209 million, reflecting the immense confidence investors have placed in the project. Currently, the presale has reached Batch 27, with the current batch price standing at $0.0248. This marks a phenomenal return on investment (ROI) of 2,380% since Batch 1, making BlockDAG one of the most promising blockchain ventures on the market. Additionally, over 18.9 billion coins have already been sold, highlighting the sheer scale of community support and investor enthusiasm. What truly sets BlockDAG apart is its commitment to open and honest operations. Notably, the transparent vesting system is fully automated through smart contracts, ensuring that users can track their token allocations without worrying about hidden clauses or unexpected changes. As a result, this practical commitment to integrity not only reassures current investors but also positions BlockDAG as a model for future blockchain projects. Finally, as the mainnet launch approaches, BlockDAG’s transparent vesting mechanism serves as a powerful statement of its commitment to doing things right. By prioritizing clarity and accountability, the project builds a strong foundation for sustained community support and long-term success. Transparency Triumphs While XRP and Solana continue to captivate traders with their promising price movements and bullish signals, the focus on short-term gains often overshadows long-term stability. Market sentiment and trading volumes paint a picture of speculative enthusiasm, but without a clear framework of transparency, the risks remain high. BlockDAG, on the other hand, offers a refreshing contrast with its commitment to clear and accountable token vesting. By leveraging smart contracts and maintaining open access to vesting data, BlockDAG builds trust and demonstrates a practical approach to sustainable growth. As the mainnet launch draws closer, this dedication to transparency may prove more valuable than fleeting market momentum.

The AVAX network is rolling out Visa credit cards now as part of its latest technologies, and the AVAX price has recently gotten better for it. A bullish rally is on the horizon, and many top altcoins are already responding accordingly. Remittix is leading the line of new projects in the market too, as traders have been storming the presale website for some RTX tokens of their own. The new Remittix project is the hottest topic in the crypto market at the moment, even among Avalanche and Solana traders. Here are some reasons behind that. Avalanche Credit Cards to Aid Crypto Adoption The Avalanche network has made a name among the top cryptocurrencies as one of the most innovative ecosystems, possibly after Ethereum. With the growing wave of crypto adoption across economies, Avalanche introduced some new developments last month to stay ahead of the curve. The AVAX blockchain will be issuing Visa credit cards to users through which they can spend their Avalanche assets. All Avalanche-based assets, from the AVAX tokens to wrapped AVAX and stablecoins issued on the network, are available spending options on the credit cards. According to reports from CoinDesk, the Avalanche debit cards were issued in partnership with Rain, the blockchain card issuing platform. The Avalanche Foundation also stated in October 2024 that the credit cards will sign up more users from Latin America and the Caribbean before focusing on other regions, and the adoption process has already seen considerable progress from there, as well as from Africa and Southeast Asia. Avalanche and Solana: What’s Driving Their Price Movements? The credit cards on Avalanche were issued about a month ago, and they might be a contributing factor to the recent spike in the AVAX price. The token is currently trading at $20.03, with a 2.52% spike in the weekly timeframe, even though the token has slumped considerably in the past few days. Many analysts have also pointed out that the AVAX price is finally breaking out of its correction phase. The Avalanche token made a 35% recovery from its $15 low on March 11, and the charts show that the AVAX price has completed an ABC corrective wave. But while Avalanche might have potential for short-term returns, the token is still stuck in limbo. It’s even worse with Solana, as the declining network and DEX activity have contributed to a drop in the Solana price. The Solana token was rejected at the $145 level during the week, and its price has fallen to $126.19, bringing its seven-day charts back into 2.25% losses. For most traders, it’s up to the new projects to set the pace for profits in 2025, and Remittix (RTX) seems to be the best crypto at the moment. Here’s more about the new project and why everyone is trooping to its presale. Remittix to Open APIs for Smooth Withdrawals Crypto traders are often faced with the familiar dilemma of the fastest, cheapest options to get their crypto assets from the blockchain into their fiat accounts for checking. Over the past decade, there hasn’t been a clear pathway for that, but now we have Remittix. The new project is concerned with helping users convert their crypto assets directly into fiat currencies and resolving them into appropriate bank accounts. It’s as easy as transferring tokens from one wallet to the other, and users get to avoid intermediaries in the transaction. That means any crypto trader can pay for tuition fees online, transfer money to relatives abroad, and even clear a cart on Shopify, all directly from their crypto hot wallets. The Remittix API only needs the recipient’s bank account details to make the transfer. The best part is that Remittix is already expanding fast. The platform supports about 30 fiat currencies and over 40 cryptos, so traders can scarcely get stranded for withdrawal options. The world is gradually adopting cryptocurrency as a form of payment, and, like Avalanche, Remittix intends to stay ahead of the curve. Stay Ahead With Remittix! The next best thing is to join the growing Remittix community, and you’d find a lot of traders going there already. The RTX tokens have been the talk of the crypto-verse for the past two months, and they are still selling at bargain rates. Each Remittix token costs only $0.0734, but they are set to rise with each presale stage. Get yours now, and start anticipating the big 130x spike post-launch. Don’t miss out on Remittix today!

It has plunged by over 55% from its highest level in 2024. Why Ethereum price has crashed Ethereum has crashed because of its ecosystem challenges and the ongoing macro factors. Internally, Ethereum has plunged because of the ongoing outflows in the spot Ethereum ETFs. Data by SoSoValue shows that ETH ETFs have had net outflows in all days this month other than March 2 and 28. These funds have had a cumulative net inflow of just $2.4 billion, bringing their net assets to $6 billion. Ethereum ETFs have largely failed because of a lack of demand from Wall Street investors. Most of these investors prefer holding and staking ETH, which earns them a good staking return of about 3%. Read more: Ethereum price prediction after the $238 billion wipeout ETH price has crashed because of the soaring competition from the layer-1 and layer-2 industry. Most of its competition is coming from companies layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum. These networks are known for having higher transaction speeds and low costs. Ethereum is also seeing more competition from layer-1 networks like Sui, Solana, and BNB Chain. These factors explain why many analysts have warned that ETH price could crash further. For example, Standard Chartered analysts have lowered their target by 60% to $4,000. ETH price also dived because of the recent leadership crisis at the Ethereum Foundation. Ethereum price crashed because of weak technicals ETH price chart by TradingView Further, technicals suggest that ETH price has more downside to go. The weekly chart shows that Ethereum price made a risky pattern known as a triple-top in 2024. This pattern formed as Ether failed to move above the key resistance point at $4,036 three times. It has now crashed below the important support level at $2,113, the neckline of this pattern and its lowest point on August 5. Ethereum price has plunged below the 50-week and 200-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). A crossover of these two averages will be a death cross, one of the riskiest patterns in the market. ETH price has also plunged below the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement, commonly known as the golden ratio at $1,940. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have all pointed downwards. Ethereum coin has also formed a bearish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign. Therefore, Ethereum price will likely continue falling as sellers target the key support at $1,500, a psychological point that is about 20% below the current level. A move above the key resistance point at $2,113 will invalidate the bearish outlook. Read more: Ethereum price prediction March: Is another 50% crash possible?

Remittix Set To Take Centre Stage,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-doge-could-fall-below-0-10-this-month-remittix-set-to-take-centre-stage/,"Dogecoin Price Prediction runs amok. The trader who earlier forecasted the growth DOGE while it was still under $0.01 now suggests another promising project . The majority of investors assert that these tokens are among the best crypto to invest in. The value of DeFi coins of these tokens today guarantees future gains. Dogecoin Price Prediction: A New Outlook Dogecoin has dropped in recent weeks. Dogecoin Price Prediction now indicates that its price can go even lower. The current latest news indicates that DOGE can go lower than current prices, as the tensions rise in the market. One trader who has been famous for calling DOGE under $0.01 now warns that the coin can fall further. The turn prompts investors to examine the Dogecoin Price Prediction carefully before they conclude what to do. The token still enjoys a healthy community, but market indicators offer poor technical support. There is a fight expected by the majority if the price trend further declines. Investors are curious whether DOGE will bounce back with the current pressure. Coincodex provides a response in the affirmative with Dogecoin price predictions that it will rise by 229.55% and be trading at $0.5710 by April 26. Remittix: A New DeFi Project with Real-World Impact Remittix is an emerging DeFi project. Remittix solves a very huge issue: expensive and time-wasting cross border payments. The world mostly makes use of zero bank accounts. They can take crypto in a wallet, convert it to a money transfer service, and receive cash to use on everyday essentials. Remittix offers a simple solution that preserves real cryptography values like anonymity and control of your money. Remittix eliminates the additional steps in the payment process. It closes the gap between crypto and modern finance and banking with the facilitation of a seamless crypto-to-fiat exchange. Remittix has already sold over 524 million tokens in its ICO, which shows strong early backing. Its current DeFi coin price is around $0.0734, one of the best cryptos to invest in for consistent gains. Remittix can be expected to yield 10x or more returns by experts if market trends continue. Investors see Remittix as a solution provider of day-to-day finance issues. The ability to make international payments simpler and cheaper is tangible value. The token has an obvious use other than speculative gain. The token is designed to provide a way for individuals to have privacy while still being incorporated into the future banking system. That combination of new and old technology makes Remittix so appealing. A Solution to Everyday Problems The Dogecoin Price Prediction does not favor DOGE because it will continue to go down. But the actual star of the show appears to be Remittix. It’s solving the problem of expensive, slow cross-border payments with practical solutions. Remittix is being described as one of the best cryptos to invest in for long-term growth. The inherent utility and practical benefits that it offers are a choice that wise investors can count on.

The final stages of presales like BTFD Coin (BTFD) are drawing thousands of investors ready to ride the next wave. Add wildcards like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) to the mix, and we might just be staring at the wildest meme coin bull run of 2025. If you’ve been hunting for the top new meme coins for exponential returns, this list breaks down the exact projects with moon potential. BTFD Coin , now in Stage 15 at just $0.0002, is offering a rare shot at a 2900% ROI if it hits its $0.006 moon target. The best part? You can double your coins instantly using the bonus code LAUNCH100 before the offer ends on March 30. Let’s dive into what makes these coins worth your attention—and your wallet. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Last Dip Before the Launch Pad with Limited 100% Bonus Ask yourself: What if you had the chance to invest in a fully-loaded crypto ecosystem before it went live—and the entry point was a fraction of a penny? That’s BTFD Coin right now. With just one stage left before listing at $0.0006, the presale is offering BTFD for $0.0002, giving you 2900% ROI potential if the price hits its forecasted moon value of $0.006. Let’s say you toss in $4500 at the current price. You’d receive 22.5 million BTFD tokens. Apply LAUNCH100 , and boom—you’re sitting on 45 million coins. If BTFD reaches just $0.0006 post-listening, that’s a cool $27,000. And if it hits the projected moon price of $0.006, you’re looking at $270,000. That’s not hype. That’s math. And it’s not just about the price. The full version of BTFD’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game went live on January 1, letting users earn while playing across multiple levels. Add in staking rewards with a juicy 90% APY (live since December 2), and you’ve got a passive income machine. Early investors aren’t just hoping for a pump—they’re collecting coins while they wait. Here’s what the numbers look like: Current Stage : 15 Price : $0.0002 Coins Sold : 72+ billion Holders : Over 11,600 Bulls Presale Raised : $6.43 million and counting Major Alert: Use Code LAUNCH100 and DOUBLE Your Tokens Instantly!

That’s why BTFD Coin is the #1 pick on this list of the top new meme coins for exponential returns. 2. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) – The Audacious $2.3B Meme Machine Known for its outrageous gas-powered branding, Fartcoin is far from a joke in market cap. This Solana-based token offers humor, hype, and liquidity all rolled into one. Whales are playing big here. A recent $1.87 million dump by a whale barely dented the momentum, suggesting serious community strength. With built-in “Gas Fee” audio antics and massive weekly gains, Fartcoin’s ability to turn attention into traction keeps it in the spotlight. Why did this coin grab a spot on this list? Its viral mechanics, meme-first brand, and high-volume investor base make it a legit contender among the top new meme coins for exponential returns. 3. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) – Cult Classic Turned Crypto Cult GOAT isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a community-powered juggernaut. Built around a god-tier goat deity with eternal rizz, GOAT has become a digital rallying cry for Gen Z humor and crypto rebellion.

Unlike most memes, GOAT rewards holders with consistent engagement drops, surprise giveaways, and NFT integrations that evolve. It’s quirky, chaotic, and totally crypto-native. What got GOAT on this list? Its ability to turn community chaos into meme coin demand has given it staying power as one of the top new meme coins for exponential returns.

Ripple dived from the year-to-date high of $3.40 to the current $2.2. This crash has led to a $62 billion wipeout as the market cap has plunged from over $189 billion to $127 billion. XRP price crash despite strong fundamentals The ongoing XRP price crash happened even after Ripple had some substantial positive news recently. Its most important news came earlier this month when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted to end its appeal against Ripple Labs. This was an important thing because it meant that Ripple paid just a fraction of the $2 billion that the agency wanted. Further, the decision means that Ripple Labs will now be at liberty to sign more deals in the United States. According to Brad Garlingouse, Ripple largely stopped making any major deals in the US following the SEC lawsuit, with most of its business coming from other countries. Many American companies cited the ongoing litigation for refusing the deal. Therefore, with the Ripple case done, analysts anticipate that there will be more deals going on. Indeed, Garlinghouse noted that the number of deals signed six weeks after Trump’s election were more than those signed six months before that. XRP price crashed even after Ripple continued its partnerships and regulatory wins. It recently partnered with Chipper Cash , a popular payment network in Africa. The company will now use Ripple’s technology to improve its payment network over time. Ripple ETF odds have risen The XRP price has also crashed as the odds of a Ripple ETF approval have jumped. There are now over 10 XRP ETF applications from popular companies like Grayscale, Canary, and Franklin Templeton. Analysts believe that the SEC has no good reason to reject these funds since it has already accepted Bitcoin and Ethereum. Also, the judiciary has said that XRP is not a security. Indeed, Polymarket odds of an XRP ETF approval have jumped to over 86% this year. Most importantly, Ripple has the resources it needs to build a viable alternative to SWIFT, a payment network that handles over $150 trillion in transactions each year. To succeed, Ripple will need to onboard as many banks as possible, which is now possible now that the company’s legal liabilities have ended. Banks and consumers will prefer the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) because it is a faster and cheaper alternative to SWIFT. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that the XRP price has dropped this year. Its attempts to recover have found substantial resistance in the past few months. It has now plunged below the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level at $2.24, a sign that the downward momentum is continuing. Ripple price has also sunk below the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. Most notably, it has formed a head and shoulders pattern, a popular bearish sign in technical analysis. Therefore, there are odds that the XRP price will continue falling in the coming weeks. This bearish view will become valid if the coin plunges below the support at $1.9770, the neckline of this H&S pattern. The bearish outlook will be invalidated if the coin rises above the key resistance level at $3.0.

At Token2049 Singapore in September 2024, Buterin called out some “cringe” anthems for crypto projects and even started singing on stage, receiving a positive reaction from both the live audience and those on social media . Meanwhile, since Ether reclaimed the $4,000 price level in December 2024, it has dropped nearly 55%. At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $1,841, down 13.34% over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether is trading at $1,841 at the time of publication.

42624824,https://timestabloid.com/?p=62195,1743312614,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Why Remittix Is A Better Investment Than PI, Ripple (XRP) And Trump Coin In April",https://timestabloid.com/why-remittix-is-a-better-investment-than-pi-ripple-xrp-and-trump/,"Surprised that Remittix is a better investment than PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April? The cryptocurrency market continues to fluctuate incredibly, and investors seek strong and promising altcoins. Remittix has been drawing a lot of interest this month with its immense growth prospects and useful application, distinguishing it from mainline coins like PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin. Why Remittix is a better investment than PI and other failing altcoins PI Coin was previously traded at $0.7954, after experiencing a large 4.58% fall. With a market cap of $5.36 billion, PI initially caught the market’s attention with its mining-style model. Investor demand seems to be falling in a rush now, however. PI’s 24-hour trading volume dropped considerably by nearly 30% to $162.8 million, reflecting decreasing investor interest. Uncertainty about the future of the coin and postponed mainnet listings have significantly impacted investor sentiment, which has led them to choose better projects. When looking at why Remittix is a better investment than PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April, Remittix greatly outweighs PI Coin by offering practical solutions in the real world and not speculative future application. With its presale exceeding $14.2 million, Remittix shows strong demand. XRP Faces Challenges: Why Remittix Is a Better Investment Than PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April XRP is trading at $2.10, losing 3.33%. The market cap for XRP stands at a tremendous $122.82 billion and has always captured the interest of investors, particularly with regard to cross-border transactions. However, despite recent lawsuit settlements, its price struggles. The volume on XRP is down slightly at 1.55% to $3.96 billion, indicating investor reservation. While there are use cases for XRP, persistent regulation concerns and the increasing competition for payments limit its short-term growth potential. This situation highlights why Remittix is a superior investment to PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April. Remittix, as compared to XRP, has fewer regulatory challenges and provides a streamlined, low-cost crypto-to-fiat payments solution already enjoying robust user acceptance worldwide. Trump Coin’s Popularity Wanes, Illustrating Why Remittix Is a Superior Investment to PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April Trump Coin now sits at $10.02, losing a precipitous 1.99% and trimming its market cap to some $2 billion. Though an early darling among the base, Trump Coin is panned as having no intrinsic utility other than political leanings. Its trading volume fell 44% to $285.03 million, showing rapidly falling investor demand. Political-tokened coins are likely to be prone to rapid price movements based on the whims of popular sentiments and news cycles, so Trump Coin is incredibly volatile and risky. In the meantime, Remittix provides a solid alternative with clearly defined real-world use and concrete advantages, reiterating that Remittix is a better investment than PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April. Practical Utility Distinguishes Remittix from PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin Apart from speculative tokens, Remittix jumps to address global financial issues by completing efficient crypto-to-fiat conversions. The working utility invites investors seeking tangible, long-term value rather than speculating on unpredictable market trends. For instance, a Latin American mid-sized travel agency can easily get paid by customers worldwide through Remittix. The agency used to only expect delayed bank transfers and high fees, but the agency can now easily get instant crypto payments easily converted into local currency, significantly improving cash flow. Yet another example: An African aid receiving humanitarian services from a European NGO can efficiently exchange crypto donations for local money via Remittix. What it implies is swifter disbursing of donations, less chance of hold-up due to standard banking, and additional fees, which makes the charities an essential gain. Remittix versus PI, Ripple (XRP), Trump Coin in April: Long-Term Value and User Adoption: Why Remittix is a sounder investment choice As PI, XRP, and Trump Coin undergo volatile popularity and lingering issues, Remittix consistently demonstrates strong user adoption. Its token presale has incredibly surpassed over 518 million tokens sold, decidedly pointing to investor confidence and faith. Moreover, Remittix’s easy payment solution addresses the true pain points of international finance, drawing in retail users as well as institutional partners. Such real-time usability fuels mass adoption, providing a sound foundation for sustainable growth. Compared to PI’s uncertain future, XRP’s legal battles, and Trump Coin’s declining popularity, Remittix provides a safer investment path. Investors seeking a cryptocurrency with clear, actionable benefits find Remittix’s model attractive, particularly during periods of market uncertainty. Choose Remittix for Stable and Practical Gains in April In April’s shifting crypto landscape, it’s clear why Remittix is a better investment than PI, Ripple (XRP), and Trump Coin in April. PI’s falling momentum, Ripple’s legal uncertainties, and Trump Coin’s speculative risks make them vulnerable to further declines. On the other hand, Remittix offers a secure, pragmatic investment opportunity with direct benefits. Its crypto-to-fiat model serves real-world needs, providing immediate value and drawing widespread user adoption. Ultimately, investors seeking reliability, stability, and practical benefits in the crypto market will find Remittix a strong contender. Its impressive growth, open utility, and widespread adoption make Remittix a great choice for significant and long-term gains this April and beyond. Want to invest in crypto with real-world utility?

While Toshi’s Bullish Surge and Floki Inu’s Metaverse Moves in Focus: Best Meme Coins to Buy for 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/arctic-pablos-final-presale-days-while-toshis-bullish-surge-and-floki-inus-metaverse-moves-in-focus-best-meme-coins-to-buy-for-2025/,"Crypto markets are buzzing after the March 2025 Core Update and looming U.S. economic turbulence. As traditional assets wobble, meme coins are staging a savage comeback. With Google’s update slapping stale sites and boosting high-engagement, community-driven content, projects like Arctic Pablo Coin are going viral, while inflation fears are driving retail and Gen Z investors into high-APY digital assets. Enter Arctic Pablo—more than just a meme coin. It’s a full-blown mythical expedition. Picture this: a lone explorer on a snowmobile tearing through frozen wastelands, chasing legendary treasure buried in Earth’s hidden realms. New holders are rewarded with increasing value, access, and story-driven hype at every icy stop. That’s not fiction—it’s the Arctic Pablo Coin presale. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) – The Adventure-Powered Meme Coin Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just the best new meme coin to buy for 2025—it’s rewriting the rules of what a meme coin can be. Built on Binance Smart Chain ($BSC) as a BEP20 token, $APC follows an epic presale journey across mysterious global locations instead of basic “stages.” Now, in Location 16—Crystal Cove—Arctic Pablo, it is priced at $0.000083, with over $2 million already raised. With a listing price at $0.008, the potential ROI is absolutely off the charts—up to 9552.41%. That means a $100 investment now turns into $9,638.55. Investors can also rake in 66% APY via the exclusive staking program. The next location drop could happen any moment. Miss this one; the next entry point won’t be this cheap again. Let’s break down the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. Each location represents a new opportunity for holders to get in early before Pablo moves on. What makes this ride irresistible? Weekly token burns. Every time Pablo leaves a location, unsold tokens are torched on-chain, slashing supply and boosting value. Combined with a deflationary tokenomics model and limited presale supply (50%), this coin’s scarcity hits different. The total supply of $APC is 221.2 billion, but only half is public. With strategic allocations to staking (15%), ecosystem growth (20%), and community rewards (10%), Arctic Pablo isn’t just about hype—it’s about long-term sustainability. Investors can also stake their holdings for a massive 66% APY, locked for just two months from launch. That’s compound growth and narrative magic wrapped in one. The buzz is real, and Pablo’s journey is heating up. Crystal Cove could close any day now. The next location? Higher price. Less ROI. The time to jump in is now. Arctic Pablo is hands-down one of the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025 —and this might be your last shot at ground-floor prices. Toshi – The Dogfather-Inspired Coin Backed by Tech-Savvy Community Power Toshi is named after the tech titan himself—Satoshi Nakamoto. But this ain’t no wannabe Bitcoin. Toshi is a meme coin bred for digital domination, built on a decentralised future. It’s got slick branding, sharp tokenomics, and one of the most aggressive community-shilling strategies seen in 2025. That puts it firmly among the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. Toshi’s smart contract is built on Ethereum, making it rock-solid and secure. Its tokenomics model is laser-focused on rewarding holders, with massive liquidity and low slippage. That means easy buys and fewer rug-pull risks. But the magic of Toshi lies in its community—an army of TikTokers, Twitter warriors, and Discord strategists hyping this coin into virality. Between the sharp tech, iconic branding, and grassroots clout, Toshi is making a strong case as one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy for 2025, especially for those betting on community-first crypto plays. Floki Inu – Viking Hype Meets Meme Coin Muscle If there’s one meme coin that refuses to die, it’s Floki Inu. Born from Elon Musk’s legendary Shiba pup, Floki took its early 2021 meme status and evolved into a full-blown DeFi and metaverse powerhouse. In 2025, it’s back in the spotlight—refreshed, reloaded, and tearing up the altcoin charts. If you’re hunting for the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025, Floki Inu deserves another look. With a massive global fanbase, anime-themed merch drops, and real-life marketing in places like London’s Underground, Floki’s comeback tour is in full swing. While the ROI might not match Arctic Pablo’s astronomical leap, it’s got serious blue-chip meme coin potential—and stability that newer tokens envy. Floki Inu mixes hype with heritage, and that combo is the winning formula heading into Q2 2025. For anyone looking to spread risk and still stay deep in meme coin territory, Floki’s legacy and expanding utility make it one of the Best Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. Final Thoughts: Don’t Let These Opportunities Slip Away Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Toshi, and Floki Inu aren’t just hype—they’re the real deal regarding the Best Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. But out of the three, Arctic Pablo Coin offers the most jaw-dropping upside, thanks to its myth-driven presale journey, weekly token burns, 66% APY staking, and an insane 9552.41% ROI opportunity. The entry point is too good to ignore with Pablo currently at Crystal Cove (Location 16). This location could close anytime, and the next one will come at a higher price. This is the window. Don’t overthink it. Join the Pablo meme coin presale now, before this legendary explorer disappears into the next realm—and takes the low prices with him.

The recent nose has now started showing a new setup that might indicate a significant sell-off could be lurking around. Although analysts believe the Ripple price prediction could be bullish this year, the recent price drop could set a tone for a near-term bear. To add to the pressure of the Ripple price prediction, the new Remittix token is now dubbed XRP 2.0, which could fuel a move away from Ripple. Here are the details of the story. Is The ETF Delay Fueling A Bearish Ripple Price Prediction? Investors rushed to Ripple coins earlier this year with two landmark announcements: the Ripple ETF filing and the US crypto reserve . However, as the days progress and no confirmation date is in sight, investors seem to be getting tired already, and this is already showing in the price setup. More interestingly, while earlier predictions showed that the price could hit a new high this year, the recent trending Ripple price prediction now has a heavy bearish undertone. Could the delay with the ETF filling be a significant setback for the Ripple price prediction? There is a mix of interest regarding the point in focus as many analysts consider the price to be fueled largely by the Ripple solution with settlement and payment rather than mere ETF future. However, from another perspective, many recent investors have continued banking on the Ripple price surging this year, with the ETF approval set as a significant catalyst. Furthermore, the rise in other competitors could also drive more bearish sentiment toward the Ripple price prediction in the future. Why Remittix’s XRP 2.0 Speculation Could Be A Strong Signal To Watch Closely As new solutions continue to join the crypto market, those without stronger backing and widespread utility could be a bubble with short-term growth. However, the recent rise of the Remittix exchange and the discovery of its many solutions have shown that the market might readjust to accommodate a new top altcoin. Funny enough, while this new altcoin is still in presale, top market analysts call it the XRP 2.0. But why is this new player compared to the more established crypto payment giant? Many of these analysts believe the approach the Remittix exchange introduces could revolutionize the crypto payment sector in the coming months. Remittix takes in crypto and helps users convert it to FIAT currencies that can be readily sent across the globe to a desired bank account; It’s that simple! While others seem to do similar, none has a cross-border connection that helps crypto users send money directly to a bank account using their crypto without going through p2p. With Remittix removing the middleman problem, crypto users can now get full control and security over their asset, giving them freedom to do more. But while it has attracted the attention of top investors in the last few months, small investors also stand a chance to take a position now before it’s too late. The presale price, which remained below $0.1, is an opportunity for everyone to get a good entry. Although the Remittix presale raised over $14.2M within the short period it started, the gradual price growth has been an opportunity for continuous growth. Don’t miss the opportunity with the presale price today, as this could be the best opportunity to invest in the future of crypto payments.

Shiba Inu’s massive SHIB burn and Layer-2 activity, alongside Chainlink’s push toward $20, reflect strong narratives—but they remain anchored in price sentiment and market behavior. In contrast, BlockDAG is shifting focus from price to performance. Its Beta Testnet isn’t about speculation—it’s about validating what works. With over 15,000 transactions daily and 200+ mining nodes active, BlockDAG is stress-testing its core systems ahead of a 2025 mainnet launch. While others ride market waves, BlockDAG is defining what readiness looks like. **(Keyword: Beta Testnet)** Shiba Inu’s Burn Rate Skyrockets Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently witnessed a dramatic surge in its burn rate, with over 1 billion tokens incinerated within a 24-hour period—a 57,000% increase. This spike was primarily driven by a single user transferring 1 billion SHIB to a dead address, effectively removing them from circulation. However, despite this aggressive burning activity, SHIB’s price has remained relatively stable, hovering around $0.00001443 after a 55% decline from its yearly high. From a technical perspective, analysis reveals the formation of a megaphone pattern on the weekly chart, suggesting potential for a bullish breakout. If confirmed, this pattern could lead to an upswing of approximately 130%, targeting the $0.00003395 level. At the same time, Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 network, is approaching a milestone of 1 billion transactions, indicating growing utility and engagement within the ecosystem. The network has processed over 975 million transactions, with more than 245,000 accounts and 10.15 million blocks. Chainlink (LINK) Targets $20 with a Bullish Breakout Chainlink’s native token, LINK, is exhibiting a bullish trajectory, having broken out of a descending parallel channel that commenced in February 2025. Currently, LINK maintains support at $15.15 and is aiming to surpass the $20 threshold in the near future. Notably, the recent price surge enabled LINK to breach the 200 EMA, positioning it to potentially reach $19.30. The $20 mark remains a significant psychological level for traders and investors. In support of this, on-chain metrics further validate the optimistic outlook. Data from Santiment indicates that LINK’s social dominance has peaked in recent weeks, suggesting increased market interest. Additionally, development activity has intensified since early March 2025, and a reduction in LINK’s exchange supply implies accumulation by whales and investors. Taken together, these factors point towards a bullish scenario for LINK’s future performance. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Launch Marks Final Phase Before 2025 Mainnet—Here’s What’s Being Tested With its mainnet launch planned for later in 2025, BlockDAG has entered the final proving ground: the Beta “Primordial” Testnet. Rather than serving as a showcase, this phase is a systems check. Every aspect of the network is being actively validated to ensure that what launches later this year meets both performance and security benchmarks. To that end, the testnet is designed to simulate full-capacity conditions. BlockDAG is targeting a minimum of 15,000 daily transactions and over 200 active mining nodes to validate scalability and decentralization. Wallet compatibility is also under scrutiny, with seamless MetaMask integration and cross-platform functionality being closely tested. Developers are deploying smart contracts, users are engaging through dApps, and token vesting is being trialed with over 110,000 investor accounts. Importantly, the real-world feedback and metrics gathered during this period will determine how the system behaves under pressure—critical insight for final mainnet adjustments. Simultaneously, the current rollout ties in with BlockDAG’s presale traction: $209 million raised, over 18.9 billion coins sold, and an ROI of 2,380% since batch 1. Now in batch 27 at $0.0248, the project continues to gain momentum as its infrastructure proves it’s ready. Ultimately, from transaction volume to smart contract deployment to investor token vesting, the testnet is more than a technical milestone—it’s a full simulation of what users and developers can expect once the mainnet goes live. For BlockDAG, it’s the last step before launch becomes reality. From Token Burns to Testnet Proof Momentum can come from price patterns, whale activity, or technical signals—but sustainability comes from systems that actually function under pressure. Shiba Inu’s burn spike and Chainlink’s bullish setup have sparked attention, yet both depend on favorable reactions. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is stress-testing every layer of its infrastructure through a live Beta Testnet—processing thousands of transactions daily, engaging over 200 miners, and integrating smart contracts and wallets in real time. As other projects build narratives around what could happen, BlockDAG is already collecting data on what’s working. The difference lies in what’s measurable.

Learn how these platforms are expanding and gaining traction. The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, with bullish trends emerging as new platforms become prominent. While some platforms wane over time, others ascend, demonstrating their durability and long-term appeal. With the market exhibiting positive trends, users seek platforms that provide stability and potential for significant growth. Among the top crypto platforms currently are Binance Coin (BNB), BlockDAG (BDAG), TRON (TRX), and Toncoin (TON). These platforms have demonstrated consistent growth, burgeoning ecosystems, and growing user bases. As the market progresses, they are positioned for potentially larger increases. Let’s delve into what makes them strong candidates in the current bullish cycle. 1. BlockDAG: Top Crypto Platform with Most Potential Growth in 2025 As market volatility increases, presale platforms have caught the attention of savvy users in 2025. BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with substantial interest. Distinct from traditional blockchains, BlockDAG utilizes a DAG ledger to enhance scalability, transaction speed, and efficiency. BlockDAG has also significantly influenced crypto mining with its X Series miners, especially the X1 Miner App. This app, popular among novices and seasoned miners alike, provides an uncomplicated and effective method for mining BDAG coins. With over 500,000 active miners, the X1 app is rapidly expanding as more individuals seek to capitalize on profits before the rise in mining challenges. BDAG continues to establish itself as a top crypto platform, with its presale exceeding $208.5 million and 18.9 billion coins distributed. Its community of over 170,000 unique holders shows robust market confidence, while early participants have experienced a 2,380% increase in price since the first batch. With the mainnet launch anticipated this year, projections suggest BDAG could reach $1, presenting substantial returns for early purchasers at its current price. 2. Binance Coin: Expanding Utility in a Robust Ecosystem Originally introduced as a utility asset for the Binance platform, Binance Coin (BNB) provided users with discounted trading fees. Over time, BNB has become integral to the crypto marketplace, facilitating transactions, staking, and initial offerings via the Binance Launchpad. As Binance maintains its status as a leading exchange, BNB’s significance remains closely linked to its operational success. With Binance’s ventures into decentralized finance (DeFi) and the growth of its Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem, BNB now powers a variety of applications in dApps, DeFi projects, and smart contracts. Its widening adoption ensures that BNB is a top crypto platform for users seeking assets with enduring value. The ongoing expansion of its ecosystem underscores its potential for further growth. 3. TRON: Pioneering Decentralization in Digital Content TRON (TRX) is crafted to empower content creators by eliminating intermediaries from digital platforms. Emphasizing a decentralized internet, TRON facilitates direct interactions among users, positioning it as a vital component in Web3 developments. Its blockchain is rapidly growing, supporting an increasing number of dApps and DeFi projects. A significant development for TRON was its acquisition of BitTorrent, which brought decentralized file-sharing to its suite of services. As TRON continues to attract developers and its DeFi offerings expand, TRX’s value is on the rise. With its growing ecosystem and practical applications, TRX stands out as a top crypto platform for those interested in blockchain’s evolving domain. 4. Toncoin: Revolutionizing Decentralized Social Media Toncoin (TON) draws attention with its association with Telegram, a major global messaging service. Focused on decentralized social media and secure communications, TON distinguishes itself from conventional blockchain initiatives. Utilizing Telegram’s extensive user base, TON aims to mainstream blockchain technology to a global audience. TON is making strides with new initiatives to integrate dApps and services within Telegram, enhancing its ecosystem continually. Its pivotal role in decentralized communications positions it as a formidable force in Web3 social media. With its user base widening and adoption increasing, TON ranks as a top crypto platform for those monitoring blockchain’s impact on social media. Overview: Top Crypto Platforms to Watch in 2025 In conclusion, let’s review the top crypto platforms for 2025, emphasizing those poised for significant attention this year. Binance Coin is broadening its functionality within DeFi and smart contracts. TRON is transforming the domain of digital content and decentralized applications, whereas Toncoin is advancing by merging blockchain with secure messaging and social media. The BlockDAG presale is notably promising, particularly due to its significant expansion thus far. The presale for BDAG has escalated beyond $208.5 million, with more than 18.9 billion coins distributed. With predictions suggesting a rise to $1, acquiring BDAG now might yield considerable gains at launch, as this platform is expected to experience substantial growth in the upcoming months.

While Hyperliquid’s recent price rebound and NEAR Protocol’s network upgrade have been noteworthy, it’s Dragoin’s token burn strategy that truly merits attention. Although Hyperliquid displays flickers of recovery with mixed technical indicators, and NEAR Protocol enhances its system with eight shards to improve scalability, these developments don’t impact investor value as significantly as Dragoin’s deflationary tactics. With every token not sold in the presale gets burned, Dragoin $DDGN establishes genuine scarcity from the outset, securing a strategic advantage for early investors in a market typically driven by long-term promises and speculative ventures. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Token’s 25% Recovery Surge Following a steep 55% fall from $27.53 to $12.06 between February 18 and March 13, Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) token has made a significant comeback, rising to over $16—a 25% increase within the past week. This surge indicates a resurgence of buying interest, although the technical analysis reveals a more nuanced scenario. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is still negative at -0.30, suggesting that sell-offs continue to dominate. Conversely, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a positive outlook, with the 12-day EMA surpassing the 26-day EMA, signaling bullish prospects. This mixed signal from the indicators points to a possible further appreciation in price, with potential targets at $18.35 and $22.23 if the buying momentum continues. However, should the upward trend not maintain its pace, the token might revisit the support level at $12.06. NEAR Protocol Boosts Network Capacity by 33% NEAR Protocol has successfully increased its mainnet capacity by enlarging it from six to eight shards, resulting in a 33% enhancement in network throughput. This upgrade brings in the capability for single-block resharding, which replaces the previous requirement for hour-long state rebuilds. Validators can now adjust shard states within a single block, reducing downtime and smoothing the transition towards dynamic resharding. This feature allows the network to automatically modify the number of shards to alleviate congestion effectively. Additionally, NEAR has proven its ability to execute multiple shard splits at the same time, marking an essential progression towards its ambitious objective of accommodating fifty shards on the mainnet. Dragoin’s Token Burn Strategy Boosts Early Investor Rewards Dragoin’s presale strategy is designed to enhance early investor value through a decisive token burn of all unsold tokens. Rather than reallocating unsold tokens or saving them for future use, Dragoin completely eliminates them, permanently reducing the total supply. This action immediately constrains supply and introduces deflationary pressure right from the start. The presale is structured into 25 stages, each with a predetermined allocation of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens. Any tokens that remain unsold at the end of each stage are permanently removed, thereby not only clearing out excess supply but also boosting scarcity. This mechanism ensures that early investors benefit from increased token rarity and potential for quicker value growth, as each token burn effectively increases the value of the remaining tokens. Early stage participants gain doubly: they purchase at lower prices and benefit as subsequent stages see further token burns, enhancing the value of their holdings. Unlike models where the supply might increase, Dragoin’s strategy ties value directly to community engagement and actual usage, making scarcity a fundamental economic advantage rather than just a promotional strategy. Currently, at $0.0000292 in the Stage 1 presale, Dragoin is projected to launch at $0.002, offering a potential return of 6,700%. For those undecided, every token not sold is an opportunity lost. The fewer tokens that remain after the presale, the higher the demand will need to be to match the dwindling supply. Dragoin doesn’t just gradually build value—it ignites it with each token burn. Immediate Scarcity Over Speculative Promise While Hyperliquid shows potential technical growth and NEAR Protocol enhances its scale, neither can match the direct, tangible value shift offered by Dragoin’s token burn mechanism. Unlike others that focus on building hype with promises of future enhancements, Dragoin actively diminishes its supply—providing early adopters with tangible benefits right from the start. Scarcity isn’t something Dragoin plans for the future; it’s crafted immediately. For those balancing the allure of short-term gains with solid long-term principles, Dragoin doesn’t merely weave an enticing narrative—it substantiates it with concrete outcomes. In a market where surplus often undermines value, Dragoin takes a different approach by affirming its early supporters’ trust right away.

In a recent video posted on X, Hilton stated his belief that XRP, like all major cryptocurrencies, is subject to daily manipulation and that its price is being deliberately suppressed. Hilton asserted that financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, are regularly manipulated. “Stocks are being manipulated every single day,” he stated, comparing traditional finance to digital assets.

Another notable expert recently drew attention to the role of market makers in suppressing XRP’s price . Hilton emphasized that the relatively low liquidity in the crypto market makes it easier for these forces to influence prices. Regarding XRP specifically, Hilton expressed confidence that its price is being held down. He cited market data and price charts as evidence. He also dismissed claims that manipulation occurs within the XRP Ledger, stating, “I don’t really think there’s manipulation going on in that context.” Instead, he focused on broader financial market forces impacting XRP and other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Cardano.

He reaffirmed his belief in the asset’s long-term potential, stating that he expects it to rise by 20X, 30X, or 40X at some point. His confidence is based on the expectation that regulatory clarity and institutional adoption will eventually drive significant price appreciation. Hilton also described the cryptocurrency market as the “last big financial frontier,” comparing its current stage to the early days of the stock market. In his view, the presence of manipulation does not negate the long-term opportunities within the space. “Am I going to let the fact that this is happening to XRP make me sell my XRP? No,” he said. Experts believe that institutions like BlackRock are looking to accumulate XRP at low prices , and selling tokens now could cost investors significant profits in the future and allow these institutions to dominate the market. Hilton’s position on XRP remains firm despite concerns about price suppression. He shared insights into his personal investment strategy, emphasizing a long-term approach. He stated that he continues to buy and hold tokens, even amid market manipulation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Analysts Weigh In,https://cryptopotato.com/is-eth-dead-as-an-investment-analysts-weigh-in/,"Ether’s (ETH) underperformance as an asset has continued to spark criticism and speculation in the crypto community, with many expressing their displeasure at the Ethereum network’s current trajectory. Quinn Thompson, founder of the discretionary macro hedge fund Lekker Capital, insists that ETH is now completely dead as an investment. While some analysts and market participants do not agree with him, others concur with him, giving reasons for their opinions. ETH is Dead as an Investment To substantiate his stance, Thompson mentioned that ETH, an asset with a market cap of $225 billion, is seeing a decline in transaction activity, user growth, fees, and revenue. Although the Ethereum network still has utility, he believes it is dead as an investment. “There is no investment case here. As a network with utility? Yes. As an investment? Absolutely not,” the Lekker Capital founder stated. In alignment with Thompson’s view, Nic Carter, co-founder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics and partner at the blockchain venture capital firm Castle Island Ventures, explained why ETH is dead as an investment. According to Carter, the main reason is that greedy Ethereum layer-2 networks are siphoning value from the blockchain, and that there is a social consensus that the creation of excess tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem is okay. The analyst said ETH died by its own hand because it had been buried “in an avalanche of its own tokens.” Analysts Blame L2s, VCs, Bitcoin Maxis Responding to Carter’s tweet, Thompson asserted that the social consensus that found the excess token creation okay happened because the emergence of endless layer-2 chains, staking, and restaking protocols enriched the pockets of developers and team members. However, now that the situation has turned awry, no one wants to admit that the concept was wrong, especially with the market saying it was a mistake. Furthermore, a pseudonymous analyst insisted that “Solana scammers” and Bitcoin maximalists cheered the creation of excess tokens on Ethereum. Since venture capitalists could not “shill” ETH, they had to sponsor the development of infinite layer-1 networks so they could dump on retailers. “If we would all come together around ETH as a community, it would be inherently strong and wouldn’t need outside banks or institutions. But bitcoin maxis were and are too afraid of it because it’s everything bitcoin(number go up and down coin) wants to be,” the analyst said. At the time of writing, ETH was worth around $1,830, having lost almost 50% of its value from a year ago. The post Is ETH Dead as an Investment?

Former Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported the development, highlighting that Ripple was not included in the announcement. Terrett noted that while some may have expected Ripple’s case to be addressed simultaneously, the procedural differences make its resolution distinct from the other cases. No @Ripple here but I’m not entirely surprised because, again, it is slightly different to these other cases in that (as @s_alderoty mentioned in his post) the SEC now has to go to the Southern District and ask Judge Torres to lift the standard injunction. Once that is done, they… https://t.co/KVjCsR6l2V — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 27, 2025 SEC’s Legal Actions and Dismissals The SEC’s lawsuits against Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland were part of the agency’s broader enforcement efforts against companies operating in the cryptocurrency space. The decision to dismiss these cases suggests a shift in the SEC’s litigation strategy, though the reasons behind the dismissals remain unspecified in the agency’s announcement. Terrett pointed out that Ripple’s case differs from the others because the SEC must first request Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to lift the standard injunction previously imposed at the SEC’s request. Once that process is completed, the SEC can vote on the final steps in the case, including its appeal withdrawal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Case Nears Final Resolution Terrett referenced a post by Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, which provided additional details on the finalization of the SEC v. Ripple case. According to Alderoty, the SEC has already agreed to drop its appeal without conditions, and Ripple will withdraw its cross-appeal. As part of the resolution, Ripple will pay $50 million of the originally imposed $125 million fine, while the remaining amount will be returned to the company. Alderoty explained that the SEC will now ask the court to lift the injunction, and the process will be subject to the necessary commission vote, drafting of final documents, and standard court procedures. He indicated this should be the last update on the case, signaling that the long-running legal battle between the SEC and Ripple is nearing its conclusion. Broader Implications The SEC’s dismissal of cases against Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland, along with the expected resolution of the Ripple lawsuit, reflects ongoing changes in the agency’s regulatory approach to the cryptocurrency industry. The outcomes of these cases may influence future enforcement actions and provide further clarity on the SEC’s stance regarding digital asset companies. With Ripple’s case requiring additional procedural steps, the company awaits the court’s decision on lifting the injunction before the SEC can finalize its legal actions. While the agency has not publicly explained its rationale for the dismissals, these developments indicate that the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency firms continues to evolve.

For those looking to diversify beyond the usual suspects like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there’s a whole universe of altcoins offering unique opportunities. Among these, Qubetics, Render, and Arbitrum have been making waves, each carving out its own niche and attracting a growing number of backers. Enter Qubetics , a project that’s been turning heads with its ambitious presale and innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization. With impressive milestones under its belt, it’s positioning itself as a strong contender in the altcoin arena. By bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology, Qubetics is unlocking new levels of liquidity and accessibility. As adoption grows, it has the potential to reshape the way assets are bought, sold, and traded globally. Qubetics: The World’s First Web3 Aggregator Qubetics is making headlines with its ongoing crypto presale , currently in its 27th stage. Priced at $0.1300, the project has already raised over $15.5 million, boasting more than 23,900 token holders and over 504 million $TICS tokens sold. These figures highlight the community’s confidence in Qubetics’ vision and potential. At its core, Qubetics is pioneering a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. This means businesses, professionals, and individuals can convert tangible assets—like real estate, art, or commodities—into digital tokens on the blockchain. Imagine a small business owner in São Paulo turning a portion of their property into tokens to raise capital, or an artist in Buenos Aires tokenizing their artwork to reach a global audience. This approach not only democratizes access to investment opportunities but also enhances liquidity and transparency in asset transactions. A $200 Investment in Qubetics Could Be Your Ticket to Massive Gains Let’s break it down with a $200 investment at the current price of $0.1300 per $TICS. That would get you approximately 1,538 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, your $200 turns into $1,538, marking a 669% ROI. If it climbs to $5, that same investment explodes to $7,692, an astonishing 3,745% ROI. At $10 per $TICS, you’re sitting on a massive $15,384, and if it soars to $15, your $200 investment skyrockets to $23,077—a jaw-dropping 11,437% return. With adoption growing and analysts projecting TICS as a major player in the Web3 space, the opportunity to get in at this low price won’t last long. Those who act now could be looking at potentially life-changing gains, while those who hesitate might find themselves priced out when $TICS starts making big moves. These projections have many considering Qubetics as one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Render: Decentralizing GPU Power Render has carved out a solid spot in the crypto community by offering a decentralized network for GPU-based rendering solutions. This platform connects those in need of rendering power with those who have excess GPU capacity, creating a peer-to-peer network that benefits both parties. By decentralizing rendering services, Render significantly reduces costs and processing times for artists, developers, and content creators worldwide. The project has been a go-to for artists, designers, and developers looking for cost-effective and scalable rendering solutions. By leveraging blockchain technology, Render ensures that rendering tasks are distributed efficiently, reducing costs and increasing accessibility. This unique approach has solidified its position as one of the best altcoins to invest in now for those interested in the intersection of blockchain and creative industries. Arbitrum (ARB): Enhancing Ethereum’s Scalability Arbitrum is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution designed to improve the speed and reduce the cost of transactions on the Ethereum network. By utilizing optimistic rollups, Arbitrum can handle a higher volume of transactions without compromising on security. Its compatibility with Ethereum’s smart contracts and developer tools makes it a seamless and efficient choice for scaling decentralized applications (dApps). The platform has gained traction among developers and users seeking efficient and scalable solutions for decentralized applications.

Using historical data from previous bull runs, the analyst highlighted a recurring pattern in XRP’s relative strength index (RSI), indicating the possibility of another significant price surge. #XRP – 90 to 120 Days Until ATH! The RSI chart below shows important historical patterns! I was one of the first to notice that #XRP usually has two peaks during #Bull Runs. Reviewing past cycles, we see that in 2021, the second peak occurred after 90 days, while in 2017,… pic.twitter.com/MgPpbwnmS3 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 28, 2025 Historical Patterns in XRP’s RSI Egrag Crypto’s analysis focuses on XRP’s RSI movements during past market cycles. In a recent tweet, the analyst pointed out that XRP typically exhibits two peaks during major bull runs. This pattern was observed in both the 2017 and 2021 market cycles. The tweet emphasizes that 2017 XRP’s second peak occurred 120 days after the initial surge, while in 2021, it took approximately 90 days. Based on this historical data, Egrag Crypto suggests that XRP could follow a similar timeline in the current cycle. The attached chart illustrates XRP’s RSI fluctuations, marking significant peaks in previous cycles. The analysis indicates that XRP is positioned in a phase comparable to past pre-peak periods. If the pattern holds, the next major price movement could align with the projected 90 to 120-day window. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Targets and Market Sentiment Egrag Crypto’s chart highlights potential price levels that XRP could reach in the coming months. The analyst has identified resistance levels around $66, $70, and $76 while also marking higher targets at $85, $88, and $89. If XRP follows the historical trend, these levels could come into play as the price moves toward a possible ATH. The market sentiment surrounding XRP remains a key factor in determining whether this projection materializes. Historically, XRP’s price movements have been influenced by regulatory developments and overall market conditions. While past trends provide valuable insights, external factors could impact XRP’s trajectory. Egrag Crypto’s tweet concludes with encouragement for the XRP community , urging holders to remain steady as the market progresses. The statement reinforces confidence in the asset’s potential, aligning with the analyst’s long-term bullish outlook. The 90 to 120-day timeframe places the anticipated price action within the middle of 2025. If XRP follows its historical RSI pattern, investors could witness a significant movement in the coming months. However, as with all market predictions, the outcome remains subject to broader market dynamics and investor sentiment.

On the Thinking Crypto podcast, Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic analytics , gave a detailed analysis of what’s happening with XRP and where it could head in the short, mid, and long term. Short-Term Outlook (Next Few Weeks to Months): Right now, XRP is holding strong above its 200-day moving average cloud, which sits between $1.76 and $1.80. This is key because it shows XRP’s resilience even when the broader crypto market is shaky. While the price action isn’t super bullish, the fact that XRP stays above this level is a good sign. (Source: @Wealthmanagerrr ) Some charts even hint at a possible “head and shoulders” pattern, which could mean a pullback. But as long as XRP holds above that $1.76 support, it’s not all bad news. Mid-Term Outlook (Next 6 to 12 Months): Next, XRP’s relative strength stands out compared to other altcoins. While many coins are trading below their 200-day averages, XRP is holding its ground. This could mean a possible breakout if the overall market improves. If XRP manages to break above key resistance levels, we might see a price surge towards $3 or higher. However, the market’s cautious mood means we’ll need to see strong bullish signs before getting too optimistic. Long-Term Outlook (1 to 2 Years and Beyond): For the long haul, XRP’s story is tied to regulatory developments and broader crypto adoption. If the market turns bullish again, XRP could ride that wave. Analysts are watching closely for signs of a sustained trend above the 200-day average, which could lead to a new bull run. In the best-case scenario, XRP could reach $5 or more, but that’s contingent on positive market conditions and potential regulatory clarity.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-30 06:48:03

Either way, a video of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin went viral and not in a good way. The crypto community on X.com, rarely known for decorum, blasted Buterin for kneeling before a robot and emitting what sounds like a “meow” sound. To some, the video underscored why one needs to be “bullish” about Ethereum’s present and future. To others, it was worthy of a Studio Ghibli-style photo edit. Most people kept scrolling. See below. https://twitter.com/Philfog/status/1905634153535541262 In the brief clip, Buterin pats the robot on the head after making the unusual sound. While he has yet to comment on the video, the moment has ignited chatter, particularly given Ether’s recent price struggles. As of publication, Ether has dropped nearly 55% since reclaiming the $4,000 mark in December 2024, now trading at $1,833 — down over 8% in the past week. Source: CoinGecko Some crypto figures have expressed concern, with commentator “The Count of Monte Crypto” humorously noting that the state of Ether’s price was more worrying than Buterin’s quirky behavior. And when Buterin tried posting about “how to fund public goods,” he was trolled by the crypto community with statements like: “NO ONE F–KING CARE[S]” and “YOU ARE THE ONLY FOUNDER THAT IS DOING 0 APART FROM DUMPING YOUR AIRDROPS! WAKE UP VITALIK.” It’s noteworthy that Buterin has long been known for being quirky and, according to a recent Bloomberg feature, “monkish.” But his behavior occasionally invites scrutiny. Iggy Azalea, for example, dissed Buterin for singing at TOKEN2049 in Singapore, calling it “loser s—.” Buterin is also not clear-cut in his political affiliation, which is somewhat refreshing for today’s polarized crypto traders. He has spoken openly against former SEC chair Gary Gensler as well as the dangers of “large-scale political coins” — seemingly a critique at Trump. Indeed, many crypto leaders have embraced Trump’s pro-crypto stance, but Buterin has distanced himself, rejecting what he called the “bronze-aged mindset” favored by some in the crypto community. With Ether facing uncertain prospects and Buterin’s actions fueling speculation, it remains unclear whether his personal brand of decentralization or his refusal to align with Trump’s crypto-friendly policies will shape Ethereum’s path forward.

Pal tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin tends to follow the global liquidity cycle but with a 10-week lag. The macro guru shares a chart suggesting that global M2, or the total money supply across the world, has sharply risen after carving a bottom in late 2024. Based on the data, Pal predicts that Bitcoin will soon end its correction and begin sparking fresh rallies. “The waiting game is almost over…the 10-week lead is my preferred.” Source: Raoul Pal/X While Pal thinks that BTC rallies are imminent, he points out that Global Macro Investor’s (GMI) head of macro research, Julien Bittel, believes that Bitcoin trails the global M2 metric by 12 weeks. According to Bittel, Bitcoin will carve a local bottom this week before moving “higher again.” Earlier this month, Pal predicted that global M2 will continue to rise while Bitcoin and crypto witness a “regular correction.” “This too shall pass… Crypto is still feeling the tightening in liquidity from the stronger dollar and higher rates in Q4 2024. That is almost done and financial conditions are easing fast and M2 is headed back to new highs.” Source: Raoul Pal/X He also predicted that Bitcoin would hit a market cycle top of at least $210,000, but he also notes that it is within the realm of possibility for BTC to climb to $412,000 or $805,000. “Over time, we just keep climbing the log regression channel. Whether we stay at the man (red) or climb above it by another standard deviation or two remains to be seen as the cycle develops.” Source: Raoul Pal/X The logarithmic regression channel is a technical tool that helps traders visualize long-term price trends on a logarithmic scale. At time of writing, BTC is trading for $82,500, down 2.25% in the past day.

In the analysis, Vincent focused on the weekly chart, arguing that a longer time frame provides a clearer picture of the asset’s position within the market cycle. His comments come amid short-term fluctuations that have led to increased speculation among traders. Zooming XRP chart out to a weekly, shows a very different story.

He emphasized that, from a momentum standpoint, the market has been trading sideways following its recent significant price increase. Rather than making a price prediction, he explained that the chart reflects a “wait and see” status, where the market consolidates before its next move. He also addressed the daily price volatility, attributing it to various factors such as market makers, coordinated whale movements , sophisticated bot trading, and manipulation across multiple tokens. He advised long-term holders to focus on the weekly chart instead of reacting emotionally to short-term fluctuations. Market Fundamentals and Outlook Van Code highlighted several key factors that support XRP’s long-term prospects. He stated that the asset’s fundamentals remain strong, regulatory developments are moving in a positive direction , and the problem XRP is designed to solve still exists. Additionally, he noted that no competitors are currently posing a significant challenge and that no ongoing legal issues affect its status. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He drew a parallel between this market phase and his past experiences in stock investments, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. Recalling a situation where he invested in a company developing a new HIV drug, he explained how negative headlines caused the stock price to decline by 60%. However, after conducting thorough research and focusing on long-term fundamentals, he held onto his investment. Eventually, the company’s clinical trials advanced, leading to a 120% increase in stock value. Advice for Investors Van Code backed the importance of focusing on market fundamentals rather than short-term noise. He urged investors to mature in their approach, zoom out on the chart, and filter out unnecessary distractions. While he clarified that his comments were not financial advice, he encouraged others to study the underlying value of XRP and its primary use cases rather than getting caught up in daily speculation. His analysis serves as a reminder that long-term market movements often involve periods of consolidation before resuming their trend. For XRP holders, this perspective may provide reassurance amid current market conditions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This meltdown has translated into some $220 million in market outflows—amid what appears to be increasing anxiety over U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nominee Paul Atkins. ​ Paul Atkins’ crypto holdings spark scrutiny Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, is a proponent of a lighter regulatory approach. President Donald Trump nominated him, and he has come under scrutiny for his significant financial interests in the crypto sector, including between $2 million and $6 million in crypto-related assets. Such holdings include stakes in crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, tokenization firm Securitize, and crypto investment firm Off the Chain Capital. During his confirmation hearing in the Senate, lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, zeroed in on potential conflicts of interest related to Atkins’ extensive background as a regulatory adviser to major financial institutions, including digital asset companies. Senator Warren expressed concerns that Atkins’ former clients, who paid him handsomely to help shape regulators such as the SEC, could unduly profit from his leadership. ​ While Ripple recently won a landmark legal battle against the SEC, Atkins’ confirmation process has raised new questions about the long-term regulatory environment for crypto. These events have been met with some significant volatility in the crypto market. XRP fell to $2.06 earlier today before bouncing back to $2.15 as cautious traders remain unsure of the regulatory landscape. Traders weigh the risks of stricter crypto regulations Traders fear that if they block the appointment of Atkins to the SEC Chair position, a more crypto-unfriendly successor could slide into the position instead. This may result in stricter regulations, postponing or even rejecting XRP and other altcoin ETFs getting approved. According to data from Polymarkets, the odds of an XRP ETF being approved before July 31 have declined from 35% to 28% since the scrutiny surrounding Atkins began. Source: Polymarket XRP open interest, one of the most essential indicators for futures market activity, has reduced from $1.6 billion to $1.48 billion in just 10 days; this $220 million reduction in open interest, based on data shown by CryptoQuant, gives proof of lost confidence in a rapidly upcoming XRP recovery. When traders exit their positions en masse, they either take profits or work to limit their losses to stanch further damage. This also suggests that most players are betting that an extension of selling pressure is likely unless the regulatory landscape radically changes for the better. The outflows in derivatives are a pretty obvious sign of increasing uncertainty. The uncertainty of the near-term price direction leaves a lack of conviction to make anyone bet on a comeback. Bearish momentum pushes XRP toward a drop below $2 According to technical indicators, XRP risks sliding below the key $2 support area. The token faces strong resistance at $2.41 (the 50-day Simple Moving Average) and $2.51 (the 100-day SMA). If XRP loses that level, you would expect it to fall further to $1,50, which is a psychological level. A break below $2 could trigger panic selling, pushing prices down to $1.80. Sustained bearish momentum could even see XRP testing lower support levels in the weeks ahead. Otherwise, a move to the upside would require a breakout above $2.41. If that occurs, XRP can rally to $2.60 and the 100-day SMA. However, given the current market sentiment and regulatory uncertainty, a significant surge in buying volume would be necessary to sustain such an upward move. As the confirmation process for the SEC chair continues, market participants are closely monitoring the situation. Atkins has committed to sell off all of his financial holdings that would otherwise pose a conflict of interest, including those of his consulting firm, Patomak Global Partners. Investor confidence still remains cautious, as many are biding their time, waiting for clearer regulatory signals before committing more funds to XRP and the wider cryptocurrency market.

The world’s leading cryptocurrency is struggling to hold its gains, with technical indicators pointing toward a shift toward bearish territory. Key Support Levels at Risk On the daily chart, Bitcoin has dropped below a critical Fibonacci support level around $83,000, which had previously acted as a strong foundation. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, this move suggests a reversal in the short-term trend. If Bitcoin can’t reclaim this level, the next major support is around the high $70,000 range. Resistance levels remain firm, with $85,000 and $88,000 acting as key obstacles. A daily close below $83,000 would likely turn this support into resistance, adding more downward pressure on the price. Bullish Momentum Fading The bullish momentum that drove optimism in recent weeks is now losing strength. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching a critical threshold, where a drop below this level confirms the end of the bullish trend. This marks a shift in sentiment, showing that Bitcoin’s recent recovery may have reached its peak. What’s Next for Bitcoin? In the short term, traders are focusing on the $81,600 level. A drop below this level could trigger a move toward $80,000 and possibly down to $78,500. Resistance levels to watch include $83,500, $85,000, and $88,000. Despite the current downward pressure, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains uncertain, influenced by macroeconomic factors and overall market sentiment.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-30 07:11:06

Back in its early days, AI16Z was just another tiny player trying to ride the AI hype wave. Fast forward, and it turned average Joes into crypto millionaires. That low entry point—$0.00009 to be exact—was a money-making machine for early believers. Today, it’s trading at more than 35x that price, and the whales are already in. But guess what? History has a wild way of repeating itself—just wearing a different logo. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the next potential moonshot that’s not just selling hype but delivering with a community, utility, and a ridiculously generous presale that’s making waves as the Best New Meme Coins to Join Today. BTFD has already raised over $6.43 million, sold more than 72 billion coins, and now boasts over 11,600 holders. And yep, it’s in Stage 15—the second-to-last round before launch.

Let’s talk numbers. At $0.0002, Stage 15 is the last real chance to get in low. The presale ends at $0.0006, offering a straightforward 200% gain. But crypto analysts are calling for a moonshot to $0.006, giving early-stage investors a 2900% ROI. Now imagine this: You throw in $3,000 at the current price of $0.0002. That nets you 15 million BTFD tokens. But wait—drop in LAUNCH100 as your bonus code before March 30, and you get double: 30 million tokens. If BTFD hits $0.006 post-launch, you’re sitting on $180,000. Wild, right? But it’s more than numbers.

When this AI-driven meme coin launched at $0.00009, very few took it seriously. “It’s just another AI gimmick,” they said. But the real ones who saw potential and hopped in early? They’re the ones grinning right now. AI16Z hit the market with tight community vibes, deep AI branding, and just the right amount of meme spice to spark interest. Its rise wasn’t instant, but once it took off, it didn’t look back.

And the clock’s ticking. Conclusion: Don’t Fumble This Bag Like AI16Z—Act Before the Bulls Run Without You You already saw what missing out on AI16Z did to your potential portfolio.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours.

PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0000065, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000516. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price has declined over the last few hours as it faced intense selling pressure. The price is aiming for a hold below the $0.0000072 mark. Will Pepe price recover? If buyers strongly defend the $0.000007 mark, we might see a strong recovery above $0.0000075. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news Santiment’s Daily Active Addresses index shows a bearish trend for the frog-based meme coin, PEPE. This index measures network activity and a decrease in active addresses from 7,319 in early February to 3,611 this week suggests falling demand for PEPE’s blockchain. This ongoing decline since mid-November likely signals a negative outlook for PEPE’s price. PEPE Price Prediction March 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.0000059 and $0.0000088, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000015. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) March 2025 0.0000059 0.0000072 0.0000088 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000024. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community.

The platform will stabilize its operations through introducing a stablecoin which backs USD value together with fee-supported token buyback procedures to maintain price stability over the duration. Stakeholders who can obtain staking rewards gain financial incentives for keeping their liquidity on the platform thus building stronger confidence throughout the system.

This development comes amid an impressive market comeback over the past two weeks following the heavy withdrawals seen in early March. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slips Under $84,000 — Key Support Levels To Watch Bitcoin Spot ETFs: 10 Straight Days Of Positive Netflows According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the Bitcoin ETFs registered total net outflows of $93.47 million on Friday, moving its aggregate netflows for the past week to $196.7 million. Prior to Friday’s negative input, these funds recorded a positive flow for 10 consecutive trading days suggesting a high amount of favorable market interest. This development indicates a return of bullish sentiments among Bitcoin institutional investors following the bearish mood seen in February and early March which featured massive asset withdrawals. In a similar fashion, Blackrock’s IBIT accounted for the majority of the inflows from last week by attracting $171.95 million in investments, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $86.84 million. VanEck’s HODL was the only other ETF with a positive inflow of $5 million in new deposits. On the other hand, a large percentage of withdrawals came from Ark Invest’s ARKB which recorded $40.97 million in net outflows. Invesco’s BTCO, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Bitwise’s BITB also experienced moderate levels of redemptions ranging between $6.95 million – $10.22 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC, BTC, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC registered no significant flow.

With Q2 of 2025 fast approaching, the Bitcoin spot ETFs conclude the first quarter of the year on an uncertain note. The year began with strong bullish momentum, driving $5.25 billion in net inflows during January. However, this was followed by a sharp reversal, with cumulative net liquidations of $4.25 billion across February and March. Notably, the resurgence of positive inflows seen in the latter half of March is a sign of renewed market interest and strong market confidence. Furthermore, the crypto-friendly stance being adopted by the Donald Trump administration could encourage institutional investment in the long run. However, macroeconomic factors including potential Fed rate hikes, and ongoing US tariff changes may force investors to move out of high-risk assets or other associated investments. In addition, the uncertainty over the current Bitcoin bull run also draws serious concerns. At the time of writing, the flagship crypto asset trades at $83,359 after a 0.77% decline in the past day. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is down by 49.43% and is valued at $16.88 billion.

As indicated, this pattern, often considered a bullish reversal signal, has led to price targets between $3.7 and $3.9. #XRP – Most Probably Inverse Head & Shoulder: Measured Move is $3.7-$3.9. Let Us Wait and See pic.twitter.com/cd1UscX5mh — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 28, 2025 Key Price Levels and Market Structure The chart accompanying Egrag Crypto’s analysis shows a well-defined ascending channel where XRP has been trading. The inverse head and shoulders pattern is clearly illustrated, with the left shoulder, head, and right shoulder marked. The neckline, a crucial level in confirming the pattern, appears to align with a potential breakout target of approximately $2.97. If this pattern plays out as expected, the projected price movement could reach the $3.7-$3.9 range. Additionally, a broader price target of $4.60 is noted at the upper boundary of the ascending channel. Other key levels on the chart include support at approximately $2.10 and a Fibonacci retracement level around $2.23. These areas may serve as important reference points for traders watching for confirmation of the pattern. Egrag Crypto’s analysis also points to a previously filled fair value gap, suggesting that XRP has completed an essential technical step before making a potential move upward . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Market Conditions According to the chart, XRP is currently trading at around $2.25. The near-term movement will be crucial in determining whether the inverse head and shoulders pattern fully forms and leads to a breakout. Market participants are likely watching for a sustained move above the neckline to confirm the pattern’s validity. Community Reactions Following Egrag Crypto’s post, some users shared their thoughts on the market outlook. One user, XRPinit, mentioned recently purchasing XRP with spare cash and intending to use it while traveling in Sri Lanka. However, they noted that XRP had pulled back after their purchase. Another user, Preston, expressed concern about the prolonged price action, stating that they have been holding since May 2020. They acknowledged selling some of their holdings when XRP previously reached $3.40 but noted that they have been repurchasing since then. Egrag Crypto’s analysis provides a structured technical outlook for XRP, suggesting the possibility of a bullish breakout if key levels hold. The next steps for XRP will depend on whether the market confirms the inverse head and shoulders pattern, with traders closely monitoring price movements around the $2.97 level.

Analytics Company Predicts BTC’s Future,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/when-will-bitcoins-expected-high-volatility-come-analytics-company-predicts-btcs-future/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has published a new report outlining key market indicators that suggest Bitcoin (BTC) could enter a consolidation phase in the coming weeks. According to their findings, Bitcoin's annualized Sharpe Ratio is on the decline, reflecting past market cycles that saw periods of stagnation or correction. The Sharpe Ratio, a metric used to evaluate risk-adjusted returns, has fallen to levels comparable to those seen in 2023, 2020, 2019, and 2016. With the ratio approaching zero, analysts at Alphractal suggest that Bitcoin offers lower returns per unit of risk. Historically, similar trends have been followed by market pauses, suggesting that a consolidation phase may be the most likely outcome. Another key indicator flagged by Alphractal is Bitcoin’s one-year percentage change approaching negative territory. Of the four previous instances where this has occurred, three resulted in bearish moves, while one had no significant impact. Related News: Binance Makes Swift Statement on Hacker Who Claimed to Have Stolen 100 Thousand People's Cryptocurrency Exchange Login Info This decline in Bitcoin’s historical variation could signal a period of lower volatility and less risk, making the market less attractive for short-term speculative trading. If Bitcoin follows the pattern observed in 2020, it may simply be experiencing a routine consolidation phase. However, if the metric continues its downward trend, the possibility of new lows could increase. Commenting on the current market outlook, Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson said those expecting increased volatility in the near term may need to be patient. *This is not investment advice.

Whether you’re chasing wild ROI, crazy cat memes, or a full-blown mythological adventure in the presale space, these three digital gems are stealing the limelight. Let’s dive deep into the Top Crypto to Buy Today: Arctic Pablo Coin , Toshi, and Simon’s Cat. Let’s unpack the hype and show you exactly why now might be your golden ticket moment. Top Crypto to Buy Today – Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Mythic Meme Hunt You Didn’t Expect Strap in, because this isn’t your average crypto story. Arctic Pablo Coin is an absolute game-changer—crafted with a mythical narrative that’s as bold as its tokenomics. At the heart of this frosty adventure is Arctic Pablo, a fearless cartoon explorer sledding through icy wonderlands like Atlantis, the Snowy Caves, and now the 16th location: Crystal Cove. At just $0.000083 per token, it’s an absolute steal. As he ventures deeper into Earth’s coldest corners, Pablo uncovers glowing treasure: the legendary $APC tokens. And this gem is quickly becoming the Top Crypto to Buy Today during an exciting meme coin presale . Here’s the kicker—this presale isn’t just staged. It’s location-based, meaning each week-long presale ties to a new mythical place, making the whole thing feel like a Netflix docuseries mixed with meme coin magic. Right now, you can scoop up $1,204,819 $APC for just $100, and if it hits the planned listing price of $0.008, you’re looking at a mind-melting $9,638.55. That’s over 9552.41% ROI—yeah, you read that right. No cap. The presale’s heating up too—over $2 million raised, and we’re not even at the final destination yet. And here’s where it gets spicy: every single unsold token at the end of each weekly presale? Torched. Burnt. Gone. That burn mechanism creates a juicy deflationary environment, meaning supply shrinks, value pumps, and your bag could swell quicker than you can say “moonshot.” It’s this unique approach that cements Arctic Pablo Coin as the Top Crypto to Buy Today for those chasing serious upside with a twist of storytelling brilliance. But wait—it gets even better. Stake your Arctic Pablo Coin after launch and bag a massive 66% APY—yeah, sixty-six, not sixteen. Just stake your coins, chill through the two-month vesting period, and watch your investment snowball while Pablo uncovers more mystical treasures. It’s passive income with a mythic twist. So if you’ve ever dreamt of joining a meme coin presale that’s got actual lore, a clever roadmap, and a deflationary burn structure that makes sense—mate, this is your shot. Don’t get caught snoozing. Crystal Cove’s closing fast, and Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a coin—it’s a blizzard of hype, making it the Top Crypto to Buy Today if you’re keen to stack while the ice is still fresh. Toshi (TOSHI): The Meme King of the Base Chain That Just Won’t Quit Toshi is your battle-scarred alley cat that just keeps landing on its feet. Built on the Base chain, Toshi brings OG meme vibes, Gen Z banter, and a massive 420.69 billion token supply that’s actively traded by a relentless community. Right now, Toshi is sitting at $0.0003294, with a market cap of $134.42 million, and 408.06 billion tokens in circulation. While it’s down 85.53% from its January 2025 ATH of $0.002273, don’t let that scare ya. It’s still flexing a ludicrous +4,157,848.46% from its ATL, proving that this kitty’s got claws. Its recent 24-hour volume hit $12.27 million, and a volume-to-market cap ratio of 9.14% tells us the community is alive, kicking, and trading like mad. This isn’t just a nostalgia coin—it’s active, volatile, and hungry for a comeback. And when it rallies, it really rallies. Simon’s Cat (CAT): From Viral YouTube Legend to Meme Coin Juggernaut Don’t sleep on this feline—it’s scratching its way into serious investor wallets. Simon’s Cat (CAT) is one of the most recognizable IP-backed meme coins right now, blending childhood nostalgia with serious tokenomics. This cat is quietly sharpening its claws at a live price of $0.05796, a market cap of $53.73 million, and a whopping 6.74 trillion CAT in circulation (out of 9 trillion total). Here’s where things get spicy. CAT’s 24-hour trading volume surged by 75.43% to hit $15.24 million. With a volume-to-market cap ratio of 28.36%, it’s clear the crowd is showing up—and not just for memes. This isn’t a sleeping kitty. This is a prowler. Sure, it’s down 88.41% from its ATH in December 2024, but don’t let the dip scare you off. It’s already rebounded +26.99% from its recent low just two weeks back. Traders are watching, bots are sniffing, and the CAT army is meowing back to life. What makes Simon’s Cat one of the top crypto to buy today? It’s that hybrid appeal—nostalgic IP from the viral Simon’s Cat brand mixed with the meme coin mechanics we all know and love. Plus, it’s on both Solana and BNB Chain, so you’ve got solid infrastructure under the hood. That combo? Kind of a big deal. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the charge as the Top Crypto to Buy Today. With its myth-themed presale journey, deflationary tokenomics, and a jaw-dropping 66% APY staking reward, this project stands out from the crowded meme coin space. Investors are jumping into a narrative-driven adventure that’s still unfolding, with the current presale price sitting at just $0.000083. If it reaches its projected listing price of $0.008, that’s a massive ROI window waiting to be claimed. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement with real potential, making it a standout choice for anyone looking to ride the next big crypto wave. Pair that with the cat-fueled chaos of Toshi, whose community refuses to let go, and the IP-backed, emotionally resonant rise of Simon’s Cat, and you’ve got a killer mix of narrative, utility, and momentum.

The asset is currently at a key juncture, with short-term and long-term indicators suggesting potential movement in either direction. Traders are closely monitoring key levels to determine ADA’s next momentum shift. Daily Chart Overview On the daily timeframe, ADA faces strong resistance at the $0.73–$0.75 range, aligning with the 200-day EMA. A breakout above this level could indicate a bullish reversal, potentially driving the price toward $0.80 or higher. On the downside, major support lies between $0.68 and $0.70, coinciding with the 200-day SMA. A failure to hold this support could result in a drop toward $0.60. 4-Hour Chart Analysis The 4-hour chart shows ADA consolidating between $0.70 and $0.73, with low trading volume. A decisive breakout above $0.73 could propel the price toward $0.78–$0.80, while a breakdown below $0.70 may trigger a retest of the $0.68 support zone. Short-Term Movements 1-Hour Chart: ADA is trading below the 20, 50, and 200-period EMAs, suggesting bearish momentum. However, the RSI is approaching oversold territory, indicating a potential short-term rebound. 15-Minute Chart: ADA is attempting to stabilize around $0.68. The Money Flow Index (MFI) reading of 35 suggests near-oversold conditions, possibly leading to a brief upward correction. Next Momentum Move Bullish Scenario: A breakout above $0.73 with strong volume could push ADA toward $0.80–$0.82. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bearish Scenario: A failure to hold $0.70 support may lead to a decline toward $0.68, with further downside risk to $0.60 if selling pressure intensifies. ADA’s price action is poised for a decisive move as the month ends. A breakout above $0.73 could signal bullish momentum, while failure to maintain key support may lead to further downside.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-textbook-resistance-turning-support-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst JD (@jaydee_757) has shared a technical analysis update on XRP, highlighting a critical resistance level turning into support. Using historical price movements and technical indicators, JD outlined key levels that could determine XRP’s next major move . His post included a detailed chart marking crucial price levels, trendlines, and past market cycle behaviors. #XRP – Textbook resistance turning Support! Posting 5 diff charts on Patreon/Discord next week for better confluence, but 100 Retweets, I'll post $XRP /USD on X next week! I called 0.28 bottom, $3.37 Local TOP, 50% crash at $1.90, IM CALLING MARKET CYCLE TOP NEXT USING ONLY TA!… pic.twitter.com/MiPiSHzgCU — JD (@jaydee_757) March 27, 2025 Key Resistance Turning to Support JD emphasized that a major resistance level, previously acting as a ceiling for price movements, has now become support. This level is around $1.99, and JD believes a monthly close above it would indicate further bullish momentum in April. He also pointed out that he previously called key market movements, including the bottom at $0.28, a local top at $3.37, and a 50% crash at $1.90. Based on his analysis, he is now prepared to call the next market cycle top using only technical analysis. Market Direction Based on Key Levels JD explained that if XRP closes above the $1.99 level, he expects a price target to be reached in April. However, he noted that a monthly close below this level would suggest a higher probability of retesting his dollar-cost averaging (DCA) level, which remains unfilled. This level aligns with the top of the symmetrical triangle pattern he has been tracking. He mentioned that his DCA strategy is available on his Patreon and Discord channels. For shorter timeframes, JD identified $1.80 as a crucial support level on the daily chart. If XRP closes below this level, the descending channel pattern could be negated. He reassured followers that he would provide further updates after the weekend’s market close. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Sentiment and Market Psychology JD commented on market behavior, emphasizing that only a small percentage of investors—what he refers to as the “5% (smart money)”—will capitalize on the upcoming move. He suggested that most traders will suffer losses due to emotional decision-making, backing his perspective that the market operates in cycles where inexperienced traders often face losses while more strategic investors capitalize on price movements. A user named DeGenarant asked JD about potential targets if a crash were to occur before a breakout. JD responded by reiterating that as long as XRP does not close below $1.99 on the monthly chart, his targets remain unchanged. He emphasized that price action below $1.80 on the daily chart would be a key factor to monitor. JD’s focus remains on whether XRP can maintain strength above the $1.99 level. If it does, he expects further upward momentum in April. If not, he sees a potential decline to his DCA target before another major move occurs. He assured his followers that he would provide more insights based on upcoming price action, particularly after the next market close.

Aave’s Horizon Plan Under Fire & Mantra Eyes $10,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-ambassador-program-expands-rapidly-presale-reaches-208-5m-aaves-horizon-plan-under-fire-mantra-eyes-10/,"The Mantra (OM) price is entering a pivotal stage, showing stability following a previous drop. With chart indicators hinting at an upcoming breakout, OM appears poised for a potential climb toward the $10 level. Meanwhile, the Aave Horizon proposal is generating interest by aiming to connect real-world assets to decentralized finance. Though this could improve adoption, discussions about new token creation and revenue allocation have stirred conversation within the community. In the crypto presale space, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making a significant mark with its shift in blockchain development. Its active Ambassador Program is accelerating international expansion by broadening its network influence. With $208.5 million already secured, BlockDAG is catching major attention. As its adoption rate increases rapidly, the presale could soon approach $600 million, potentially driving the price up substantially. Mantra (OM) Price Maintains Momentum Amid Bullish Signals Mantra (OM) has recently shown strong support, stabilizing after a previous downturn. At present, OM is trading at $6.82 after rebounding from a monthly low of $5.86. Despite market swings, the price remains above key moving averages, pointing to positive momentum. A bullish chart formation, known as a falling wedge, is taking shape—a pattern often tied to potential price increases. Should OM break past resistance, it may climb toward $9.12, its recent high, and possibly test the $10 zone. For this to happen, OM needs to keep holding its current support levels. Aave Horizon Proposal Divides Community on Institutional DeFi Aave Labs recently unveiled Horizon, a proposal that aims to bring real-world assets (RWAs) into the decentralized finance space. It would allow institutions to use tokenized money market funds (MMFs) as collateral to borrow stablecoins like USDC and GHO, unlocking significant liquidity. While Aave presents this as a step toward merging regulated finance with DeFi, the Horizon proposal has raised concerns. Critics question the fairness of profit distribution and the introduction of new tokens. Still, Aave Labs points to data showing a 408% yearly growth in tokenized U.S. Treasuries as proof of future potential. If the plan passes, Horizon will launch under Aave V3, with goals to move into Aave V4 for enhanced scaling. BlockDAG’s Ambassador Program Pushes Presale Toward $600M Milestone BlockDAG’s Ambassador Program is designed to expand its outreach by involving community members in sharing its goals, bringing in new users, and supporting global knowledge-building around the project. Central to the program is education. Participants benefit from access to exclusive learning sessions and one-on-one engagement with the BlockDAG team. This ensures ambassadors develop a solid understanding of blockchain systems, enabling them to spread insights across their communities with confidence. To keep members motivated, the program includes reward-based incentives like BDAG coin distributions and limited-edition merchandise. These offerings build a strong community atmosphere. Ambassadors who actively promote BlockDAG’s growth may also rise to leadership roles within the network, enhancing their visibility and impact. Having already raised $208.5 million and sold 18.9 billion coins, BlockDAG is making rapid progress toward its $600 million target. With batch 27 pricing BDAG at $0.0248, the coin has jumped 2,380% since its opening rate of $0.001. The Ambassador Program is playing a major role in driving this surge by expanding awareness and drawing new support. As more people join, both demand and pricing pressures are expected to rise significantly. This consistent upward trend is why many now view BlockDAG as the best crypto platform available, raising its profile in the global blockchain space and setting higher benchmarks for decentralized growth. In a Nutshell! The Mantra price has shown bullish potential, with signs pointing toward a climb near the $10 range. However, long-term stability could depend on broader market shifts. At the same time, the Aave Horizon proposal aims to connect real-world finance with DeFi, but questions around profit and token issuance continue to spark mixed reactions. Turning to BlockDAG, currently in batch 27 of its presale, its recent efforts in blockchain expansion through the Ambassador Program are making an impact. With $208.5 million already raised, it’s edging closer to the $600 million goal, which could trigger sharp price increases. As usage grows, BlockDAG is proving to be the best crypto platform , with early supporters potentially seeing major returns in the near future.

Even so, optimism over a trend reversal has the likes of Solana finding their footing. At the same time, internal shortcomings are further weighing on Ethereum price. Amid this chaos, PepeX stands out as one of the attractive meme projects of 2025. Its mission is to restore fairness and transparency to the meme coin space while eliminating gatekeeping. In just one week, it has raised over $1 million and is set for further gains during and post its 90-day presale. Ethereum price plunges as its ecosystem’s shortcomings fuel underwhelming performance Ethereum price extended its previous losses on Saturday’s session to trade at its lowest level since 11th March. As seen on CoinMarketCap, the altcoin’s price has been down by 7.89% over the past 7 days compared to Bitcoin and Solana’s decline of 1.38% and 3.19% respectively. Notably, economic uncertainties continue to weigh on the crypto market. While the market sentiment had improved to a neutral level earlier in the week, the crypto fear & greed index dropped to a fear level of 26 on Saturday before improving slightly to 32. However, beyond these external factors, some analysts blame shortcomings in its ecosystem for the underwhelming performance. In the absence of a major bullish catalyst, Ethereum price will likely remain under pressure in the near term. As seen on its daily price chart, the altcoin will likely remain range-bound in the ensuing sessions as the bulls defend the support zone along the lower Bollinger band. On the upside, it may face resistance along the middle band at around $1,950. However, further decline will invalidate this thesis; pushing Ethereum price to the October 2023’s low retested on 11th March at $1,750. Ethereum price chart | Source: TradingView PepeX: The project bringing back sanity to the meme crypto space Some meme coins like the TRUMP token still propel the culture of a project starting from an internet trend and its virality fueling its growth. However, the subsector is steadily moving away from this concept to become major financial assets operating on real-world use cases. PepeX is one of the fresh crypto projects under the latter category. On its website, PepeX describes itself as being “like pump.fun but fair, easy and open to all”. This is meant to solve the existing challenges related to insider manipulation andthe gatekeeping of token creation. As the world’s first AI-driven meme launchpad, it allows anyone to launch a meme coin in just five minutes. This also includes the branding and marketing of meme tokens; features that allow retail investors to enjoy opportunities that have previously been unattainable to them. Besides, PepeX will ensure that token creators’ holdings are capped at 5% of the total supply, which they can lose to the community should the project fail. This policy, coupled with anti-sniping protections and transparent bubble maps, positions PepeX as the “system rectifier” and investors are taking note of it. Subsequently, it has already raised over $1 million in one week with stage 1 already sold out. In addition to its growth potential in the crypto market, early adopters get to enjoy gains of upto 311% during its presale. What started at a token price of $0.02 is currently at $0.021 as it increases by 5% with every stage. By the end of its presale slated for 22nd June, it will be at $0.0823. Hurry up and buy the PepeX token here . Solana price finds footing as bulls remain optimistic of a trend reversal Solana price chart | Source: TradingView Macroeconomic factors continue to weigh on the cryptocurrency market with Solana price dropping to a two-week low on Saturday’s session. However, it will likely remain above the steady support zone of $118.50 as the bulls remain optimistic of improved risk sentiment and subsequent trend reversal. The entry of more buyers may have Solana price break the resistance along the middle Bollinger band at $130.80. If successful, it would attract even more traders with the next target being at $139.

Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to surge toward $3.5; however, it faces repeated rejections. As a result, the price has been dropping. Will TIA price recover? If buyers maintain the current momentum and push the price toward the resistance of $3.5, we might see a strong recovery. Will TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Celestia has unveiled Shwap, a Data Availability (DA) upgrade that enhances its DA network. The upgrade introduces a new storage system and messaging protocol, boosting data retrieval efficiency and reducing storage demands. Celestia price prediction March 2025 Celestia’s price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $100K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $2.4 and a maximum of $4.5, with an average of $3.1. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction March 2025 $2.4 $3.1 $4.5 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $17.84, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Crypto-backed mortgages are a kind of loan where borrowers use their cryptocurrency holdings, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Ether ( ETH ), as collateral to secure financing for real estate purchases. This approach allows you to access funds without selling your digital assets. By retaining crypto ownership, borrowers can still benefit from future price increases. There are various types of crypto-backed mortgages: purchase mortgages, cash-out refinancing and bridge loans. Purchase mortgages: These help you finance real estate using crypto as collateral. Cash-out refinancing: It allows you to refinance your existing mortgages by leveraging your crypto assets to access additional funds. Bridge loans: These loans provide short-term financing, helping you cover the period between purchasing a new property and selling an existing one. Crypto mortgages are particularly appealing if you want to preserve your holdings while securing real-world assets . However, you need to consider the volatility of cryptocurrencies and carefully assess the risks before opting for a crypto-backed mortgage. Lenders usually accept stablecoins such as Tether ( USDt ) and USDC (USDC) or major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Some lenders may accept a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies as collateral, which is known as cross-collateralization. Did you know? With traditional mortgages becoming increasingly difficult to obtain, particularly for younger individuals, alternative solutions are gaining traction. Fintech startups are addressing this demand by offering adjustable or fixed-rate mortgages secured by substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Crypto-based mortgages vs traditional mortgages Crypto-backed and traditional mortgages differ from eligibility requirements to risk factors. Traditional mortgages rely on credit history, income verification and down payments, while crypto-backed mortgages use digital assets as collateral. The approval process for crypto mortgages is often faster, but they come with higher interest rates and volatility risks. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties make crypto-backed loans less widely accepted in real estate markets. A comparison of the two mortgage types is given below: How do crypto-backed mortgages work? The basic mechanism of crypto-backed mortgages is that depositors calculate the value of the crypto the borrower proposes to collateralize and release a loan against the amount . To assess the value of the crypto assets, the lenders may apply a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which indicates the percentage of the collateral value you can borrow. For example, if the LTV ratio is 50%, you can secure a loan of $25,000 for collateralized crypto assets worth $50,000. Overcollateralization helps to create a buffer, which helps the lender if the value of the collateral goes down. Smart contracts are used to automate the execution of loan terms. Here is a step-by-step look at the functioning of crypto-backed mortgages: Step 1: Find a lender – Look for a financial institution or decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that offers crypto-backed mortgages. Compare different lenders based on their interest rates, fees and supported cryptocurrencies. Step 2: Apply and submit proof of ownership – Submit an application for getting a loan against the crypto you hold. You also need to provide proof of ownership of your digital assets. The lender will assess the worth of your crypto holdings to determine your borrowing limit. Some lenders may consider other financial factors, such as credit history. Step 3: Move crypto to escrow account – Once approved, you need to pledge the required amount of crypto by transferring it into an escrow account. This crypto acts as security for the mortgage loan. Step 4: Prep the loan – Complete the loan agreement, which outlines key terms like repayment schedules, interest rates and what happens if your collateral’s value drops. Usually, if the value of the crypto drops, you will need to deposit more crypto in the escrow account so that the loan remains overcollateralized. If you fail to deposit additional crypto, the lender may liquidate your crypto deposits. Step 5: Disbursal of loan – The loan funds are typically disbursed in fiat currency for purchasing the property. Step 6: Make mortgage payments – Repay the loan according to the agreed terms. The interest rate may differ in line with the market value of the collateralized crypto. Step 7: Recover your collateral – If you complete all payments as per the loan agreement, you will get back your cryptocurrency from escrow. If you fail to repay it, the lender may liquidate your collateral to cover the outstanding amount. Did you know? Freddie Mac data shows that when fixed-rate mortgages were introduced in 1971, interest rates were about 7.5%. However, by 1980, they had dramatically increased to almost 20%. Benefits of crypto-backed mortgages Thanks to crypto-backed mortgages, you can access funds to invest in real estate without selling digital assets. You can leverage your crypto assets to take advantage of real estate market growth. Here are some key benefits of using a crypto-backed mortgage: Faster and simpler process: Compared to traditional mortgages, crypto-backed loans generally have a quicker and more streamlined approval process. Lenders use smart contracts to execute loan terms, making the whole process efficient and without prejudice. Liquidity without selling: You can access funds to invest in real estate without liquidating your crypto holdings. This is particularly beneficial during a real estate market upswing as you can retain your crypto assets while securing finances for real estate investment. Investment growth potential: Crypto-backed mortgages enable you to enjoy double growth. You benefit from appreciation in the prices of the real estate and the growth of your crypto assets. Broader accessibility: Crypto-backed mortgages provide financing opportunities for anyone who lacks traditional credit histories. If you have just settled in a country and don’t have financial records there, crypto-backed loans become a viable option. Tax benefits: Since no assets are sold, you can avoid immediate capital gains tax. This allows you to access value without triggering taxable events. Challenges in crypto-backed mortgages While crypto-backed mortgages offer some unique advantages, they also come with several challenges you must consider. From price volatility to regulatory uncertainties, these factors can impact the feasibility and cost of securing a mortgage with cryptocurrency. Here are some key challenges in crypto mortgaging: Higher costs: Compared to conventional mortgages, crypto-backed loans often have steeper interest rates. Since lenders consider these loans riskier, they set higher costs to protect themselves from potential losses. Price volatility: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, meaning their value can fluctuate significantly. If the value of the pledged crypto collateral drops, you may need to add more assets or partially repay the loan to prevent liquidation. Limited market adoption: Many sellers may not be willing to deal with a prospective buyer who has arranged their loan using cryptocurrencies. This might limit your property purchase options. Regulatory uncertainty: The legal framework for crypto-backed mortgages is still evolving. Shifting regulations could impact the availability, terms or tax treatment of these loans, creating uncertainty for borrowers. Did you know? With $12.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt spread across 84 million loans, the average American mortgage holder owes $144,593. These home loans represent a massive 70.2% of all consumer debt in the US, highlighting their crucial importance to the nation’s financial health. How to decide on a crypto-backed mortgage? Before deciding on your cryptocurrency-backed mortgage, you need to make a thorough assessment of your financial status and risk tolerance. Begin by analyzing your cryptocurrency portfolio. Determine how much of your holdings you could pledge and consider how these assets may perform in the future. Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, collateralizing a single asset may be risky. Diversifying your collateral across various cryptocurrencies may help avoid potential losses if prices fluctuate. You also need to carefully analyze the loan terms. Understanding the interest rates, payback plan and any other expenses related to the mortgage is essential. Consider the risks, such as asset liquidation if their value falls dramatically or if you fail to meet repayment terms. As crypto-backed mortgages are a relatively new financial instrument, seeking professional guidance may help if you feel unsure about it. Consulting with financial and real estate experts specializing in crypto lending can assist you in navigating the process, structuring your loan and aligning your mortgage decision with your long-term investment and financial objectives.",Crypto-backed mortgages,EN,0,0,ICO|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-30 08:35:00

Many altcoins have produced notable losses over the past week, led by XRP and ETH from the larger caps. BTC Struggles at $83K Last weekend went in a dull fashion as BTC’s price was stuck at $84,000. However, it started to gain traction on Sunday evening and pumped to $88,800, which became its highest price tag in over two weeks. As the community was preparing for a charge at $90,000, though, the landscape changed and bitcoin started to lose its momentum. After a few days of sideways action around $86,000 and $88,000, the cryptocurrency slumped below the lower boundary on Friday and dropped to $83,400. It managed to sustain that level for a bit, but the bears increased the pressure over the past 24 hours. The result came yesterday evening when BTC dropped to a 12-day low of $81,600 (on Bitstamp). It managed to react well to this Saturday crash and has recovered over a grand, but it’s still in the red on a daily and weekly scale. Its market capitalization has declined to under $1.630 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 59%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out Weekly Although most alts are quite sluggish on a daily scale, the weekly chart is quite painful. ETH, which was close to $2,100 at one point, is down by over 8% since last Sunday and is well below $1,850 now. XRP has dropped by 9% despite the lawsuit closure against the US SEC. BNB, SOL, ADA, TRX, LINK, XLM, HBAR, DOT, and LTC have declined by somewhere between 3-7%, while UNI has plunged by more than 11%. The biggest losers, though, are PI and HYPE, as both are down by over 20% in a week. SUI and TON are among the few exceptions with gains over the past week. TON has risen by nearly 4%, while SUI is up by almost 7%. The total crypto market cap has slipped below $2.8 trillion, which means that it has lost $200 billion since the peak on Monday.

In an interview , Puckrin explained that while a full-fledged recession is not yet the most likely outcome, the odds have increased considerably due to growing macroeconomic instability. He pointed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies, including tariffs on trading partners and budget cuts, as potential recession triggers. “Trump and his advisors have not completely dismissed the possibility of a recession, which makes it a credible risk,” Puckrin noted. However, he clarified that while Trump is not actively pushing for a recession, the administration’s economic strategies could unintentionally lead to one. The growing macro uncertainty has already started to shake markets, with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) slipping as investors seek safer opportunities in European capital markets. According to Puckrin, this flight from the U.S. dollar is contributing to the recent weakness in risk-on assets, including crypto. Tariffs and Macroeconomic Uncertainty The recent trade tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have sent shockwaves through the crypto market, driving down prices across the board. Bitcoin (BTC), which had surged past $109,000 in January 2025, saw a sharp 24% correction following the tariff announcement. Altcoins have fared even worse, with the broader market sentiment shifting from euphoria after Trump’s November 2025 re-election to extreme fear as trade war concerns mount. According to Nansen research analyst Nicolai Sondergaard, crypto markets are likely to remain under pressure from tariffs until at least April 2025. Sondergaard believes that only a diplomatic breakthrough or a softening of the Trump administration’s stance could reverse the downward trend. Crypto Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Policy Shifts Despite the bleak outlook, some analysts see glimmers of hope. 10x Research founder Markus Thielen recently suggested that Bitcoin may have found a price bottom in March 2025, pointing to a slight softening in Trump’s trade rhetoric. Thielen believes this policy shift could signal a potential BTC price reversal, offering a ray of optimism for crypto investors. While the market remains fragile, any sign of de-escalation in the trade war or a shift in monetary policy could reignite risk appetite.

Shiba Inu’s growing price and Cheems’ Binance listing are exciting, but both rely heavily on speculation. Dragoin offers a different kind of opportunity. With its entry price of just $0.0000292, it gives new and small investors a realistic chance to get into crypto without big risks. What makes Dragoin even more appealing is its step-by-step presale plan, strong community involvement, and built-in interactive features. These qualities make Dragoin a smart option for anyone who wants more than just a quick trend in the meme coin market. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surge Drives $0.001 Speculation Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently gained momentum due to a sharp rise in its burn rate. A major event came when an anonymous wallet burned 1 billion SHIB tokens—worth around $13,050. This move, along with growing activity on the Shibarium layer 2 network, which just reached a two-month TVL high, has sparked fresh discussions about token supply. Adding to this, SHIB’s reserves on crypto exchanges have dropped to a four-year low. Only 100.42 trillion tokens remain on exchanges, creating more talk around a possible supply squeeze. These factors have led some market watchers to believe SHIB could eventually hit the $0.001 mark—giving it a market cap of $589 billion. But this goal depends heavily on continued token burns, the success of Shibarium, and broader market conditions. Cheems Gains Momentum After Binance Listing Cheems (CHEEMS), a meme token based on Solana, has seen a notable 52.4% price jump in the past week, taking its market cap to $210 million. This boost came after its recent listing on Binance, which increased visibility and improved trading volume. Cheems is now priced at $0.00015094, just slightly down 0.00132% from its last close, though still far below its all-time high of $0.0092—suggesting there may be more room to grow. Still, Cheems remains a speculative investment with a history of wild price swings. This reflects the broader uncertainty that often surrounds meme coins. Some analysts expect Cheems to hit $0.000002219 by December 2025 if market momentum continues. As always, it’s important for investors to weigh the risks of meme coins carefully, especially when price action is driven by hype rather than solid fundamentals. Dragoin’s $0.0000292 Presale Offers an Easy Way to Enter Crypto Dragoin stands out by offering an affordable way for new crypto users and small investors to get started. At a presale price of just $0.0000292, it gives people a low-cost entry into the crypto world—perfect for those looking to explore without heavy upfront spending.

With a total supply of 200 billion tokens and a 25-stage pricing model, Dragoin offers early backers the potential to see strong returns as prices rise through each stage.

For anyone looking to start small but still benefit from long-term gains, Dragoin offers a rare mix of low entry cost and strong future potential. Stage 1 of the Dragoin presale is already live at $0.0000292. When it officially launches at $0.002, early buyers could see returns above 6,700%—a huge leap for those who move early. Why Dragoin’s Low-Cost Presale Has Long-Term Appeal Shiba Inu and Cheems may win attention with price spikes and exchange buzz, but Dragoin offers something more solid. Its clear pricing model, strong focus on community, and easy access for new investors help build lasting value. With a simple starting price and real ways to stay involved, Dragoin presents a better choice for those who want steady growth instead of fast hype.

These struggles suggest the existence of deeper-lying issues with the second-most valuable crypto ecosystem. Reasoning Behind The ‘Falling Expectations’ For ETH Price American media giant Bloomberg is among the latest to weigh in on the struggles of the Ethereum ecosystem over the past year. In a March 29 report , Bloomberg assessed the performance of the ETH ecosystem, primarily comparing it with the premier cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The Ethereum blockchain launched almost 10 years ago in July 2015, catching attention as a rival to Bitcoin for top spot in the cryptocurrency industry. Bloomberg said in its report that the ecosystem seems to be struggling to deliver on this early promise as it enters a new decade. The global crypto landscape appears to be improving, especially following the election of Donald Trump as United States president. Trump has been vocal about his pro-crypto stance. Thanks to what Bloomberg dubbed the “Trumpian Embrace,” crypto projects seem to be set for a transformed industry with clearer and less stringent regulations . However, the American media company does not believe this “Trumpian Embrace” is enough to turn around the fortunes of Ethereum, which seems to be battling some functional issues. One of such problems is the continuous exodus of developers from the blockchain platform. Data from Electric Capital shows that the number of active developers working on Ethereum-related software dropped by approximately in 2024. In contrast, the Solana network saw the influx of new developers in the past year, with an 83% year-over-year growth. Bloomberg also highlighted some of the concerns with how the Ethereum Foundation (EF) is being run without enough regard for the price of ETH. For instance, the EF moved traffic to the layer-2 networks in a bid to make transactions cheaper on the blockchain. Standard Chartered highlighted these upgrades, unfortunately, diverted activity and fees away from the underlying Ethereum network, which somewhat explains the bearish expectations for the ETH price. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits just above the $1,800 level, reflecting an over 3% slump in the past 24 hours.

While most investors still favor stocks ahead of digital assets, this feat is commendable and shows the attention that digital assets are now getting, even from some of the most ardent stock investors. According to reports, a total of 16.29 million individuals had accounts at the top five domestic virtual assets exchanges. In the data submitted to Rep. Cha Gyu-geun of the minor opposition Rebuilding Korea Party, most of these users are on exchanges like Bithumb, Upbit , Gopax, Coinone, and Korbit. According to the reports, the figure was adjusted for users on multiple platforms, counting them just once. According to the report, the total number of crypto holders in the country now accounts for about 32% of its population. The number of crypto investors exceeded the 14 billion mark for the first time in March 2024, before the sector welcomed over 500,000 people with the election of United States President Donald Trump. The development pushed the total number of crypto investors in the country above the 15 million mark. South Korean investor statistics unveiled According to reports, about 15 million South Korean crypto investors on the top exchanges were also categorized by age and gender. The male investors in their 30s and 40s accounted for about 40% of the crypto investors in the country. However, female investors in the 50s also accounted for a huge share of the high-net-worth investors in the crypto sector. The report revealed that 9.2 million South Korean investors were registered on Upbit, while Coinone had 3.2 million investors. Bithump at 2.36 million, Korbit at 770,000, and Gopax at 150,000 represented the remaining figures. Bithumb registered a rise in the number of accounts, seeing a jump to 2.36 million as of March 18, with the rise representing a 77.4% increase in one year following an aggressive marketing push by the company. In the categorization by age, South Korean investors in their 30s accounted for 4.51 million, closely followed by investors in their 40s at 3.97 million. Investors in their 20s or younger at 2.92 million, investors in their 50s at 2.64 million, and investors in their 60s at 1.12 million made up the remaining numbers. A spread of the gender showed males in their 30s and 40s at 3.1 million and 2.67 million, respectively, accounting for about 38.1% of the total investor population. National Assembly officials’ crypto holdings surge 48% YoY According to reports, investors holding less than 1 million won ($680) in crypto are about 12.1 million or 83.1%, while 1.57 million investors held between one million and 10 million won. Investors with assets between 10 million won and 100 million won were about 830,000, while about 160,000 investors held assets over 100 million won. According to the data, 36,000 male investors in their 40s hold digital assets of over 100 million, while 35,000 males in their 50s hold the same. Meanwhile, the crypto holdings in the South Korean National Assembly registered an uptick, tripling in the last year. According to the 2025 property change report released by the National Assembly’s Public Officials Ethics Committee, about 335 senior officials, including members of the South Korean National Assembly and those affiliated with the secretariat, were put at 1.2 billion Korean won. This figure represents a three-fold increase from the 401.63 million that was reported in the same period last year. The number of reported digital asset holdings also rose by 48.4% year-on-year to 46 cases. The reported targets were not only themselves but their spouses and direct descendants. The individual with the highest crypto holdings was Kim In-young, a policy research committee member of the National Assembly, who reported about 530 million won in digital assets. The report mentioned that Kim diversified his assets, spreading them across nine major cryptos, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana . Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Tom Lee says that based on historical patterns, the stock market could mount a recovery in early April. “The spike in the VIX (volatility index) or the collapse in investor sentiment or consumer confidence, that all happened around February 2018, so really that coincided with the first low that was made in 2018, and the market began to stage its recovery… But as we start to think about the second half of this year, first of all, we’ve already had the collapse in sentiment. We’ve seen $850 billion of cash raised over the past year in money market balances, and then in the second half, we were looking for tax reform, which really propelled stocks in 2017.” According to Lee, much of the panic in the stock market has already taken place this year, leading him to believe that stocks should start regaining their bullish momentum this week. “So I think that the odds of a V-shaped recovery in stocks that come after April 2nd is just extremely high, because we’ve already sequenced a lot of the panic that people saw in 2018. I think it’s already taking place.” A V-shaped rally is a technical pattern indicating an abrupt bullish reversal and a sharp surge in the market. Earlier this month, both the stock and crypto markets took a hard hit after President Donald Trump announced tariffs and refused to rule out an upcoming economic recession.

In a recent report, Athanasios Vamvakidis and Claudio Piron noted that targeted tariffs on specific products were already expected by the market, but broader trade restrictions would be a “negative surprise.” They warn that new tariffs could lead to more uncertainty, especially given concerns about a possible economic slowdown in the United States. “We believe the risks are balanced ahead of next week’s deadline. The market already expects tariffs on certain products. Comprehensive tariffs would be a negative surprise. The dollar is not expected to continue to strengthen when comprehensive tariffs are implemented, and the market is still concerned about the slowdown in the US economy,” they said. They also noted that logistics issues could delay the implementation of new tariffs and leave room for potential negotiations. Related News: Giant Altcoin Whale Couldn't Withstand the Fall: Sold Its Altcoins at a Huge Loss Trump’s tariff strategy has sparked widespread concern among economic and business groups, particularly in Japan. On March 26, Trump signed a memorandum at the White House imposing a 25% tariff on imported cars, set to take effect on April 2. The move has drawn criticism from international trade experts and automakers who fear significant disruptions to global supply chains. Such protectionist policies are unlikely to produce economic benefits and could instead pose risks to the broader global economy, warned Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. “The US tariff policy has no positive impact and will bring risks to the global economy,” Kumano said. *This is not investment advice.

Having launched their mainnet not that long ago, the team defied some of the negative expectations and their token is currently solidly in the top 100 coins by means of total market capitalization. Yet, many remain skeptical. In the following, we examine some of the most recent developments, updates, news, and commentary by influential industry participants regarding Pi Network. Pi Network News: Pushing Back Against Controversy Back in February, before the mainnet of Pi Network went live, the CEO of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges – Bybit – Ben Zhou, said in an X post that the project is a scam, citing police reports from 2023 issued by Chinese police authorities describing it as such. He further explained that the exchange wouldn’t list its native token – the Pi coin. Now, according to a recent report by The Defiant, a spokesperson from Pi Network disclaimed these allegations and said that it lacks any of the hallmarks of a multi-level marketing (a.k.a pyrmaid) scheme. Apparently, rather than having multiple levels in its referral program, Pi Network only has one: “If Person A refers Person B, and Person B then refers Person C, Person A and Person C have no relationship and do not receive any mining bonus as a result of them being referred in,” the spokesperson said. Pi Coin Price Tanks 22% Weekly Pi coin’s price has decreased by a considerabl 22.5% for the past two weeks and is currently trading below $0.8%, charting a further 6% decline in the last 24 hours. There seems to be no isolated project-related reason for this as the cryptocurrency follows the trajectory of the broader market, which is mostly covered in red as well. It’s worth noting that it is the wors-performing coin in the top 100, followed by Hyperliquid and Kaspa. Pi Network Updates to Migration and Account Verification In the past, Pi accounts relied predominantly on phone numbers for their unique identification system. According to the team, this has been both expensive and unreliable. Having that in mind, the team is migrating to a new account verification system that will rely on email-based two-factor identification. There are additional details that the users need to go through such as establishing a trusted email.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi disruptor aiming for an audacious $2.5 target. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), trading at just $0.025, is gaining momentum as a high-upside contender. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at just $0.025, is gaining momentum as analysts predict a run to $2.5. MUTM is positioning itself as top performer and could be one of the best bets of 2025 with a $5.7 million funding boost and increasing investor interest hence over 7400 investors have joined. While ADA has long been a heavyweight in the blockchain market, Mutuum’s innovative approach is turning heads, sparking speculation that it could be the next big altcoin breakout. Mutuum Finance: A Rising Performer in DeFi Lending The lending framework of Mutuum Finance has implemented two independent financial models to unlock better accessibility and encourage large-scale societal adoption in decentralized lending systems. More than 7400 investors have backed the platform which obtained $5.7 million through presale funding. The price stands at $0.025 during Phase 4 and investors expect a 20% boost in Phase 5 which suggests promising profit opportunities in the future. Experts expect MUTM to surpass $2.5 after its $0.06 launch because its modern lending approach will satisfy the growing market need for DeFi solutions over the following months. Mutuum Finance differentiates its operations by uniting Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in its approach. Through the P2C system users can generate passive revenue by providing USDT as a loan through automatic liquidity pools based on smart contract technology. Through the P2P model users retain independence in asset transactions because they perform lending deals without intermediaries. Mutuum Finance offers P2C together with P2P features to establish a strong security foundation while simultaneously improving efficiency standards and bringing increased profitability for DeFi yield investors. A Secure and Transparent Financial Ecosystem Mutuum Finance creates a new stablecoin system which provides full USD backing through Ethereum blockchain infrastructure. Users gain stability from the asset’s over-collateralization features since it eliminates the risks that algorithmic stablecoins suffer from insolvency events. Security takes priority at this platform because it conducts an extensive smart contract audit process to establish complete transparency and build trustworthiness. Mutuum Finance achieves financial reliability excellence by resolving crucial weaknesses previously found in Defi projects. Driving Community Engagement with Investor Rewards To accelerate growth, Mutuum Finance has introduced aggressive incentive programs. A $1 million giveaway will reward ten investors with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, while the referral system incentivizes users who bring in new participants. Early adopters gain exclusive benefits, including access to staking pools, governance rights, and VIP updates, strengthening their engagement and influence within the ecosystem. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance sets its tokenomics strategy to manage circulation limits and elevate token worth. The limited presale supply created alongside anti-inflationary practices ensures restricted availability that could potentially drive price appreciation. The platform maintains sustainability through staking mechanisms which also drive token participation toward growth and long-term expansion. The crypto market will likely see substantial growth from Mutuum Finance because of its innovative lending system and strong security measures along with incentives developed by investors. Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as a serious contender in the DeFi space, leveraging its $5.7 million funding and 7,400+ investors to challenge established giants like ADA. With a unique dual-lending model, robust security measures, and a transparent financial ecosystem, MUTM is poised for significant growth. As the presale price stands at $0.025, with an imminent increase to $0.03, early investors have a golden opportunity to capitalize before the projected surge to $2.5. Don’t miss out on this high-potential altcoin.

People might wonder why trust in crypto’s decentralized nature remains a challenge after so many years. While its unpredictable system may attract some risk-tolerant investors, it raises a red flag for more conservative traders. In traditional banking, if an issue arises, the typical course of action is to call customer service. After a lengthy verification process, a representative eventually assists the customer. You might also like: Cross-chain interoperability is the key to scaling DeFAI | Opinion When it comes to crypto, the experience is quite different. Firstly, there are no ‘customer service’ representatives for DeFi and no central authority to help solve issues. If users have lost access to their digital wallet or forgotten their private key, they have no one to turn to for support, as their journey in crypto is entirely self-sufficient. As a result, wallets often remain dormant, as some users lack the technical skills and expertise to navigate the ecosystem. According to a Reuters article, an estimated 20 percent of Bitcoin ( BTC ) total supply is inactive or locked in lost wallets. Recognizing this gap, a new sector of DeFi has emerged called DeFAI, which integrates AI to enhance the user experience with a new type of customer success. While it might not be as personal as calling a bank, AI agents are beginning to fill this void. AI solutions offer valuable guidance for those new to crypto, helping users navigate the often confusing ecosystem. One of the main drivers behind AI’s integration into DeFi is the volatile nature of the crypto market. These fluctuations are typically driven by online speculation, with a single comment or tweet having the power to impact the value of specific tokens or assets. In this unpredictable environment, the need for accessible, AI-powered support has never been more crucial to helping users make data-driven decisions. In January, for example, a fake Barron Trump memecoin quickly amassed a market capitalization of $460 million, mainly due to its alleged association with the Trump family. However, the excitement was short-lived once people realized it had no legitimate connection. This resulted in the coin dropping 95 percent, wiping out millions from investors. However, DeFAI allows users to access more accurate data analysis and improved decision-making tools. AI helps mitigate the impact of market speculations, identifying trends that might not be immediately obvious and ultimately assisting investors in making more informed decisions. While this new sector is still in its early stages, the potential for AI agents to enhance DeFi’s performance is clear. The web3 investment firm DFG recently published a report highlighting the potential of this emerging area of DeFi. The report breaks down the DeFAI ecosystem, exploring the three primary categories: the abstraction layer, autonomous trading agents, and AI-powered dApps. Each category plays a role in this new era of DeFi by offering unique capabilities, ranging from streamlining complex transactions to optimizing trading strategies and improving liquidity management. One key takeaway from the report is that the effectiveness of AI is directly tied to the quality of the data it relies on. In the context of DeFAI, AI agents perform optimally with access to real-time, verifiable data. High-quality datasets allow agents to predict price movements more accurately, leading to better trade recommendations and more informed decisions. Throughout the report, DFG highlights four key data providers that use reliable data: Mode Synth, Chainbase, sqd.ai, and Cookie. While AI agents might not replicate a portfolio manager or financial advisor, they add a new level of support to DeFi that can provide another layer of security for newcomers. As this sector grows, access to quality data and transparent decision-making processes will be crucial for driving broader acceptance.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With XRP’s price at risk of falling below $1.50 in April, investors are shifting toward Remittix, a hyped crypto looking to offer near-instant fiat conversions. Table of Contents XRP’s key downtrend signals Remittix: Why it shines above the rest The road ahead Through the sale of 524 million+ tokens at $0.0734 per token, Remittix achieved a total of over $14.2 million funding, making it a rapidly growing crypto player. Many see its focus on near-instant fiat conversions as a major leap for digital finance. The potential downward movement of XRP prices below $1.50 in April has caused some investors to move their funds to Remittix. XRP’s key downtrend signals The price of XRP currently resides below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) though it’s above the 200-day EMA. The $1.85 support level has prevented XRP’s market value from reaching larger losses in previous events. However, a price break through this threshold could push it toward $1.50. The market will likely experience substantial price drops down to $1.25 when defense fails at $1.50. Analysts point out that increased trading volumes during prices moving downward could provide evidence of stronger bearish momentum. The XRP price has been weakened by the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s trade tariff policy, which continues to shake volatile markets. Analysts suggest that the resolved SEC case against Ripple has already been priced in, leaving XRP without a fresh catalyst for growth. As such, XRP could move below $1.50 in April as crypto investors will explore alternative cryptocurrencies.

Unlike complex systems from many market leaders, Remittix prioritizes user-friendly exchanges. This focus has attracted $14.2 million in investment, as backers recognize its potential to streamline crypto transactions. Remittix’s model is straightforward. The planned platform will enable users to convert their coins directly into regular money with quick processing and reduced costs. The quick access to digital asset liquidity represents a major benefit for users looking to obtain fast money from their cryptocurrencies. Users remember when they had to deal with the inconvenience of token-to-cash transfers, especially network congestion and the need to navigate through various platforms. Remittix aims to eliminate these obstacles, offering a direct and efficient solution. Designed for wide adoption Remittix’s success in raising over $14.2 million demonstrates that users are looking for convenient solutions. Experts suggest that cryptocurrencies which solve basic problems, such as instant fiat conversion, have the potential to draw wide adoption beyond the tight trader groups. Uncertain market conditions demand the ability to sell quickly and this function makes Remittix invaluable. Numerous investors chose Remittix as an alternative to tokens focused on complex or theoretical applications. The road ahead The XRP price forecast shows the potential to give up the $1.85 support level. The absence of significant market changes could lead the price to fall even further to below $1.50. Market conditions are leading potential investors toward projects with clear use cases, like Remittix’s instant trading solutions. The effective execution of Remittix promises will make it an indispensable token for those seeking real-life benefits. For more information on Remittix, visit the website or socials .

According to Nic Puckrin, the founder of Coin Bureau, while a recession isn’t certain, the economic environment could harm risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Puckrin remarked: “Trump and his advisors have said they have not completely dismissed the recession, which means it is definitely possible, but right now, I would not say it is probable, but the odds have climbed a lot.” Impact of Trump Administration’s Economic Policies Puckrin also explained that while Trump is not intentionally pushing for a recession, policies such as job cuts and budget balancing could trigger an economic slowdown. This uncertainty has contributed to a decline in the US Dollar Index (DXY), as investors look to European markets for better opportunities. Crypto Markets Struggle Amid Trade War The U.S. trade war, particularly with China, has already impacted cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin dropping significantly.

Table of Contents Demand for XYZ soars as its presale nears $15m milestone Dogecoin price forecast Shiba Inu price movements Conclusion XYZVerse (XYZ) is capturing attention with bold forecasts of its price surging from $0.003333 to $10. Analysts suggest it could overtake well-known coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). What is driving this potential surge and could XYZVerse become the next standout in the cryptocurrency world? Demand for XYZ soars as its presale nears $15m milestone The XYZVerse project, a blend of sports enthusiasm and cryptocurrency, has garnered considerable attention from investors. Setting itself apart, XYZVerse emphasizes long-term viability through a well-defined roadmap and an active, dedicated community. Its recent recognition among the best new meme projects has further enhanced its reputation and appeal. Since its inception, the XYZ token has demonstrated significant growth. Beginning at $0.0001, it has already surged to $0.003333, with the next target price set at $0.005. By the final presale stage, the token will reach a price of $0.02, paving the way for listings on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. Anticipated listings at a price point of $0.10 suggest the potential for returns of up to 1,000x for early investors, contingent upon achieving the projected market capitalization. Investor interest remains robust, with the project swiftly moving past the $10 million funding milestone and quickly approaching the $15 million benchmark. This momentum underscores strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Community engagement is highly valued and actively rewarded in the XYZVerse ecosystem Dedicated community members are recognized through XYZ token airdrops, ensuring those who actively contribute share in the project’s success. XYZVerse’s strategic approach, including robust tokenomics, planned CEX and DEX listings, and routine token burns, positions the XYZ token for sustained growth and long-term success. Every strategic move aims to bolster token value, rallying a committed community poised to achieve legendary status together.

Despite a 0.56% weekly gain, the memecoin has fallen by 8.71% over the past month. However, over the last six months, DOGE has surged by 50.31%, showing strong long-term growth. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $0.19. If it breaks through, it could target the second resistance at $0.20. On the downside, support is at $0.15, with a further support level at $0.13. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 27.88, indicating that DOGE is oversold. This may signal a potential price rebound. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) are at $0.19. This suggests that a move above these levels could trigger bullish momentum. The MACD Level is negative at -0.00303507345, and the Stochastic indicator is low at 5.90, both pointing toward oversold conditions. These technical factors suggest that DOGE may be poised for a price increase, potentially exceeding the resistance levels in the near term. Shiba Inu price movements Shiba Inu has seen mixed price movements lately. In the past week, the price declined by 2.22%, currently ranging between $0.00001248 and $0.00001288. Over the last month, the price decreased by 5.24%. In the past six months, SHIB’s price dropped by 27.85%. Technical indicators suggest possible changes ahead. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 21.95, indicating oversold conditions. The stochastic oscillator is low at 1.750, implying potential for an upward move. However, the MACD level is negative, which may signal continued bearish momentum. If the price rises, SHIB could face resistance at $0.00001427, about 5% above the current price. The next resistance is at $0.00001560, approximately 15% higher. If the price falls, support may be found at $0.00001161, roughly 5% lower, and then at $0.00001028, about 15% down. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are at $0.00001362 and $0.00001398, indicating the price is slightly below these levels. Conclusion Although DOGE and SHIB are strong, XYZVerse unites sports and memes, aiming to surge to $10. For more information on XYZVerse, visit the website , Telegram , or X .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Dogecoin and Solana face potential 30% declines in April, investors are flocking to the Remittix presale, with over $14.2 million already raised. Table of Contents Solana’s price under pressure Dogecoin price looks fragile Remittix gains momentum among new crypto presales Conclusion Remittix has drawn attention with its fundraising of over $14.2 million through the sale of 524 million tokens at $0.0734 per token, encouraging traders to use its easy crypto-to-fiat conversion system. While the altcoin market attracts strong interest in Remittix, some experts suggest Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) could suffer a 30% decline in April. Solana’s price under pressure On March 28, SOL experienced consolidation which ended as it fell from $138 to $131 after Asian markets opened. Volume increased by 4% to reach $3.4 billion although this level did not stop the price decline. Solana has lost important market ground from its rally since March 11, suggesting potential for further declines in the coming weeks. Some blame macro factors for this shift. The decision by President Donald Trump to levy tariffs on imported cars and automotive parts frightened numerous investors, who showed concerns about rising prices. The Federal Reserve’s attention toward inflationary concerns could stop interest rate reductions, which could also negatively impact risk assets including cryptocurrencies. The $146.5 resistance level for Solana corresponds to a 0.500 Fibonacci retracement point. The chart signals bearish signs when prices get rejected at this level. The market direction depends on sellers’ actions, which may push Solana down to $110 before it reaches $100 based on current market trends. Dogecoin price looks fragile Price fluctuations for DOGE remain limited, with Bollinger Bands establishing $0.19 as the resistance zone and $0.178 as the protective boundary against a decline down to $0.16. Volatility rise is likely because the distance between the bands continues to decrease. The eight to nine month substantial price dip that memecoins experience as the market drops requires DOGE to build its price potential using social media attention. Short-term volatile traders invest in DOGE but they also recognize that it has the potential to decrease by 30%. This leads investors toward alternative stable-gain opportunities.
