Recent trends suggest growing interest in the popular meme coin, but conflicting indicators leave the market’s next move uncertain. From search trends to mining milestones, Dogecoin has plenty going on, keeping its community engaged. Related Reading: Upbit Listing Sends BONK Skyrocketing 67% For A Fresh ATH In Memecoin Mania Search interest in Dogecoin peaked today, November 22, coinciding with a price increase, data from Google Trends shows. However, as public curiosity declined, so did the price, demonstrating a significant link between attention and performance. While some see this as an indication of Dogecoin’s unexpected character, others believe that it demonstrates how community-driven it is. Mining Activity Reaches New Peak Dogecoin is on a tear and its network enjoying solid numbers. Proof of this is its soaring hashrate, which touched an all-time high. This strengthens the security and stability of the blockchain as well as being more appealing to miners and investors. Crypto expert Master Kenobi believes mining DOGE has become more profitable than the cycles by Bitcoin with regards to halving, as steady payouts provide greater stability in the old system. 💥 #DOGE hashrate on ATH 🚀 In the long term, I believe #DOGE mining could become more profitable and less stressful for miners compared to #Bitcoin mining, as it offers greater predictability without the disruptions caused by halving events. This stability would contribute to… https://t.co/SfjlyGS8Q5 pic.twitter.com/IOIkuK8mCe — Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) November 20, 2024 With the increasing hashrate, expanded infrastructure also comes into the picture, giving more hope to the future of Dogecoin. A stable mining environment assures security and serves as a basis for the growth of the ecosystem. Traders Are Becoming More Optimistic Seasoned cryptocurrency expert expert Tardigrade sparked enthusiasm in the Dogecoin community by highlighting a major technical trend on its charts. The expert identified a “Hidden Bullish Divergence,” a structure that frequently indicates a reversal or slowing in bearish momentum. His analysis has sparked rumors that Dogecoin might be getting ready for its next innovation. Positive mood seems to be mostly prevalent when taken with the existing “Extreme Greed” value of 94 on the Fear & Greed Index. But the notable volatility (42.27%) over the past month calls for prudence on behalf of investors. Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough A Mixed Price Forecast Though there is growing hope, Dogecoin projections remain dubious. Analysts project a -6.83% decline with a December 22, 2024 price of $0.369286. Although the Fear & Greed Index is rather positive, history shows that such times usually precede temporary corrections. For investors, the combination of enthusiasm and prudence creates a perilous atmosphere. On the one hand, increased hashrate and technical indications appear good. However, because of Dogecoin’s unexpected nature, risks are always present. Dogecoin’s market remains volatile, fueled by its community, mining stats, and social emotion. Whether it’s a good moment to purchase or sell is determined by the community’s risk tolerance. One thing is certain: Dogecoin never fails to keep the cryptocurrency community guessing.

This surge has reignited investor optimism, especially as Ethereum approaches its yearly highs. Key data from CryptoQuant highlights a significant bullish signal: Ethereum’s Taker Buy Volume hit an astonishing $1.683 billion in a single hourly candle. This metric reflects aggressive buying activity in the futures market, further supporting Ethereum’s potential for continued upward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits ATH As BTC Nears $100K – What To Expect? The driving force behind this rising demand for Ethereum appears to stem from profits being cycled out of Bitcoin. With Bitcoin consistently breaking all-time highs, investors are reallocating gains into ETH, boosting its price. Ethereum’s ability to capitalize on Bitcoin’s momentum underscores its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency and a key player in the broader market trend. However, the next few days will be crucial for Ethereum as it nears its yearly highs. A strong breakout above these levels could propel ETH into a new uptrend, further strengthening its bullish narrative. Ethereum Bulls Waking Up Ethereum bulls are finally showing signs of life after eight months of bearish price action, with the price surging over 40% since November 5. This strong upward momentum aligns with the broader market rally, fueling optimism that Ethereum’s recovery is just beginning. The resurgence in bullish sentiment has positioned Ethereum as a key focus for investors seeking opportunities in the current market environment. According to data by CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, Ethereum’s Taker Buy Volume recently hit $1.683 billion in a single hourly candle, highlighting significant demand and the involvement of high-volume trades. This aggressive buying activity is a bullish signal, suggesting increased confidence in Ethereum’s potential to sustain its rally. Strong demand at this scale creates upward pressure on the price, reinforcing the bullish narrative for ETH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Driven By U.S. Coinbase Investors – Top Analyst Shares Metrics However, Ethereum still faces a critical hurdle at the $3,550 level, a significant supply zone that has acted as a barrier since late July. The next few days will be pivotal for Ethereum, as breaking above this key resistance could signal the continuation of its upward trajectory. Failure to do so, however, might result in a short-term consolidation. All eyes are now on ETH, as its next moves could set the tone for the altcoin market. ETH Holding Above Key Levels Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,333 after a 10% surge yesterday, marking a significant rebound for the second-largest cryptocurrency. The price is testing a critical supply zone just below the $3,450 level, a resistance area that bulls need to reclaim to confirm the uptrend and maintain momentum for new highs. This supply zone has historically acted as a key barrier, and breaking above it with conviction would signal strong buying pressure and the potential for a sustained rally. Holding above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $2,959 further strengthens the bullish case for Ethereum, as this indicator is widely regarded as a benchmark for long-term price trends. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Expects A Retrace Before It Breaks ATH – Targets Revealed Should Ethereum maintain its position above the 200-day MA and push decisively past the $3,450 level, it could pave the way for a bullish rally, targeting higher resistance zones in the coming days. However, failure to overcome this supply area may result in short-term consolidation as bulls regroup to challenge the level again. For now, the market focuses on Ethereum’s ability to clear this crucial resistance and continue its upward trajectory.

This breakout marks a significant turning point, signaling growing confidence among investors and renewed optimism for ADA’s price. With this critical resistance now in the rearview, Cardano is set to aim even higher. Could this be the beginning of a sustained rally that pushes ADA to new heights? As market sentiment improves and the bulls take charge, the focus is on analyzing Cardano’s surge beyond the $0.8119 level, exploring the key drivers behind its rally, and evaluating the prospects for continued upward movement toward higher price targets. Market Sentiment: Growing Confidence In ADA’s Potential On the 4-hour chart, ADA is striving to extend its gains after breaking past the $0.8119 level while remaining above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Holding above this critical mark and the 100-day SMA highlights ADA’s strength and potential for further price growth as it aims at new highs. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a notable rebound, rising sharply from a recent low of 55% to its current level of 70%. While this increase signals growing positive market sentiment, it raises concerns about the rally’s sustainability since a price correction could occur if profit-taking ensues. Overall, the steady increase in the RSI highlights ADA’s resilience and strengthens the outlook for continued price growth in the near term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bullish Move For Cardano Price To Cross $5, Here’s When Furthermore, Cardano is demonstrating robust upward momentum after breaking through the key $0.8119 resistance level, maintaining its position above the 100-day SMA. Its solid performance highlights sustained bullish strength, signalling that the digital asset is well-positioned for more price appreciation, with the 100-day SMA indicating the potential for a persistent uptrend. Finally, the RSI on the daily chart is currently at 66%, well above the crucial 50% threshold, reflecting a strong ascent for Cardano. This level suggests that the bullish move is likely to persist, with Cardano’s price expected to continue rising in the near term as the RSI approaches the overbought zone. What The $0.8119 Breakout Signals For Cardano The $0.8119 breakout represents a key milestone for ADA, signaling a shift in market sentiment toward a more optimistic outlook. This breach of resistance indicates that Cardano is gaining momentum, with the possibility of additional price gains, targeting the $1.2630 resistance level and beyond. Related Reading: Cardano Price Set To Skyrocket By 430%, Crypto Analyst Predicts However, if the resistance proves to be strong, ADA may experience a pullback or enter a consolidation phase, with the price likely retracing to the $0.8119 support level. A sustained drop below this critical support could signal a shift in momentum, potentially leading to deeper declines.

However, the momentum waned as SHIB retraced to levels below $0.00002303. With Bitcoin witnessing a push towards $100,000, SHIB investors have urged the development team to implement strategies that could catalyze a substantial rally Key Catalysts For Shiba Inu Price In response to these appeals, Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, addressed the community’s concerns by highlighting SHIB’s achievements and catalysts which will enhance the SHIB token valuation. Emphasizing the token’s prominence on the Ethereum blockchain, Kusama first stated via X: “‘Hey dude send Shib to the moon.’ Checks we are still #1 eth token in the world.” Addressing the notion that SHIB is merely a get-rich-quick scheme, a user commented: “What people don’t get is this token is about function and not just get rich quick.” Kusama agreed, replying that a superior technology and adoption are the key catalyst for the Shiba Inu token price: “Because through function we change the world and wagmi. No leader. Lots of tech. Unparalleled vision in the entirety of crypto. What more can you ask for?” Kusama wrote. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could See A 53% Surge If This Resistance Breaks, Analyst Explains The conversation also turned to SHIB: The Metaverse, a project anticipated to drive broader adoption of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. When asked about its launch, Kusama revealed: “I expect a MV update in the Shib Mag soon :)” SHIB: The Metaverse is envisioned as a virtual world within the SHIB ecosystem, offering a digital playground where users can socialize, game, and trade digital assets. This metaverse aims to integrate Shiba Inu’s community, tokens, and services like ShibaSwap into a cohesive online environment. Users will be able to purchase virtual land, create unique experiences, and potentially mirror real-life businesses. Concerns about competition from other meme tokens were also addressed by Kusama. When a user asked about the competition from Dogecoin (DOGE) and BONK, Kusama emphasized that the SHIB ecosystem will be on an enterprise level: “I hope all memes do well so that wagmi. But they are playing ‘I Declare War’ and I am on the enterprise playing multilevel chess with the shields raised saying Check to a Klingon. #kipla” he stated. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike Further emphasizing upcoming developments, Kusama announced via X: “Analysis: Shib is still King! Bone is key. Leash is strong. TREAT is Coming.” He added shortly after: “Reminder that TREAT released by Shib Core is not yet available.” The TREAT token, designed as an access key to advanced features within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, is set to be released soon. This token will complement the existing SHIB, BONE, and LEASH tokens, each serving distinct roles within the ecosystem. While LEASH focuses on exclusivity and BONE on technology, TREAT will unlock advanced functionalities, enriching the overall user experience. In July, Kusama elaborated: “As you may know, Shib is home to a variety of tokens, including Shib, Bone, Leash, and our upcoming unreleased token: TREAT. Each token has its own utility and governance, and TREAT is the access token to all the advanced features of our system, in contrast to Leash, which is about exclusivity, or Bone, which focuses on technology.” Hinting at another potential catalyst, Kusama retweeted a post by artchick.eth (@digitalartchick), who speculated: “Memecoin ETF within 10 months.” Kusama commented: “I didn’t say it…. but I did RT it.” The prospect of a memecoin ETF in the United States is significant. Similar to the US spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a memecoin ETF could attract substantial inflows from investors currently unable to access memecoin markets. Given its status as the second-largest memecoin by market capitalization, Shiba Inu would be a prime candidate for inclusion. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002502.

Historical data reveals that each time Dogecoin (DOGE) sees a price surge, there is an accompanying rise in volume. As a result, understanding the relationship between volume and price could help in projecting what will happen if DOGE achieves a daily volume of $50 billion.Historical Context Between DOGE’s Volume and PriceDogecoin reached its all-time high above $0.73 in May 2021, fueled by a surge in daily trading volume, which peaked at about $46 billion, according to market data from CoinMarketCap.This massive rise was influenced by retail enthusiasm, celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk’s tweets, and market-wide euphoria. At its peak, Dogecoin’s market cap exceeded $98 billion, making it one of the top crypto assets by valuation at the time.However, as DOGE dropped from the $0.73 peak, investor participation reduced, leading to an equal slump in trade volume. In recent times, Dogecoin’s 24-hour volume averaged $3.5 billion.Nonetheless, this figure surged massively amid the latest election-induced increase in price. For context, Dogecoin spiked 177% from $0.1582 on Nov. 5 to a three-year peak of $0.4385 on Nov. 12. Within this period, volume rose beyond $19 billion and particularly hit a peak of $39.9 billion on Nov. 12.Dogecoin Potential Price at $50B VolumeCurrently, Dogecoin trades at around $0.3945 with a 24-hour volume of $8.7 billion. This is in contrast to its 2021 heights, confirming the important role of volume in driving upward momentum. When trading volume spikes, it typically signifies heightened interest and liquidity, which can amplify price movements, especially in speculative assets like DOGE.The relationship between trading volume and price is not straightforward, as price is determined by supply and demand. However, we can make a simplified estimate based on the proportional increase in trading volume and assume that higher volume leads to higher prices due to increased demand. Using this as a benchmark, If trading volume increases to $50 billion per day and we assume proportionality, the price of Dogecoin could rise to approximately $1.23 per coin. The Price of $1.23 would imply a new market cap of roughly $212 billion, which would place Dogecoin among the most valuable cryptocurrencies. This would require significant, sustained interest and investment.However, this would depend on several factors. The first is a rise in demand . Notably, higher trading volume often translates to rising demand. With $50 billion in daily activity, massive capital inflows could push prices higher, especially if new buyers enter the market.However, the second factor is speculative momentum. Crypto assets thrive on speculation, and Dogecoin, as a meme token, benefits from social media buzz and community-driven hype. A volume surge could attract traders aiming to capitalize on short-term price spikes.Also, greater liquidity from high volume can lead to sharper price movements, particularly if large transactions occur. If most of the volume consists of buy orders, upward pressure on DOGE’s price would be substantial.",Market|Doge|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-11-23 04:25:53

XRP has continued to solidify its position in the $1 range, with a 28% surge today, pushing its price to $1.43. This latest price movement has boosted XRP’s two-week performance to a massive 170% gain.With XRP showing strong determination to break its 2021 cycle high, market analysts believe the journey to a new ATH has already begun. Among those voicing this optimistic view is “CrediBULL,” who boasts a following of 436K on X. According to CrediBULL, XRP is likely to reach a new ATH much faster than most expect.XRP to Outperform Bitcoin and EthereumFurthermore, he expressed the bold opinion that XRP will significantly outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two market leaders, from its current price levels.On short-term timeframes, XRP is outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of price appreciation. For instance, Bitcoin is up by 55% over the past 90 days, while Ethereum has gained 21%. In contrast, XRP has surged by an impressive 94% over the same period.However, Bitcoin is trading near an all-time high of around $99K, and Ethereum is down just 32% from its peak. XRP, on the other hand, is still trading 63% below its six-year-old all-time high. Despite this, analysts believe that XRP’s days below its peak are numbered.In his analysis, CrediBULL pointed out that the XRP/ETH pair has just reclaimed and retested a four-year-long range, with the first target potentially being about 250% higher.Currently, the XRP/ETH pair stands at 0.0004390, up by +18.14%. CrediBULL projects a further increase of 246%, bringing it to 0.0008357 ETH by the end of 2025. He envisions an even more promising outlook as the years progress. Bullish Signal on XRP/USDMeanwhile, looking at the XRP/USD pair, CrediBULL pointed out that XRP’s monthly RSI is about entering the overbought region for the first time since 2021. “This is extremely bullish,” he said. He explained that contrary to popular belief, a higher RSI typically signals stronger momentum and a more bullish outlook for the asset—provided there are no bearish divergences. As a result, he concluded that the next target for XRP is $2, and after that, it’s aiming for a new all-time high.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-11-23 04:41:17

Despite the fact that ETH is currently 36% below its all-time high of $4,878 from 2021, analysts anticipate that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization may be preparing for a significant shift.

This consistent activity serves as the foundation for Ethereum’s long-term value and underscores its ongoing significance in the crypto sector. Institutional Investors Place Bets In the past week, institutional buyers bought more than $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH), which caused a stir in the crypto community. During the same time frame, $147 million has been put into Spot Ethereum ETFs. This shows that people are becoming more optimistic about the future of ETH. #Ethereum whales have bought over 430,000 $ETH in the last two weeks, worth over $1.40 billion! pic.twitter.com/n7iTTADuax — Ali (@ali_charts) November 14, 2024 The activity surge continues; trading volumes for Ethereum ETFs reached a record $1.63 billion last week, representing a 44% weekly increase. According to analysts, this increase is consistent with the patterns observed in Bitcoin ETFs, which experienced an initial period of stagnation, followed by a period of sustained growth. In response, Ethereum’s price went through the roof, rising by 25%, which was the biggest weekly gain in six months. Many people see these changes as signs that Ethereum is gaining speed, which could possibly lead to more benefits. Shifting Landscape: Layer 2 Solutions While there are positives, growth in Ethereum’s network sends out a mixed signal. New ETH addresses created are lower than those seen in previous bull markets. The reason for this is seen by experts as Layer 2 options such as Base. Because these technologies are built on top of Ethereum’s infrastructure, transfers can happen more quickly and for less money. This makes it less important to directly connect to the main Ethereum chain. Nevertheless, Ethereum’s significance has not been eclipsed by Layer 2 growth. Tokens continue to be indispensable in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. In reality, this expansion strengthens Ethereum’s fundamental function while simultaneously increasing its scalability and accessibility.

The 180-day correlation between the two cryptocurrencies has plummeted to a three-year low, falling below 0.5. This change, according to analysts, indicates that Ethereum is now more influenced by its distinctive market dynamics than by the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. The necessity of independently assessing Ether’s potential is increasing as it continues to pursue its own course. Ethereum is demonstrating that it is more than just Bitcoin’s counterpart — it is forging its own path in the crypto world, whether through the adoption of Layer 2 solutions, institutional interest, or increasing ETF activity.

Earlier today, Avocado Onchain, a CryptoQuant analyst, shared his perspective on Bitcoin’s market performance, focusing on the widely-used Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This indicator is often used to assess Bitcoin’s valuation about its realized cap, which represents the aggregated value of all Bitcoin based on its last movement price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits S2F Threshold: Should You Hold Tight Or Take Profits? What Bitcoin MVRV Metric Currently Signals According to Avocado Onchain, the MVRV ratio provides key insights into market cycles. Historically, when the MVRV ratio dips below 1, it signals a market bottom, while values above 3.7 have coincided with potential market tops. As Bitcoin approaches new all-time highs, the MVRV ratio’s behavior suggests a shift in market sentiment from skepticism to optimism. This raises critical questions about how investors should interpret these metrics during a bull cycle. The MVRV ratio, calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s market cap by its realized cap, offers insights into whether the asset is undervalued or overvalued relative to its historical averages. Avocado Onchain emphasized that the ratio might not necessarily reach 3.7 in this cycle, as seen in prior bull markets, but could still signal overvaluation at lower levels. He noted that the ratio’s peaks and troughs have shown a narrowing trend, with higher lows and lower highs. MVRV Historical Patterns Drawing from historical patterns, the CryptoQuant analyst noted: In past cycles, detailed analysis of historical charts shows that in 2017, the MVRV ratio first reached 3.7, but Bitcoin’s price didn’t peak until six months later. Similarly, in 2021, the peak followed about three months after the ratio hit 3.7. Avocado Onchain suggested that while the MVRV ratio signals “overvaluation,” it does not guarantee an imminent price peak. Instead, the ratio often lingers around the overvaluation range, reflecting ongoing bullish sentiment with price fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Officially In Overheated MVRV Zone, Rally End Near? To mitigate risks, Avocado Onchain advises against relying solely on the MVRV ratio for investment decisions. He advocates for a gradual selling strategy as the ratio rises, allowing investors to balance potential gains with reduced exposure to market corrections. The analyst particularly concluded, stating: Asset prices often enter phases of extreme overvaluation that cannot be fully explained by numerical data alone. During a bull market, it’s essential to use not only on-chain metrics but also factors like investor sentiment, macroeconomic trends, and government policies to develop a well-rounded.

Notably, the token had once fallen as low as $8 at the peak of the FTX exchange collapse and the ensuing crypto bear market. Solana Makes Historic Recovery, Eyes USDT Flippening Solana (SOL), the much-touted “Ethereum killer,” is again in the spotlight. After dominating the 2020-21 crypto bull market, the digital asset saw its value plummet after FTX’s spectacular collapse, led by Sam Bankman-Fried. However, SOL has staged an impressive comeback over the last two years. Related Reading: $4,000 Solana Price Possible As SOL Breaks Out Of Massive Cup And Handle Pattern At the time of writing, SOL is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a reported market cap of over $123 billion. The layer-1 blockchain’s market cap is just $8 billion shy of overtaking stablecoin Tether’s (USDT) market cap of $130 billion. Notably, SOL needs a further 10% price appreciation to decisively increase USDT’s market cap and become the third-largest digital asset by market cap. SOL will only trail Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as the third-largest cryptocurrency. Given the token’s recent price trajectory, it won’t be surprising to see SOL surging past the leading stablecoin’s market cap before the end of the year. In the last three weeks alone, the token has experienced a remarkable 75% surge, rising from $148 on November 4 to $259 at the time of writing. While the broader crypto market has gained momentum following the victory of pro-crypto Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump, attributing SOL’s rise solely to this would be disingenuous. Memecoin Frenzy, Increased Network Activity, ETF Potential Helped SOL SOL’s remarkable turnaround can be linked to several factors that have spurred increased network adoption. One of the most prominent contributors is the ongoing memecoin frenzy, which has emerged as a dominant narrative in the crypto market. Related Reading: Solana Memecoin Market Thrives: POPCAT Reaches New Record Price Of $1.75 Memecoins – particularly those based on the Solana blockchain – have emerged as the crypto market’s top narrative over the last year. In October alone, the total market cap of Solana-based memecoins surpassed $10 billion. This memecoin craze has also translated into heightened network activity for Solana. Between September and October, Solana saw a 42% month-over-month (MoM) increase in active addresses, amounting to approximately 123 million. Besides benefitting from the memecoin narrative, Solana has also seen increased decentralized finance (DeFi) activity throughout the year. According to DefiLlama data, Solana is home to the second-largest DeFi ecosystem in the world, with a total value locked (TVL) of $9.265 billion. In addition, there are growing prospects for a Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). A recent report indicates that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is holding active talks with multiple asset managers regarding the potential launch of a new spot Solana ETF. While SOL’s achievement of a new ATH is impressive, experts believe the token still has significant growth potential. At the time of writing, SOL trades at $259, up 6.2% over the past 24 hours.

Cardano broke above $1 on Friday as bullish momentum reached astronomical levels. The asset has not slowed down yet, surging further to $1.14 before consolidating at $1.09 at the time of writing.Notably, Cardano is up 25% in the past 24 hours and a staggering 213% from its price 30 days ago. According to analyst Ali Martinez, the preposterous uptick is a glimpse of Cardano’s ultimate bullish target.Something Huge on Cardano’s HorizonMartinez insisted that Cardano is still in the early stages of its targeted explosion. In a Friday X thread , he cited bullish on-chain metrics as his basis for his assertion.First, the analyst pointed to a growing whale and institutional accumulation of Cardano as a sign that something explosive is coming for the asset. Martinez’s analysis shows that the large transaction volume on the Cardano network has surged past $22 billion daily.He further indicated that the impressive daily transactions on Cardano were actually accumulations other than sales or fund relocation. The analyst deduced his claims from the uptick in whales holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA, who have topped by stash by 100% in the past month.Meanwhile, Martinez noted that bullish on-chain activities have started exerting upward pressure on ADA’s price, which is evident in the recent outburst. His commentary further asserts that sustaining these bullish metrics would spur Cardano to mirror its previous bull cycle.The analyst also reiterated his earlier prediction, insisting that Cardan would hit $6 by 2025 . Notably, ADA is now 450% away from this price target and 184% from its all-time high of $3.10.Furthermore, Martinez’s analysis aligns with Cardano bull Dan Gambardello’s assertion that something huge is coming for the “Ethereum killer.” Gambardello hinted that something preposterous is imminent for Cardano, stating that although he cannot figure out what exactly, he believes whales and institutions are loading up the asset for a reason.Cardano Traction Reaches Epic LevelsMeanwhile, Santiment confirmed the growing institutional traction towards Cardano. The market intelligence firm’s recent analysis indicates that ADA’s social presence has surged to multi-month highs.Santiment’s data shows that Cardano had an astronomical social media mention and discussion rate yesterday. Notably, this is its largest social traction in 11 months, specifically since December 8, 2023. Furthermore, Santiment shares that Cardano’s market cap is now three times what it was 17 days ago following the push past $1. Also, realized profits on the Cardano network reached an 8-month high, as traders cashed out $165 million from their ADA stash yesterday.",Market|Cardano Price Prediction|Latest Cardano (ADA) Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-11-23 08:34:39

XRP’s recent price action has reignited optimism about its prospects. A week after reclaiming the $1 price territory for the first time in nearly three years, XRP has surged further. The token now has its eyes set on the $2 region, as it currently changes hands at $1.55 amid a 59% gain in a week.Can XRP Close November Above $2?In his latest market commentary , analyst CryptoBull stressed the importance of XRP claiming $2 and closing November above it. For context, this price would mark a near 7-year high, as XRP previously saw $2 in January 2018. XRP’s attempt to breach $2 met resistance at the $1.96 mark.However, some believe the $1.96 region could yield this bull run amid a favorable regulatory atmosphere and greater capital injection. According to CryptoBull, if XRP reclaims $2 and closes November above it, this would represent a 288% monthly increase, XRP’s highest monthly gain in seven years.Notably, at the current price of $1.55, XRP is already up 203% this month. A monthly close above $2 , marking a 288% increase, would be reminiscent of the asset’s price movement in March 2017, when it broke out during the 2017 bull run. For context, XRP surged from $0.0056 to $0.0214 in March 2017, a 284% monthly rise.Timeline for XRP Upside to $5 and $30CryptoBull believes if XRP repeats this increase with a close above $2 this month, the price action could suggest it is mirroring the 2017 bull run . Interestingly, the 2017 bull run presented massive gains following the bullish March performance, as XRP rallied by an additional 15,367% to $3.31 by January 2018.If it follows this path, more gains could be on the horizon. CryptoBull predicts that if the trend continues, XRP could more than double its price in December, eventually closing the month at the $5 price. This would mark a new all-time high.Meanwhile, CryptoBull sees XRP reaching a higher upside target after claiming a new ATH of $5 by the end of December 2024. According to the analyst, the altcoin could push further to a two-digit price of $30 by the end of January 2025. XRP Price Predictions CryptoBull XRP Price Predictions | CryptoBull The $30 price would mark a substantial 1,835% increase from the current $1.55 value, still substantially lower than the 15,367% gain XRP secured in 2017. However, this $30 price would take XRP’s market cap to $1.7 trillion, slightly lower than Bitcoin’s $1.9 trillion valuation. This shows the substantial capital inflow necessary to hit $30.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-11-23 08:48:18

Today, XRP is trading at $1.57 after advancing further by 13% in the last 24 hours, solidifying its position in the $1 price range. Notably, XRP even reached a high of $1.62 today amid its bull frenzy that peaked on Friday. As the frenzy cools off, XRP has settled in the $1.50 range.Notably, just on Thursday, XRP traded at $1.0821, which implies the asset has grown by 49.71% in under two days. With XRP approaching the $2 range, analysts believe XRP may never have reasons to retest below $1.XRP Will Not Trade Below $1 AnymoreAmong the market commentators voicing this bold view is “The Bearable Bull,” a widely followed millionaire mentor on X (formerly Twitter). “We will never see XRP go below $1 again,” he declared in a recent tweet.Other market commentators expressed a similar view, noting that XRP’s position in the $1 range is now reinforced. However, some cautioned that the bold prediction might be too early, as a major correction could send XRP's price below $1.Notably, XRP broke into the $1 range for the first time in three years on November 16, 2024, and traded as high as $1.267 that day.However, a pullback ensued, with XRP correcting those gains. Yet, the asset did not lose the $1 range but came dangerously close when it hit a low of $1.0055 on November 17. Since then, XRP has rebounded massively, and the asset is now showing strong signs of continuing its upward momentum.Other Bold Market Predictions for XRPOptimism about where XRP is headed is high in the crypto community. According to John Deaton, an attorney known for his pro-XRP stance, XRP is poised to reclaim a $100 billion market cap, noting that times have changed and the days of XRP's unimpressive performance are over.Similarly, analyst “CrediBULL” has predicted that XRP will break its all-time high sooner than expected. He even boldly stated that XRP will surpass expectations and outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum.XRP boasts a 90-day growth of 127%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 53% and Ethereum’s 22%. While XRP is still 60% below its peak, Bitcoin is trading at an all-time high, and Ethereum is down 30% from its peak. CrediBULL maintains that XRP will outpace these market leaders in price performance during this bull run.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-11-23 09:21:19

But a recent Shanghai court ruling clarified that it’s perfectly legal for citizens to hold, buy, and sell Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough Judge Sun Jie of the Shangai Songjiang People’s Court explained in an article via WeChat that it’s not illegal for Chinese citizens to hold cryptos, even though the courts have already ruled that business entities are not allowed to keep, buy, or sell cryptocurrencies at will. Jie’s insights were part of a case review on a lawsuit involving two companies in an initial coin offering that’s illegal in the country. Coin Offerings Remain Illegal Judge Sun Jie’s comments were part of a case review involving two companies engaged with digital assets in 2017. According to records, an agricultural company expressed its intention to finance a digital asset. It then worked with an investment company to draft its whitepaper and issue the tokens.

After drafting the token’s whitepaper, the investment company was paid 300,000 Yuan for its services. Under this premise, the agricultural company expected that the investment firm would release the tokens. It was the start of a misunderstanding, leading the company to seek a full refund. Planned Token Financing And Release Is ‘Potentially Illegal’ In Judge Jie’s notes, the planned financing and release of these tokens are potentially illegal. The planned initial coin offering falls under unlawful public financing. The court has ruled that no organization or individual can illegally finance or issue digital assets. The complaint of the agricultural company is deemed invalid by the court since the planned financing and token release would have been illegal. Still, the court instructed the investment firm to reimburse 250,000 yuan after careful evaluation.

However, she explained that the Chinese government imposes strict restrictions because of the risks involved. However, the rules on cryptocurrencies change in business since crypto use can impact the financial and economic order. Judge Sun Jie says these are the primary reasons why Chinese laws impose strict rules on the use of cryptocurrencies. China first banned initial coin offerings and closed online crypto exchanges in 2017. The authorities continued their campaign against crypto in 2021 and even banned mining and other cryptocurrency-related businesses.

It’s worth stepping back to see the big picture. A shiny new web3 house on the hill then asks new-era artists to conform to the old setting by becoming vehicles to sell even worse garbage, while leaving out the OGs of the scene—ensuring the products can’t outshine the primary idiocracy… or so it might seem at first. Maybe there is more to it all. Something even those directly involved are not even considering to be a thing. This “full circle” above refers to how seemingly progressive ideas are actually about selling the future in a desperate attempt to save the past, and control the present. Much like printing money at the expense of future generations, the fiat era of money is still in full swing in art. The Great Contemporary Art Bubble was a revelation when I first saw it at the start of my career in art in 2008. This article offers an alternative perspective to the popular banana show recently dominating the web3 art internet. It’s a big “what if”? If you can be truthful, brave, and funny—say, in the spirit of Joe Rogan—you might get some things wrong, but this article have plenty most have never considered to be a part of the art world. My intent is to be as fair as possible, and to continue saving art from the last hundred years of agendas that no longer serve it, especially in today’s world where decentralisation tools can invite everyone excluded into the party-this being nearly the whole population of the earth right now. Setting the stage: First off, SuperRare has done a great service to the digital art community in impressive numbers of art sold, and development in the scene through their DAO, up keeping the creator resale ryoalties, and fighting for the scene to become a thing among the first in the game. Watch this interview by the founders to get a deep dive into their perspective on the Dinis Guarda show. Thousands of artists will likely speak positively about the whole thing. So what gives? In short, the corporate mindset leading art, once again. This is not about SuperRare alone, but the whole company scene that emerged, but something that is personal to me about it all as well. As per the selected fifteen bananas, the dilemma of SuperRare is obvious. You can’t outshine the lame duck pre-internet paradigm banana, and the bureaucratic class, so their curator team is stuck choosing the upper end of what can be politically business wise tolerated. That ends up being not much, while they sell the future down the polluted river. “A tragedy is a literary, theatrical, or dramatic work that typically depicts the downfall of a central character, often due to a combination of their own flaws (such as hubris, greed, or ambition) and external forces (such as fate, societal pressures, or the actions of others). Tragedy is characterized by serious themes and often evokes feelings of pity and fear in the audience, culminating in catharsis—a purging or emotional release.” Or actually just.. (Art) Threat To Our Bureaucracy The SuperRare competition held in sync with Sotheby’s upcoming auction of a famous banana marked a new low in substance for the NFT scene, and there’s plenty to reflect on from before. Not because the art was the worst—that standard is impossible to set in NFTs anymore—but because of the combination of pleasing an old player while simultaneously sidelining the OGs – for the sake of engagement farming and money. The essence of crypto art—the rugged band of true avant-garde artists who took on the central banking system—has now been mostly washed away from sight. Events like this banana show, where they could have shone brightly to the world, instead pushed them further into the shadows. The watering down the Vodka of this scene is now an equivalent of a frozen bottle in the freezer. The more partnerships formed with pre-internet and web2 companies in hopes of “reputational gain,” the more a promising beginning started to vanish before our eyes. Very soon, the scene began to resemble the old one the pioneers had been trying to escape. The clearer the communication challenging the status quo in the art world at large, the more certain you became of hearing, “You weren’t selected this time,”, if you heard anything at all in the web3 scene as well. The curatorial team is hidden, so the community can only fight a symbol like SR, while those responsible for the heat generated remain protected. “I’m afraid I can’t explain myself, sir. Because I am not myself, you see?” ― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland Is art free? If art is truly free, where are the visual artist equivalents of Jordan Peterson, Thomas Sowell, Eric & Bret Weinstein, Gad Saad, Camille Paglia, Joe Rogan, Jonathan Haidt, Graham Hancock, Patrick Bet-David, Coleman Hughes, Yeonmi Park, Casey & Calley Means, Christina Hoff Sommers, Michael Malice, Mike Baker, Matt Taibbi, Matt Walsh, Matt Taibbi, Tucker Carlson, Annie Jacobsen, Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, Andrew Huberman, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and an abundance of others? This list includes credentialed academics, surgeons, scientists, religious and non-religious figures, journalists, people from the left and the right, as well as outside the system. Regardless of what you think of them, together they reach billions of people across various platforms and tackle a vast ocean of topics that are absent from the art world. Many even more provocative voices are deliberately excluded from the list, highlighting just how low the tolerance for dissenting to the postmodern monolith viewpoints is. So, are we living in the most restricted era of art history, or are we just now realizing how controlled it has always been? It’s becoming increasingly clear that the culture of convenience in art has overtaken its true purpose, much like what has happened in food, medicine, media, and other fields, as illustrated by the podcast guest list above. It didn’t take long that web3 went down the same stream. This article, links and all, might just be able to change your whole perception on what art is today. You will, however, need some courage and sincerity to get it. As I’ve recently discussed, including in this Anna Fischer interview, the art world’s cancellation and selection processes are deeply intertwined with lesser-known histories and fishy agendas also. These include the interference of intelligence agencies like the CIA since the 1940s, working alongside a specific kind of ideological possession—arguably making art less free than even the corporate scene is now substance wise. We’ve just had it for so long that people don’t understand being completely captured by a singular philosophy of postmodernism. You can read my previous “Free web3” article to get clued up on that side if unfamiliar. The past to shine light to our current state: Through declassified documents, investigative journalism and biographies related to the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), a CIA-funded organization, revealed that the agency had funded Jackson Pollock, Rotko, and De Kooning. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) played a pivotal role in the CIA’s cultural strategy. Key figures like Nelson Rockefeller (a MoMA trustee) were complicit in promoting Abstract Expressionism as a symbol of American freedom. MoMA organized exhibitions that were covertly funded by CIA-backed organizations, ensuring Abstract Expressionism gained prominence internationally to combat soviet art propaganda. Jackson Pollock in his studio in 1951 Wait a minute, VESA—are you insinuating that SuperRare or Sotheby’s are somehow influenced or captured by an intelligence agency? In short, no not directly, nor do I have any evidence otherwise. Direct involvement is not how these agencies work anymore. Most people would never know if they were behind something. However, it’s impossible to claim they haven’t been influenced indirectly, given what we know about the past For better or worse, we’ve all been influenced by these forces. The question is, did CIA leave the space after the 50’s, which is unlikely, and how many other agencies have entered, and from which countries since? Undoubtedly this is part of how we’ve arrived at where we are today, and I’ll unpack that as best I can below. A scene from 1740’s London Sotheby’s was founded in 1744 and has long been one of the rubber stamps of perceived quality. Much like the media, they underwent a strange transformation during COVID, embracing their metaverse and digital assets phase. It was as if, suddenly, serving Big Mac-level artworks in a three Michelin-star restaurant was considered cool. To me, it felt like they were burning down their own house and hosing it with petrol to speed up the process. A similar trend emerged with SuperRare, which increasingly alienated itself from its origins, throwing out OGs like Robness and Max Osiris. These were contrarians, for sure, but contrarians have always been a crucial part of the game. They fought for freedom of expression—annoying to the founders, perhaps—but they were powerful in their expression and represented the core of what this scene was supposed to be about. In essence, they weren’t doing anything Duchamp, Pollock, or even Basquiat wouldn’t have done. I say this, having endured a few unprovoked tirades from Max myself, but keep being on his side. If you are against free speech, you are anti-art The talented rarely align with corporate agendas over art. While I was courteous to the early scene people involved, I was merciless in my expression of what this scene was truly about. You can find that in pieces like “Selling banks their fat asses back” or “The Br8ve“. The corportes had clenched assholes just by knowing I existed, especially after taking a freedom of speech stance during Covid. Many platforms didn’t accept my applications in web3, so kudos for SuperRare for keeping me. I said I was going to be fair. The free speech alone was enough to get me sidelined to the tune of tens of millions so far. Freedom of speech of course is another way of saying freedom of expression aka art. The artists with the greatest potential and the most original expressions found themselves relegated to the outskirts of the pump. Meanwhile, what thrived were imitations of previously made masterworks, done to death concepts from decades back, meaningless glitch art, and whatever iteration of abstract impressionism was f l y i n g. I had some cool ones too along those veins, but crickets. Seemed everyone and their uncles were on Sotheby’s and Christie’s – but not me. To share some of the load, this was going on for me ever since the beginning. Artnome was among the first three people I contacted in 2017, and he took an active role in making sure I was nowhere to be found in his curation or circle. I contacted him directly, so there is little doubt. Everyone in the early scene was aware of everyone else. Can only imagine what kind of things he has said behind closed DMs. To me, Artnome represents crypto art much like Flint Dibble represents archeology. Many from the early scene felt the same. Not mentioning names as I am not in the habit of throwing people under a bus, nor were they shy to say so either. The personal responsibility part Back in the day in 2017, when there were very few of us crypto artists indeed, it was the SuperRare guys who reached out to me to join their platform. It was my relative mistake back then to join Four Park and Orion Vault instead, as my ten-year efforts could be priced at $50K there, while SR was averaging $50 per piece in 2017 and 2018. My works were heavy effort and just making one was 5x more expensive than what I could have gotten out of them in SR. Also the quality of the works was some cool stuff but mostly kids throwing shit on a wall and seeing what sticks with a glitch effect. By glitch effect I am not talking about cool stuff like Xcopy or A.L Grego later, but truly amateurish “wtf is this?” stuff. I thought I’ve actually exhibited in reputable galleries and received major press coverage reaching hundreds of millions. Joining this could look bad for me on many levels. VESA and CTO of SuperRare Jonathan Perkins at the Museum of the Future in Dubai in 2022. My bad, of course, since I sold nothing through the former two and was priced out of reach for the SR crowd at the start. The bear market and non-existent high level collector base wiped out both Four Park and Orion Vault. It wasn’t long, that things looked different on SR, and I did hop on board already in 2019, which I thought was early enough, but then nearly nothing happened no matter what price or kind of work I uploaded. I thought it very strange, as there was things flying off the digital shelves for more money and less, objectively deserving it much less on the basis of story, aesthetics, CV, reach, process & critical acclaim. Primarily, art matters, and that didn’t suck. So,again, wtf? The works were being sold for crazy money consistently by others. You could basically literally put out a line of colour and be an artist that started that year, and sell. It was the boom of 2021. Somehow, this was not the case for me in NFTs, despite being here and very visible almost before anyone else. “The Beginning of a new era” artwork by VESA, a digital original from 2013 made with a Bollywood star, reaching about 300m people when published. The Shiny New Web3 Art House On The Hill SuperRare quickly became a standard for collectors, most of whom, for the most part, had little understanding of art. The founders had backgrounds in architecture and new media but lacked direct experience in fine art. It was a degen scene—focused on crypto symbols and positive decentralization propaganda—which soon escalated into pure speculative hype over anything and everything available. There was some sophistication, too. Expertise was then soon imported from the legacy scene, which ended up being the problem. For the most part, collectors sought the curatorial stamp rather than the substance, career, or depth of the art itself. However, there were exceptions—artists who truly embodied those qualities. Meanwhile, platforms like Rarible, OpenSea, and others turned into a digital Wild West on fire. I’m using Joseph Desire-Court’s 1826 “Delusion scene” artwork as a meme to help people understand my relationship with SuperRare since the early days to now. It is deeply personal, as well as funny, as my real son was stillborn during the time I realised I was going to be left behind from the movement in 2021. Losing my son, as well as simultaneous access to the first NFT run, was a tough pill to swallow back then. I’m not suggesting this whole situation with NFTs is SR’s fault, but they seemed to have played a part in my deboosting—despite them being well aware of me. In the coming banana show part, I got confirmation of this, as all the founders were tagged in my post & the accompanying text leaves little for imagination for the curators. It’s proof of censorship. Painting by Joseph Desiree-Court meme alteration – 1826 to 2024 “In the biblical book of Genesis God flooded the earth, sparing only Noah and his family who had been instructed to build an ark. All others perished in the great deluge. Instead of illustrating the life of Noah, Court gives us a scene from the other side of the story. Here a man has to choose between saving his own son or his father. He chooses his father who, despite the man’s efforts, has just slipped out of his grasp. The painting can be read as an allegory about clinging to the past. If you always look to traditions and the past, you will miss out on all the possibilities that the future can bring.” End Stage Postmodernism During the NFT boom, the Pride LGBTQ+ movement also reached a stratospheric rise, and overnight, Fewocious became its brightest star. While I think he is a talented artist, his work was clearly youthful; a 16-year-old simply hasn’t had the time to develop much depth yet. His pieces sometimes depicted crying, misunderstood figures with a similar text explanation—if you know what I mean. The cartoonish style of this young artist was soon hailed as Basquiat-esque, with the added elements of gender confusion and being on the spectrum. Altogether, it fit every “tick-a-box” criterion for the emerging ETH scene, that was enhanced by media, marches and organisations. There was a heavy government, media and colliding corporate push for this that came out of seemingly nowhere all of a sudden. During the NFT run, the Bitcoin culture and the rest of the chains truly separated. It was all WAGMI and “Gm” for the scene—except, of course, for many of the artists who had fled the increasingly absurd woke art world and formed the first wave of crypto art by critiquing central banking, money printing, and promoting hard money principles. We were interested in healing society from a very different set of lenses, and not all that convinced more woke was what we needed to go into the right direction. On top of that, if you dared say a word about the “fresh wave” of end stage postmodernism, you weren’t necessarily cancelled silently, but certainly considered “out”. I’m Potency No one likes critique it feels ick, but without it the whole world becomes no rizz. I haven’t really participated in an ‘art submission competition,’ perhaps ever, as I’m a bit old-school and view it much like Prince might have viewed the rise of TV singing contests. He felt the process and commerce of it killed authenticity in the artist, and wasn’t wrong. In comparison to the music roster we had until about 2000, we live in a post music world now. However, the endless corruption symbolised by the duct-taped banana artwork, colliding with a SR competition, prompted me to enter. “In I’m-Potency, artist VESA presents a sharp satire on Western society’s spiritual flaccidity. By replacing Adam’s reaching finger with a limp, taped banana—a nod to Maurizio Cattelan’s Comedian—this piece reflects the decay of a culture that once held itself as a beacon of enlightenment but has now veered into absurdity. Michelangelo’s Adam famously reaches toward God with a finger that isn’t fully extended, symbolizing humanity’s hesitation and the delicate gift of free will. In this reimagining, Adam’s once-restrained reach becomes even more compromised, transformed into a limp banana pointing downward. It’s as if Western culture, once brimming with creative potential, is now resigned to existential apathy, unable or unwilling to reach for anything beyond itself.” That is just the start of the text ending in this: The post tagged the new head of digital assets in Sotheby’s, the auction house, as well as SR. Read the full context of the submission substance here See the selected, eventually 15 artworks considered more worthy by the SR curation team Of course, it was not selectedThe most amazing thing about my submission piece “I’m Potency” not selected to the SR banana competition finals was that I am an actually censored artist, making a case on how art has been censored by the postmodernists for over a hundred years, writing the whole thing out crystal clear, but I got censored again out of the show by those who were meant to build the free infrastructure. What we have here, is an illusion of choice. A combination of a totalitarian philosophy, coupled with an illusion of options. This is made obvious by the objectively much less substance or vision pieces selected over mine with a topic of censorship. More on this a bit later, but you will see it at the very least, vindicates my point that shadow games beyond merit and substance are going on inside of the web3 art world, much like in the legacy art as well. Pissing on traditional values for a hundred years In the art world, the war on conservatism began over a century ago with Duchamp’s satire and shock artwork, The Fountain (1917). Duchamp claimed his six-dollar urinal entry piece singled how “art has lost all of its credibility.” Ironically, it sank art even lower from a certain perspective. Fast-forward a hundred years to The Comedian and it seems no amount of bubble gum in the form of “substance” can satiate the post-MTV generations. If something had already been done with far more punch a century ago, eroding standards in a meaningful way at the time, then today’s attempts are pure LARPing. Sotheby’s, in this context, is not worthy of the reverence it once commanded—especially when their head of digital assets, Michael Bouhanna, calls The Comedian “the most significant work of the 21st century.” Very little of course about this is about art, as most of it is money, power and potentially continued societal agency subversion. Jonathan Haidt’s research on disgust sensitivity is fascinating. He discovered that conservatives have a much more heightened sense of disgust when boundaries are broken, as well as a greater need for physical cleanliness. In contrast, this is not a high priority for liberals or libertarians. Naturally, those with no boundaries are easier to subvert for whatever cause. Fobia means An intense, irrational fear or aversion to a specific object, situation, or activity that is often disproportionate to the actual danger posed. This is not the same as disgust, which is an emotional response of strong aversion or revulsion to something perceived as unpleasant, offensive, or morally unacceptable. This part is less discussed in this context. “KISS” My second inspired banana, which I did not submit to the contest. So returning to the Pollock paradigm and how he was a darling of the alphabet agencies, with the CIA entering the art world as far back as the 1940s to combat the rise of communism. Leftist artists were propped up to showcase American exceptionalism. Selling the idea of a cocaine-laced drink and “do what you feel like” freedom to American youth and elites wasn’t a hard pitch compared to glorifying Soviet despots who demanded hard work as well as to be elevated to Godlike status. Read the full context of the “Kiss” artwork Most know of course the famous Kiss by Gustav Klimt, and how combining the CIA logo and the idiot banana in this context is at least a chuckle, if not a profound question mark on the last 80 years of our understanding of art. This isn’t conspiracy theory—it’s conspiracy fact. It’s also worth noting that the term “conspiracy theorist” was invented by the CIA as a derogatory label to discredit those questioning their activities, a tactic that gained traction after the JFK assassination. This will be relevant later when discussing how RFK has now been elected as part of the new U.S. cabinet. Conspiracy theories have been around pre-internet, took the internet by storm, and are completely invisible to the art world. This is because there is no right wing thought in the space what so ever. Sure there is cooky thing from flat earth to what ever, but there are legitimate conspiracies proven true that are fascinating. There are no gallery artworks making any waves? Not a single openly conservative artist anyone knows? Seems natural. Some of you might also be familiar with the famous interviews of Yuri Bezmenov, the defected KGB spy, who outlined how demoralization was part of their plan to take down the U.S. government. If you ask me, the demoralization he described has only ramped up since the 1980s, fueled by postmodern values and the fiat-funded war on conservative ideals and God—or whatever God represents as a symbol of natural order to be discovered rather than manipulated into existence. His “useful idiot” term helps us see many players in art in a different light. Eric Weinstein gives some indication with his Kayfabe concept to where we might be today. Here are parts 2 & 3 Home of DAF The art world, which has been playing with our collective subconscious for a 100 years, is in deep need of an audit by a character like Elon Musk with his DOGE crew of Vivek, RFK and Trump. Wouldn’t that be something? You also need me on Rogan going a three hour round to talk about this all. This is why I made the Department of Artistic Freedom. It’s an open invitation to the first 100 builders resonating with this idea, and available on Ador for 369k sats- a nod to Tesla. Buy it if you want to support the cause like that, but I care mostly that the mentality spreads. You don’t have to join to start making the new direction happen. Just choose to do your own exploration without censoring yourself constantly. It will be a think tank for liberty minded artists, and the function will first be to come to the aid of artists who are being ignored despite obvious merit and substance, as well as facing some form of cancellation for BS reasons. Given the massive push by governments, media, and activists for the LGBT+ community not long ago, how can we be certain that the art aspect wasn’t a similar operation to the one carried out with Jackson Pollock back in the day? Be so free that no boundary of physical reality can hold you back. Simultaneously, everyone raising their voice will be canceled, and most will be incentivized to stay quiet. I’m not saying it was—I’m saying that, knowing all we now know, we can’t be sure. And those involved publicly might not have any idea this was the case. Least of all Fewocious, so crytal clear, I am not accusing Fewo, SupeRare, nor Sotheby’s of anything. This is about something much bigger and the sum of the parts. Beeple’s “Cross Road” sold for 6.6M at Sothebys earlier $17 Million Realized in Sotheby’s First NFT Sale with Digital Creator Pak Postmodern pump: The same question certainly applies to Pak, Beeple, and many others who used late-stage postmodernism expressions as their vehicle of communication. Much was fitting to the agenda of end stage postmodernism in NFTs. From the Twitter files, we know for a fact that deboosting and amplifying messages were actively managed, and merit was certainly not at the top of the food chain in the selection process. The real question seemed to be: What can we push and get away with? This approach fit the degen agenda perfectly. It is difficult to sell high level art to an audience that can’t read it. This has been the argument of culture critic Camille Paglia. Again, I am not accusing any artist, gallery or auction house. This is mere opinion and speculation on big philosophy waves as well as the continued erosion of substance in art. In podcasting, this kind of speculation has been normal for a long time, but not in art, for some reason. Also, this has nothing to do with hating any group within postmodernism. It has everything to do with the manipulative individuals working behind the scenes to activate and suppress ideas according to power plays and political agendas. People like James Lindsay have committed significant parts of their lives to try to figure this all out. Some will accuse me of being jealous of other people’s success. While I certainly feel that more financial success would help, if finances were my first priority, this would not have consistently been my focus—to save art from postmodernism—for seven years publicly now. Otherwise, we have continued regress as progress, and a world in general, in inverse mode. When any artist does well, I’m genuinely happy for them. Artists aren’t usually known for achieving major success, as megastardom has often required aligning with various agendas rather than relying solely on the strength of the art itself to reach stratospheric heights. We can’t fix any of this unless it’s at least discussed. How differently does this all make us view what was going on before, as well as what might be going on now? The dignified bananas. Here are also some other entries that I figured were worthy of attention. Some not submitted to the competition, as understandably people with dignity don’t submit work to be evaluated by clowns, and they have been increasingly disappointed by the quality of curation since the early days. My post started with how I don’t do this, and unleashed as much fire as I can toward the whole system, stress testing it to see if I was correct – and it absolutely turned out to be the case. Banana Zone by Norman Harman Norman Harman is one of the most interesting voices in web3. To me, the consumerist era has been gone for 20 years already, but his critique of the bureaucratic class with his new series, as well as an avalanche of dirty little bitch slaps to the auction champagne crew, has been a breath of fresh air in the scene. The new AI motion work is dope too. Both capture perfectly the orgiastic degeneracy scene of this auction vibe. Norman, like many other OGs, wouldn’t “submit” work to a contest like this anymore, having been disillusioned from the scene already many times over. “RARE In The Machine” by Spaced Painter Spaced Painter did her literal submission with this piece, in which the banana fucks her into oblivion, and she metaphorically gives up due to being sidelined and ignored. That makes her Rare. It was visionary, as her being left out of the ten selected, gave her exactly that. The piece illustrates well on how the demoralising effect of 100 years of postmodernism is having on the spiritually minded, and just anyone with common sense anymore, and it is so obvious that we can make super predictive art about it. ROBNESS – I AM BANANA The “I Am Banana” by Robness is a parody take of Kevin Abosch’s I Am a Coin project already from 2019 minted on Superrare. How can you go lower than the banana? Well just put tape on tape and watch the yellow paint dry. At least that’s my interpretation. The competition set up by another crypto art enfant terrible, Maxis Osiris, has put together a parody auction competition to parody the parody auction competition parodying the parody auction. Alotta Money would be proud. Like Alan Watts said earlier that academia and religion has become but a foot note on a foot note, the direct experience is “access denied”, so the Farisejan and the money changers can keep doing their thing. “I’ll die on this lid” by Max Osiris We had a nice convo with my friend Nicolaas on all the of above and more on Bitcoin LIVE, but I wasn’t yet unfortunately aware of the selected bananas then. What ever last remaining hopium I had for the early stage platforms died the next day, hence I got motivated to write this article. Artist extraordinaire ANDRÉS DEL VECCHIO curated a much better selection of bananas from the litter on his X, so leaving that here for you to evaluate in case you don’t have time to go thought the 1100 entries yourself. It took a child to point to the nude emperor that he had been conned. In art, it has lasted a hundred years. The measure of intelligence is the ability to change. – Albert Einstein They are laughing at us. Our creative generative power. We need to understand this. While an Einstein quote is a tough one to do without seeming pretentious, in the above context it works. If you work with truth, even the setbacks help you rise. We need to stop focusing on the fall. Artists are creators, and we are currently being completely under served by trying to be under the thumb of the destroyers. This is all the postmodernists can do, and by doing garbage bananas, you are submitting to being reduced further and further. Start building the future. Make your own gallery. Band together. Don’t submit to the bureaucrats that run the establishment. We are artists. We are powerful. it’s cool. Old things and people die. Let them. As you can tell, there has been a lot of wtf going on here. Remember, I was building this, this and this, as well as speaking on big stages when everything flies off the shelves and for me nothing moved. Despite it all, find gratitude. It’s a lifeline. There is plenty to be grateful for, but step out of harms way. Remember why you got into this in the first place. If you want to support my efforts, do consider collecting these pieces from my SR page. It’s unlikely that they will age badly. I’m happy to give the platform fee back to SR, as those guys, despite my poor sales, still airdropped me comfort tokens when SUPR was launched for being there early. There was some respect there at least still then. Unfortunately, I can’t help but wonder, in recent light, how much my art not reaching people there despite significant effort, was artificially suppressed. Maybe not at all by them, but who knows. I still have a bunch of art there that cost me a bomb to mint, so hoping all my efforts with SR and for this scene will be acknowledged at some point. Writing and researching this article took a week, and I was not paid to do it. I’m either brave and pricipled, or a complete idiot. Hard to tell which one sometimes. Bit of both, I guess.
