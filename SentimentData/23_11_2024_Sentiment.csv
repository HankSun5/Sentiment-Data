Recent trends suggest growing interest in the popular meme coin, but conflicting indicators leave the market’s next move uncertain. From search trends to mining milestones, Dogecoin has plenty going on, keeping its community engaged. Related Reading: Upbit Listing Sends BONK Skyrocketing 67% For A Fresh ATH In Memecoin Mania Search interest in Dogecoin peaked today, November 22, coinciding with a price increase, data from Google Trends shows. However, as public curiosity declined, so did the price, demonstrating a significant link between attention and performance. While some see this as an indication of Dogecoin’s unexpected character, others believe that it demonstrates how community-driven it is. Mining Activity Reaches New Peak Dogecoin is on a tear and its network enjoying solid numbers. Proof of this is its soaring hashrate, which touched an all-time high. This strengthens the security and stability of the blockchain as well as being more appealing to miners and investors. Crypto expert Master Kenobi believes mining DOGE has become more profitable than the cycles by Bitcoin with regards to halving, as steady payouts provide greater stability in the old system. 💥 #DOGE hashrate on ATH 🚀 In the long term, I believe #DOGE mining could become more profitable and less stressful for miners compared to #Bitcoin mining, as it offers greater predictability without the disruptions caused by halving events. This stability would contribute to… https://t.co/SfjlyGS8Q5 pic.twitter.com/IOIkuK8mCe — Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) November 20, 2024 With the increasing hashrate, expanded infrastructure also comes into the picture, giving more hope to the future of Dogecoin. A stable mining environment assures security and serves as a basis for the growth of the ecosystem. Traders Are Becoming More Optimistic Seasoned cryptocurrency expert expert Tardigrade sparked enthusiasm in the Dogecoin community by highlighting a major technical trend on its charts. The expert identified a “Hidden Bullish Divergence,” a structure that frequently indicates a reversal or slowing in bearish momentum. His analysis has sparked rumors that Dogecoin might be getting ready for its next innovation. Positive mood seems to be mostly prevalent when taken with the existing “Extreme Greed” value of 94 on the Fear & Greed Index. But the notable volatility (42.27%) over the past month calls for prudence on behalf of investors. Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough A Mixed Price Forecast Though there is growing hope, Dogecoin projections remain dubious. Analysts project a -6.83% decline with a December 22, 2024 price of $0.369286. Although the Fear & Greed Index is rather positive, history shows that such times usually precede temporary corrections. For investors, the combination of enthusiasm and prudence creates a perilous atmosphere. On the one hand, increased hashrate and technical indications appear good. However, because of Dogecoin’s unexpected nature, risks are always present. Dogecoin’s market remains volatile, fueled by its community, mining stats, and social emotion. Whether it’s a good moment to purchase or sell is determined by the community’s risk tolerance. One thing is certain: Dogecoin never fails to keep the cryptocurrency community guessing.

This surge has reignited investor optimism, especially as Ethereum approaches its yearly highs. Key data from CryptoQuant highlights a significant bullish signal: Ethereum’s Taker Buy Volume hit an astonishing $1.683 billion in a single hourly candle. This metric reflects aggressive buying activity in the futures market, further supporting Ethereum’s potential for continued upward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits ATH As BTC Nears $100K – What To Expect? The driving force behind this rising demand for Ethereum appears to stem from profits being cycled out of Bitcoin. With Bitcoin consistently breaking all-time highs, investors are reallocating gains into ETH, boosting its price. Ethereum’s ability to capitalize on Bitcoin’s momentum underscores its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency and a key player in the broader market trend. However, the next few days will be crucial for Ethereum as it nears its yearly highs. A strong breakout above these levels could propel ETH into a new uptrend, further strengthening its bullish narrative. Ethereum Bulls Waking Up Ethereum bulls are finally showing signs of life after eight months of bearish price action, with the price surging over 40% since November 5. This strong upward momentum aligns with the broader market rally, fueling optimism that Ethereum’s recovery is just beginning. The resurgence in bullish sentiment has positioned Ethereum as a key focus for investors seeking opportunities in the current market environment. According to data by CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, Ethereum’s Taker Buy Volume recently hit $1.683 billion in a single hourly candle, highlighting significant demand and the involvement of high-volume trades. This aggressive buying activity is a bullish signal, suggesting increased confidence in Ethereum’s potential to sustain its rally. Strong demand at this scale creates upward pressure on the price, reinforcing the bullish narrative for ETH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Driven By U.S. Coinbase Investors – Top Analyst Shares Metrics However, Ethereum still faces a critical hurdle at the $3,550 level, a significant supply zone that has acted as a barrier since late July. The next few days will be pivotal for Ethereum, as breaking above this key resistance could signal the continuation of its upward trajectory. Failure to do so, however, might result in a short-term consolidation. All eyes are now on ETH, as its next moves could set the tone for the altcoin market. ETH Holding Above Key Levels Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,333 after a 10% surge yesterday, marking a significant rebound for the second-largest cryptocurrency. The price is testing a critical supply zone just below the $3,450 level, a resistance area that bulls need to reclaim to confirm the uptrend and maintain momentum for new highs. This supply zone has historically acted as a key barrier, and breaking above it with conviction would signal strong buying pressure and the potential for a sustained rally. Holding above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $2,959 further strengthens the bullish case for Ethereum, as this indicator is widely regarded as a benchmark for long-term price trends. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Expects A Retrace Before It Breaks ATH – Targets Revealed Should Ethereum maintain its position above the 200-day MA and push decisively past the $3,450 level, it could pave the way for a bullish rally, targeting higher resistance zones in the coming days. However, failure to overcome this supply area may result in short-term consolidation as bulls regroup to challenge the level again. For now, the market focuses on Ethereum’s ability to clear this crucial resistance and continue its upward trajectory.

This breakout marks a significant turning point, signaling growing confidence among investors and renewed optimism for ADA’s price. With this critical resistance now in the rearview, Cardano is set to aim even higher. Could this be the beginning of a sustained rally that pushes ADA to new heights? As market sentiment improves and the bulls take charge, the focus is on analyzing Cardano’s surge beyond the $0.8119 level, exploring the key drivers behind its rally, and evaluating the prospects for continued upward movement toward higher price targets. Market Sentiment: Growing Confidence In ADA’s Potential On the 4-hour chart, ADA is striving to extend its gains after breaking past the $0.8119 level while remaining above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Holding above this critical mark and the 100-day SMA highlights ADA’s strength and potential for further price growth as it aims at new highs. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a notable rebound, rising sharply from a recent low of 55% to its current level of 70%. While this increase signals growing positive market sentiment, it raises concerns about the rally’s sustainability since a price correction could occur if profit-taking ensues. Overall, the steady increase in the RSI highlights ADA’s resilience and strengthens the outlook for continued price growth in the near term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bullish Move For Cardano Price To Cross $5, Here’s When Furthermore, Cardano is demonstrating robust upward momentum after breaking through the key $0.8119 resistance level, maintaining its position above the 100-day SMA. Its solid performance highlights sustained bullish strength, signalling that the digital asset is well-positioned for more price appreciation, with the 100-day SMA indicating the potential for a persistent uptrend. Finally, the RSI on the daily chart is currently at 66%, well above the crucial 50% threshold, reflecting a strong ascent for Cardano. This level suggests that the bullish move is likely to persist, with Cardano’s price expected to continue rising in the near term as the RSI approaches the overbought zone. What The $0.8119 Breakout Signals For Cardano The $0.8119 breakout represents a key milestone for ADA, signaling a shift in market sentiment toward a more optimistic outlook. This breach of resistance indicates that Cardano is gaining momentum, with the possibility of additional price gains, targeting the $1.2630 resistance level and beyond. Related Reading: Cardano Price Set To Skyrocket By 430%, Crypto Analyst Predicts However, if the resistance proves to be strong, ADA may experience a pullback or enter a consolidation phase, with the price likely retracing to the $0.8119 support level. A sustained drop below this critical support could signal a shift in momentum, potentially leading to deeper declines.

However, the momentum waned as SHIB retraced to levels below $0.00002303. With Bitcoin witnessing a push towards $100,000, SHIB investors have urged the development team to implement strategies that could catalyze a substantial rally Key Catalysts For Shiba Inu Price In response to these appeals, Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, addressed the community’s concerns by highlighting SHIB’s achievements and catalysts which will enhance the SHIB token valuation. Emphasizing the token’s prominence on the Ethereum blockchain, Kusama first stated via X: “‘Hey dude send Shib to the moon.’ Checks we are still #1 eth token in the world.” Addressing the notion that SHIB is merely a get-rich-quick scheme, a user commented: “What people don’t get is this token is about function and not just get rich quick.” Kusama agreed, replying that a superior technology and adoption are the key catalyst for the Shiba Inu token price: “Because through function we change the world and wagmi. No leader. Lots of tech. Unparalleled vision in the entirety of crypto. What more can you ask for?” Kusama wrote. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could See A 53% Surge If This Resistance Breaks, Analyst Explains The conversation also turned to SHIB: The Metaverse, a project anticipated to drive broader adoption of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. When asked about its launch, Kusama revealed: “I expect a MV update in the Shib Mag soon :)” SHIB: The Metaverse is envisioned as a virtual world within the SHIB ecosystem, offering a digital playground where users can socialize, game, and trade digital assets. This metaverse aims to integrate Shiba Inu’s community, tokens, and services like ShibaSwap into a cohesive online environment. Users will be able to purchase virtual land, create unique experiences, and potentially mirror real-life businesses. Concerns about competition from other meme tokens were also addressed by Kusama. When a user asked about the competition from Dogecoin (DOGE) and BONK, Kusama emphasized that the SHIB ecosystem will be on an enterprise level: “I hope all memes do well so that wagmi. But they are playing ‘I Declare War’ and I am on the enterprise playing multilevel chess with the shields raised saying Check to a Klingon. #kipla” he stated. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike Further emphasizing upcoming developments, Kusama announced via X: “Analysis: Shib is still King! Bone is key. Leash is strong. TREAT is Coming.” He added shortly after: “Reminder that TREAT released by Shib Core is not yet available.” The TREAT token, designed as an access key to advanced features within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, is set to be released soon. This token will complement the existing SHIB, BONE, and LEASH tokens, each serving distinct roles within the ecosystem. While LEASH focuses on exclusivity and BONE on technology, TREAT will unlock advanced functionalities, enriching the overall user experience. In July, Kusama elaborated: “As you may know, Shib is home to a variety of tokens, including Shib, Bone, Leash, and our upcoming unreleased token: TREAT. Each token has its own utility and governance, and TREAT is the access token to all the advanced features of our system, in contrast to Leash, which is about exclusivity, or Bone, which focuses on technology.” Hinting at another potential catalyst, Kusama retweeted a post by artchick.eth (@digitalartchick), who speculated: “Memecoin ETF within 10 months.” Kusama commented: “I didn’t say it…. but I did RT it.” The prospect of a memecoin ETF in the United States is significant. Similar to the US spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a memecoin ETF could attract substantial inflows from investors currently unable to access memecoin markets. Given its status as the second-largest memecoin by market capitalization, Shiba Inu would be a prime candidate for inclusion. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002502.

Historical data reveals that each time Dogecoin (DOGE) sees a price surge, there is an accompanying rise in volume. As a result, understanding the relationship between volume and price could help in projecting what will happen if DOGE achieves a daily volume of $50 billion.Historical Context Between DOGE’s Volume and PriceDogecoin reached its all-time high above $0.73 in May 2021, fueled by a surge in daily trading volume, which peaked at about $46 billion, according to market data from CoinMarketCap.This massive rise was influenced by retail enthusiasm, celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk’s tweets, and market-wide euphoria. At its peak, Dogecoin’s market cap exceeded $98 billion, making it one of the top crypto assets by valuation at the time.However, as DOGE dropped from the $0.73 peak, investor participation reduced, leading to an equal slump in trade volume. In recent times, Dogecoin’s 24-hour volume averaged $3.5 billion.Nonetheless, this figure surged massively amid the latest election-induced increase in price. For context, Dogecoin spiked 177% from $0.1582 on Nov. 5 to a three-year peak of $0.4385 on Nov. 12. Within this period, volume rose beyond $19 billion and particularly hit a peak of $39.9 billion on Nov. 12.Dogecoin Potential Price at $50B VolumeCurrently, Dogecoin trades at around $0.3945 with a 24-hour volume of $8.7 billion. This is in contrast to its 2021 heights, confirming the important role of volume in driving upward momentum. When trading volume spikes, it typically signifies heightened interest and liquidity, which can amplify price movements, especially in speculative assets like DOGE.The relationship between trading volume and price is not straightforward, as price is determined by supply and demand. However, we can make a simplified estimate based on the proportional increase in trading volume and assume that higher volume leads to higher prices due to increased demand. Using this as a benchmark, If trading volume increases to $50 billion per day and we assume proportionality, the price of Dogecoin could rise to approximately $1.23 per coin. The Price of $1.23 would imply a new market cap of roughly $212 billion, which would place Dogecoin among the most valuable cryptocurrencies. This would require significant, sustained interest and investment.However, this would depend on several factors. The first is a rise in demand . Notably, higher trading volume often translates to rising demand. With $50 billion in daily activity, massive capital inflows could push prices higher, especially if new buyers enter the market.However, the second factor is speculative momentum. Crypto assets thrive on speculation, and Dogecoin, as a meme token, benefits from social media buzz and community-driven hype. A volume surge could attract traders aiming to capitalize on short-term price spikes.Also, greater liquidity from high volume can lead to sharper price movements, particularly if large transactions occur.

XRP has continued to solidify its position in the $1 range, with a 28% surge today, pushing its price to $1.43. This latest price movement has boosted XRP’s two-week performance to a massive 170% gain.With XRP showing strong determination to break its 2021 cycle high, market analysts believe the journey to a new ATH has already begun. Among those voicing this optimistic view is “CrediBULL,” who boasts a following of 436K on X. According to CrediBULL, XRP is likely to reach a new ATH much faster than most expect.XRP to Outperform Bitcoin and EthereumFurthermore, he expressed the bold opinion that XRP will significantly outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two market leaders, from its current price levels.On short-term timeframes, XRP is outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of price appreciation. For instance, Bitcoin is up by 55% over the past 90 days, while Ethereum has gained 21%. In contrast, XRP has surged by an impressive 94% over the same period.However, Bitcoin is trading near an all-time high of around $99K, and Ethereum is down just 32% from its peak. XRP, on the other hand, is still trading 63% below its six-year-old all-time high. Despite this, analysts believe that XRP’s days below its peak are numbered.In his analysis, CrediBULL pointed out that the XRP/ETH pair has just reclaimed and retested a four-year-long range, with the first target potentially being about 250% higher.Currently, the XRP/ETH pair stands at 0.0004390, up by +18.14%. CrediBULL projects a further increase of 246%, bringing it to 0.0008357 ETH by the end of 2025. He envisions an even more promising outlook as the years progress. Bullish Signal on XRP/USDMeanwhile, looking at the XRP/USD pair, CrediBULL pointed out that XRP’s monthly RSI is about entering the overbought region for the first time since 2021. “This is extremely bullish,” he said. He explained that contrary to popular belief, a higher RSI typically signals stronger momentum and a more bullish outlook for the asset—provided there are no bearish divergences. As a result, he concluded that the next target for XRP is $2, and after that, it’s aiming for a new all-time high.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-11-23 04:41:17

This consistent activity serves as the foundation for Ethereum’s long-term value and underscores its ongoing significance in the crypto sector. Institutional Investors Place Bets In the past week, institutional buyers bought more than $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH), which caused a stir in the crypto community. During the same time frame, $147 million has been put into Spot Ethereum ETFs. This shows that people are becoming more optimistic about the future of ETH. #Ethereum whales have bought over 430,000 $ETH in the last two weeks, worth over $1.40 billion! pic.twitter.com/n7iTTADuax — Ali (@ali_charts) November 14, 2024 The activity surge continues; trading volumes for Ethereum ETFs reached a record $1.63 billion last week, representing a 44% weekly increase. According to analysts, this increase is consistent with the patterns observed in Bitcoin ETFs, which experienced an initial period of stagnation, followed by a period of sustained growth. In response, Ethereum’s price went through the roof, rising by 25%, which was the biggest weekly gain in six months. Many people see these changes as signs that Ethereum is gaining speed, which could possibly lead to more benefits. Shifting Landscape: Layer 2 Solutions While there are positives, growth in Ethereum’s network sends out a mixed signal. New ETH addresses created are lower than those seen in previous bull markets. The reason for this is seen by experts as Layer 2 options such as Base. Because these technologies are built on top of Ethereum’s infrastructure, transfers can happen more quickly and for less money. This makes it less important to directly connect to the main Ethereum chain. Nevertheless, Ethereum’s significance has not been eclipsed by Layer 2 growth. Tokens continue to be indispensable in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. In reality, this expansion strengthens Ethereum’s fundamental function while simultaneously increasing its scalability and accessibility.

The 180-day correlation between the two cryptocurrencies has plummeted to a three-year low, falling below 0.5. This change, according to analysts, indicates that Ethereum is now more influenced by its distinctive market dynamics than by the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. The necessity of independently assessing Ether’s potential is increasing as it continues to pursue its own course. Ethereum is demonstrating that it is more than just Bitcoin’s counterpart — it is forging its own path in the crypto world, whether through the adoption of Layer 2 solutions, institutional interest, or increasing ETF activity.

Earlier today, Avocado Onchain, a CryptoQuant analyst, shared his perspective on Bitcoin’s market performance, focusing on the widely-used Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This indicator is often used to assess Bitcoin’s valuation about its realized cap, which represents the aggregated value of all Bitcoin based on its last movement price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits S2F Threshold: Should You Hold Tight Or Take Profits? What Bitcoin MVRV Metric Currently Signals According to Avocado Onchain, the MVRV ratio provides key insights into market cycles. Historically, when the MVRV ratio dips below 1, it signals a market bottom, while values above 3.7 have coincided with potential market tops. As Bitcoin approaches new all-time highs, the MVRV ratio’s behavior suggests a shift in market sentiment from skepticism to optimism. This raises critical questions about how investors should interpret these metrics during a bull cycle. The MVRV ratio, calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s market cap by its realized cap, offers insights into whether the asset is undervalued or overvalued relative to its historical averages. Avocado Onchain emphasized that the ratio might not necessarily reach 3.7 in this cycle, as seen in prior bull markets, but could still signal overvaluation at lower levels. He noted that the ratio’s peaks and troughs have shown a narrowing trend, with higher lows and lower highs. MVRV Historical Patterns Drawing from historical patterns, the CryptoQuant analyst noted: In past cycles, detailed analysis of historical charts shows that in 2017, the MVRV ratio first reached 3.7, but Bitcoin’s price didn’t peak until six months later. Similarly, in 2021, the peak followed about three months after the ratio hit 3.7. Avocado Onchain suggested that while the MVRV ratio signals “overvaluation,” it does not guarantee an imminent price peak. Instead, the ratio often lingers around the overvaluation range, reflecting ongoing bullish sentiment with price fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Officially In Overheated MVRV Zone, Rally End Near? To mitigate risks, Avocado Onchain advises against relying solely on the MVRV ratio for investment decisions. He advocates for a gradual selling strategy as the ratio rises, allowing investors to balance potential gains with reduced exposure to market corrections. The analyst particularly concluded, stating: Asset prices often enter phases of extreme overvaluation that cannot be fully explained by numerical data alone. During a bull market, it’s essential to use not only on-chain metrics but also factors like investor sentiment, macroeconomic trends, and government policies to develop a well-rounded.

Notably, the token had once fallen as low as $8 at the peak of the FTX exchange collapse and the ensuing crypto bear market. Solana Makes Historic Recovery, Eyes USDT Flippening Solana (SOL), the much-touted “Ethereum killer,” is again in the spotlight. After dominating the 2020-21 crypto bull market, the digital asset saw its value plummet after FTX’s spectacular collapse, led by Sam Bankman-Fried. However, SOL has staged an impressive comeback over the last two years. Related Reading: $4,000 Solana Price Possible As SOL Breaks Out Of Massive Cup And Handle Pattern At the time of writing, SOL is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a reported market cap of over $123 billion. The layer-1 blockchain’s market cap is just $8 billion shy of overtaking stablecoin Tether’s (USDT) market cap of $130 billion. Notably, SOL needs a further 10% price appreciation to decisively increase USDT’s market cap and become the third-largest digital asset by market cap. SOL will only trail Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as the third-largest cryptocurrency. Given the token’s recent price trajectory, it won’t be surprising to see SOL surging past the leading stablecoin’s market cap before the end of the year. In the last three weeks alone, the token has experienced a remarkable 75% surge, rising from $148 on November 4 to $259 at the time of writing. While the broader crypto market has gained momentum following the victory of pro-crypto Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump, attributing SOL’s rise solely to this would be disingenuous. Memecoin Frenzy, Increased Network Activity, ETF Potential Helped SOL SOL’s remarkable turnaround can be linked to several factors that have spurred increased network adoption. One of the most prominent contributors is the ongoing memecoin frenzy, which has emerged as a dominant narrative in the crypto market. Related Reading: Solana Memecoin Market Thrives: POPCAT Reaches New Record Price Of $1.75 Memecoins – particularly those based on the Solana blockchain – have emerged as the crypto market’s top narrative over the last year. In October alone, the total market cap of Solana-based memecoins surpassed $10 billion. This memecoin craze has also translated into heightened network activity for Solana. Between September and October, Solana saw a 42% month-over-month (MoM) increase in active addresses, amounting to approximately 123 million. Besides benefitting from the memecoin narrative, Solana has also seen increased decentralized finance (DeFi) activity throughout the year. According to DefiLlama data, Solana is home to the second-largest DeFi ecosystem in the world, with a total value locked (TVL) of $9.265 billion. In addition, there are growing prospects for a Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). A recent report indicates that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is holding active talks with multiple asset managers regarding the potential launch of a new spot Solana ETF. While SOL’s achievement of a new ATH is impressive, experts believe the token still has significant growth potential. At the time of writing, SOL trades at $259, up 6.2% over the past 24 hours.
