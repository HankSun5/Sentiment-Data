35260174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650264,1730154617,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Are ‘ETF Paper Bitcoins’ Suppressing BTC Prices? Analyst Provides Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/etf-paper-bitcoin-suppressing-btc-prices-analyst/,"In a new YouTube video titled “There Is No ETF Paper Bitcoin,” Fred Krueger, an investor at the crypto hedge fund 2718.fund, delved into the growing concerns surrounding US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and their impact on the cryptocurrency’s price. Krueger aimed to dispel the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that have been circulating about “paper Bitcoin”—the notion that ETFs might be selling Bitcoin they do not actually possess—and to explain why Bitcoin’s price has not surged as dramatically as some might expect, despite significant ETF purchases. Krueger began his analysis by acknowledging the prevalent skepticism in the market. “There’s all this paper Bitcoin, and ETFs don’t really have the Bitcoin, and if they were buying all this Bitcoin, how come Bitcoin price is not higher?” he stated, encapsulating the core concerns of many investors. Historically, the concept of “paper Bitcoin” has been associated with exchanges that sold Bitcoin to customers without actually possessing the underlying assets. Krueger highlighted several high-profile instances where this practice led to significant losses for investors. He cited the case of Mt. Gox. Another example he provided was QuadrigaCX, a Canadian exchange that collapsed under mysterious circumstances. Founder Gerald Cotten allegedly died in India, taking with him the private keys to the exchange’s cold wallets, effectively locking away customer funds. “A lot of Canadians lost all their Bitcoin on this Quad exchange,” Krueger noted. Are “ETF Paper Bitcoin” Real? These historical events have contributed to the current apprehension about ETFs and the possibility that they might be engaging in similar practices—selling Bitcoin they do not actually hold, thereby suppressing BTC’s price through artificial supply. However, Krueger argued that ETFs, particularly those managed by established financial institutions, operate under a fundamentally different framework compared to unregulated exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Outlook Confirmed By Critical Data – STH Overheating? Focusing on two leading ETFs—IBIT, the BlackRock ETF, and FBTC, the Fidelity ETF—Krueger emphasized the stringent regulatory oversight governing these entities. “Both of these ETFs are subject to very strict regulatory oversight, including the SEC but also other agencies in the US,” he stated. This comprehensive oversight includes requirements for complete transparency, regular audits, and the use of third-party custodians for asset verification. “They literally have to get a receipt of an asset from a third-party custodian,” Krueger added. In the case of IBIT, Coinbase serves as the third-party custodian. “Coinbase is itself a public company that is audited,” Krueger pointed out, noting that the public nature of Coinbase adds an additional layer of scrutiny and accountability. IBIT conducts audits of Coinbase, and both entities are subject to audits by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. For FBTC, custody is handled by Fidelity Digital Assets, a separate entity within Fidelity that specializes in the custody of digital assets, thereby ensuring specialized oversight and management. “The issuers of IBIT and FBTC are BlackRock and Fidelity, two of the largest and oldest financial institutions, and they have a vested interest in maintaining their reputation,” Krueger asserted. “Their reputation is at stake, and this is a big deal,” he emphasized, suggesting that these institutions would not risk their credibility by engaging in the sale of non-existent Bitcoin. Krueger contrasted BlackRock with entities like QuadrigaCX to underscore the disparity in regulatory compliance and operational scale. “BlackRock is highly regulated BlackRock has a robust corporate governance structure with committees for audit, risk, and compliance and very extensive internal controls,” Krueger added. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $125,000 By Year-End If Trump Wins, Says Standard Chartered Addressing the core concern about ETFs holding “paper Bitcoin,” Krueger provided specific data to refute this notion. “The reality is the ETFs have zero pure paper Bitcoin,” he stated unequivocally. He highlighted that IBIT holds approximately 403,000 actual Bitcoins, while FBTC holds about 185,000 actual Bitcoins. “Together, these two ETFs hold almost 3% of the world’s total Bitcoin, or 588,000 Bitcoins—I think it’s 2.9%,” he calculated. Krueger acknowledged that some skeptics have attempted to analyze Bitcoin movement between specific dates to challenge these holdings. However, he emphasized that the facts are clear and verifiable. “We know how much Bitcoin these ETFs have; we know that it’s accounted for, and that’s a reality,” he insisted. Turning to the question of why Bitcoin’s price has not increased more dramatically despite significant ETF inflows, Krueger offered a nuanced explanation. He noted that Bitcoin is, in fact, up by 60% since the introduction of the ETFs, translating to a $600 billion increase in market capitalization. This growth has been fueled by approximately $20 billion in net inflows into the ETFs, resulting in a price multiplier effect of about 30x. “That’s historically about normal, maybe a little on the low side but not terribly so,” he assessed. Krueger attributed the moderation in Bitcoin’s price growth to substantial selling pressures from various sources. “There’s been a bunch of selling,” he explained. He detailed that Germany sold $3 billion worth of Bitcoin as well as Mt. Gox holdings. Additionally, FTX sold its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) stake earlier in the year, and the Digital Currency Group (DCG) sold assets to resolve lawsuits. “We had a lot of selling,” Krueger summarized. Speculating on the potential impact absent these selling pressures, Krueger suggested that Bitcoin’s price could have been significantly higher. “We probably would be at $90k if there wasn’t any selling,” he posited. At press time, BTC traded at $68,752.

Bitcoin US To The Rest Reserve Ratio Has Seen A Reversal Recently In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the recent trend in the BTC US to The Rest Reserve Ratio. This indicator tells us, as its name suggests, the ratio between the total Bitcoin reserves of the US-based centralized platforms and that of the global ones. Platforms here refer to not just the exchanges, but also other entities like banks and funds. When the value of this metric is rising, it means the asset is currently moving from offshore platforms to American ones. Such a trend can be a sign of demand from the US-based investors. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests the foreign platforms have higher demand for BTC right now as the American exchanges are losing dominance to them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Not Over Yet? This Ratio Has Just Seen A Golden Cross Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the Bitcoin US to The Reserve Ratio over the past year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the 100-day EMA Bitcoin US to The Rest Reserve Ratio had been declining earlier in the year, but during the past couple of months, its value has bottomed out and shown a reversal to the upside. This would mean that a transfer of BTC is now occurring from global platforms to the US-based ones. In the chart, the quant has marked the last instance of the indicator displaying this trend. It would appear that the previous turnaround in the metric had occurred in the last quarter of 2023 and had accompanied a BTC rally that would eventually take the asset to a new all-time high (ATH). The sharpest part of this increase in the indicator had come in the first quarter of 2024. The reason behind this acceleration had been the introduction of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, which had quickly gained popularity among the investors. Related Reading: Dogecoin Surges 16%, But Here’s What DOGE ‘Risk Indicator’ Says About Rally From the graph, it’s also visible, though, that a while after the price had reached the ATH, the metric had topped out and witnessed a reversal in direction. Thus, the spot ETFs couldn’t keep up the same level of interest. The analyst notes that BTC’s sustained consolidation this year can be traced back to this decrease in the reserve of the US-based platforms. Since the indicator has once again shown a turnaround recently, it’s possible that Bitcoin could see the return of bullish momentum, if the previous pattern is to go by. BTC Price Following a 2% jump during the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has returned back to the $68,700 level.

Using the crypto, which is decentralized and peer-to-peer, removes the involvement of third parties, like central banks. This Bitcoin promise has redefined the financial landscape, helped the unbanked, and empowered those who want independence. However, the ecosystem has its share of critics, including central banks. Related Reading: Floki Inu Warning: Analyst Says ‘Prepare For The Crash’ – Details Central banks’ role shrinks as the Bitcoin ecosystem grows and its use cases expand. This prevailing belief is validated by a growing amount of research from financial institutions and central banks that assess Bitcoin’s disruptive nature. The ever-increasing narrative focuses on Bitcoin’s role in promoting inequality and its potential to disrupt central banks’ policies. The Role Of Bitcoin In Distributing Wealth One subject of central banks’ studies highlights Bitcoin’s role in wealth distribution. To help us understand Bitcoin’s role, we look at two papers published by the European Central Bank. The first paper, published after the FTX fiasco in 2022, is titled “Bitcoin’s Last Stand,” which sees the top crypto as a failed monetary project nearing its end. But in 2024, when Bitcoin hit an all-time high, the same researchers filed another study, painting Bitcoin positively. The paper argued that crypto can impact wealth distribution, but only the early holders get richer. Since Bitcoin or crypto use doesn’t produce a product or service, the increased wealth of early adopters comes from the reduced consumption of all other members of society. Does BTC Disrupt Monetary Policies? Other finance-related researches look at Bitcoin’s impact on monetary policies. For example, the Minneapolis Federal Reserve argues that when people can hold and use Bitcoin, it is difficult for the state to run budget deficits regularly. Traditionally, the government can just offer bonds in case there’s a deficit in revenue collection. But governments may only spend what they usually collect if there’s Bitcoin. The study suggests two options: one, to ban Bitcoin’s adoption, and two, to tax this asset. In addition to the Minneapolis paper, an IMF policy paper in 2023 highlighted Bitcoin’s effect on monetary policy. The paper argues that Bitcoin impacts a state’s policy, and emerging markets are most vulnerable. As a solution, the researchers recommend strengthening their monetary policies first before banning Bitcoin. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Stock Hits All-Time High As Bitcoin Blazes Past $67,000 Central Banks, Financial Institutions Now Take Bitcoin Seriously Recent studies and research from central banks indicate that Bitcoin is redefining finance. While these papers don’t mirror the ideas and thinking of policymakers at these institutions, they give us insight into how the industry sees Bitcoin. Some recent policies, including the IMF 2022 Argentina bailout recommendations, include a few anti-cryptocurrency provisions. Bitcoin’s continued popularity is now becoming an obstacle for many central banks in their efforts to create monetary policies. One of the main aims of Bitcoin’s supporters is to offer the public an alternative financing landscape free from the direction, if not, clutches of banks.

Analyzing The Next Steps For The Crypto Leader",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-ready-to-break-through-70000-analyzing-the-next-steps-for-the-crypto-leader/,"As the US presidential election draws near, Bitcoin has briefly surged to the $70,000 mark for the first time in over five months. This milestone coincides with former President Donald Trump leading in polls against Vice President Kamala Harris, setting the stage for potential shifts in the cryptocurrency landscape depending on the election outcome. $70,000 As Key Level For Bitcoin To Surpass March Record The recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price has been bolstered by a rally in the stock market, with analysts noting that investors are increasingly pricing in a potential Trump victory. Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty, indicated that Bitcoin needs to maintain a solid break past $70,000 to build confidence in surpassing its previous record of $73,798 set in March. Trump has positioned himself as a pro-crypto candidate, pledging to make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world. In contrast, Harris has taken a more cautious stance, advocating for a regulatory framework for the industry. Amidst the political backdrop, options traders have ramped up their bets, with many speculating that Bitcoin could reach $80,000 by the end of November, irrespective of who wins the election. Related Reading: Are ‘ETF Paper Bitcoins’ Suppressing BTC Prices? Analyst Provides Answers Implied volatility around Election Day on November 5 has also risen, reflecting the uncertainty in the market. Notably, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen approximately $3.1 billion in net inflows this month, further contributing to the positive sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Concerns Surround Harris’s Stance On Crypto Crypto analyst VirtualBacon recently highlighted the significance of the upcoming election for the cryptocurrency market, dubbing it the “Crypto Election.” Prediction markets currently favor Trump at 60%, although these figures may be skewed due to the crypto community’s historical support for him. National polls indicate a tighter race, with Harris holding a slight lead of just over 1%. The crypto industry has contributed approximately $119 million to campaigns this election year, representing nearly half of all corporate donations. However, major players like Coinbase and Ripple are strategically donating across party lines to promote supportive legislation rather than backing a single candidate. While both Trump and Harris have publicly expressed favorable views on cryptocurrency, their commitments to concrete legislative action remain uncertain. Harris’s regulatory approach raises concerns, as her campaign has emphasized protecting minority investors in digital assets without providing specifics. Moreover, her tenure as Vice President coincided with the appointments of prominent crypto critics such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler, and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. On the other hand, Trump’s evolving views towards cryptocurrency, including the launch of a successful NFT project and a DeFi platform, suggest a warming to the industry. As the election approaches, VirtualBacon suggests that it’s crucial to consider that economic data released post-election will significantly influence market sentiment. The upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in November could provide critical insights into inflation and liquidity, impacting both the broader market and the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. BTC’s Path To $100,000 Despite the speculation surrounding the impact of the presidential election, which is just 7 days away, another analyst, Ali Martinez, noted that over the past eleven years, seven of them have seen massive gains for the market’s leading crypto. As can be seen in the chart provided by Martinez, the average November gain for BTC is a massive 46%, which if the market follows these late patterns, could see a November price of just over $100,000 per coin.

Despite the usual volatility across all crypto assets, including blue-chip meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe, the token is up 215% this year. Raydium Rallying But Traders Must Be Cautious Taking to X, the analyst maintains that RAY will likely continue rallying as long as Pump.fun, the meme coin launchpad on Solana, is token-free. RAY is within a breakout pattern at spot rates, easing past March and July highs and printing a new 2024 high in the process. Related Reading: GOAT Outpaces PEPE Growing To $900M Market Cap In 2 Weeks – Details As it is, not only did buyers force the token above these two major liquidation levels, but it impressively shook off the weakness of August and September, more than doubling from September lows in the process. As crypto sentiment improves, the odds of RAY edging higher for the better part of Q4 2024 will only increase. For now, traders expect the “uptober” to benefit altcoins the most. If Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices tick higher, breaking key resistances in the coming sessions, other quality DeFi tokens, including RAY, will find major tailwinds. Despite the confidence that Q4 of every trading year brings, Bitcoin has been moving sideways, struggling to breach $70,000. If there is an upswing, perhaps triggered by the outcome of the upcoming general election in the United States, RAY could extend gains in the process. Will A Pump.fun Token Slow Down RAY Bulls? The pace at which RAY expands, recouping losses of 2022, will also depend on other market factors, including meme coin activity on Solana. Additionally, traders will determine whether Pump.fun will launch their native utility and governance token. This is crucial because liquid tokens, surpassing the 69 SOL market cap threshold, are automatically listed on Raydium. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run Pump.fun is one of the most active platforms on Solana, aiding the minting of over 2.7 million meme coins on Solana. Due to this, the meme coin launchpad has generated over $152 million in fees, according at Dune Analytics. The eventual launch of a Pump.fun governance token will allow the platform to tap value, taking advantage of its valuation and virality. The team revealed plans to launch their token and a trading bot in a recent Twitter Spaces. As positive as this may be, there is no specific timeline for the token’s launch. A Pump.fun token could attract liquidity away from RAY, possibly dampening the DEX’s growth despite the Pump.fun-Raydium current relationship, investors will find the meme coin launchpad’s token more attractive, especially if it serves a useful purpose and allows holders to participate in governance.

The price must clear the $0.5250 and $0.5320 resistance levels to continue higher. XRP price is correcting losses from the $0.4880 zone. The price is now trading above $0.5200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5150 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5250 resistance zone. XRP Price Struggles To Match Bitcoin’s Surge XRP price started a recovery wave from the $0.4880 zone. It is back above $0.5050 but struggles to match Bitcoin and Ethereum momentum. The bulls were able to push the price above the $0.5150 resistance. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5333 swing high to the $0.4867 low. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5150 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $0.5200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5333 swing high to the $0.4867 low. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5250 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5335 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5350. A clear move above the $0.5350 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance or even $0.5850 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5250 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5150 level. The next major support is near the $0.5085 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5085 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5000 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.4880 zone.

Last week alone, global crypto funds attracted $901 million in net inflows, pushing the total for the month to $3.4 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rebounds Above $67,000 As Whales Continue to Accumulate Bitcoin Dominates Inflows As Ethereum Sees Outflows According to CoinShares, out of the total fund flows recorded, Bitcoin-centric investment products captured the lion’s share of inflows, with $920 million in net additions over the past week. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $997.6 million in net inflows, led largely by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitcoin’s dominance was notable, with blockchain equities and Solana-based products also seeing inflows of $12.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively. However, other Bitcoin-based products, including those outside US markets, faced some net outflows. While Bitcoin maintained strong inflows, Ethereum-based funds recorded net outflows of $34.7 million last week, signaling a decrease in investor interest. CoinShares reported that Ethereum’s price ratio to Bitcoin had fallen to its lowest point since April 2021, which could be contributing to this outflow trend. The data suggests that while Ethereum has seen gains in the past, investors are now focusing more on Bitcoin, possibly anticipating future regulatory clarity and further mainstream adoption with developments like spot ETFs. Regional Trends And Behind The Boom Geographically, US-based crypto funds attracted a substantial $906 million in net inflows last week. In contrast, other regions saw mixed results, with funds based in Sweden, Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong collectively experiencing $29.1 million in net outflows. This difference highlights the United States’ growing role in shaping the global crypto investment market, especially as American firms like BlackRock and Fidelity expand their crypto offerings. According to CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill reveals that the we political climate likely influences the recent Bitcoin price movements and increase in inflows. He noted that Republican gains in the polls correlate with increased interest in Bitcoin investments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stock To Flow Model Shows Price Is Ready For Next Phase Transition Above $100,000 This suggests that market participants may see a shift in political power as favourable to digital assets, potentially driving anticipation of regulatory reforms or even greater crypto acceptance. CoinShares report shows that the October influx represents roughly 12% of assets under management (AUM) in digital asset funds and marks the fourth-largest month for inflows on record. This brings the year-to-date total to $27 billion, almost tripling the previous high of $10.5 billion set in 2021.

As a result, Solana has surpassed the payment platform PayPal in market capitalization, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency. Solana Market Cap Hits $83.56 Billion As of now, Solana’s market capitalization stands at approximately $83.56 billion, reflecting a 2% growth. In contrast, PayPal’s market cap is slightly lower at $83.52 billion, underscoring the growing interest and investment in SOL as it continues to attract attention from investors. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst In terms of trading volume, Solana has seen a remarkable increase of nearly 28% in the last 24 hours, amounting to around $2.76 billion. This contrasts sharply with PayPal, which has averaged $11.66 million in trading volume over the past three months. Despite its recent gains, Solana has faced challenges in breaking through its most important resistance level in the short term at $180, experiencing four unsuccessful attempts within the past week. This struggle has led to a slight retracement of 1% in the last 24 hours, bringing the current trading price to $175.60 per SOL. Potential Upside Breakout From Triangle Pattern Despite any short-term obstacle, crypto analyst CryptoBullet has recently shared a bullish outlook for the Solana price, suggesting that the SOL/BTC trading pair is on the verge of a “big breakout.” According to the analyst, this potential movement could represent the final leg up in Solana’s current market cycle. Previous predictions from CryptoBulltet indicated that Wave 4 of Solana’s price action on the weekly chart has concluded, setting the stage for a breakout from a “massive” triangle pattern, which could lead to new all-time highs. However, while Solana is currently trading between $175 and $179, it remains down nearly 33% from its all-time high of $259, achieved during the 2021 bull market in November. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Says 80-90% Correction Is Over With 100% Jump Imminent Looking at the key support levels, with the current consolidation mode experienced over the past week, the token has found strong support at $170, preventing it from retesting even lower levels, which if breached in the current retracement could take SOL to the $164 area, where its next support level is located. However, given the number of bullish predictions for Solana and the broader market in the final months of the year, especially with the upcoming US elections, if the token manages to break above $180 and consolidate, the next target would be the $200 level, which has not been tested since the start of the last bearish trend at the end of July.

This emerging positivity in BTC’s market indicators comes on the heels of the asset seeing a gradual recovery in price over the past weeks. Earlier today, BTC again came closer to the $70,000 mark with a 24 hour high of $69,217. However, the asset has since retraced with a current trading price of $68,644, up 1.6% in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Positions Face Serious Risk Above $68,500 – Details Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal According to an analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the “Hash Ribbons” indicator has flashed a buy signal, historically aligning with strong long-term performance for BTC. This signal follows an earlier occurrence during the summer, indicating strong prospects for Bitcoin’s growth. The Hash Ribbons indicator tracks shifts in Bitcoin’s hash rate, an important metric that reflects the overall health of the mining ecosystem. As Darkfost explains, this indicator has consistently proven accurate in predicting Bitcoin price rallies, with only one notable exception during the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a unique market disruption. By analyzing Hash Ribbons chart, Darkfost noted: “This suggests that another BTC rally could potentially occur over the middle-term.” Miners’ Position Signals Market Optimism Adding to the bullish outlook, another analyst, Avocado onchain, has pointed out a notable trend in miners’ behavior, which may also contribute to an optimistic price outlook for BTC. Miners play a critical role in Bitcoin’s cyclical market patterns, often influencing price volatility with their buying and selling actions. According to Avocado, miners tend to hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell during periods of price stagnation, which can create favorable conditions for a price surge when demand picks up. Miners Are Betting on a Bitcoin Price Rise “Historically, when the MPI rebounded from a low, #Bitcoin’s price tended to experience significant increases.” – By @avocado_onchain Read more 👇https://t.co/aa9bcHN9XJ pic.twitter.com/8PsOQdBMEl — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 28, 2024 The Miner Position Index (MPI) shows that miners still hold onto their Bitcoin with minimal movement toward exchanges, indicating limited selling pressure from these influential market participants. Historically, a rebound in the MPI has been associated with Bitcoin price increases, suggesting miners are holding onto assets in anticipation of higher prices.

Analyst Ali Martinez has pinpointed this region as the critical threshold that Ethereum will cross before it makes its next significant move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Potential For Monetary Policy Sparks Growing Interest Among Central Banks If this support is sustained, according to Martinez, it shall serve as the catalyst in staging a rally to usher the cryptocurrency to the ambitious target of $6,000. However, things do not seem that smooth ahead as already some market observers and participants have opined that the existing support could break under pressure. #Ethereum is testing a key support zone at $2,400. If this level holds, we might see $ETH aiming for the channel’s upper boundary near $6,000! pic.twitter.com/W8J8WVy5CL — Ali (@ali_charts) October 26, 2024 Ethereum has begun forming a rising channel from July 2023. An ascending channel is a technical pattern in which two parallel trend lines represent the support and resistance level. Recently, the price of Ethereum stayed near the lower edge of this corridor. Martinez believes that Ethereum will rally from here, so everyone’s holding on tight. Important Support And Resistance Zones The ascending channel pattern does not occur by accident. It indicates the probable paths of Ethereum. The trend line acts as a resistance level in the channel, while the trend line at the bottom actually acts as a support level for the price to bounce. The move of Ethereum past $2,600 is also an important retest point that will act as a pivot for its new price target. Martinez believes this is a good risk-reward opportunity for the investor and recommends placing stops at around $2,00 to $2,150. The idea behind these stop-losses is to limit the potential losses, but they also open up upside in case Ethereum moves higher towards the upper trendline. This observation appears somewhat vague, as some analysts are expressing concerns about a potential breakdown at the $2,500 range. However, Martinez has not provided much insight into how this situation could still create favorable conditions for a rally to occur. Indicators Look Positive: On-Chain Data On-chain data shows 70% of Ethereum holders are profitable. Therefore, this positive attitude would be further supported in terms of the level of profitability that reduces the chances of big sellers. When there aren’t strong motives for selling, then an upward movement for Ethereum could easily be expected. Related Reading: Floki Inu Warning: Analyst Says ‘Prepare For The Crash’ – Details Robust Long-Term Projections Meanwhile, the future estimates for Ethereum have room for growth. The current market predictions reveal that Ethereum is trading about 6.5% lower than the predicted target for next month, which also means the asset is underpriced. More positive projections for the long term range from 173% possible returns in a year, according to figures by CoinCheckup. Such growth could probably give a push to Ethereum’s upward movement and form a firmer support base that may encourage price levels to stay high and stabilized.

Cipher Mining's strategic hardware purchases and hosting capacity expansion have made it an appealing stock, with a 67% increase since my December ""buy"" rating. Q3 is expected to show a revenue decline due to increased mining and electricity costs, but Cipher's prudent ""hold-some, sell-some"" Bitcoin strategy aids liquidity. Future success hinges on Bitcoin's price; well-positioned mining stocks like CIFR are poised for growth as the market enters a bull season. While crypto-exposed investors anticipate the post-halving price momentum for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), I believe that analyzing Bitcoin mining stocks and other crypto-related stocks should take more of a bottom-up approach at this stage. A Bitcoin miner that has well navigated the post-halving challenges and shown operational resilience through strategic capacity expansion as well as in its financials would be in a ready position to capitalize on Bitcoin’s momentum. That's why the discussion of the wider crypto market trend will take a back seat in this analysis, and the focus will be more on the granular details of Cipher Mining’s ( CIFR ) operations. Let's not forget that Bitcoin remains the lodestar for the crypto market. Therefore, identifying mining stocks with solid operational and financial footing now could provide an edge as the market heads into the next phase of the cycle. Every Bitcoin Miner has its strengths and weaknesses, as each miner takes a different approach to navigating the volatile crypto business. Cipher Mining's strategic timing in its hardware purchases and hosting capacity expansion made the stock one of the more appealing mining stocks to me, especially during the months leading up to the halving event. In that period, Cipher Mining's net assets also turned positive. This prompted my “buy” rating for the stock in December in an article titled: "" Cipher Mining’s Strategic Planning Will Pay Off ."" The stock is up an impressive 67% since that coverage. And one question is whether there is still fuel in the tank for CIFR? Cipher Mining’s Post-Halving Performance and Q3 Results Expectations As we already know, virtually every miner has seen decreased sales since the halving event. The increase in Bitcoin network difficulty has also raised the cost of mining per BTC, which has taken a toll on operating margins. For Q3, I don’t expect exceptional financial performance for Cipher Mining, beyond striving to maintain operations. Q3 months (July to September) are also typically peak electricity demand months on Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”) electricity grids, where Cipher Mining gets the majority of its electricity power. To balance demand on the grid, a utility strategy called the four coincident peak program (“4CP”) is employed. During these 4CP periods, companies face increased electricity rates. For miners, it becomes important to limit energy consumption during these peak periods to save costs and potentially earn incentives. Based on the factors mentioned above, Cipher Mining will see a sequential decline in total mined BTC in Q3. In Q2, Cipher Mining mined 296 BTC in April, 166 BTC in May, and 176 BTC in June, bringing the total mined BTC to 635 BTC and Q2 total revenue to $36.81 million. 100% of Cipher Mining's revenue currently comes from its BTC mining operations. Though the miner has announced plans to diversify into high-performance computing (“HPC”) services, that hasn't taken off properly yet. For Q3, consensus expects a sequential decrease of 21% in Cipher Mining’s revenue, which will result in $28.81 million in revenue. Analysts expect a loss of $0.07 earnings per share. Using the current total shares outstanding for CIFR at 335.27 million shares with the projected EPS loss, this means Cipher Mining is expected to post a net loss of around $23 million. These estimates and anticipated drop in key financial metrics are well within the context of the reduced operational activity miners experience during 4CP periods in Texas. I, however, expect a slightly higher revenue from that of consensus estimates for Q3 because according to monthly production updates, Cipher Mining mined a total of 493 BTC in Q3. In the July , August , and September operations updates, Cipher Mining produced 178 BTC, 160 BTC, and 155 BTC respectively. I have applied the FASB accounting rule, which most miners have adopted, to the dollar value calculation of Cipher Mining's 493 produced BTC in Q3, where I’d use the monthly closing price of BTC as a fair value estimation for each month’s production. July’s closing price was $64,619. In August, BTC closed at $58,969, while in September, the monthly close was $63,329. This brings the fair value for Bitcoin mined in July to $11.5 million, that of August will be $9.44 million, and September production will be worth $9.82 million. The total dollar value of Bitcoin produced in Q3 based on using the monthly closing price as the fair value price will be $30.76 million. I believe the announced sales result for Q3 will be slightly above the consensus estimates of $28.81 million. Beating consensus estimates will bode well for CIFR as Bitcoin is now trading above $70,000 again, sparking a bull market sentiment. Data by YCharts I think Q3 will see QoQ drop in margins due to the higher cost to mine due to increase In electricity cost in 4CP periods and the increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty. Network difficulty is currently at an all-time high. Cipher Mining's 13.5 EH/s mining capacity EoY target remains feasible. Capacity has increased from 8.7 EH/s at the end of Q2, to 9.3 EH/s as of the September operations update. I believe Cipher Mining is on the path to achieving its 13.5 EH/s hashrate target because of the latest acquisition of the 300-MW Barber Lake site in West Texas, bringing total energy capacity to around 2.5 GW. There will be a drop in Cipher Mining’s asset base as less BTC were mined QoQ in Q3, and Cipher also sold $67.5 million worth of its BTC holding to fund the acquisition of the 300-MW Barber Lake site. About 923 BTC were sold in September, bringing the number of total BTC held to ~1,512 BTC as of the end of September. That would be a 33.4% QoQ drop in BTC held. Despite this drop, ~1512 BTC (around $107 million at today's BTC price) is still enough ongoing dry powder for Cipher. While the drop could raise some short-term liquidity concern if the price of Bitcoin drops further, I think Cipher Mining’s “hold-some, sell-some” approach to its produced and held Bitcoin remains prudent. I believe it helps the team swiftly undertake acquisitions they feel will be accretive without always embarking on ATM offerings, thereby severely diluting shares. This approach provides a balanced mix where the company can effectively manage cash flow and operational needs while still benefiting from BTC’s potential future price appreciation. Data by YCharts The massive jump in outstanding shares we saw in Q2 has not been repeated in Q3. So far in Q4, no additional shares have not been issued yet. However, it's important to keep an eye on the amount paid in stock-based compensations in the upcoming Q3 earnings result, as this could be dilutive too, affecting EPS. Stock-based compensation in Q2 was $13.3 million. If this increases in Q3, it could mean further dilution of shareholder value, and doesn’t bode well for investors. Risks As reiterated in coverage of Bitcoin-exposed stocks on Seeking Alpha, these stocks are tied to Bitcoin’s price movement and market sentiment; therefore, they exhibit a higher volatility just like their anchor asset. As Cipher Mining’s Bitcoin stash has shrunk following the sell-off for the 300-MW facility acquisition, and amidst reduced MoM Bitcoin production , Cipher Mining’s short-term liquidity prowess now leans more on a surge in Bitcoin's price. If BTC fails to impress, there is every likelihood that raising funds through equity issuance would recur, as mining companies face intense costs and typically have shorter cash runways. Takeaway While Q3 is expected to see a decline in revenue and production due to increased mining and electricity costs, CIFR’s latest strategies, like that of the Barber Lake acquisition, positions the miner well for future growth. The company's prudent ""hold-some, sell-some"" strategy with its Bitcoin holdings provides a buffer for short-term liquidity, but investors should remain vigilant about potential dilution from stock-based compensation. Ultimately, the direction of Bitcoin's price will be pivotal to the success of mining stocks, and identifying well-positioned mining stocks like CIFR, and taking long positions, would benefit investors as the Bitcoin market enters the anticipated bull season.",BTC-USD|CIFR,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-29 13:30:47

35285357,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650571,1730210759,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin Triggers Golden Cross: What This Means For The Crypto Trend,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-triggers-golden-cross-what-this-means-for-the-crypto-trend/,"Bitcoin price is now above $70,000 per coin. The recent rally back toward local all-time highs has carried BTCUSD high enough to causes two important moving averages to form a “Golden Cross.” This signal has appeared twice since the bear market bottom and yielded significant results. Let’s take a look at the data and the most recent signal now that it has confirmed. Bitcoin Daily Golden Cross: 50-Day And 200-Day Moving Averages As pictured above, BTCUSD has triggered a daily golden cross of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. In technical analysis, a golden cross happens when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. This typically suggests that there is an actively trending environment and price is expected to appreciate.

The chart above also depicts a death cross in August 2024. However, its appearance didn’t lead to a prolonged downtrend. Could this also mean that this latest golden cross might not produce a sustainable uptrend? BTCUSD Golden Cross And Death Cross Recent History Zooming out provides a more clear picture of the signal’s effectiveness since the bear market bottom in November 2022. BTCUSD rising from bear market lows around $16,000 to $23,000 was enough to pull the 50-day moving average above the 200-day average, triggering the first golden cross of 2023. This kept Bitcoin trending higher until it reached roughly $32,000, then fell to retest lows around $25,000. The bearish short-term price action then triggered a death cross. Here, much like we saw in 2024, Bitcoin trended sideways and avoided a downtrend. It didn’t take much upside to force another golden cross. From that golden cross, BTCUSD rallied another 100%, doubling in price. The chart above shows that the golden cross in October 2024 occurred just months after the death cross, just like it did in late 2024. Could that mean another 100% rally from current levels? If so, Bitcoin price could reach as high as $140,000 before beginning to show weakness. Buy And Hold: Using Moving Average Crosses As A Trading System Using the 50-day and 200-day moving averages as a buy and hold trading system starting from 2018 would have yielded significant results. The first golden cross fired in April 2019 at around $5,000 per BTC. A death cross in October 2019 closed out the trade and sold some coins. A quick golden cross and death cross combo in early 2020 led to a small loss. May 2020’s golden cross more than made up for it, triggering when Bitcoin was trading just below $10,000. The trade stayed open while Bitcoin blasted off into its most bullish trend in recent years and eventually closed with the next death cross in Jun 2021 at around $35,000 per BTC. This kept $25,000 in profit from the trade, combined with the initial $4,000 profit from the early 2019 trade to make $29,000. The small loss takes the total closer to $28,500. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates $3.4 Billion October Crypto Inflows—What’s Behind the Boom? In September 2021, BTCUSD golden crossed again at around $45,000, only to shortly later death cross at $3,000 lower. This death cross stayed active until Bitcoin shed another $30,000. Fortunately, using the two moving averages as a buy and hold trading system meant the death cross moved you to cash – avoiding the worst of the bear market. Come early 2023, Bitcoin was ready to begin a new uptrend and the golden cross triggered at $23,000. A death cross formed at $27,000, keeping another $6,000 worth of profits. Another golden cross in October 2023 triggered at $35,000, riding all the way to $62,000 when the most recent death cross closed out the trade. In six trades total, the 50/200MA trading system would have earned approximately $58,500 as Bitcoin traveled from around $5,000 to $74,000. Four out of the six trades were profitable and the two losses were relatively minor when compared to the profits generated. Tony Severino, CMT is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

Cardano (ADA) is also at a critical juncture, showing striking similarities to its price action in 2020—a year that saw ADA skyrocket by over 4,000% in under 12 months. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst Renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis comparing ADA’s current market structure to November 2020. According to Martinez, ADA’s recent consolidation around key levels could set the stage for a significant upward surge, particularly following the upcoming U.S. election. Martinez’s analysis highlights Cardano’s pattern of explosive growth after periods of accumulation and points to the potential for a strong rally if Bitcoin breaks new highs. Investors are now closely watching ADA’s price movement, eager to see if it can replicate its historic bull run. As the market prepares for a possible shift, Cardano’s performance in the coming weeks could offer insight into broader altcoin momentum in this cycle. The next moves could be decisive, making ADA one to watch in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Cardano Following 2020 Bullish Pattern Cardano has captured the attention of analysts and investors who see its current consolidation as a possible signal of accumulation, hinting at a strong move up ahead. Well-known analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, comparing Cardano’s current price behavior and its pattern in 2020—a year in which ADA experienced an extraordinary 4,000% surge. According to Martinez, Cardano’s price action is displaying a similar setup, suggesting the possibility of a breakout around November 18, roughly two weeks after the U.S. elections. This timeline aligns with historical patterns, where ADA consolidates before explosive upward moves. Martinez’s analysis points to a long-term bullish target of $6.30, representing a potential 2,000% increase from current levels. He anticipates that if it materializes, this rally could lead to a market top for Cardano around September 2025. This prediction is based on ADA’s cyclical price trends, where significant rallies have historically followed periods of low volatility and accumulation, driven by market sentiment and broader crypto adoption. Related Reading: GOAT Outpaces PEPE Growing To $900M Market Cap In 2 Weeks – Details Many investors are now watching ADA closely, as such a rally would not only be significant for Cardano but could signal a broader bullish momentum across altcoins. Cardano’s current price level has attracted a mix of institutional and retail investors seeking opportunities before what could be a substantial move. With both on-chain data and technical indicators supporting a bullish outlook, ADA’s upcoming price action may set the tone for the altcoin market in the coming months. If history repeats, Cardano could be primed for one of its most powerful surges, attracting new interest and capital into the ecosystem. ADA Technical Levels Cardano is trading at $0.346 after experiencing a clear rejection from the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.351. This key level has been pivotal, as a break above it and holding it as support would signal a potential shift toward a short-term uptrend. For bulls aiming to regain control over ADA’s price action, establishing a firm foothold above the 200 EMA is essential, as it would likely attract buying interest and strengthen upward momentum. Additionally, the $0.37 supply zone presents another significant hurdle for ADA, as bulls have struggled to reclaim this level since early October. This resistance zone has repeatedly capped price action, indicating that substantial buying pressure is necessary to break through and sustain gains beyond this mark. A bullish trend could gain traction if ADA breaches the 200 EMA and the $0.37 supply zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Positions Face Serious Risk Above $68,500 – Details However, if these levels remain unclaimed, ADA’s price is likely to continue consolidating sideways in the near term. Such a pattern would allow the market to stabilize and potentially attract fresh demand before attempting another breakout, though it may delay any significant upward movement for ADA.

Taking this into consideration, a crypto analyst has unveiled a new technical pattern in the Dogecoin price chart called the ”Descending Megaphone.” The analyst has suggested that if Dogecoin can break out of this distinct pattern, it could set the stage for a significant rally to higher price targets. Dogecoin Price Eyes $1 Breakout Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) has pointed out that the Dogecoin daily candle has just closed with a breakout into a “Descending Megaphone pattern.” While this unique technical pattern is a sign of increasing volatility especially during a downtrend, a break above the upper boundary of this chat pattern could indicate a potential upward move. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Says 80-90% Correction Is Over With 100% Jump Imminent In the case of Dogecoin, if its price can move beyond the upper line of the Descending Megaphone pattern, it could signal the start of a huge rally. For more clarity, a Descending Megaphone is a bullish chart pattern formed by two diverging trend lines, with the upper line representing the resistance and the lower indicating support. The pattern typically looks like a megaphone with a downward tilt. According to Trader Tardigrade, despite entering this unique chart pattern, the Dogecoin price has been showing signs of strength and momentum on the daily chart. Looking at the meme coin’s daily chart, the analyst has set a price target of $0.2, predicting that Dogecoin could rise to this level as part of its price action within the Descending Megaphone pattern. Trader Tardigrade has shared that he is closely observing how the Dogecoin price behaves within this new pattern formation, paying particular attention to any movement towards the upper boundary of the Descending megaphone. Responding to his bullish predictions, a crypto community member remarked that a $1 price target remains a highly anticipated dream for Dogecoin Trader Tardigrade replied, asserting that this ambitious and coveted price target is no longer a dream for Dogecoin. Bitcoin Price Discovery To Influence DOGE Rally Following his price forecast for Dogecoin, another community member suggested that the Dogecoin price may not reach the $1 target set by Trader Tardigrade without Bitcoin undergoing a price discovery. To this, the analyst simply responded “step by step.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Stock To Flow Model Shows Price Is Ready For Next Phase Transition Above $100,000 The Bitcoin price discovery has been a central topic amongst various crypto analysts in the market lately. Notably, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Crypto Feras’ disclosed that if Bitcoin can break through critical price resistance levels, it could potentially revisit the $72,000, ultimately leading to a price discovery and an immense bullish situation. Considering that a Bitcoin bull run often precedes bullish movements for other cryptocurrencies, Trader Tardigrade has affirmed that after a price discovery, the Dogecoin price could enter a major rally. As of writing, the Dogecoin price was trading at $0.164, marking a staggering 13.72% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.
