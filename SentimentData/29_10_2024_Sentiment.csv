35260174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650264,1730154617,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Are ‘ETF Paper Bitcoins’ Suppressing BTC Prices? Analyst Provides Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/etf-paper-bitcoin-suppressing-btc-prices-analyst/,"In a new YouTube video titled “There Is No ETF Paper Bitcoin,” Fred Krueger, an investor at the crypto hedge fund 2718.fund, delved into the growing concerns surrounding US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and their impact on the cryptocurrency’s price. Krueger aimed to dispel the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that have been circulating about “paper Bitcoin”—the notion that ETFs might be selling Bitcoin they do not actually possess—and to explain why Bitcoin’s price has not surged as dramatically as some might expect, despite significant ETF purchases. Krueger began his analysis by acknowledging the prevalent skepticism in the market. “There’s all this paper Bitcoin, and ETFs don’t really have the Bitcoin, and if they were buying all this Bitcoin, how come Bitcoin price is not higher?” he stated, encapsulating the core concerns of many investors. Historically, the concept of “paper Bitcoin” has been associated with exchanges that sold Bitcoin to customers without actually possessing the underlying assets. Krueger highlighted several high-profile instances where this practice led to significant losses for investors. He cited the case of Mt. Gox. Another example he provided was QuadrigaCX, a Canadian exchange that collapsed under mysterious circumstances. Founder Gerald Cotten allegedly died in India, taking with him the private keys to the exchange’s cold wallets, effectively locking away customer funds. “A lot of Canadians lost all their Bitcoin on this Quad exchange,” Krueger noted. Are “ETF Paper Bitcoin” Real? These historical events have contributed to the current apprehension about ETFs and the possibility that they might be engaging in similar practices—selling Bitcoin they do not actually hold, thereby suppressing BTC’s price through artificial supply. However, Krueger argued that ETFs, particularly those managed by established financial institutions, operate under a fundamentally different framework compared to unregulated exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Outlook Confirmed By Critical Data – STH Overheating? Focusing on two leading ETFs—IBIT, the BlackRock ETF, and FBTC, the Fidelity ETF—Krueger emphasized the stringent regulatory oversight governing these entities. “Both of these ETFs are subject to very strict regulatory oversight, including the SEC but also other agencies in the US,” he stated. This comprehensive oversight includes requirements for complete transparency, regular audits, and the use of third-party custodians for asset verification. “They literally have to get a receipt of an asset from a third-party custodian,” Krueger added. In the case of IBIT, Coinbase serves as the third-party custodian. “Coinbase is itself a public company that is audited,” Krueger pointed out, noting that the public nature of Coinbase adds an additional layer of scrutiny and accountability. IBIT conducts audits of Coinbase, and both entities are subject to audits by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. For FBTC, custody is handled by Fidelity Digital Assets, a separate entity within Fidelity that specializes in the custody of digital assets, thereby ensuring specialized oversight and management. “The issuers of IBIT and FBTC are BlackRock and Fidelity, two of the largest and oldest financial institutions, and they have a vested interest in maintaining their reputation,” Krueger asserted. “Their reputation is at stake, and this is a big deal,” he emphasized, suggesting that these institutions would not risk their credibility by engaging in the sale of non-existent Bitcoin. Krueger contrasted BlackRock with entities like QuadrigaCX to underscore the disparity in regulatory compliance and operational scale. “BlackRock is highly regulated BlackRock has a robust corporate governance structure with committees for audit, risk, and compliance and very extensive internal controls,” Krueger added. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $125,000 By Year-End If Trump Wins, Says Standard Chartered Addressing the core concern about ETFs holding “paper Bitcoin,” Krueger provided specific data to refute this notion. “The reality is the ETFs have zero pure paper Bitcoin,” he stated unequivocally. He highlighted that IBIT holds approximately 403,000 actual Bitcoins, while FBTC holds about 185,000 actual Bitcoins. “Together, these two ETFs hold almost 3% of the world’s total Bitcoin, or 588,000 Bitcoins—I think it’s 2.9%,” he calculated. Krueger acknowledged that some skeptics have attempted to analyze Bitcoin movement between specific dates to challenge these holdings. However, he emphasized that the facts are clear and verifiable. “We know how much Bitcoin these ETFs have; we know that it’s accounted for, and that’s a reality,” he insisted. Turning to the question of why Bitcoin’s price has not increased more dramatically despite significant ETF inflows, Krueger offered a nuanced explanation. He noted that Bitcoin is, in fact, up by 60% since the introduction of the ETFs, translating to a $600 billion increase in market capitalization. This growth has been fueled by approximately $20 billion in net inflows into the ETFs, resulting in a price multiplier effect of about 30x. “That’s historically about normal, maybe a little on the low side but not terribly so,” he assessed. Krueger attributed the moderation in Bitcoin’s price growth to substantial selling pressures from various sources. “There’s been a bunch of selling,” he explained. He detailed that Germany sold $3 billion worth of Bitcoin as well as Mt. Gox holdings. Additionally, FTX sold its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) stake earlier in the year, and the Digital Currency Group (DCG) sold assets to resolve lawsuits. “We had a lot of selling,” Krueger summarized. Speculating on the potential impact absent these selling pressures, Krueger suggested that Bitcoin’s price could have been significantly higher. “We probably would be at $90k if there wasn’t any selling,” he posited. At press time, BTC traded at $68,752.

Bitcoin US To The Rest Reserve Ratio Has Seen A Reversal Recently In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the recent trend in the BTC US to The Rest Reserve Ratio. This indicator tells us, as its name suggests, the ratio between the total Bitcoin reserves of the US-based centralized platforms and that of the global ones. Platforms here refer to not just the exchanges, but also other entities like banks and funds. When the value of this metric is rising, it means the asset is currently moving from offshore platforms to American ones. Such a trend can be a sign of demand from the US-based investors. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests the foreign platforms have higher demand for BTC right now as the American exchanges are losing dominance to them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Not Over Yet? This Ratio Has Just Seen A Golden Cross Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the Bitcoin US to The Reserve Ratio over the past year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the 100-day EMA Bitcoin US to The Rest Reserve Ratio had been declining earlier in the year, but during the past couple of months, its value has bottomed out and shown a reversal to the upside. This would mean that a transfer of BTC is now occurring from global platforms to the US-based ones. In the chart, the quant has marked the last instance of the indicator displaying this trend. It would appear that the previous turnaround in the metric had occurred in the last quarter of 2023 and had accompanied a BTC rally that would eventually take the asset to a new all-time high (ATH). The sharpest part of this increase in the indicator had come in the first quarter of 2024. The reason behind this acceleration had been the introduction of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, which had quickly gained popularity among the investors. Related Reading: Dogecoin Surges 16%, But Here’s What DOGE ‘Risk Indicator’ Says About Rally From the graph, it’s also visible, though, that a while after the price had reached the ATH, the metric had topped out and witnessed a reversal in direction. Thus, the spot ETFs couldn’t keep up the same level of interest. The analyst notes that BTC’s sustained consolidation this year can be traced back to this decrease in the reserve of the US-based platforms. Since the indicator has once again shown a turnaround recently, it’s possible that Bitcoin could see the return of bullish momentum, if the previous pattern is to go by. BTC Price Following a 2% jump during the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has returned back to the $68,700 level.

Using the crypto, which is decentralized and peer-to-peer, removes the involvement of third parties, like central banks. This Bitcoin promise has redefined the financial landscape, helped the unbanked, and empowered those who want independence. However, the ecosystem has its share of critics, including central banks. Related Reading: Floki Inu Warning: Analyst Says ‘Prepare For The Crash’ – Details Central banks’ role shrinks as the Bitcoin ecosystem grows and its use cases expand. This prevailing belief is validated by a growing amount of research from financial institutions and central banks that assess Bitcoin’s disruptive nature. The ever-increasing narrative focuses on Bitcoin’s role in promoting inequality and its potential to disrupt central banks’ policies. The Role Of Bitcoin In Distributing Wealth One subject of central banks’ studies highlights Bitcoin’s role in wealth distribution. To help us understand Bitcoin’s role, we look at two papers published by the European Central Bank. The first paper, published after the FTX fiasco in 2022, is titled “Bitcoin’s Last Stand,” which sees the top crypto as a failed monetary project nearing its end. But in 2024, when Bitcoin hit an all-time high, the same researchers filed another study, painting Bitcoin positively. The paper argued that crypto can impact wealth distribution, but only the early holders get richer. Since Bitcoin or crypto use doesn’t produce a product or service, the increased wealth of early adopters comes from the reduced consumption of all other members of society. Does BTC Disrupt Monetary Policies? Other finance-related researches look at Bitcoin’s impact on monetary policies. For example, the Minneapolis Federal Reserve argues that when people can hold and use Bitcoin, it is difficult for the state to run budget deficits regularly. Traditionally, the government can just offer bonds in case there’s a deficit in revenue collection. But governments may only spend what they usually collect if there’s Bitcoin. The study suggests two options: one, to ban Bitcoin’s adoption, and two, to tax this asset. In addition to the Minneapolis paper, an IMF policy paper in 2023 highlighted Bitcoin’s effect on monetary policy. The paper argues that Bitcoin impacts a state’s policy, and emerging markets are most vulnerable. As a solution, the researchers recommend strengthening their monetary policies first before banning Bitcoin. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Stock Hits All-Time High As Bitcoin Blazes Past $67,000 Central Banks, Financial Institutions Now Take Bitcoin Seriously Recent studies and research from central banks indicate that Bitcoin is redefining finance. While these papers don’t mirror the ideas and thinking of policymakers at these institutions, they give us insight into how the industry sees Bitcoin. Some recent policies, including the IMF 2022 Argentina bailout recommendations, include a few anti-cryptocurrency provisions. Bitcoin’s continued popularity is now becoming an obstacle for many central banks in their efforts to create monetary policies. One of the main aims of Bitcoin’s supporters is to offer the public an alternative financing landscape free from the direction, if not, clutches of banks.

Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty, indicated that Bitcoin needs to maintain a solid break past $70,000 to build confidence in surpassing its previous record of $73,798 set in March. Trump has positioned himself as a pro-crypto candidate, pledging to make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world. In contrast, Harris has taken a more cautious stance, advocating for a regulatory framework for the industry. Amidst the political backdrop, options traders have ramped up their bets, with many speculating that Bitcoin could reach $80,000 by the end of November, irrespective of who wins the election.

Analyst Provides Answers Implied volatility around Election Day on November 5 has also risen, reflecting the uncertainty in the market. Notably, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen approximately $3.1 billion in net inflows this month, further contributing to the positive sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Concerns Surround Harris’s Stance On Crypto Crypto analyst VirtualBacon recently highlighted the significance of the upcoming election for the cryptocurrency market, dubbing it the “Crypto Election.” Prediction markets currently favor Trump at 60%, although these figures may be skewed due to the crypto community’s historical support for him. National polls indicate a tighter race, with Harris holding a slight lead of just over 1%. The crypto industry has contributed approximately $119 million to campaigns this election year, representing nearly half of all corporate donations. However, major players like Coinbase and Ripple are strategically donating across party lines to promote supportive legislation rather than backing a single candidate. While both Trump and Harris have publicly expressed favorable views on cryptocurrency, their commitments to concrete legislative action remain uncertain. Harris’s regulatory approach raises concerns, as her campaign has emphasized protecting minority investors in digital assets without providing specifics. Moreover, her tenure as Vice President coincided with the appointments of prominent crypto critics such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler, and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. On the other hand, Trump’s evolving views towards cryptocurrency, including the launch of a successful NFT project and a DeFi platform, suggest a warming to the industry. As the election approaches, VirtualBacon suggests that it’s crucial to consider that economic data released post-election will significantly influence market sentiment. The upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in November could provide critical insights into inflation and liquidity, impacting both the broader market and the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. BTC’s Path To $100,000 Despite the speculation surrounding the impact of the presidential election, which is just 7 days away, another analyst, Ali Martinez, noted that over the past eleven years, seven of them have seen massive gains for the market’s leading crypto. As can be seen in the chart provided by Martinez, the average November gain for BTC is a massive 46%, which if the market follows these late patterns, could see a November price of just over $100,000 per coin.

Despite the usual volatility across all crypto assets, including blue-chip meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe, the token is up 215% this year. Raydium Rallying But Traders Must Be Cautious Taking to X, the analyst maintains that RAY will likely continue rallying as long as Pump.fun, the meme coin launchpad on Solana, is token-free. RAY is within a breakout pattern at spot rates, easing past March and July highs and printing a new 2024 high in the process. Related Reading: GOAT Outpaces PEPE Growing To $900M Market Cap In 2 Weeks – Details As it is, not only did buyers force the token above these two major liquidation levels, but it impressively shook off the weakness of August and September, more than doubling from September lows in the process. As crypto sentiment improves, the odds of RAY edging higher for the better part of Q4 2024 will only increase. For now, traders expect the “uptober” to benefit altcoins the most. If Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices tick higher, breaking key resistances in the coming sessions, other quality DeFi tokens, including RAY, will find major tailwinds. Despite the confidence that Q4 of every trading year brings, Bitcoin has been moving sideways, struggling to breach $70,000. If there is an upswing, perhaps triggered by the outcome of the upcoming general election in the United States, RAY could extend gains in the process. Will A Pump.fun Token Slow Down RAY Bulls? The pace at which RAY expands, recouping losses of 2022, will also depend on other market factors, including meme coin activity on Solana. Additionally, traders will determine whether Pump.fun will launch their native utility and governance token. This is crucial because liquid tokens, surpassing the 69 SOL market cap threshold, are automatically listed on Raydium. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run Pump.fun is one of the most active platforms on Solana, aiding the minting of over 2.7 million meme coins on Solana. Due to this, the meme coin launchpad has generated over $152 million in fees, according at Dune Analytics. The eventual launch of a Pump.fun governance token will allow the platform to tap value, taking advantage of its valuation and virality. The team revealed plans to launch their token and a trading bot in a recent Twitter Spaces. As positive as this may be, there is no specific timeline for the token’s launch. A Pump.fun token could attract liquidity away from RAY, possibly dampening the DEX’s growth despite the Pump.fun-Raydium current relationship, investors will find the meme coin launchpad’s token more attractive, especially if it serves a useful purpose and allows holders to participate in governance.

There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $2,630 and $2,650 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Starts Steady Increase Ethereum price formed a base above the $2,450 level and started a fresh increase like Bitcoin. ETH climbed above the $2,500 and $2,550 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The price is up over 5% and there was a move above the $2,600 level. A high is formed at $2,630 and the price is showing positive signs. It is holding gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,487 swing low to the $2,630 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,630 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,720. A clear move above the $2,720 resistance might send the price toward the $2,880 resistance. An upside break above the $2,880 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,950 resistance zone. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,595 level. The first major support sits near the $2,550 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,487 swing low to the $2,630 high. A clear move below the $2,550 support might push the price toward $2,520. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,450 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

Last week alone, global crypto funds attracted $901 million in net inflows, pushing the total for the month to $3.4 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rebounds Above $67,000 As Whales Continue to Accumulate Bitcoin Dominates Inflows As Ethereum Sees Outflows According to CoinShares, out of the total fund flows recorded, Bitcoin-centric investment products captured the lion’s share of inflows, with $920 million in net additions over the past week. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $997.6 million in net inflows, led largely by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitcoin’s dominance was notable, with blockchain equities and Solana-based products also seeing inflows of $12.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively. However, other Bitcoin-based products, including those outside US markets, faced some net outflows. While Bitcoin maintained strong inflows, Ethereum-based funds recorded net outflows of $34.7 million last week, signaling a decrease in investor interest. CoinShares reported that Ethereum’s price ratio to Bitcoin had fallen to its lowest point since April 2021, which could be contributing to this outflow trend. The data suggests that while Ethereum has seen gains in the past, investors are now focusing more on Bitcoin, possibly anticipating future regulatory clarity and further mainstream adoption with developments like spot ETFs. Regional Trends And Behind The Boom Geographically, US-based crypto funds attracted a substantial $906 million in net inflows last week. In contrast, other regions saw mixed results, with funds based in Sweden, Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong collectively experiencing $29.1 million in net outflows. This difference highlights the United States’ growing role in shaping the global crypto investment market, especially as American firms like BlackRock and Fidelity expand their crypto offerings. According to CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill reveals that the we political climate likely influences the recent Bitcoin price movements and increase in inflows. He noted that Republican gains in the polls correlate with increased interest in Bitcoin investments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stock To Flow Model Shows Price Is Ready For Next Phase Transition Above $100,000 This suggests that market participants may see a shift in political power as favourable to digital assets, potentially driving anticipation of regulatory reforms or even greater crypto acceptance. CoinShares report shows that the October influx represents roughly 12% of assets under management (AUM) in digital asset funds and marks the fourth-largest month for inflows on record. This brings the year-to-date total to $27 billion, almost tripling the previous high of $10.5 billion set in 2021.

As a result, Solana has surpassed the payment platform PayPal in market capitalization, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency. Solana Market Cap Hits $83.56 Billion As of now, Solana’s market capitalization stands at approximately $83.56 billion, reflecting a 2% growth. In contrast, PayPal’s market cap is slightly lower at $83.52 billion, underscoring the growing interest and investment in SOL as it continues to attract attention from investors. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst In terms of trading volume, Solana has seen a remarkable increase of nearly 28% in the last 24 hours, amounting to around $2.76 billion. This contrasts sharply with PayPal, which has averaged $11.66 million in trading volume over the past three months. Despite its recent gains, Solana has faced challenges in breaking through its most important resistance level in the short term at $180, experiencing four unsuccessful attempts within the past week. This struggle has led to a slight retracement of 1% in the last 24 hours, bringing the current trading price to $175.60 per SOL. Potential Upside Breakout From Triangle Pattern Despite any short-term obstacle, crypto analyst CryptoBullet has recently shared a bullish outlook for the Solana price, suggesting that the SOL/BTC trading pair is on the verge of a “big breakout.” According to the analyst, this potential movement could represent the final leg up in Solana’s current market cycle. Previous predictions from CryptoBulltet indicated that Wave 4 of Solana’s price action on the weekly chart has concluded, setting the stage for a breakout from a “massive” triangle pattern, which could lead to new all-time highs. However, while Solana is currently trading between $175 and $179, it remains down nearly 33% from its all-time high of $259, achieved during the 2021 bull market in November. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Says 80-90% Correction Is Over With 100% Jump Imminent Looking at the key support levels, with the current consolidation mode experienced over the past week, the token has found strong support at $170, preventing it from retesting even lower levels, which if breached in the current retracement could take SOL to the $164 area, where its next support level is located. However, given the number of bullish predictions for Solana and the broader market in the final months of the year, especially with the upcoming US elections, if the token manages to break above $180 and consolidate, the next target would be the $200 level, which has not been tested since the start of the last bearish trend at the end of July.

This emerging positivity in BTC’s market indicators comes on the heels of the asset seeing a gradual recovery in price over the past weeks. Earlier today, BTC again came closer to the $70,000 mark with a 24 hour high of $69,217. However, the asset has since retraced with a current trading price of $68,644, up 1.6% in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Positions Face Serious Risk Above $68,500 – Details Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal According to an analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the “Hash Ribbons” indicator has flashed a buy signal, historically aligning with strong long-term performance for BTC. This signal follows an earlier occurrence during the summer, indicating strong prospects for Bitcoin’s growth. The Hash Ribbons indicator tracks shifts in Bitcoin’s hash rate, an important metric that reflects the overall health of the mining ecosystem. As Darkfost explains, this indicator has consistently proven accurate in predicting Bitcoin price rallies, with only one notable exception during the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a unique market disruption. By analyzing Hash Ribbons chart, Darkfost noted: “This suggests that another BTC rally could potentially occur over the middle-term.” Miners’ Position Signals Market Optimism Adding to the bullish outlook, another analyst, Avocado onchain, has pointed out a notable trend in miners’ behavior, which may also contribute to an optimistic price outlook for BTC. Miners play a critical role in Bitcoin’s cyclical market patterns, often influencing price volatility with their buying and selling actions. According to Avocado, miners tend to hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell during periods of price stagnation, which can create favorable conditions for a price surge when demand picks up. Miners Are Betting on a Bitcoin Price Rise “Historically, when the MPI rebounded from a low, #Bitcoin’s price tended to experience significant increases.” – By @avocado_onchain Read more 👇https://t.co/aa9bcHN9XJ pic.twitter.com/8PsOQdBMEl — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 28, 2024 The Miner Position Index (MPI) shows that miners still hold onto their Bitcoin with minimal movement toward exchanges, indicating limited selling pressure from these influential market participants. Historically, a rebound in the MPI has been associated with Bitcoin price increases, suggesting miners are holding onto assets in anticipation of higher prices.
