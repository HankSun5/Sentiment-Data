Exculpatory Evidence Discovered, Lawyers for Roman Storm Say According to Storm’s counsel , the government has “possessed exculpatory materials” regarding evidence pertinent to the developer’s criminal trial since August 2023. NEW: Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm's attorneys moved to reconsider case dismissal, alleging prosecutors hid exculpatory 2023 FinCEN communications suggesting non-custodial cryptocurrency mixers aren't ""money transmitting businesses."" pic.twitter.com/9LmpyQtkIh — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) May 19, 2025 The defense lawyers claim that the federal prosecutors’ view of Tornado Cash as a “money-transmitting business” goes against their August 2023 statement where FinCEN officials claimed that fellow crypto mixer, Samourai Wallet, does not count as a money transmitter given its non-custodial nature. Given that Tornado Cash is also non-custodial, Storm’s team argues that the government is going against its own stance by indicting the crypto developer . “The disclosures in the Samourai case reveal that the government, at the very least, played fast and loose and, at worst, affirmatively misled this court,” the letter reads. U.S. Prosecutors Defend Their Stance Meanwhile, prosecutors are pushing back on the defense’s claims after Storm’s team expressed “concern about the government’s belated disclosures in the Samourai case” in a May 8 letter. “The Government disclosed all known substantive communications between the prosecution team and FinCEN regarding Samourai Wallet months in advance of pretrial motions and trial,” U.S. prosecutors said in a recent filing. “Indeed, the defendants will have seven months to make use of the information before trial,” they added. “Nothing more is warranted.” U.S. Sees Changing Crypto Regulations The controversial Tornado Cash case comes amid shifting crypto regulations in the United States as President Donald Trump relaxes rulemaking on the blockchain sector . On April 7, the Deputy Attorney General’s Office released a memorandum stating it would, in part, “no longer target virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and offline wallets for the acts of their end users or unwitting violations of regulations.” The post Roman Storm’s Defense Team Accuses U.S. Government Of Withholding Key Exculpatory Evidence appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Crypto mixers|Regulation|tornado cash,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-19 22:40:51

According to sources familiar with the matter cited by Bloomberg, the DOJ’s criminal division in Washington is examining the circumstances surrounding the breach, which has raised serious concerns about cybersecurity within the crypto sector. Coinbase Collaborates With DOJ Amid Major Data Breach Coinbase disclosed that the breach involved criminal actors bribing employees and contractors in India to gain access to sensitive client data. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, stated: We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Importantly, the exchange’s CLO clarified that while Coinbase itself is not under investigation, the DOJ is focused on the criminals involved in the breach. The incident first came to light when Coinbase received an email from an unidentified threat actor on May 11, claiming to possess information about certain customer accounts alongside internal documents. The company anticipates losses ranging from $180 million to $400 million due to the cyberattack. $20 Million Reward Fund After Rejecting Ransom While the attackers managed to steal some data, including names, addresses, and email addresses, the exchange confirmed that login credentials and passwords were not compromised. In a statement on May 15, Coinbase reassured its users via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that it would not succumb to the attackers’ demands. The criminals had requested a ransom of $20 million.

Trading volumes have nearly doubled in the same period, signaling heightened interest as DOGE approached the key $0.23 resistance level. Meanwhile, other leading meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) have also dipped around 4.4%, suggesting the entire sector is gearing up for a bounce as sellers get exhausted. So, is the baseline Dogecoin price prediction still bullish — or does this past week’s dip signal deeper trouble ahead for the top meme coin? Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Forms Bull Flag and Could Rise to $0.35 DOGE’s price action has stalled in the past week after the token reached the $0.25 area as it seems that this is a key level for market participants. The price has dropped to its lowest point in a week already at around $0.21 as momentum indicators were already flashing sell signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) had surged to overbought levels already while the MACD’s histogram had been trending lower for four days in a row. Although the price action still favors a bullish Dogecoin price prediciton, the rally had already reached a point of exhaustion already and justifies a pullback. However, this does not necessarily mean that the uptrend is over. DOGE has formed a bullish flag pattern that could result in a higher high if the price breaks the upper bound of this formation. This resistance currently stands at around $0.23 and it is the key level to watch in the following days. Based on the flag’s pole size, a bullish breakout could push DOGE to $0.35, meaning a potential 52% gain in a relatively short period. Meanwhile, the key support to watch apart from the flag’s lower bound would be the range between $0.18 and $0.19 as a bounce off this level will still maintain the asset’s bullish price structure intact. While DOGE’s outlook may be a bit uncertain at the time, the top crypto presales of the year like Best Wallet (BEST) offer the highest upside potential as their tokens are offered at a heavily discounted price. Best Wallet (BEST) Set to Launch Groundbreaking Web3 Storage Solution – $12.5M Raised and Counting Best Wallet (BEST) is rapidly positioning itself as a game-changer in the crypto space, offering a next-gen wallet that supports assets across 60 blockchains, delivers ultra-low swap fees, and is packed with powerful tools for modern traders.

Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty. Bitcoin ETF inflows are recovering, and analysts predict BTC could reach $110,000–$444,000 in 2025. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is holding above $100,000, leading Fidelity Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer to say the crypto asset could reclaim its position as a leading store-of-value contender. Timmer’s recent analysis highlights a convergence in the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two assets are increasingly comparable in risk-adjusted returns. The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility. The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio. Source: X.com From an allocation standpoint, Timmer recommended a 4:1 gold-to-Bitcoin ratio for a store-of-value hedge, highlighting an intriguing observation. Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!” While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic n ewsletter , pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated, “Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison. Source: X.com Gold, with a 30.33% price gain in 2025 compared to Bitcoin’s 3.84%, benefited from its stability during economic unease. Additionally, the analysis added that Bitcoin performed better as a “high-beta growth asset,” thriving in rising liquidity and fiat debasement environments. Recent developments signal a shift: US trade policy clarity, a softer Federal Reserve stance, and easing financial conditions have spurred steady inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Related: Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs Bitcoin is on track for new highs in 2025 A higher Sharpe ratio is a positive metric for Bitcoin, significantly increasing the probability of reaching new all-time highs above $110,000 in May.

Bitcoin Suisse head of research Dominic Weibei said, “In this environment, Bitcoin has emerged as the Swiss army knife asset. Whether equities rally or bonds crumble, BTC trades on its supply-demand fundamentals, delivering a win-win profile that traditional assets simply can't offer.” Similarly, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin has a ""decent chance"" of reaching $250,000 or more in 2025, driven by its interplay with gold, according to a gold-based forecast. The report uses a scenario-based framework rooted in its gold model to project Bitcoin’s potential revaluation as a non-sovereign hard asset. If Bitcoin’s network value, measured in gold, follows a power curve, and gold maintains its current value, analysts suggest it could hit $444,000 in 2025. However, a more conservative estimate by Bitcoin analyst Apsk32 points to a ""reasonable"" target of $220,000 for the year.

On-chain data shows the number of non-zero SOL addresses recently hit a new all-time high. Solana (SOL) price has regained bullish momentum since early April 2025. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $99.8 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $6 billion, has formed higher highs and higher lows in the past seven weeks, thus signaling a rising trend in the higher timeframe. The rising SOL trend coincides with the Bitcoin price rebound above $100k amid an anticipated reversal of the BTC’e weekly dominance. Furthermore, the rising crypto optimism favors an altseason in the coming months, bolstered by the notable rebound of Ether against BTC . Solana Network Records Mixed Fundamentals The Solana network remains a key player in the DeFi space, mostly in the memecoin ecosystem. The rising adoption of Solana-based memecoins has helped increase the non-zero SOL address in the recent past. According to on-chain data analysis from Glassnode, the number of Solana wallets holding at least 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high (ATH) of 11.16 million. Meanwhile, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on VanEck’s proposed Solana ETF on Monday for further review and consultations. Midterm Expectations for SOL Price After hitting a local target of above $174 in the past two weeks, the SOL price has been trapped in a short-term correction. In the 1-hour timeframe, SOL price has formed a parallel symmetrical falling trend in the past few days. Following Monday’s SOL price rebound from the lower border of the symmetrical falling trend, SOL price is positioned to rally towards the upper border in the coming days. A potential close above the symmetrical falling trend will propel SOL price towards the next short-term target of above $200. However, a further correction, in the coming days, will likely dump SOL price towards the next significant support level above $157.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 23:00:11

As ETH consolidates, Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are all seeing increased liquidity and investor attention, each positioning for the next major move in a shifting market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 40x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace among presales in 2025, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. Analysts are forecasting up to 40x returns before listings, driven by a capped 100 billion token supply, strong branding, and a Hashex audit for security. The project is dominating early-stage dashboards, with traders and analysts alike highlighting its Q3 listing narrative and daily community growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s structure and momentum are making it the top choice for those seeking powerful upside before the next wave of listings. As each stage fills, the entry window narrows, and those recognizing the setup are moving quickly. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Bitcoin: Liquidity Builds as Key Levels Approach Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at approximately $103,405, reflecting a 1.1% decline over the past 24 hours. The market is monitoring support above $100,000, with volatility intensifying after a weekend surge to $106,540. As institutional inflows remain steady, BTC’s price stability is encouraging capital to explore dynamic opportunities, including high-upside altcoins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana: Bullish Patterns and Institutional Optimism Solana (SOL) is priced at $171.54 as of May 19, 2025, consolidating just below resistance after a recent climb. Technical analysts suggest a breakout above $175 could trigger a move toward $200, but for now, some investors are rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper growth while SOL trades sideways. Avalanche: DeFi Growth and Technical Strength Avalanche (AVAX) is trading around $22.58, with analysts forecasting an average of $19.74 for May and a potential peak of $22.58.

Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Kaspa (KAS) continue to gain ground and attract attention, but another name is quickly becoming hard to ignore: BlockDAG. This rising project is shaping a strong case to join the ranks of leading digital currencies. Unlike quick-trending coins, BlockDAG offers practical features, meaningful partnerships, and a tech-driven structure that makes it stand out. Priced at just $0.0020 in its current crypto presale phase, BlockDAG aims for a launch price of $0.05, offering a projected 2,400% return. It may turn out to be one of the top crypto coins in 2025 worth watching. BlockDAG’s Momentum Grows With $255M Raised Recognized as one of the top crypto coins in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised $255 million in its presale while offering BDAG coins at $0.0020 for a limited time. With the launch price confirmed at $0.05, this gives buyers a projected ROI of 2,400%. Batch 28 is already at $0.0262, indicating swift progress through the presale stages. A total of 20.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold, reflecting growing interest. What separates BlockDAG from others is its EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, allowing developers to launch Ethereum-based dApps with ease. It’s tailored for builders seeking seamless usability. BlockDAG also passed a complete CertiK audit and sold over 17,600 mining units. It’s already operational, not just an idea. Five exchanges are confirmed to list BDAG, and 15 more will be announced during the awaited GO LIVE reveal. That’s 20 listings ready to go once trading begins. Those following the top crypto coins in 2025 with early access and a strong system will likely find BlockDAG a top choice. The $0.0020 price will soon be gone once its value becomes more widely recognized. Solana (SOL): Building Through Market Fluctuations Solana has shown it can recover fast. At about $173, it rebounded after news broke of FTX planning to offload $5 billion in assets, including $236 million in unstaked SOL. This raised some selling pressure but didn’t shake Solana’s overall standing. The platform’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) grew from $7.5 billion to $9.6 billion in May. This rise supports its status among the top crypto coins in 2025, especially for those drawn to reliable decentralized finance systems. Dogecoin (DOGE): Community-Driven Meme Coin Dogecoin holds near $0.2271 and is showing serious momentum. After the SEC acknowledged a 21Shares spot Dogecoin ETF filing, its active address count surged by 528%. Futures open interest climbed 70% to $1.65 billion. Many analysts expect DOGE to cross $0.24 and even aim for $0.40 if the trend keeps up. Despite its meme label, its growing use and speculative energy give it a position among the top crypto coins in 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Breaking Out Technically KAS saw a 30% jump over the last week, reaching around $0.1189. A bullish engulfing pattern and strong support at the $0.101 Fibonacci level are helping its case. Short-term goals are pointing toward $0.1554, and community enthusiasm remains high. Kaspa’s appeal includes its speed, low fees, and a solid development team, key traits among top crypto coins in 2025. To Sum Up! Who’s Leading the Pack? Solana continues gaining strength through its growing DeFi activity. Dogecoin earns attention from ETF buzz and user metrics. Kaspa’s upward trend remains intact due to chart setups and a loyal user base. Each is part of the discussion around top crypto coins in 2025. However, BlockDAG is stepping into a leading role. With its $0.0020 presale price and $0.05 confirmed launch value, EVM-compatible tech, solid audit record, and 20 exchange listings in motion, the project shows significant traction. Add the 20.8 billion coins already sold and 17,600 miners distributed, and it becomes clear that this network is well-prepared. For anyone following early-stage coins with real use and fast growth, BlockDAG ranks among the top crypto coins in 2025 that can’t be overlooked. Timing is key before wider attention sends it soaring.

Bitcoin has just recorded its highest-ever weekly close, brushing against its all-time high and sending ripples across the entire market. Confidence is back, and the numbers are loud. Sentiment charts have flipped bullish, daily volumes are climbing, and early adopters are scanning for the top coins to join today. With BTC holding firm, the rising tide could lift more than just legacy tokens—new players like Qubetics are showing signs of becoming serious contenders before even hitting major exchanges. Qubetics ($TICS) is rising as a strong alternative for those who missed out on earlier cycles. Its utility-first approach is putting it at the center of global finance conversations, especially with its recent spotlight on cross-border payments. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash is experiencing a technical comeback, supported by bullish community sentiment, and Filecoin is making headlines by joining forces with Lockheed Martin. These developments aren’t just news—they’re shaping the strategic plays for this quarter. Each of these coins is reacting to the new wave of crypto momentum, but the real edge could lie in knowing where the next breakout might come from. One name continues to come up: Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator with a growing presale narrative. How Qubetics Is Reshaping International Payments With Real-World Utility The growing need for fast, secure, and low-cost global payments is more than a fintech buzzword—it’s a daily operational demand. Qubetics answers this challenge head-on with its near-instant cross-border transaction solution that leverages the TICS token. It’s not just another blockchain tool—it’s built for the institutions and enterprises that fuel global trade. Whether it’s a U.S. startup working with remote developers across Southeast Asia, or a Canadian e-commerce business sourcing goods from Latin America, Qubetics removes the common roadblocks—transaction delays, high fees, and currency friction. For financial institutions, Qubetics brings the blockchain backbone needed to make settlements seamless and transparent. It streamlines fund transfers without needing to rely on outdated rails. Picture a mid-sized U.S. bank facilitating instant remittances for expats sending money to their families in developing economies—Qubetics makes that happen without intermediaries or unnecessary lag. And for everyday users? It’s about sending, spending, and converting digital assets on the go with no headaches. With this kind of practical firepower, Qubetics isn’t just joining the race—it’s changing how it’s run. That’s why it stands among the top coins to join today. Why the Qubetics Presale Stands Out as One of the Top Coins to Join Today The Qubetics presale isn’t your average crypto fundraising story—it’s built with structure, predictability, and real reward potential. Each presale stage lasts exactly seven days, ending every Sunday at 12 AM. And every week without fail, the price rises by 10%. That means early buyers know exactly when their entry window closes. Currently, the presale is in Stage 35 with a token price of $0.2785, over $17.1 million has already been raised, and more than 513 million $TICS tokens have been sold to over 26,700 holders. Now, what makes this one of the top coins to join today is the projected ROI baked into these price points. If $TICS reaches just $1 post-presale, that’s a 258.95% return. If it hits $5, the return jumps to 1,694.74%. At $6, that’s a 2,053.68% increase. A $10 price point after mainnet launch? That would be 3,489.47% ROI. And if Qubetics reaches $15 after launch, that’s a whopping 5,284.21% ROI. Take this for example: a $5,000 investment at today’s Stage 35 price nets you 17,950 $TICS. If $TICS climbs to $10, that stack becomes worth $179,500—with zero need to time the market, because the crypto presale itself is staged for growth. This kind of structure is rare in early crypto. It’s why the Qubetics presale is being tagged by many as the best crypto presale in 2025. For those still weighing their entry, this stage closes in days—not weeks. And with the mainnet dropping in Q2 2025, the clock’s ticking for those waiting on the sidelines. Bitcoin Cash Shows Renewed Energy With Bullish Sentiment Growing Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is picking up serious momentum among community members. As of today, it’s trading around $379.16, showing a daily dip of -5.04%, but the broader sentiment tells a different story. According to Binance’s consensus rating, 35.00% of users are “very bullish” on BCH’s future. Add to that 25% marking it as “bullish” and another 12.5% keeping a neutral stance, the outlook leans overwhelmingly positive. What makes this different from earlier cycles is the clear pattern seen on its technical forecast. The chart shows a post-2024 bounce, with projections heading towards the $450 to $500 zone by 2030 if trends continue. Market participants are reading this as an entry window while prices are still below the 2021 highs. It’s not just a historical bounce—it’s backed by a community that’s recalibrating its outlook amid broader market optimism. These signs aren’t abstract. They’re the same kind of patterns that predate significant rallies—especially when major tokens like Bitcoin are stabilizing near peak highs. BCH may not make flashy headlines every day, but it’s staking its place as one of the top coins to join today based on both sentiment data and upward technical movement. Filecoin’s Partnership With Lockheed Martin Could Redefine Space Data Storage Filecoin just stepped beyond blockchain and straight into aerospace. According to the latest reports, Filecoin has teamed up with Lockheed Martin, aiming to reshape how data is stored and transmitted in space. The partnership aims to leverage decentralized storage infrastructure for space missions—this is no longer just cloud vs. chain—it’s earth vs. orbit. This strategic collaboration brings serious real-world backing to Filecoin’s long-term vision. Lockheed Martin’s involvement speaks volumes about institutional confidence in Filecoin’s tech stack. While traditional storage systems rely on centralized control, this shift to decentralized protocol represents a massive leap toward faster, cheaper, and more secure space communications. And back on Earth, Filecoin’s credibility just skyrocketed. Its use case is no longer confined to Web3 data—this could be the architecture supporting tomorrow’s orbital networks. For community members looking for long-hold projects with government-aligned partnerships, Filecoin just made a serious case as one of the top coins to join today. Weekly Crypto Surge: What It Means for Qubetics, Filecoin, and Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin’s record-breaking weekly close isn’t just technical—it’s psychological. That bullish wave is setting the tone for other altcoins to find their footing and take off. The crypto market thrives on chain reactions, and BTC’s performance often opens doors for adjacent coins that show promise, structure, or real-world partnerships. Qubetics, which is still in its presale phase, offers a rare form of predictability amid all this volatility. With a guaranteed 10% weekly price rise, early buyers aren’t guessing—they’re planning. Bitcoin Cash is benefiting from this upward trend, reviving its bullish sentiment. And Filecoin? The Lockheed Martin deal now rides a tailwind from an increasingly optimistic market. These three are being pulled forward by different forces—but the destination looks the same. They’re not reactionary plays. They’re strategic entries in a market preparing for its next real breakout. Why These Are the Top Coins to Join Today in 2025 Each of these tokens—Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Filecoin—are delivering something different. BCH is riding a technical breakout with backing from a bullish community. Filecoin is proving it’s more than a Web3 storage player—it’s a frontier-tech protocol moving into aerospace. And Qubetics is building a payments solution on-chain that cuts across borders, fees, and friction. But what ties them all together is momentum. With BTC holding near all-time highs, the broader market is heating up. Projects with strong fundamentals, growth structures, and relevant use cases are moving to the front of the line. Qubetics, still in its presale, is being recognized among the top coins to join today, offering a lower-barrier entry with massive upside—especially considering its fixed 10% weekly increase and approaching Q2 2025 mainnet launch. For participants scanning for where to go next, the smart play is to join this best crypto presale while it’s still priced under $0.30—and to keep a close eye on Filecoin and Bitcoin Cash as this cycle unfolds.

Every stage closes on Sunday at 12 AM, with each new stage increasing token price by 10%. What is Filecoin’s role in space data transmission? Filecoin is partnering with Lockheed Martin to create decentralized data storage systems for space, marking a new use case for blockchain.

Per the newspaper Chungnyun Ilbo , experts say that US dollar-based stablecoins could have an impact on exchange rates and fiat currencies. Stablecoin Danger for South Korean Economy? The comments came at a digital assets-themed meeting of the Korea Economic Association at the FKI Tower Conference Center in Yeouido, Seoul, on May 19. The FKI Tower Conference Center in Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea. (Source: FKI TV/YouTube/Screenshot) An expert panel expressed concerns about the possible proliferation of dollar-based stablecoins in South Korea. The panel argued that stablecoin usage would reduce the volume of won-based payments made by both individuals and corporations in South Korea. It also claimed that the central Bank of Korea (BOK) could suffer as a result. The BOK, experts said, could lose the ability to manage money supplies or intervene in the foreign exchange markets. The BOK has made similar statements in recent days , in response to stablecoin-related manifesto pledges from the leading presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung .

Members of his party, the Democratic Party, have also argued that financial regulators – and not the BOK – should have the final say on stablecoin issuance. But others want to use existing stablecoins in their adoption drives. They claim that failing to adopt is hampering Seoul’s tech competitiveness. These advocates favor allowing South Korean firms and payments companies to work with high-cap stablecoins like USDT and USDC . However, Lee Seung-seok, a senior researcher at the Korea Economic Research Institute, warned: “If dollar-based stablecoins become established as a means of payment in South Korea, this could bring about structural changes in the won/dollar exchange rate determination mechanism. Exchange rates could soar due to a drop in KRW demand and an increase in demand for foreign currency.” The researcher added that dollar-based stablecoins allow for rapid capital mobility. He added that their decentralized nature “could result in large-scale capital outflows in the event of a crisis.” The market cap of USDC over the past month. (Source: CoinMarketCap) Kim Hyo-bong, a former Financial Supervisory Service official, said that Washington and Brussels were both likely to launch stablecoin legislation in 2025. Kim said: “South Korea should also make sure it acts in line with global trends.” Kang Tae-soo, a visiting professor at the KAIST Graduate School of Finance and a BOK Monetary Policy Committee member, said that stablecoins offer firms advantages in the payment and settlement spaces. But Kang concurred that stablecoins were difficult to control. He said they could sow uncertainty in the monetary and foreign exchange policy sectors. The academic argued that the BOK and the government needed to ensure adoption drives “minimize side effects and maximize advantages.” However, others warned against the dangers of over-regulation. Namgung Joo-hyun, an Associate Professor of Commercial Law at Sungkyunkwan University, said that the “global digital asset paradigm is rapidly changing.” He said: “We must take steps to ensure South Korea does not end up isolated due to excessive regulations. We need to establish a financial framework that provides both international consistency and industrial competitiveness.” Foreign direct investment in Korea fell four notches in 2024 from a year earlier, ranking 17th among the world’s top 30 economies, data from the Bank of Korea (BOK) showed Sunday. https://t.co/9oKM5UHpu1 pic.twitter.com/TWGwKHda7x — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 18, 2025 A War of Words Meanwhile, the presidential candidates’ stablecoin war of words continues. During the first televised debate between the four leading candidates for the June 3 poll, Lee Jae-myung reiterated his commitment to launching a KRW-pegged coin. But EToday reported that Lee Jun-seok, of the rival Reform Party, challenged the frontrunner on the matter. Lee Jae-myung refuted Lee Jun-seok’s challenge, claiming that “stablecoins based on fiat won collateral are stable.” However, Lee Jun-seok claimed that there were “no use cases” for any sort of stablecoins that use a peg other than the USD. He continued, explaining that USDC and USDT, combined, “account for 90% of the stablecoin market.” Lee Jun-seok asked the frontrunner what measures he would take “to prevent the illegal circulation of stablecoin funds, such as remittances to North Korea.” The post South Korean Experts Warn Seoul of Mounting ‘Stablecoin Danger’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|South Korea|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-19 23:30:00

XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Dominating Whale Accumulation in May",https://thecoinrise.com/final-pre-listing-window-xrp-solana-and-magacoin-finance-are-dominating-whale-accumulation-in-may/,"Introduction May 2025 is witnessing a sharp rotation of capital as whales accumulate select tokens. XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this movement, with on-chain data confirming high-conviction buying. Bitcoin and Hedera (HBAR) remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating 83,100 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. This strategic accumulation is happening as retail investors take profits, signaling growing institutional confidence. As BTC’s momentum steadies, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen whale accumulation surge as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project is audited by Hashex, features a capped 100 billion token supply, and offers scarcity-driven tokenomics. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading around $2.35, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next key resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Solana: Smart Money Bets on a Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading near $171, with whales accumulating over 61,000 SOL in recent months, signaling strong confidence in a potential price surge. Major smart money addresses have returned, making multi-million dollar purchases at current levels. As Solana’s whales build positions, many investors are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for similar early-stage momentum and breakout potential. HBAR: Institutional Interest and Uptrend Potential Hedera (HBAR) is trading at $0.19, with whale accumulation accelerating alongside XRP in early 2025. Analysts highlight the potential for a major rally if current support holds, especially with ETF speculation and institutional flows on the rise. In this environment, many are diversifying into high-upside projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next wave of growth. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Whale accumulation is setting the tone for May, with XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge. With a clear listing roadmap, robust demand, and Stage 8 nearly complete, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the month. The window for entry is closing-and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

Ethereum (ETH) is regaining ground with technical strength, Dogecoin (DOGE) is driven by renewed whale activity and community support, and the Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) is making waves on the back of politically powered news cycles. But for many investors looking beyond headlines, it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that is being quietly discussed as the boldest 50x entry of this crypto cycle. Here’s how these tokens are performing — and why MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly under the radar of early-stage investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A High-Momentum Entry Before Listings Begin MAGACOIN FINANCE gained traction immediately upon launch — and has maintained strong upward momentum ever since. Analysts now cite it as one of the most strategic early-stage altcoins of 2025. With investor demand already climbing, and projections forecasting up to 50x returns , MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious attention before listings have even begun. Its combination of community-first strategy, low initial pricing, and increasing visibility within crypto circles places it at the center of what many are calling 2025’s most compelling altcoin narrative . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Ethereum: Resuming Its Bullish Ascent Post-Pectra Upgrade Ethereum is now trading above $2,500 , with strong indicators following the recent Pectra upgrade , which improved network performance and scalability. Analysts forecast a potential breakout to $3,000 by month’s end, with further targets as high as $5,000–$12,000 into 2025. Institutional adoption, ETF demand, and onchain activity are all aligning to support Ethereum’s continued rise. Dogecoin: Whale Buys Drive Sentiment-Fueled Rally DOGE has rebounded from recent corrections and is building momentum once again. With over 1 billion DOGE scooped up by whales in the past month, the meme leader is showing clear signs of accumulation. Key resistance lies at $0.25–$0.26 , and a confirmed breakout could place DOGE back in a bullish trend similar to early 2021 patterns. Community sentiment and volume remain critical drivers. Official Trump Coin: Volatility Fueled by Political Utility The Official $TRUMP Coin is currently trading around $12.85 , showing signs of stabilization after a wave of volatility triggered by news of a private gala dinner with Donald Trump for top holders. The coin continues to attract politically aligned traders and event-driven speculation. While its current range is tightly bound between $10 and $14, some analysts forecast upside potential if the project sustains attention through real-world integrations and rewards. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Final Thoughts Ethereum is strengthening on the back of technical upgrades and institutional demand. Dogecoin is thriving again with clear signals of large investor accumulation. $TRUMP remains highly event-driven and speculative — tied to a broader cultural and political narrative. Yet among all this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the project many insiders and analysts are watching closest. With early interest mounting and bold ROI projections in the spotlight, it could very well be the standout performer of the 2025 altcoin rally .

XRP is showing short-term bullish momentum, and Chainlink is posting strong technical signals. But away from the spotlight, a lesser-known name, Unstaked, is quietly building a case for future gains. With a current price of $0.009267 and over $6.2 million raised by Stage 13 of its presale, Unstaked blends open metrics, task-based rewards, and a token model that’s drawing early attention. Analysts now say a $1 target by 2027 is not out of reach, placing it firmly in the race as the crypto with the most potential. While XRP and Chainlink continue their recovery, Unstaked is focused on building a system from the ground up. In a market leaning more toward fundamentals, that approach could make all the difference. XRP in Short-Term Rally: Price May Hit $5.50 in Under 2 Months XRP has seen a rebound in recent weeks. After reaching a yearly high of $3.40 in January, it dropped to $1.60 before climbing back above $2. Many analysts see this range as a setup for a larger breakout. Elliott Wave analyst XForceGlobal forecasts a move to $5.40 or $5.50 in the next 50 days, based on a pattern often followed by strong third-wave surges. This technical view is backed by recent events, like Ripple’s SEC settlement and the rising odds of a Spot XRP ETF approval, now estimated at over 75%. Still, some remain cautious. XRP’s short-term rally relies heavily on strong institutional use, which may take time to build. Because of this, some traders are also exploring early-stage projects with faster upside. Chainlink’s Bullish Signs Are Building, But Growth Remains Gradual Chainlink (LINK) is showing key signs of recovery after a long dip. At $17.27, LINK has gained 70% since its April low of $10.21 and is now above its 50-day average. Analysts point to several positive chart setups, including an inverse head-and-shoulders and a broadening pattern on the 4-hour chart. Open interest has doubled to $768 million, and funding rates have held positive for more than a week. These are strong signs of increased long positions and rising trader interest. Chainlink has also seen real progress, adding 12 new integrations across eight chains and becoming an official provider for BNB Chain’s Kickstart Program. These steps show growing demand and usage. Yet despite these Chainlink bullish signs, its price is still below this year’s high of $27.30. While the climb continues, it’s slower than what some are looking for. That’s why early-stage tokens gaining momentum are drawing more attention now. Unstaked Aims for $1 by 2027 with Task-Based Rewards While big-name tokens dominate the news, Unstaked is steadily gaining momentum and funding. Now priced at $0.009267, the project has already collected more than $6.2 million by Stage 13 of its presale, showing growing support from early participants. Unstaked works through a Proof of Intelligence model where rewards come from actions, input, and real user involvement. That means users earn for what they do instead of just holding. It’s a system based on verified results, made for long-term scaling and built around real activity. One of its strong points is liquidity support, built through structured presale phases and clear token planning. This helps make sure that once Unstaked reaches exchanges, there will be volume and depth, limiting price swings and slippage. The team has also launched a $1 million Gleam contest, giving 20 winners a $50,000 prize each. Entry requires task completion and a minimum of $100 in UNSD holdings. This approach brings new users and encourages real money to enter the system. With clear goals, useful features, and a working reward system, Unstaked is moving forward without relying on hype. Its structure and plans support its position as a top pick for long-term growth, including a possible $1 value by 2027. Given its confirmed launch price of $0.1819, early buyers are eyeing up to 27x returns before future gains are even counted. Final Say As crypto starts to rise again, the line between fast movement and real utility is more visible than ever. XRP shows strong short-term potential backed by ETF buzz and better legal footing. Chainlink (LINK) shows positive signs in its network, though its progress is steady rather than fast. At the same time, Unstaked is doing something else. It’s creating a full ecosystem that includes utility, clear rewards, and working tools. With $6.2 million already raised in crypto presale , a $1 million Gleam campaign in progress, and a reward model in place, the platform is already running on measurable results. For those looking at the crypto with the most potential, it might not be the most familiar name that takes the lead. It may be the one already proving its use at an early price. At $0.009267, Unstaked is one of the rare low-cost options already showing clear signs of delivery.

Bitcoin is reclaiming dominance, Ethereum is surging to new highs, and investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE-a rising altcoin that could become this year’s biggest early-stage win. With XRP, TON, and Solana also attracting capital, the altcoin market is entering a new phase of speculation and aggressive positioning. The big question now: Could these tokens deliver the next 15,000% run-up? Let’s break down the leaders that are capturing analysts’ attention right now-and the altcoin that’s turning heads as its listing nears. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Bitcoin Eyes $250,000 as Institutional Demand Accelerates Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $103,405, consolidating after a volatile weekend but holding above key support. Analysts from Unchained and Changelly forecast a possible run to $250,000 by year-end 2025, with an average price prediction for May around $120,555. Institutional inflows, ETF adoption, and a maturing macro backdrop are fueling bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes, capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where early-stage entries offer the potential for exponential returns. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing major attention in 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% potential returns, with some calling a $1 target by year-end “not out of reach” given current momentum. MAGA’s capped supply of 100 billion tokens (45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and unique political meme appeal are driving rapid community growth and early-stage investor participation. Key highlights : Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion token cap, 45% in presale HashEx-audited contracts and strong grassroots momentum Analysts forecast 35x–185x returns, with $1 as a stretch target As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity-one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with a more transparent structure and scarcity-driven upside. Analysts say a 35x surge looks conservative, with 50x or even 150x possible if current trends continue. Ethereum’s Bullish Breakout and Layer-2 Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators are bullish, with ETH breaking above its 50-day EMA and forming a classic bull flag pattern. If ETH can close above the $2,700 resistance, analysts see a move to $2,750–$2,900 in May and a year-end target between $4,392 and $5,925. Institutional adoption, DeFi growth, and Layer-2 upgrades are all strengthening ETH’s long-term outlook. As Ethereum’s rally matures, some investors are rotating capital into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. XRP: Institutional Flows and Bullish Projections XRP is trading at $2.33 and attracting whale accumulation, with over 880 million tokens acquired by large holders in May. Analysts expect a breakout to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end, with long-term targets as high as $12.50 if ETF approvals and global adoption accelerate. While XRP’s setup is strong, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns remains open. Toncoin and Solana: Quiet Strength and Technical Upside Toncoin (TON) is trading near $2.84, with forecasts for 2025 ranging from $2.77 to $2.96 and technical analysis pointing to steady growth as adoption increases. Solana (SOL) is holding at $172, consolidating after its 80% rally from recent lows, with analysts targeting $250–$400 as the next major resistance zone. As both TON and SOL maintain bullish structures, investors are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for the kind of early-stage momentum that can deliver outsized gains. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts Between Bitcoin’s ETF-driven surge, Ethereum’s bullish breakout, and the institutional momentum behind XRP, TON, and Solana, the next crypto cycle is already taking shape. But among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only early-stage entry still offering ground-floor potential and 15,000% upside. With a clear listing roadmap, robust investor demand, and Stage 8 nearing closure, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the best shot at a 25x–35x return in 2025. The opportunity is narrowing-and smart investors are already taking notice.

The Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction points toward $0.35, as Stellar gears up to bring $3 billion in real-world assets on-chain. Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) breakout news has traders buzzing after a 680% surge in daily users and $100 targets enter the chat. But if you’re hunting for the best new crypto to buy , there’s a different name stealing the spotlight, Web3 ai . This isn’t just a headline grabber. Web3 ai is already rolling out cross-chain AI utilities like trading bots, fraud detection, and DeFi analysis, all powered by its native token, $WAI. The presale price? Still just $0.000365. Early buyers got in at $0.0003, and analysts are calling the jump to $1 a realistic next step. With working tech and deep crypto integration, this is exactly what traders are racing to lock in. $WAI at $0.000365: Why Smart Money Is Rushing Into Web3 ai Web3 ai isn’t waiting around. It’s already shipping real products. While others pitch empty promises, this project has 12 live AI tools in development, built for everyday and pro users alike. Arbitrage bots, rebalancing engines, scam trackers, and alpha-generating signals, $WAI powers them all. Currently in stage 5 of a 50-stage presale, $WAI is selling for $0.000365. Stage 1 was priced at $0.0003, and the token will list at $0.005242. With $4.2 million already raised, it’s clear that momentum is building fast. The numbers say it all: a run from $0.000365 to $1 could turn early entries into massive wins. What separates Web3 ai from the pack? It’s delivering from day one. No waiting, no delays, just real AI tools ready to go. If you’ve been wondering what the best new crypto to buy looks like, this is the one analysts can’t ignore. It has the product, the price point, and the upside, all mapped out. Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction Looks Strong With RWA Momentum The Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction has turned bullish after a 50% bounce from April’s lows, now hovering around $0.30. Targets vary from $0.25 to $0.39, with some models even pointing to $0.88, driven by Stellar’s massive 2025 plan to bring $3 billion in real-world assets to its blockchain. With new support from Paxos, SG Forge, and Mastercard’s Crypto Credential network, Stellar is doubling down on cross-border payments and institutional adoption. Technical signs show a breakout forming, with resistance near $0.357. Still, how fast the Stellar Development Foundation executes will determine whether the next leg higher happens. For now, interest in Stellar is climbing alongside network upgrades. Avalanche (AVAX) Breakout News Sparks Bullish Sentiment The latest Avalanche (AVAX) breakout news is grabbing attention after AVAX hit $24.38 and daily users exploded by over 680% in just a month. A fresh $250 million funding round is fueling growth, while developers rush in with renewed interest. Analysts are eyeing a short-term cap at $30, with long-range targets stretching toward $100. AVAX is shaking off its corrective phase and entering a bullish structure. Support sits near $21, and daily stablecoin volumes are above $1.3 billion, showing serious liquidity. If Avalanche keeps this pace, its user base and token value could push it back into the top 10. Add platform upgrades this quarter, and AVAX is shaping up as a major contender again. Wrapping Up! Both the Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction and Avalanche (AVAX) breakout news have given traders reasons to stay bullish. But what analysts are really watching now is Web3 ai. At $0.000365 in stage 5 and a launch price of $0.005242, this AI-powered platform already raised $4.2 million and is gaining speed. This isn’t just a presale, it’s a project with working products, multi-chain access, and a token that powers real functionality. That’s why investors aren’t waiting. With every stage, the price rises, and the FOMO only gets stronger. For anyone tracking the best new crypto to buy , Web3 ai looks like the one you don’t want to miss.

Current Bitcoin Rally Not Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktakes post by contributor avocado_onchain, last year’s BTC bull cycle – which saw the leading cryptocurrency create and break multiple all-time highs (ATHs) – was accompanied by sharp spikes in Binance market buy volume and funding rates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stochastic RSI Signals Brewing Bullish Momentum – ATH Incoming? Notably, a sudden increase in funding rates was twice followed by a sharp price pullback due to overheating. In this context, overheating refers to excessive bullish leverage in futures markets that drives up the cost of long positions, signalling overly aggressive sentiment that often precedes a market correction. The following chart illustrates these corrections triggered by excessive leverage in BTC futures. Specifically, boxes 1 and 2 show sharp rises in Binance funding rates, initially accompanied by price increases, then extended periods of correction. However, the current rally appears different. According to avocado_onchain, Bitcoin’s ongoing rebound is occurring without an overheated funding rate. In fact, Binance market buy volume is trending downward – as shown in box 3 of the chart – which contrasts with previous bull cycles. The analyst argues that these are signs of a healthier rally, as earlier bull runs were marked by overheated funding rates and abrupt corrections, which weakened investor sentiment. In contrast, the current rally has maintained relatively stable funding rates, suggesting more cautious and sustainable market behavior. Despite short-term price fluctuations, market buy volume has shown a steady upward trend since 2023, as marked by the yellow arrow in the chart. The analyst notes: This indicates that buying sentiment remains favorable for further upside, suggesting that it’s not yet time to consider an exit. We can’t predict exactly when Bitcoin will break its previous high, but current on-chain and market data signals remain very constructive. Other Indicators Point Toward New ATH Besides the stable funding rates and encouraging market buy volumes, BTC is also showing several other positive signs pointing toward a new ATH for the flagship digital asset in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says For example, on-chain data shows that long-term holders are not selling, even as BTC trades near its previous ATH of $108,786, recorded in January. This behavior suggests that these investors anticipate further upside. That said, analysts caution against overly optimistic expectations, noting that Bitcoin may still be far from experiencing a true supply shock. At press time, BTC is trading at $102,393, down 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

While on a trip to Washington, D.C., where he advocates for balanced and inclusive digital asset regulations, Garlinghouse expressed disappointment on X (formerly Twitter). “I hope you will reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” Garlinghouse wrote, inviting Senator Lummis to join him for a public discussion via X Spaces or a live event . He stressed the importance of supporting all blockchain networks—not just Bitcoin—especially given Lummis chairs the Senate Digital Assets Subcommittee and represents Wyoming, a state known for its crypto-friendly stance. Crypto community divides as Garlinghouse challenges Senator Lummis’s Bitcoin-only focus Garlinghouse’s remarks underscore continuing fears that Bitcoin is making other digital assets and the firms that help develop blockchain technology obsolete. The scrapped meeting drew reactions from members of the crypto community. Some accused the Senator of being biased and expressed frustration over her stance. On X, user @DarkScarf89 expressed curiosity as to why the Senator had refused a meeting, pointing to a divergence in support of a level playing field that might not quite match the Bitcoin-only narrative. Bitcoin maximalists, however, lauded Lummis. Troy Cross thanked her “for fighting against the scammers,” a move that could suggest skepticism toward Ripple and its XRP token. This conversation illustrates the friction that exists between Bitcoin maximalists and proponents of a wider, more welcoming regulatory strategy. Industry participants increasingly demand models that apply to all digital assets, not only Bitcoin. The scandal has done little to waver Senator Lummis’ love for Bitcoin. She has advocated that Americans consider Bitcoin a long-term investment , a hedge against inflation, and a weakening U.S. dollar. “I encourage people to save Bitcoin for their retirement, for their future,” Lummis recently stated. Her strong Bitcoin focus has earned both praise from the Bitcoin community and criticism from other parts of the crypto ecosystem. Nonetheless, Lummis has worked collaboratively on crypto legislation beyond Bitcoin. She and Senator Bernie Moreno co-introduced a bill to improve digital asset tax treatment. They expressed frustration over the bipartisan GENIUS Act’s failure to pass—a bill designed to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. CME XRP futures ignite demand for Spot ETF approval and regulatory clarity Today’s launch of CME XRP futures shifts attention to the pending approval of a spot XRP ETF. With futures trading attracting institutional interest, regulatory clarity on XRP-related products is increasingly urgent. Garlinghouse previously expressed optimism that a spot XRP ETF could be approved by the end of 2025, especially following the conclusion of Ripple’s legal dispute with the SEC. Meanwhile, analysts like Fred Rispoli note XRP’s potential role in a proposed digital asset reserve outlined in a Trump-era executive order, adding another layer of complexity to XRP’s regulatory outlook. Garlinghouse backs pro-crypto legislation as Senate prepares to debate stablecoin bill Ripple CEO told his followers on X that he was heading to Washington to support what he called “sensible pro-crypto” legislation focused on stablecoins and market structure. He said he was encouraged to see lawmakers recognizing crypto as a multichain industry “as it should be.” Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin. They are typically pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar or commodities like gold. On December 17, 2024, Ripple launched its own stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). Senator Cynthia Lummis, a well-known crypto advocate, previously introduced the BITCOIN Act, which proposes creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. She recently said senators have agreed on the final wording of new Senate stablecoin legislation and expects the bill to reach the floor next week. The bill in question is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. Introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), it is co-sponsored by Senators Lummis, Tim Scott (R-SC), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The GENIUS bill has faced roadblocks — most notably due to Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), opposing it — owing to President Donald Trump-linked USD1 stablecoin .

ADA price has signaled bullish sentiment catalyzed by increased adoption from institutional investors. Cardano (ADA) price has moved in tandem with the wider altcoin market, amid anticipated altseason. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of $33 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $854 million, dropped around 10 percent in the past seven days to trade about $0.74 on Monday, during the late-North American trading session. Nonetheless, ADA price has been in a recovery mode in the past few weeks akin to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Moreover, on-chain data analysis shows an increased capital inflow to crypto investment products, fueled by the geo-political and economic uncertainty. Cardano Founder Under Scrutiny for Fraud Claims The Cardano network has found itself between thin ice as some on-chain analysis suggests a trust-misuse by founder Charles Hoskinson. According to Masato Alexander, an NFT artist, Hoskinson manipulated the Cardano network, during the 2021 Allegra hard fork, to seize control of 318 million ADA coins. Alexander noted that Hoskinson defrauded early investors by using Genesis keys to rewrite the Cardano ledger, by redirecting unclaimed tokens from the 2017 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) into Cardano’s reserves without community approval. “From the data we have, we know that a significant sum, totaling 318,200,635,000,000 Lovelace, which translates to 318,200,635 ADA, departed from our active set. These UTxOs, residing in 465 distinct addresses, played their part, however brief or long, in the immutable story of Cardano,” Alexander noted . Although the top Cardano team has denied the allegations including Hoskinson, an on-chain investigation is expected to be conducted in the coming weeks. Mid-term Expectations for ADA Price In the daily timeframe, ADA price has established a rising trend in the past few weeks. After breaking out of a macro-falling wedge pattern in April, ADA price has gradually gained bullish momentum characterized by higher highs and higher lows. In the four-hour time frame, ADA price has formed a falling symmetrical parallel channel, likely a continuation pattern. A consistent close above the upper border of the falling channel will set the precedent of a fresh rally towards the short term target about $1.14.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|FORKS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 00:15:24

Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19. Alpenglow consists of Votor, which processes voting transactions and block finalization logic, and Rotor, a data dissemination protocol that would replace Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping system and aim to reduce the time it takes for all nodes to agree on the network state. Source: Anza Anza researchers claimed that “Alpenglow will shatter both these latency bounds” and the project expects it to reach actual finality in about 150 milliseconds, rivaling internet infrastructure . “A median latency of 150 [milliseconds] does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance.” Votor — which would replace TowerBFT — would aim to finalize blocks in a single round if 80% of the stake is participating, and in two rounds if only 60% of the stake is responsive. Related: DeFi lender Aave reaches $40B in value locked onchain These two voting modes are integrated and run concurrently, with finalization taking place as soon as the faster of the two paths terminates. Anza’s researchers claimed this model would result in “unprecedented finalization latency” while enabling it to operate more effectively under “harsh network conditions.” Alpenglow won’t fix Solana’s network outages The project’s white paper noted that switching to Alpenglow wouldn’t completely shield Solana from the network outages that it has experienced in the past. Solana currently only has one production-ready client, Agave, meaning any security vulnerability in Agave can disrupt the entire Solana network. However, a new independent validator client called Firedancer is set to launch on Solana’s mainnet sometime this year, which will provide client diversification for the network.

And for those watching closely, it’s starting to feel like we’ve seen this story before. A Look Back: When ADA, SHIB, and DOGE Shocked the Market Cardano (ADA) wasn’t always a top-tier altcoin. It had spent years trading under the radar before smart contract capabilities were introduced through the Alonzo hard fork in September 2021. Around that time, ADA had surged to an all-time high of $3.10, driven by developer activity and ecosystem growth. That move placed Cardano squarely in the spotlight. Shiba Inu (SHIB), on the other hand, rose to fame in record time. Its price had skyrocketed by over 1,000% within weeks in 2021. Initially dismissed as another meme token, SHIB drew in a wave of investors and reached a peak of $0.000090. That rally showcased how quickly retail attention could turn into real momentum. Dogecoin (DOGE) followed a similar arc. In 2021, DOGE was propelled by social media and celebrity endorsements. One week in April saw the price jump more than 400%, and by May, it had reached $0.74—its all-time high. Despite being a joke coin at launch, DOGE’s community and visibility helped it carve out a lasting presence in the market. Each of these assets shared a common theme: they started from modest beginnings and reached massive valuations, fueled by a mix of community, development, and market timing. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized platform built on blockchain technology, designed to provide non-custodial lending and borrowing solutions. Its model empowers users to supply digital assets, earn passive income through mtTokens, or access liquidity by borrowing against their holdings—all while retaining control of their assets. The protocol is also building an overcollateralized stablecoin, backed entirely by assets deposited within Mutuum, providing users with a decentralized and transparent alternative to centralized stablecoins. Additionally, a Layer 2 solution is in development to improve transaction speed and significantly reduce gas fees, making the platform scalable and more accessible to a wide range of users. MUTM is now available at a price of $0.025 during the ongoing Phase 4 of its presale. Over 88% of this round has already sold, and the project has now raised over $8.6 million, with more than 10,000 holders on record. Once Phase 4 ends, the price will rise by 20% to $0.03, followed by a confirmed listing at $0.06. This structured pricing is drawing attention from early investors looking to get in before the next wave of exposure. These strong presale numbers, paired with increasing wallet adoption, signal growing confidence in MUTM’s fundamentals. Could MUTM Follow a Similar Path? While ADA had utility, SHIB had virality, and DOGE had community, MUTM is entering with real-world financial use cases, early development, and a clear path toward long-term sustainability. The upcoming beta platform launch, which is planned to go live shortly after token listing, will include lending, borrowing, and real-time mtToken integration—delivering functionality from day one. Unlike many projects that inflate supply through token printing, Mutuum uses a portion of its platform fees to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to active participants, creating natural demand and supporting token value. For those asking what crypto to buy now or searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in, MUTM presents a compelling mix of affordability, utility, and momentum—key components that fueled the rise of its predecessors. Experts are already forecasting that, based on utility, adoption, and tokenomics, MUTM has the potential to reach up to $7 over the long term. This projection is based on the layered value system being built—including mtTokens, the stablecoin framework, Layer 2 functionality, and a growing holder base. At the current price of $0.025, a simple investment of $800 would translate to a 280x return, or $224,000, when MUTM hits the projected $7 benchmark. This kind of upside is exactly what early investors are looking for—not just explosive short-term gains, but a token that can mature and hold value over time. MUTM is still early, but all the signals point to something much bigger in the making. The protocol is delivering features, the presale is gaining serious traction, and utility is already being built—not promised. With ADA, SHIB, and DOGE all rising from obscurity to dominance, MUTM may be the next to follow. And with prices set to increase in the next phase, the window to secure an early position is closing quickly.

This has attracted both developers and investors to its platform. But as Solana innovates in blockchain infrastructure, another project Ruvi AI is charting its own path by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain. Ruvi AI solves real problems in critical industries and opens up new opportunities for investors. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI is a platform that brings together AI’s ability to process vast amounts of data and blockchain’s transparency and security. It provides solutions for industries such as healthcare, finance and logistics. By using AI, Ruvi AI can identify trends, improve decision making and make operations more efficient. Blockchain ensures these improvements come with transparency and trust. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its tangible progress. The launch of its Beta platform allows you to try it out and see how it solves real world problems. By delivering results instead of promises, Ruvi AI is a project you can bank on. Presale Success Paves the Way for Growth Ruvi AI has already proven to be attractive to investors. In Phase 1 tokens were sold for $0.01 each. The phase sold out in 2 weeks and those who participated early have already seen their investment grow 50% as the token price has risen to $0.015 in Phase 2 . Market predictions suggest even more growth for Ruvi AI with the token expected to reach $1 shortly after listing on major exchanges. Early participants not only get bonuses but will also benefit as the project grows. Ruvi AI’s Commitment to Investors Ruvi AI has introduced a VIP rewards system to reward participants based on the amount of tokens they accumulate during the presale. The system adds bonuses to your initial holding, giving you even more opportunities to grow. Here’s how it works: VIP Tier 2 To accumulate 50,000 tokens you need to invest $750 at $0.015 token price. As a VIP Tier 2 you will get 40% bonus and get 20,000 tokens more, so your total will be 70,000 tokens .At $0.07 listing price these tokens will be worth $4,900 , 553% ROI. If the token reaches $1 your holdings will be $70,000 , 9,233% ROI. VIP Tier 3 To accumulate 100,000 tokens you need to invest $1,500 . As a VIP Tier 3 you will get 60% bonus and get 60,000 tokens more, so your total will be 160,000 tokens . At $0.07 listing price the tokens will be worth $11,200 , 1,020% ROI. If the token price reaches $1 your investment will be $160,000 , 10,567% ROI. VIP Tier 5 To get 500,000 tokens you need to invest $7,500 . As a VIP Tier 5 your holdings will be doubled with 100% bonus and you will have 1,000,000 tokens . At $0.07 listing price the tokens will be worth $70,000 , 833% ROI. If the token hits $1 the investment will be $1,000,000 , 12,233% ROI. These examples show how important it is to accumulate tokens early to get the full benefits of Ruvi AI’s rewards and growth. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Participants Ruvi AI also rewards its most active contributors through leaderboard rewards. The top investors get extra tokens: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens , worth $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1 . Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens , valued at $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1 . Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens , equal to $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1 .This shows Ruvi AI’s commitment to reward its investors. A Platform for Real Solutions Ruvi AI is transforming industries by using AI to solve complex problems and blockchain to ensure accountability and transparency. Whether a company needs to streamline healthcare logistics, sharpen financial forecasting or improve data sharing trust, Ruvi AI has solutions. The release of its Beta platform is proof that Ruvi AI isn’t just theory. It’s already delivering value to those who use and support it. Act Now Solana may be fast but Ruvi AI is focused on combining AI and blockchain to create solutions with real use cases.

Beneath the headlines, a new group of tokens is gaining traction ahead of what could be the next explosive cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, Solana, and NEAR Protocol are all drawing serious attention as Stage 8 of MAGACOIN FINANCE accelerates, and momentum builds across both established leaders and bold new contenders.Each project is showing signs of strategic positioning, technical strength, or early-stage investor demand – and the next moonshot may already be in play. Here’s a breakdown of the four coins analysts are watching now. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Breakout of the Year MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about early-stage entries of 2025. With Stage 8 now live and over $8 million raised, the project is ranked as the #1 presale of the year, and analysts are forecasting up to 40x returns before listings. Its capped 100 billion token supply, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and HashEx audit are fueling surging demand and rapid community growth. As each stage fills, urgency grows – and with a listing target of $0.007, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as a rare ground-floor opportunity by both retail and whale investors. For those seeking asymmetric returns, this is where speculation meets structure. XRP’s Payment Utility and Futures Momentum XRP is trading between $2.10 and $2.39 in May 2025, gaining momentum from payment adoption and the upcoming CME futures launch. Regulatory clarity is drawing institutional buyers, and analysts believe a surge to $5–$15 could happen quickly if liquidity conditions shift after futures approval.As XRP’s global utility grows, capital is also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the potential for exponential gains remains wide open. Solana: DeFi Dominance and a Technical Supercycle Solana (SOL) is trading at approximately $170.15, up more than 80% from its prior lows and standing out as one of the strongest Layer-1 performers. With DeFi apps thriving and network activity climbing, analysts are forecasting a move toward $250–$400 if the current trend continues.As Solana’s rally accelerates, investors are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside as the cycle extends. NEAR Protocol: Quiet Growth and Breakout Potential NEAR Protocol is quietly building momentum in 2025, with its developer ecosystem expanding and new integrations driving user growth. While NEAR isn’t yet in the spotlight like SOL or XRP, its scalable architecture and focus on usability position it as a sleeper candidate for the next breakout.As capital seeks undervalued networks, many are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion With Solana’s rally igniting the altcoin market, the focus is shifting to projects with clear upside and breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking off as Stage 8 nears completion, offering a rare early-stage entry point as listings approach. XRP and NEAR add further depth to the list of contenders, but among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most aggressive early entry for those seeking the next moonshot.The window for entry is narrowing – and this could be the moment to catch it.

The decision disclosed in a regulatory filing comes as the commission initiates formal proceedings to judge those proposals. The Commission announced that it is initiating proceedings to allow more time to assess whether the proposed rule change aligns with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. This section requires, among other provisions, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices and to protect investors and the public interest. The SEC initially accepted both applications earlier this year. Bitwise first submitted its proposal in January 2025 via the BZX Exchange . The agency issued its first delay on March 11, and with this latest development, the review process has now moved into a more formal and detailed stage. 21Shares, which already operates spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, was one of the earliest companies to apply for a Solana-based ETF in America’s market. However, like its competitors, the company has been stymied by regulation, as the SEC continues to be wary of financial products based on crypto. This delay is nothing out of the ordinary. The SEC also pushed off a decision on Grayscale’s proposed Solana ETF earlier this month, indicating the glacial pace of most digital asset ETF applications . Analysts predict high odds for Solana ETF in 2025 For their part, ETF experts remain unbothered by the latest delay. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas argue there’s still a good chance (70% in 2025) that there’s a Solana ETF approved in the U.S. The rush isn’t limited to 21Shares and Bitwise. Heavyweights like VanEck and Franklin Templeton have also filed for Solana ETFs. This demand for Solana suggests strong institutional demand for regulated SOL exposure vehicles. ETF products are also eyeing other altcoins like Litecoin and XRP. Litecoin ETF’s likely approval rates are around 90%, and XRP ETFs are at 85%. Dogecoin and Cardano ETFs follow closely, with approval probabilities of approximately 80% and 75%, respectively. However, approval for all of those products is still pending. The approval process is slow and unpredictable. Some of these filings may not receive final action until late-2025. Investors respond to SEC delays The price of Solana saw a small bump on the news. SOL/USD has suffered the most in the last 7 days, with a loss of about 1.2% to trade around $166 at the time of writing. The market is also heavily sensitive to any whiffs of regulation, particularly on how they’d impact investor confidence and future ETF product availability. Paradoxically, this decline is taking place at a time when institutions are showing even more interest in Solana. Some analysts believe the sluggish market may not be a long-term condition. As per recent trends, Solana has never been overbought. Thus, we can expect a more or less mid-term recovery. Adding to the bullish action is the word from CME Group that it will launch Solana’s future contracts. If successful, these futures would allow investors to hedge or speculate on SOL’s price in a regulated setting. And while the move is parsed as incremental, it is also predicted to make it easier for future ETFs to be approved. Futures products do not manage the ETF but enable institutions to speculate on Solana without owning the coin. This is especially important because the regulatory outlook for spot crypto markets remains highly uncertain.

Senators easily cleared the 60-vote threshold for the vote, which is intended to just move the legislation to a period of further debate before a final vote series to pass it out of the Senate. The House of Representatives is working its way through its own version of stablecoin legislation, which is intended to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins and their issuers in the U.S. The Senate previously failed to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance the bill during a vote on May 8, after Democratic lawmakers raised concerns about consumer protection and national security provisions. That vote had failed on a bipartisan basis, after Republicans Josh Hawley and Rand Paul also voted against cloture. Despite that earlier setback, industry participants expected easy passage on Monday after lawmakers spent much of the last week negotiating changes in language, though many of these changes seemed marginal . One individual following the negotiations told CoinDesk that ""there's enough"" in the newest version of the bill to address some of Democrats' concerns earlier on Monday, though the lawmakers negotiating language could have added more hefty consumer protection provisions.

However, this was followed by a return to consolidation around the $103,000 price level. This intense volatility in the past 24 hours suggests that the Bitcoin price still has a long way to go before it reaches a price top. Amid this volatile movement, a new macroeconomic model, the Decode Macro Trend Oscillator (MTO), has pointed out when to expect Bitcoin’s price to top this cycle. Decode’s Macro Trend Oscillator Model And Its Alignment With Bitcoin Peaks The Decode Macro Trend Oscillator is a sophisticated tool designed by a Bitcoin analyst known as Decode on the social media platform X. The oscillator aggregates around 40 macroeconomic indicators, ranging from interest rates and global liquidity to industrial production and market volatility, into 17 carefully selected leading metrics. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now These are then normalized and visualized as a histogram to produce a cyclical pattern that has historically aligned with Bitcoin’s major tops. A close look at the chart titled Bitcoin Liquid Index on the 1M candlestick timeframe reveals that the light green histogram bars have coincided with each of Bitcoin’s cycle peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021. These peaks are marked by vertical red lines, and the transitions from deep red to green territory on the oscillator appear to offer a visual cue for the end of bearish phases and the onset of price rallies. As of May 2025, the histogram remains in a deep red zone but has begun inching upward, with the most recent bar reading at -11.47, suggesting that macroeconomic conditions may soon start to favor a bigger rally for Bitcoin. BTC Mode Configuration Fine-Tunes Cycle Top Prediction Decode’s analysis goes beyond Bitcoin-specific indicators. In one of the accompanying charts of the S&P 500 Index of the 2M timeframe, a long-term comparison is made between the current global environment and the economic backdrop of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Interestingly, Decode’s macro trend oscillator proved reliable in estimating periods of downturns and expansions in both instances. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength In both instances, inflation pressure and declining consumer sentiment pushed the oscillator deep into negative territory for years. However, once the histogram flipped into the green, the economy and prices entered a prolonged phase of expansion. The third chart offers a more detailed view of Bitcoin’s weekly trend, including an overlay of M2 money supply growth, which is another popular monetary metric. This view highlights how the Macro Trend Oscillator, when switched to a configuration Decode called “Bitcoin Mode,” fine-tunes its sensitivity to metrics that directly impact crypto markets. In this configuration, only a few of the full 17 metrics that best identify Bitcoin cycle tops are used. As it stands, Bitcoin is still in the negative red histogram zone, even despite its rally in recent months. The first deep green histogram has yet to show up, not to mention the first light green bar that will mark the cycle peak. Based on this setup, the oscillator implies that Bitcoin still has a lot of room to run this cycle, and that a price top is unlikely to arrive in 2025.

A key procedural vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed in a 66-32 vote on May 20. Several Democrats changed their votes to pass the motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key backers, said on May 15 that she thinks it's a “fair target” to have the GENIUS Act passed by May 26 — Memorial Day in the US. The US Senate voted 66-32 to advance debate on the GENIUS stablecoin bill. Source: US Senate The GENIUS Act was introduced on Feb. 4 by US Senator Bill Hagerty and seeks to regulate the nearly $250 billion stablecoin market — currently dominated by Tether ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ). The bill requires stablecoins be fully backed, have regular security audits and approval from federal or state regulators. Only licensed entities can issue stablecoins, while algorithmic stablecoins are restricted. Several Democratic senators withdrew support for the bill on May 8, blocking a motion to move it forward, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest involving Trump’s crypto ventures and anti-money laundering provisions.

The motion to invoke cloture — which allows the Senate to proceed with debating the bill — was approved with a 66-32 vote. Interestingly, more than 15 Democratic senators, including Catherine Cortez Masto, Adam Schiff, Mark Warner, and Ruben Gallego, changed their earlier ‘no’ votes to ‘yes.’ However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted against the motion. Senator Josh Hawley was absent during the vote. However, this vote does not mean the GENIUS Act has become law. It simply allows the Senate to begin discussing, debating, and potentially amending the bill before a final vote. Why This Matters for Crypto Investors The GENIUS Act includes regulations for stablecoins — digital currencies tied to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. Many in the crypto community see this as a positive step because it introduces clear rules, ensuring stablecoin issuers hold proper reserves like U.S. treasury bonds. It also demands more transparency about how these stablecoins are backed. JUST IN: Motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the consideration of the GENIUS Act has PASSED. 15+ Dems flipped their votes from no to yes including @CortezMasto , @SenAdamSchiff , @MarkWarner , @SenRubenGallego , @SenatorWarnock and others. Senate Minority leader… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) May 20, 2025 Experts say this could strengthen trust in the crypto market and protect users from risks seen in the past when some stablecoin companies lacked proper financial backing. Concerns Around Stablecoins and Politics There’s ongoing debate about private tech companies like Meta or Square issuing their own stablecoins. Some see it as risky without strict regulations. Another concern is about political leaders, including President Trump, having financial interests in crypto-related projects, raising questions about fairness and possible conflicts of interest. While having government figures support crypto might sound positive, experts warn it could lead to future problems if decisions appear to benefit insiders. As reported by Eleanor Terrett, Josh Vlasto, spokesperson for CIFonX, said, “We congratulate the Senate on today’s vote. This action, and eventually passage of a stablecoin bill, clears the path for Congress to act on the mandate of voters to pass market structure legislation which creates clear rules of the road for digital assets.”",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 01:52:37

We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said. Michael Saylor comments on Dimon’s announcement. Source: Michael Saylor JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market. “I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.” “If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said. At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

Each offers a different value. ADA is moving upward in a strong rally, SHIB’s forecast points to a big breakout, and Web3 ai is becoming a top choice thanks to its AI-powered tools and growing presale. All three point to unique paths for potential future gains. While ADA and SHIB are seeing price surges and network updates, Web3 ai brings a complete platform that changes how people manage crypto. It’s no longer just about price moves; now it’s about tools, access, and control. The question is, which of these will stand out as the best crypto platform going forward? Cardano (ADA) Price Momentum Strengthens Toward $1.20 Momentum for Cardano (ADA) is rising steadily this May. A major reason is the growing open interest, now at $930 million, showing more activity from large-scale and leveraged market participants. This has pushed many to expect a breakout past the $1.20 mark. Technical indicators are also aligning well. ADA is showing higher lows, stronger volume, and stability near its 200-day moving average. With DeFi adoption increasing and new upgrades across its ecosystem, analysts believe ADA is still undervalued at today’s prices. ADA brings both steadiness and upward potential. While not as fast-moving as smaller coins, its developer community and expanding use make it a solid option for anyone considering the best crypto platform for longer-term growth. SHIB Forecast Signals a 105% Rise with Bullish Setup Shiba Inu (SHIB) is drawing fresh attention with a bullish forecast. Analysts now see the potential for a 105% increase if SHIB maintains its current trend. After moving above the $0.000026 resistance level, it could aim for $0.000053 soon. Several things are fueling this optimism: higher trade volume, better sentiment, and active work on its ecosystem. Shibarium is growing, and more SHIB coins are being burned, which helps it look more serious beyond just being a meme coin. Though SHIB carries some risks, its price pattern is attracting breakout traders and those who follow community-driven coins. If the momentum continues, SHIB could become a bigger part of the conversation around the best crypto platform. Web3 ai’s Presale Hits $4.2M as AI-Powered Crypto Tools Gain Ground Instead of following price trends alone, Web3 ai is building a smart, AI-focused system to support crypto users in real-time. With $4.2 million already raised in its presale and the current price at $0.000365 (Stage 5), Web3 ai is becoming a strong contender in 2025. This system brings together blockchain and AI to deliver automation, smart insights, and decision-making tools in one place. The platform includes modules like sentiment tracking, contract reviews, trading bots, and portfolio analysis, all in a single dashboard. It helps simplify complex tasks and reduces mistakes by centralizing tools. What makes Web3 ai different is its use of machine learning trained on big data, combined with real blockchain information. It features price predictions, scam alerts, staking guidance, and auto-strategies. $WAI is used across the system for rewards, feature access, and governance. Designed to be modular and cross-chain, Web3 ai values user privacy, control, and steady upgrades. With a projected ROI of 1,747% by launch and strong support in the presale phase, it’s positioning itself as a top contender for best crypto platform, not just this year, but for years to come. Final Thoughts! Cardano (ADA) brings solid fundamentals, high engagement, and a path to break $1.20. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing short-term excitement with its pattern and growing network support. Both projects are backed by strong price actions. Yet, Web3 ai is changing what people expect from crypto platforms. With a $4.2 million presale, a stage price of $0.000365, and a projected 1,747% return, it blends real tools and practical use into one smart platform. For anyone looking beyond just market movements, Web3 ai is shaping up as a top name among the best crypto platform picks .

XRP and Solana are drawing renewed attention, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum is turning heads among those seeking asymmetric upside. With Kaspa joining the list of contenders, the smart money is quietly positioning for the next phase of the bull cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating 2025 Altcoin Picks CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE has stormed into the 2025 cycle with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full, all while its token price remains under $0.001. Its capped 100 billion token supply and Hashex-audited smart contracts have created a scarcity-driven model that’s fueling strong demand and rapid presale sellouts.Analysts are forecasting 25x–35x returns, with some models calling for even more if momentum continues. Whale allocations and a unique blend of political narrative and structured tokenomics are positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP Inches Toward Futures and Institutional Access XRP is trading at $2.33 as of May 19, 2025, after a 3.3% dip, but the launch of CME Group’s XRP futures and Ripple’s expansion into the UAE are driving institutional interest. Despite short-term price pressure, analysts remain bullish, with targets of $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate.As XRP holders seek further upside, many are also rotating into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the growth curve is just beginning. Bitcoin: New Highs and Growing Demand Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,005, having closed the week above $106,000 for the first time ever and maintaining its position as the market’s anchor. With technical forecasts calling for a move to $114,289 in May and long-term projections as high as $210,000–$230,000 for 2025, institutional inflows and ETF demand are keeping sentiment bullish.As Bitcoin’s growth steadies, investors are increasingly seeking higher-multiple opportunities in early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana’s Consistent Climb Draws Institutional Eyes Solana (SOL) is trading at $171.54, up 3.38% from yesterday, and continues to be one of the strongest Layer-1 performers this cycle. Price forecasts for May 2025 suggest a range between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to $183 and beyond.As Solana’s fundamentals remain robust, some SOL holders are rotating into smaller-cap options like MAGACOIN FINANCE to chase outsized returns ahead of listings. Kaspa: Quietly Building Momentum Kaspa (KAS) is quietly gaining traction in 2025, with its proof-of-work model and expanding ecosystem attracting new capital. While not as high-profile as Bitcoin or Solana, KAS is being watched by analysts as a potential breakout candidate for the second half of the year.As capital rotates, many are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion While Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana remain foundational to any crypto portfolio, the search for the next breakout is intensifying. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the bold, high-upside pick that’s catching analyst attention as Stage 8 nears completion.With a clear listing roadmap, robust demand, and a narrowing entry window, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the defining early-stage opportunity of the 2025 cycle.

That’s exactly where Unstaked is stepping in, blending blockchain with AI in a way that brings immediate benefits. Rather than selling future potential, it’s already giving users working tools that help with decision-making, risk control, and portfolio management. Now in stage 13 and with over $6.2 million raised, Unstaked is building strong momentum. Many analysts are starting to recognise it as a serious contender for the top DeFi token of 2025, with growing belief that $UNSD could approach the $1 mark soon after launch. AI-Powered Tools That Help Users Make Smarter Moves What truly sets Unstaked apart is how it brings advanced AI technology directly to its users. Instead of simply offering another token to hold, it provides a toolkit packed with features, live trading alerts, scam detection, risk analysis, and portfolio optimisation. These tools aren’t promises for later. They’re built to function the moment the AI agents are live. Users can activate their own AI agents to run community engagement across platforms like Telegram and X. These agents do more than automate replies; they learn, adapt, and support long-term community growth. This shift from passive holding to active participation gives investors a stronger reason to be involved. With features that drive interaction and utility, Unstaked is positioning itself as a meaningful platform, and one that could rise as the top DeFi token of 2025 for users who want a function alongside investment potential. Presale Growth Reflects Rising Confidence in the Project The momentum behind Unstaked’s presale shows just how quickly interest is building. With the project now in stage 13, over $6.2 million has already been raised, and tokens are sold at $0.009267 each. That kind of traction doesn’t happen without a compelling offer. A key part of that appeal is Unstaked’s open and fair launch structure. With no private or early-stage allocations, the project attracts a broad mix of everyday investors who are drawn to transparency and accessibility. Unlike many DeFi projects that rely on speculation, Unstaked offers actual value through its functional AI agents. Additionally, its $1 million giveaway is helping build a strong and engaged community. With an expected launch price of $0.1819, early participants see plenty of room for growth. That optimism, tied to the project’s tangible offerings, is what’s making Unstaked one of the leading names among the top DeFi tokens of 2025 contenders. Could $UNSD Reach $1 After Listing? Some market watchers now suggest that Unstaked could climb past $1 shortly after it goes live. This view isn’t just based on hype. The project’s strong presale performance and wide support for utility-first DeFi solutions make a solid case. Unstaked’s unique proof-of-intelligence framework also plays a big role. It logs every action made by its AI agents on-chain, creating a public, transparent record of engagement and productivity. This data-driven approach adds credibility and makes user activity measurable, something not many other platforms offer. This kind of verifiable participation draws in a new type of investor, someone looking for impact they can track, not just tokens they can hold. With practical use cases and clear metrics already in play, Unstaked is making a name for itself among those looking for the top DeFi token of 2025 with more than just market buzz. Summing Up! DeFi is evolving, and the next generation of platforms will be judged by more than yield and tokenomics. Projects like Unstaked, which balance utility, transparency, and community interaction, lead the way. With presale stages advancing, AI tools already operational, and more than $6.2 million raised, it’s becoming harder to ignore what Unstaked is building.

Arthur Breitman’s Bet on Tokenized Uranium Could Signal a Tezos Revival Arthur Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, is placing a bold bet on tokenized uranium—a move that could mark a pivotal comeback for the once-hyped “Ethereum killer.” In a recent interview, Breitman reflected on Tezos’ evolution from a top-10 crypto project to a more subdued but resilient player in the blockchain space, now targeting the Real World Asset (RWA) sector. With its unique self-amending protocol and strong emphasis on decentralization, Tezos is aiming to reinvent itself by enabling secure and transparent uranium tokenization. Breitman emphasizes Tezos’ culture of “doing things for real,” contrasting its genuinely decentralized infrastructure with other projects driven by hype or custodial models. While Tezos has endured regulatory hurdles, shifting narratives, and market skepticism, its pivot toward tokenizing critical assets like uranium could redefine its place in the crypto ecosystem and reignite developer and institutional interest. Avalanche (AVAX) Surges 21%, But Ruvi AI (RUVI) Emerges as 2025’s Breakout Star with $2 Price Prediction and 20,000% Growth Forecast Avalanche (AVAX) has seen a significant 21% surge, hitting $22.80 amid growing adoption and bullish momentum, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $30.01 by 2030. However, market analysts are increasingly turning their attention to Ruvi AI (RUVI), a disruptive decentralized AI superapp that’s making waves with its innovative integration of Web3 technology. With a successful presale already under its belt—where early investors earned 50% gains—RUVI is now priced at just $0.015, yet experts forecast the token could reach $2 in 2025, representing a staggering 20,000% ROI. Combining blockchain utility with AI-driven content creation tools for text, video, audio, and images, Ruvi is quickly gaining traction as the next major player in the crypto space.

The exchange said in a May 16 filing to a New York federal court that its terms of service, which it claimed the class group agreed to, has a clause that users agree to arbitrate all claims, along with a clause preventing users from launching class actions against the crypto exchange . “The Court should hold that Plaintiffs are required to arbitrate claims that accrued after Feb. 20, 2019, even if the Court adheres to its initial decision as to claims that accrued before then and that the class-action waiver in the 2019 Terms of Use is enforceable for all of Plaintiffs’ claims,” Binance said. Binance argues that its terms of service have a clause about users agreeing to arbitrate all claims. Source: PACER In March, Judge Andrew Carter denied Binance’s request to have all of the class action’s claims sent to arbitration for users who bought tokens on the exchange between April 1, 2017, and Feb. 20, 2019, and partially denied the motion for users who bought tokens after 2019 until a decision could be made to what extend the arbitration clause would apply. Binance said in its latest filings that it updated its terms in February 2019 to include the arbitration clause and argued that an earlier version of the terms of service included a clause that informed users that Binance could amend the terms as needed without any individual notice. Binance case was previously dismissed Judge Carter had sided with Binance and dismissed the suit in March 2022. Binance had argued that it isn’t beholden to US securities laws because it doesn’t have a physical headquarters in the country. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned that decision in March 2024 , and the Supreme Court later declined to hear Binance’s appeal in January. Related: US judge transfers Binance lawsuit to Florida, citing first-to-file rule Binance’s legal entanglements in the US have escalated since mid-2023, when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company for selling unregistered securities, which was settled for $4.3 billion in November 2023. Binance was also slapped with a class action in Canada in April 2024 for allegedly violating securities laws after it announced its departure from the country in May 2023.

Despite these setbacks, the Pi Core Team has announced new job openings, leaving the community both puzzled and concerned. Price Drops Despite Fund Announcement After briefly spiking to $1.6796 on May 8, the price of Pi has pulled back sharply and is now trading at around $0.75. Although it remains slightly above its early April lows, the token’s value has dropped since peaking at $2.98 in late February. Even a major announcement on May 14, where the Pi Core Team unveiled a $100 million ecosystem fund to boost network development, failed to stop the price slide. In fact, some community members argue that this fund may be contributing to sell pressure rather than supporting the market. Technical analysts are keeping a close eye on the critical $0.70 support level. If this support breaks, it would invalidate the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, possibly opening the door for a drop to $0.40. Hiring Spree Amid the Chaos Interestingly, amidst the falling prices and growing controversies, the Pi Core Team has released a fresh list of job openings. This move comes at a time when investor confidence is shaky, leaving many to question the timing and motives behind the recruitment drive. Allegations of Pump-and-Dump and Wallet Concerns Along with falling prices, the Pi community is also raising concerns about possible pump-and-dump activity. Many believe the Pi Core Team controls over 10,000 wallets and sub-wallets, though only the 7 largest wallets are easy to track. In the last five months: 5.4 billion Pi were moved from the Foundation 1 wallet to the Foundation 3 wallet. About 700 million Pi were transferred from Foundation 3 to Foundation 2 in smaller batches. More than 1 billion Pi went directly from Foundation 1 to Foundation 2. Right now, the Foundation 3 wallet holds 4.7 billion Pi, while Foundation 2 has only 24 million Pi left. The community is demanding answers about where these large amounts of Pi have gone and is calling for better transparency and accountability from the Pi Core Team.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 02:36:23

In our previous entries, we covered moving averages and MACD , great for identifying trends and momentum. Now let’s look at RSI , a tool many traders use to time their trades with better confidence. What is RSI? RSI stands for Relative Strength Index. It helps you see if a coin has been bought or sold too much recently and might be ready to reverse. It’s plotted as a line that moves between 0 and 100. Most traders use it with a 14-period setting. Depending on your chart’s timeframe, this could mean 14 days, 14 hours, or even 14 minutes. Unlike price-following indicators, RSI doesn’t just track where price is. It tells you how extreme recent buying or selling pressure has been . That way, you can figure out if the market’s about to flip before it actually does. How to Read It: RSI above 70 = Overbought → Market may be due for a correction RSI below 30 = Oversold → Market may be due for a bounce RSI between 40–60 = Neutral → No strong signal Example in Action: RSI (Purple Panel): Overbought Alert RSI is sitting above 70 , signalling classic overbought conditions . This suggests that Bitcoin’s recent bullish run may be losing steam or approaching a natural correction. What Traders Are Watching: RSI dropping back below 70 could mean a pullback is starting. If BTC remains strong, RSI might stay overbought. This is a behavior common in strong uptrends but also a risky zone for late buyers. For better accuracy, use RSI together with MACD and Moving Averages to make more informed decisions. MACD : Bullish, but Momentum Slowing? MACD Line (Blue): 4,142 Signal Line (Orange): 3,536 Histogram: Positive but starting to flatten, hinting that momentum is slowing down . The MACD remains bullish with the blue line comfortably above the orange, but keep an eye on that histogram. If those bars start to shrink, it’s often the first clue that bullish momentum is fading. Moving Averages : Is BTC Overextended? 50-Day EMA (Yellow Line): 92,570 200-Day SMA (Blue Line): 91,673 BTC is trading well above both these critical moving averages, which confirms the strength of the current uptrend. But this also raises a flag: Is the market overstretched? When price pulls too far away from these averages, a healthy correction often follows, bringing price back toward the 50 EMA , a level many traders view as dynamic support in a bull market. Final Takeaways: Should You Act Now or Wait? Current Trend: Strongly bullish but potentially overextended. RSI: In overbought territory, exercise caution. MACD: Still bullish, but showing early signs of slowing momentum. Strategy: If you’re already in profit, this is a great time to consider securing gains or tightening your stop-losses. If you’re waiting to enter, watch for a pullback toward the 50 EMA for a stronger, lower-risk entry point. Pro Tips for Using RSI Like a Pro RSI is simple, but using it well is where it really counts. Here’s how experienced traders make the best of RSI: Understand Market Context RSI works beautifully in sideways or ranging markets , where price bounces between support and resistance. But in strong trends (like a bull run), RSI can stay overbought or oversold for weeks. So don’t hit that sell button just because RSI hits 70. Look at the bigger picture first. Combine It with Other Indicators RSI works best when it’s part of the conversation. Try pairing it with: MACD to check if momentum agrees with what RSI is telling you. Moving Averages (like the 50 EMA) to see if price is stretched too far from key support levels. Watch for Divergence If price makes a new high , but RSI doesn’t? That’s called bearish divergence , momentum could be slipping. If price makes a new low , but RSI doesn’t? That’s bullish divergence , a bounce might be around the corner. Divergence doesn’t always play out immediately, but it’s one of those clues that serious traders don’t ignore RSI Is an Early Indicator, Not a Direct Call to Action Just because RSI is flashing overbought or oversold doesn’t mean you need to rush into action. Use it as an early warning, not as a reason to panic-buy or panic-sell. Play with Timeframes to Refine Your Strategy RSI readings change based on the timeframe you’re looking at. If the daily RSI shows overbought , but the 1-hour RSI is cooling off , this often means the market is in a short-term pullback within a larger uptrend. Smart traders use this to their advantage, waiting for the short-term RSI to reset before jumping back into the larger trend. This approach helps you avoid chasing tops and gives you better, lower-risk entry points. Always check multiple timeframes before making your move.

From institutional Layer-1 giants to narrative-driven tokens and pre-listing breakouts, this list represents a strategic blend of infrastructure, utility, and momentum. Here are five cryptocurrencies traders are watching closely this quarter — each bringing something unique to the table, and one in particular still offering true early-stage entry potential . 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — A Pre-Listing Standout With 25x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines as a rare altcoin still offering early-stage positioning with a fixed listing target of $0.007 . Currently moving into Stage 9 , MAGA has become the go-to pick for traders who missed early SHIBA, PEPE, and DOGE cycles — but want exposure to a similarly explosive setup, with clearer tokenomics. Why it’s trending: Strong community backing and political branding Structured entry points with transparent ROI potential Analyst projections of 25x–35x upside from current levels With listings on the horizon, MAGA is quickly earning its place among 2025’s most-watched speculative allocations . 2. Cardano (ADA) — Layer-1 Strength With Breakout Setup Cardano (ADA) continues to show strength in its fundamentals, even as its price consolidates below $0.80. With ongoing upgrades like Hydra , growing DeFi participation, and solid developer traction, ADA is positioning for a technical breakout above $1.00 . Why ADA still matters: Scalable blockchain infrastructure with long-term ecosystem goals Low price entry relative to previous ATHs Viewed as a low-risk Layer-1 long play in 2025 Investors seeking a blend of stability and upside are still allocating to ADA — especially ahead of its next wave of ecosystem rollouts. 3. Avalanche (AVAX) — Real-World Growth at a Discount Avalanche is trading around $28–$30 and continues to impress institutional audiences with its subnet model and real-world partnerships . Major integrations with gaming and financial companies — including attention from BlackRock — have helped solidify its 2025 relevance. Why AVAX is considered undervalued: Enterprise-grade scalability Strong developer growth and subnet expansion Analysts targeting $60–$90 range by Q3 if momentum holds AVAX is viewed as one of the strongest alternatives to Ethereum , particularly for investors chasing innovation in DeFi and GameFi. 4. OFFICIAL $TRUMP (TRUMP) — Controversial but Climbing OFFICIALTRUMP has become one of the most discussed tokens of 2025 — and not just because of its meme appeal. With an exclusive $TRUMP holders dinner scheduled for May 22 , political speculation and global wallet activity have triggered major volatility — and major attention. Key headlines: Top 220 buyers spent $140M+ for access to Trump’s private event Justin Sun rumored to be the largest holder with $18M+ Under U.S. Senate investigation for foreign wallet dominance and supply centralization Despite (or because of) its controversy, analysts say $TRUMP could remain one of the most heavily traded tokens this quarter , especially with a speculative rebound toward $13–$14 in play. 5. XRP (XRP) — Legal Clarity + CME Futures = Strong Positioning XRP continues to hold steady above $2.30 , supported by recent U.S. legal victories and anticipation of CME futures integration . It remains a cornerstone of blockchain-based cross-border liquidity , with broad global appeal. Why investors are still holding XRP: Regulatory green light in major markets Real-world adoption for financial infrastructure Long-term analyst targets of $10–$15 remain active XRP offers both growth potential and portfolio balance , making it a favorite for investors rotating out of Bitcoin-heavy allocations. Conclusion If you’re looking to reposition your portfolio before June 2025, these five cryptocurrencies stand out for different reasons — but all share the common trait of being undervalued relative to their upside : MAGACOIN FINANCE for high-leverage early-stage exposure Cardano for technical consistency Avalanche for scalable enterprise adoption OFFICIALTRUMP for political-driven speculation XRP for regulatory and institutional strength All five offer strategic entry points this quarter — but only MAGACOIN FINANCE still trades below its listing price, making it the last high-upside presale many analysts are watching closely.

The rise is a welcome return to form for Bithumb, which has had a torrid 12 months. Founded in 2014 under the name Xcoin and rebranded in 2015, Bithumb once ruled the roost in South Korea with over 70% of trading volumes. However, the exchange began to fade after suffering hacks, including one in 2018 that saw it lose about $30 million. Meanwhile, rival Upbit rose to prominence after partnering with internet-only Kbank, which could help process new exchange users digitally. But by 2024, Bithumb came roaring back. It raised marketing expenses more than tenfold to 192 billion won in 2024, from 16 billion in 2023. Data from market data provider Kaiko shows that Bithumb held 36% of the trade in January 2024. Though those figures have since waned, the firm has maintained around 25%. That’s quite a bit higher than its high single-digit market share at the start of 2023. Bithumb’s sudden resurgence is throwing the market into disarray in a country where Upbit has long held a near-monopoly. For years, Upbit was a primary growth driver with Kbank, and it was able to roll out a digital onboarding process for customers. The return of Bithumb, however, indicates that the market is now better positioned to compete. Bithumb sets the stage for public listing Bithumb is presently in preparation for IPO . The exchange is now racing to reach 1 billion dollars in IPO goals. A listing is scheduled for the second half of 2025, with Samsung Securities as the lead underwriter. The bourse plans to list South Korea’s KOSDAQ stock market and is considering a dual listing of the cryptocurrency exchange operator on the United States’ NASDAQ market to attract more global investors, KRX said. Bithumb has already broken its non-exchange businesses into smaller units to make the company easier to manage ahead of the IPO chase. NYC 5G (Bithumb A) was spun off on 31 July 2025. This move is intended to simplify its corporate setup and remove core trading functions from other projects, such as “blockchain research, consulting, and NFT efforts.” Solid financials back Bithumb, and its upcoming IPO is seen as a strategic step toward greater transparency. The move comes as the company works to rebuild trust following past controversies, including investigations into former executives over allegations of fraud and embezzlement. Bithumb remains under regulatory scrutiny Despite a few recent wins, Bithumb remains under intense regulatory scrutiny. South Korea enforces some of the world’s strictest crypto regulations , where violations can result in severe penalties. In the first half of 2025, Bithumb was warned about potential regulatory suspension due to Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. The Financial Services Commission had to develop a countermeasure for over 400 suspected user accounts. That backdrop has pushed many smaller Korean crypto exchanges out of the business. Only two big players remain in the country: Bithumb and Upbit. International exchange players like Binance also encountered challenges from the authorities, and the tight data privacy law proved difficult to sidestep.

Bitcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Ethereum May Be Fueling the Breakout",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrps-push-past-20-bitcoin-magacoin-finance-and-ethereum-may-be-fueling-the-breakout/,"Introduction The whales are moving again-but this time, their focus extends far beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Large-cap crypto holders are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE, with early projections pointing to up to 40x upside if it mirrors the explosive performance of early SHIBA or DOGE.As Stage 8 heats up, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the high-reward entry favored by smart money, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP position for the next major move. Here’s why analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most explosive altcoin entry of the 2025 cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why Early Whales Are Targeting MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly dominating early 2025 as one of the most-watched presales in the market. With over $8 million raised, a price still under $0.001, and a listing target of $0.007, the project is ranked as the #1 presale of the year, with analysts forecasting up to 40x returns before listings. Its scarcity-driven model-a capped 100 billion token supply and 45% allocated to presale-combined with a Hashex audit, is fueling surging demand and rapid community growth.Whale allocations and stage-based momentum are setting the pace, and as each stage fills, urgency grows. For those seeking asymmetric returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as the lead entry for Q3 listings and beyond. Bitcoin’s Steady Climb Reinforces Market Confidence Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading near $95,466, with bullish momentum and analysts predicting a potential surge past $100,000 in May 2025. Institutional inflows remain robust, and ETF demand is at an all-time high, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as the macro anchor for the next crypto cycle.As BTC’s price stabilizes above $95,000, capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the potential for exponential returns is drawing new buyers. Ethereum’s Quiet Build-Up Toward ETF Catalysts Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $2,489, with analysts forecasting a rise to $6,700 by year-end if institutional adoption and Layer 2 upgrades continue to accelerate. The recent Pectra update and the possibility of an ETH ETF are fueling optimism, while whales are quietly accumulating in anticipation of a breakout.As ETH’s growth steadies, more investors are diversifying into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. XRP Futures and ETF Hopes Drive Institutional Interest XRP is trading at $2.36 as of May 19, 2025, following the launch of CME Group’s regulated XRP futures contracts. While price action has been mixed, the new futures market and pending ETF decisions are expected to boost institutional demand and price discovery. Analysts see $5–$10 as the next major target, with $20 possible if ETF approval and global adoption accelerate.As XRP’s narrative strengthens, capital is also flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE for those seeking the next breakout. Chainlink: Reliable Growth Amid Rotating Capital Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $15.14, maintaining steady growth as DeFi and oracle demand remain high. While not as explosive as some rivals, LINK’s consistent utility and integration across major protocols make it a core holding for many.As capital rotates, some LINK holders are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for a shot at early-stage, high-multiple returns. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion When whales start positioning early, it’s a clear sign they see something big on the horizon. With MAGACOIN FINANCE accelerating through Stage 8, its combination of timing, tokenomics, and narrative is drawing accumulation from large BTC, ETH, and XRP holders.While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the market’s anchors, it’s tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer true breakout potential-and with whales quietly loading up, that breakout could arrive much sooner than the market expects.

33767162,[object Object],1747710036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin On Edge Of Extreme Greed—Is Euphoria Coming?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-on-edge-of-extreme-greed-is-euphoria-coming/,"Data shows the Bitcoin trader sentiment has been teetering on the edge of extreme greed for the last few days, a sign that a break may be coming. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Sitting On The Boundary Of Extreme Greed The “ Fear & Greed Index ” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The index uses a numerical scale running from zero to hundred for representing the market sentiment. All values above 53 correspond to greed among the investors, while those below 47 suggest the presence of fear. The in-between levels naturally correspond to a net neutral mentality. Now, here is how the current market sentiment looks, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the indicator currently has a value of 74, which implies the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed and a strong one at that, considering the high value. In fact, this value is so high that it’s right on the gateway to a special zone called the extreme greed. This region, which is situated beyond the 75 level, corresponds to euphoria among the Bitcoin traders. There is a similar territory on the other end of the scale as well, known as extreme fear (under 25). When the index is in this zone, it naturally suggests the investors are in the deepest state of despair. Historically, both of these zones have held much significance for Bitcoin and other digital assets, as major reversals have occurred when the investors have held these mentalities. Thus, extreme greed can lead to a top and extreme fear to a bottom. Recently, Bitcoin has climbed to price levels near the all-time high , so it’s not surprising that the sentiment is heating up. Still, for now, the index hasn’t broken into the extreme greed zone yet, so it’s possible that the run could have more room to run before overhype becomes an issue. It only remains to be seen how long this would hold, however, considering that the Fear & Greed Index has been sitting on this boundary level for three straight days now. Any continuations to the rally could take the market sentiment beyond the extreme greed threshold, at which point a reversal could become more likely, the higher the index ventures into the zone. In some other news, Bitcoin’s 30-day correlation with Gold has recently declined to its lowest level since February, as the analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post . At present, the 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and Gold is sitting at a value of -0.54, which means that over the past month, the two have traveled oppositely to each other to some degree. BTC Price Bitcoin saw a sharp burst to the $107,000 level yesterday, but the coin has since fallen off just as rapidly, as its price is now floating around $102,300.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Euphoria|Bitcoin Extreme Greed|Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-20 03:00:36

Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Z-Score Is Still Under Its Mean In a post on X, quant Frank has talked about how the Mayer Multiple of Bitcoin is looking right now. The “Mayer Multiple” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the BTC spot price and its 200-day moving average (MA). In other words, the metric represents the distance that the asset’s value has from the 200-day MA. The 200-day MA is a level that’s generally considered as an important boundary between macro bullish and bearish trends in the cryptocurrency, so it can be useful to know how far the coin is from this line. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up $18,000, But HODLer Profits Same As On April 1—Here’s Why In the context of the current discussion, the Mayer Multiple itself isn’t of interest, but rather its Z-Score. The Mayer Multiple Z-Score is an oscillator that tracks how much deviation the indicator has from its mean value. Now, here is the chart for the metric shared by the analyst: As is visible in the top graph, the Bitcoin price saw a dip under the 200-day MA during the earlier market downturn, but with the latest recovery run, it has broken back above the line. It would seem, though, that the asset hasn’t gained too much distance over the level so far, at least in historical context. And indeed, the Mayer Multiple Z-Score (bottom graph) confirms this, as its value is currently below zero. The zero level corresponds to the all-time mean of the Mayer Multiple. As such, a negative value like the current one suggests the metric is less than the average over history. More specifically, 53% of all days have witnessed the ratio being higher than the latest level. Based on this, the quant notes that Bitcoin remains relatively cool even at its current $103,000 price. From the chart, it’s visible that while the Z-Score is still negative, it’s much improved compared to the lows from earlier in the year. It’s possible that if BTC continues its bullish momentum, it will be challenging the zero level soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says In the current cycle, the Mayer Multiple has been higher than its mean on a few occasions already, with the largest separation occurring in the rally from Q1 2024, where the Z-Score surged above the level corresponding to a standard deviation of 1. So far, though, the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple hasn’t deviated to the same degree as during the bull run from the first half of 2021. It now remains to be seen whether the metric would heat up to similar levels in this cycle as well or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $102,700, down 1.5% over the last seven days.

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market. She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed. In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto “Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.” She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.” “I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SEC Crenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.” Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: Report Crenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said. “Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.” In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo” SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.” Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.” Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-20 03:08:27

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,650 resistance zone. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,450 and $2,500 levels. The price is trading above $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,530 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,650 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Regains Traction Ethereum price started a downside correction below the $2,450 level, unlike Bitcoin . ETH traded below the $2,400 and $2,350 support levels. However, the bulls were active near the $2,300 zone. A low was formed at $2,308 and the price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $2,450 and $2,500 levels. The price surpassed the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,583 swing high to the $2,308 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,530 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,540 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,583 swing high to the $2,308 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,580 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,720 resistance. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,780 resistance zone or even $2,840 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,520 level. The first major support sits near the $2,450 zone. A clear move below the $2,450 support might push the price toward the $2,420 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,250.

Whether it will overcome it or not is uncertain. Like other altcoins, Hype’s recovery started last month after locating a solid ground level above $9. While this came after trending bearishly throughout the first quarter of the year, it initiated a buy and increased with a strong close above the psychological $20 level in the late month. The trading volume enhanced this month, and the price increased until it reached a crucial multi-month resistance level of $28.4 yesterday. Looking back from where the price picked up in April, Hype has seen an impressive recovery and is now looking highly bullish on a short-term scale. Although it is facing a serious hurdle at this crucial resistance. Increasing above this resistance could fuel a bigger price movement in the future. However, a continuous rejection there could trigger a drop capable of bringing a pullback in the market before exploding higher. Similarly, trading calmly around this crucial resistance could lead to a slight consolidation phase before deciding the next major direction of the market. The bulls are still in charge despite the latest rejection. HYPE’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview After last month’s breakup, it has created supports at $23.25, $19.5 and $16.9 respectively. If the price drops from the currently trading level, we may see a pullback into the mentioned support levels before rebounding. Flipping the $28.4 resistance level, the potential buying target would be $35.7 on the short-term scale. The $43.25 level is the next resistance to watch for a major breakup.

It currently appears strong, but is likely to break lower following a newly formed bearish pattern on the daily chart. Alpaca is considered one of the top gainers (if not the biggest) during the recent rally in altcoins following an over 20x increase within two weeks. However, the buying pressure stopped following a long-wick rejection at $1.28 in late April. The price nosedived, but managed to stay above $0.16 in the first week of this month. Holding this price level as support, it resurged and pushed briefly above the $0.7 level in the second week. A rejection occurred again and the crypto lost momentum throughout that week. It advanced selling this week and further dipped to the $0.15 level yesterday. Today came with a relief following a major gain in the last 24 hours, and as we can see, it is now looking strong on the day. Despite the recent drops, it is still up by 6x on a monthly. But looking at the current price action, it has formed a double-top pattern on the daily chart. A break below the $0.15 level should validate more bearish moves in the coming days. Alpaca’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview On the way down, the $0.147 level is providing support. A drop below it could slide us to $0.0876. The key level to watch for a retest is $0.061. If a rebound fails there, it may roll back to the bottom level of $0.028. Towards the upside, the $0.266 level is the closest resistance to watch on the daily chart. A resurge above this weekly resistance should rally us through $0.4 to $0.727 before reclaiming the $1.28 high, where it faced a rejection in April.

As of May 2025, Bitcoin trades above $103,000, supported by post-ETF approval demand and on-chain accumulation. Additional forecasts from SkyBridge, Unchained Capital, and InvestingHaven suggest $200K–$1M Bitcoin targets within the decade. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, stated again in May 2025 that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030. She confirmed the forecast in a CNBC interview dated May 9, 2025. ARK Invest’s models include a base-case projection of $700,000 for Bitcoin, with the bull-case target being that $1.5 million figure. These scenarios consider Bitcoin’s fixed supply, institutional investment trends, and the growing financial infrastructure supporting Bitcoin.

Bitcoin and Solana are both in breakout territory — but a newer name, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is attracting heavy buyer interest ahead of a potential 40x move. The common thread? Traders looking to turn $500 into something massive before Q3 are rotating into this group — while Stage 8 of MAGACOIN FINANCE is still open . HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Bitcoin (BTC): Big Money Bets on the $250K Target Bitcoin has surged above $105,000 , just 3.5% below its all-time high, with daily trading volume topping $38 billion . Institutional inflows remain strong, and CME futures open interest is climbing. Leading analysts, including JPMorgan and Scott Melker, are reiterating bold forecasts of $250K by year-end . BTC remains the anchor of market confidence — and it’s pulling everything else forward with it. Solana (SOL): The Infrastructure Star with Eyes on $372 Solana is up over 6% daily , now trading at $178.45 , and analysts are watching for a continued move toward $294–$372 . The announcement of native Metamask support and the “Build on Solana” initiative backed by Chainlink Labs have elevated its growth trajectory heading into Q3. It’s not just moving fast — it’s scaling at the right time. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Stage 8 Is Live, Demand Is Climbing, and 40x Is the Talk of the Market Investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE , now ranked as the #1 altcoin entry of 2025 . The project has gained serious traction with early-stage buyers, and Stage 8 is now open with demand accelerating daily. With a 40x projection built around strong chart setups, trader positioning, and listing anticipation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting investors looking for that rare mix of visibility and early timing. The project is also fully audited by Hashex , adding a level of trust few emerging assets can match. To celebrate its explosive growth, new buyers can use promo code PATRIOT50X for a limited-time 50% bonus — driving even more interest as Stage 8 quickly approaches sellout. XRP and XLM: Bullish Sentiment Builds Around Utility Tokens XRP is trading above $2.36 , with anticipation building for the May 19 CME Futures launch . Analysts are targeting $3.40–$5.50 , with longer-term models calling for $10+ if ETF approvals align. Stellar (XLM) is quietly gaining ground as well, with May averages forecast around $0.236 , supported by ecosystem activity and developer momentum. Both are drawing renewed attention — but neither matches the energy forming around the Stage 8 window now closing fast. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Final Thoughts Bitcoin is driving institutional capital. Solana is expanding infrastructure at pace. XRP and XLM are rebuilding momentum around utility. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the breakout altcoin of this phase — with Stage 8 still open, listings ahead, and a real shot at 40x returns before the broader market catches up. For those aiming to turn $500 into a breakout position , the timing couldn’t be clearer — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is where the buyers are already moving .

In the last 24 hours, Ethereum’s price rose by 6.93%, and over the past week, it’s up 5.61%, currently trading around $2,558.65. One of the factors behind this rise is a fresh update from the Ethereum Foundation. The organization announced changes to its leadership structure, naming Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak as new Co-Executive Directors. Along with a newly appointed President, this marks a step toward strengthening the foundation’s management and decision-making processes. The news has been well received within the Ethereum community, with many viewing it as a sign of renewed focus and direction for the network. While Ethereum has seen a bullish climb, other leading cryptocurrencies have struggled to match its pace. Bitcoin (BTC) posted a smaller daily gain of 1.83%, while Binance Coin (BNB), XRP, and other altcoins recorded even smaller increases. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC stayed flat, as expected. Ethereum Price Analysis Technical analysis adds another layer to Ethereum’s price movement. The cryptocurrency recently rebounded from a crucial support area and is now approaching resistance levels between $2,523 and $2,690. Analysts predict that the market structure is still uncertain, but this bounce leaves room for either a fresh rally or another corrective move. However, a decisive break below $2,464 could suggest the current rally has ended and further downside is ahead. For now, Ethereum’s combination of leadership changes and positive price action has set it apart from the rest of the market.

It fell from $0.25 down to about $0.21. Traders saw a brief bounce above $0.23 around May 17–18, but that did not last. As of today, DOGE sits near $0.21, marking a 10% weekly drop. Investors are watching the bigger picture, hoping long‑term signals point to a renewed uptrend. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? Analyst Maintains Bullish Outlook According to analyst Javon Marks, a key trendline gave way in late 2023. This line had capped Dogecoin since its $0.70 peak. He says the break ushered in higher highs and higher lows. A fresh low near $0.15 has held so far. Based on this view, he kept his $0.65 target, which would mean a 200% gain from $0.21. Marks also mentioned $0.74 and $1.25 as possible future milestones. $DOGE and a +174% climb to its first target at $0.6533 continues to be in the cards 🃏… https://t.co/7Jt82s0jLy — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) May 18, 2025 Resistance Levels Remain Key Barrier Based on reports from market watcher Ali Martinez, the $0.25–$0.26 range is a major hurdle. That zone worked as support in December 2024 but flipped to resistance in early 2025. Since then, the meme coin has tried and failed to push past it. In February, it hit $0.28 before reversing to below $0.15. A March rally saw a move above $0.19 but stopped short again. The most recent test in May peaked at $0.24 before closing at $0.22. Traders will be looking for a clear close above $0.26 to signal new momentum. On‑Chain Activity Sees Strong Uptick Based on latest data, wallet activity has jumped sharply. New addresses grew by over 100% in the last seven days. Active addresses climbed by 110%. Even zero‑balance addresses rose by 155%, which often hints at fresh participation or address cleanup. Higher on‑chain counts don’t always mean a price rise, but they do show more users are logging transactions again. Stretch Targets Face Big Hurdles Dogecoin’s long‑term goals may sound exciting, but getting there won’t be simple. A move to $0.6533 or beyond requires first holding above $0.26. Then it must break $0.28 with real volume behind it. Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Big price swings could scare some holders into booking profits. Even if the chart lines line up, outside events like social media buzz or exchange listings may be needed to push DOGE past $0.30. In the short term, traders will watch whether DOGE can reclaim $0.25 and hold it for a few days. If that happens, the higher‑low pattern stays intact. If it falls back below $0.21, the setup could collapse and open the door to further losses. For now, the coin sits in a tug‑of‑war between bullish chart fans and those who see more downside.

But while BTC leads the charge, the focus is shifting to altcoins where the return potential is far greater. Among them, XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Ethereum are now ranked among the most likely to deliver 10,000% upside — with early-stage buyers already making their move. XRP: Futures Catalyst and Institutional Confidence in Motion XRP is currently trading above $2.36 , and all eyes are on the CME Futures launch on May 19 . Traders are calling for short-term movement toward $3.40–$5.50 , while long-term projections extend well into double-digit territory.

Audited by Hashex and now ranked as one of the most talked-about meme-driven tokens of the year, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction because of performance, positioning, and timing.

Ethereum: ETF Hype Meets On-Chain Fundamentals Ethereum is trading solidly above $2,600 and re-establishing itself as a cornerstone of the bull cycle. Between the successful Pectra upgrade , Layer-2 adoption, and anticipated spot ETF approval , ETH is positioned for a powerful second-half breakout. Forecasts from major research groups suggest movement toward $6,500–$12,000 , making it one of the few large-caps still loaded with upside. HBAR (Hedera): A Utility Giant Still Flying Under Radar HBAR continues to build through high-value enterprise integrations. From ESG reporting to payment rails, Hedera’s use cases remain strong. While it hasn’t exploded yet, many analysts believe it’s one catalyst away from being revalued significantly higher.

44836255,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=731060,1747713636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44836255.jpeg,U.S. senate officially approves ‘GENIUS Act’ to regulate crypto stablecoins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-senate-passes-genius-act/,"The U.S. Senate has officially approved the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025,” or the GENIUS Act. The provision, a major legislation, has established the first broad federal framework for overseeing stablecoins and constitutes a substantial leap toward mainstreaming digital assets. The development came just a week after a failed procedural vote. All 49 Democratic senators blocked a motion to invoke cloture on the bill’s consideration , halting its initial path to the floor. In the following days, reports surfaced of a bipartisan effort to revise the bill for another vote. Key Democrats jumped back aboard the measure. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Mark Warner (D-VA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-PA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD)—all of whom voted against cloture on the GENIUS Act earlier this month—supported the measure tonight. Alsobrooks and Gillibrand initially co-sponsored the bill. GENIUS Act gains momentum with bipartisan backing after procedural turnaround The bill has garnered more than 60 votes and is now expected to quickly move forward to a full floor vote, potentially as soon as tomorrow, a source familiar with the matter said. However, the bill still has to go through a vote in the House of Representatives and be signed into law by President Trump. If passed, the GENIUS Act will establish a legal basis for issuing stablecoins in the United States . Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) introduced the GENIUS Act. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Tim Scott (R-SC) served as co-sponsors of the legislation, which generated bipartisan momentum. The legislation seeks to lay down a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins that have grown substantially and now have an aggregate market cap exceeding $250 billion. Just days ago, the bill failed to clear a key procedural vote. At the time, a confluence of political factors undermined support from pro-crypto Democrats, such as concerns about President Donald Trump’s conflicts of interest related to cryptocurrency. Supporters hail the GENIUS Act as pro-dollar and innovation-driven Under the GENIUS Act, stablecoin issuers must hold cash and/or Treasury securities reserves and comply with AML/ATF standards. The bill also authorizes the Federal Reserve to regulate stablecoins so that these digital assets function safely and securely. Some members of Congress had criticized the GENIUS Act even as it won bipartisan backing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was worried that the measure would be a boon to President Donald Trump, who could use it to expand his stablecoin venture, “USD1,” and his meme coin. She said it allowed Trump to regulate his own digital currency. Supporters, however, viewed the GENIUS Act as a necessary step toward responsible innovation. Senator Bill Hagerty called it a “pro-growth” initiative and “the first-ever regulatory framework for payment stablecoins.” Next week, the Senate will make history when we pass the GENIUS Act that establishes the first ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. This bill will cement US dollar dominance, protect customers, increase demand for US treasuries, and ensure that innovation… — Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) May 16, 2025 Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, also endorsed the bill . The GENIUS Act is about securing the future of American finance. Stablecoins strengthen U.S. dollar dominance, modernize our outdated payment rails, and give Americans faster, cheaper, and more transparent ways to move money. Digital asset technology is the next generation of… — Bo Hines (@BoHines) May 16, 2025 Justin Slaughter, VP of regulatory affairs at Paradigm and a Democratic staffer, offered a pragmatic endorsement , saying this is “close to the best we can get for years and years.” Amanda Tuminelli, executive director and chief legal officer of the DeFi Education Fund, urged bipartisan backing , arguing that clear rules around stablecoins would benefit consumers, small businesses, and the global standing of the U.S. dollar. Echoing this sentiment, Ji Kim, acting CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, described the vote as “a critical step” toward regulatory clarity and said the legislation is vital for maintaining U.S. leadership in the digital finance space.

This pushed total inflows for the year to $7.5 billion, eclipsing the previous high of $7.2 billion seen in February. The influx has now erased the $7 billion in outflows from the February-March downturn. Interestingly, Ethereum stood out with strong performance. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , Ethereum experienced $205 million in inflows last week, bringing its year-to-date total to $575 million. This was indicative of a renewed investor confidence after the Pectra upgrade finally went live on May 7th, following a series of delays, as well as the appointment of co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak. Bitcoin also saw notable inflows of $557 million, though down from the previous week, possibly influenced by the Federal Reserve’s continued hawkish stance. Meanwhile, short-bitcoin products attracted $5.8 million for the fourth consecutive week, which suggested investor hedging as prices climb. During the same period, Sui and XRP recorded inflows of $9.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively, while Cardano and Chainlink posted smaller inflows of $0.5 million and $0.2 million. On the other hand, Solana witnessed $0.89 million in outflows, and multi-asset products saw a larger $2.9 million in withdrawals. Regional investor sentiment showed clear divisions. The US, for one, saw strong weekly inflows of $681 million, with Germany and Hong Kong contributing $86.3 million and $24.2 million, marking Hong Kong’s largest since November 2024. Australia and Switzerland followed with modest inflows of $13.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively. However, sentiment soured in Sweden, Canada, and Brazil, which recorded outflows of $16.3 million, $13.5 million, and $3.9 million over the past week, respectively.

The price is now trading above $2.350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.40 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

A clear move above the $2.50 resistance might send the price toward the $2.60 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance or even $2.680 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.80. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.420 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.350 level. The next major support is near the $2.320 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.320 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.20 support. The next major support sits near the $2.120 zone.
