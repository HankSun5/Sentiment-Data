Exculpatory Evidence Discovered, Lawyers for Roman Storm Say According to Storm’s counsel , the government has “possessed exculpatory materials” regarding evidence pertinent to the developer’s criminal trial since August 2023. NEW: Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm's attorneys moved to reconsider case dismissal, alleging prosecutors hid exculpatory 2023 FinCEN communications suggesting non-custodial cryptocurrency mixers aren't ""money transmitting businesses."" pic.twitter.com/9LmpyQtkIh — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) May 19, 2025 The defense lawyers claim that the federal prosecutors’ view of Tornado Cash as a “money-transmitting business” goes against their August 2023 statement where FinCEN officials claimed that fellow crypto mixer, Samourai Wallet, does not count as a money transmitter given its non-custodial nature. Given that Tornado Cash is also non-custodial, Storm’s team argues that the government is going against its own stance by indicting the crypto developer . “The disclosures in the Samourai case reveal that the government, at the very least, played fast and loose and, at worst, affirmatively misled this court,” the letter reads. U.S. Prosecutors Defend Their Stance Meanwhile, prosecutors are pushing back on the defense’s claims after Storm’s team expressed “concern about the government’s belated disclosures in the Samourai case” in a May 8 letter. “The Government disclosed all known substantive communications between the prosecution team and FinCEN regarding Samourai Wallet months in advance of pretrial motions and trial,” U.S. prosecutors said in a recent filing. “Indeed, the defendants will have seven months to make use of the information before trial,” they added. “Nothing more is warranted.” U.S. Sees Changing Crypto Regulations The controversial Tornado Cash case comes amid shifting crypto regulations in the United States as President Donald Trump relaxes rulemaking on the blockchain sector . On April 7, the Deputy Attorney General’s Office released a memorandum stating it would, in part, “no longer target virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and offline wallets for the acts of their end users or unwitting violations of regulations.” The post Roman Storm’s Defense Team Accuses U.S. Government Of Withholding Key Exculpatory Evidence appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Crypto mixers|Regulation|tornado cash,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-19 22:40:51

According to sources familiar with the matter cited by Bloomberg, the DOJ’s criminal division in Washington is examining the circumstances surrounding the breach, which has raised serious concerns about cybersecurity within the crypto sector. Coinbase Collaborates With DOJ Amid Major Data Breach Coinbase disclosed that the breach involved criminal actors bribing employees and contractors in India to gain access to sensitive client data. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, stated: We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Importantly, the exchange’s CLO clarified that while Coinbase itself is not under investigation, the DOJ is focused on the criminals involved in the breach. The incident first came to light when Coinbase received an email from an unidentified threat actor on May 11, claiming to possess information about certain customer accounts alongside internal documents. The company anticipates losses ranging from $180 million to $400 million due to the cyberattack. $20 Million Reward Fund After Rejecting Ransom While the attackers managed to steal some data, including names, addresses, and email addresses, the exchange confirmed that login credentials and passwords were not compromised. In a statement on May 15, Coinbase reassured its users via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that it would not succumb to the attackers’ demands. The criminals had requested a ransom of $20 million.

Trading volumes have nearly doubled in the same period, signaling heightened interest as DOGE approached the key $0.23 resistance level. Meanwhile, other leading meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) have also dipped around 4.4%, suggesting the entire sector is gearing up for a bounce as sellers get exhausted. So, is the baseline Dogecoin price prediction still bullish — or does this past week’s dip signal deeper trouble ahead for the top meme coin? Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Forms Bull Flag and Could Rise to $0.35 DOGE’s price action has stalled in the past week after the token reached the $0.25 area as it seems that this is a key level for market participants. The price has dropped to its lowest point in a week already at around $0.21 as momentum indicators were already flashing sell signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) had surged to overbought levels already while the MACD’s histogram had been trending lower for four days in a row. Although the price action still favors a bullish Dogecoin price prediciton, the rally had already reached a point of exhaustion already and justifies a pullback. However, this does not necessarily mean that the uptrend is over. DOGE has formed a bullish flag pattern that could result in a higher high if the price breaks the upper bound of this formation. This resistance currently stands at around $0.23 and it is the key level to watch in the following days. Based on the flag’s pole size, a bullish breakout could push DOGE to $0.35, meaning a potential 52% gain in a relatively short period. Meanwhile, the key support to watch apart from the flag’s lower bound would be the range between $0.18 and $0.19 as a bounce off this level will still maintain the asset’s bullish price structure intact. While DOGE’s outlook may be a bit uncertain at the time, the top crypto presales of the year like Best Wallet (BEST) offer the highest upside potential as their tokens are offered at a heavily discounted price. Best Wallet (BEST) Set to Launch Groundbreaking Web3 Storage Solution – $12.5M Raised and Counting Best Wallet (BEST) is rapidly positioning itself as a game-changer in the crypto space, offering a next-gen wallet that supports assets across 60 blockchains, delivers ultra-low swap fees, and is packed with powerful tools for modern traders.

Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty. Bitcoin ETF inflows are recovering, and analysts predict BTC could reach $110,000–$444,000 in 2025. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is holding above $100,000, leading Fidelity Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer to say the crypto asset could reclaim its position as a leading store-of-value contender. Timmer’s recent analysis highlights a convergence in the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two assets are increasingly comparable in risk-adjusted returns. The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility. The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio. Source: X.com From an allocation standpoint, Timmer recommended a 4:1 gold-to-Bitcoin ratio for a store-of-value hedge, highlighting an intriguing observation. Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!” While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic n ewsletter , pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated, “Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison. Source: X.com Gold, with a 30.33% price gain in 2025 compared to Bitcoin’s 3.84%, benefited from its stability during economic unease. Additionally, the analysis added that Bitcoin performed better as a “high-beta growth asset,” thriving in rising liquidity and fiat debasement environments. Recent developments signal a shift: US trade policy clarity, a softer Federal Reserve stance, and easing financial conditions have spurred steady inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Related: Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs Bitcoin is on track for new highs in 2025 A higher Sharpe ratio is a positive metric for Bitcoin, significantly increasing the probability of reaching new all-time highs above $110,000 in May.

Bitcoin Suisse head of research Dominic Weibei said, “In this environment, Bitcoin has emerged as the Swiss army knife asset. Whether equities rally or bonds crumble, BTC trades on its supply-demand fundamentals, delivering a win-win profile that traditional assets simply can't offer.” Similarly, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin has a ""decent chance"" of reaching $250,000 or more in 2025, driven by its interplay with gold, according to a gold-based forecast. The report uses a scenario-based framework rooted in its gold model to project Bitcoin’s potential revaluation as a non-sovereign hard asset. If Bitcoin’s network value, measured in gold, follows a power curve, and gold maintains its current value, analysts suggest it could hit $444,000 in 2025. However, a more conservative estimate by Bitcoin analyst Apsk32 points to a ""reasonable"" target of $220,000 for the year.

On-chain data shows the number of non-zero SOL addresses recently hit a new all-time high. Solana (SOL) price has regained bullish momentum since early April 2025. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $99.8 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $6 billion, has formed higher highs and higher lows in the past seven weeks, thus signaling a rising trend in the higher timeframe. The rising SOL trend coincides with the Bitcoin price rebound above $100k amid an anticipated reversal of the BTC’e weekly dominance. Furthermore, the rising crypto optimism favors an altseason in the coming months, bolstered by the notable rebound of Ether against BTC . Solana Network Records Mixed Fundamentals The Solana network remains a key player in the DeFi space, mostly in the memecoin ecosystem. The rising adoption of Solana-based memecoins has helped increase the non-zero SOL address in the recent past. According to on-chain data analysis from Glassnode, the number of Solana wallets holding at least 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high (ATH) of 11.16 million. Meanwhile, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on VanEck’s proposed Solana ETF on Monday for further review and consultations. Midterm Expectations for SOL Price After hitting a local target of above $174 in the past two weeks, the SOL price has been trapped in a short-term correction. In the 1-hour timeframe, SOL price has formed a parallel symmetrical falling trend in the past few days. Following Monday’s SOL price rebound from the lower border of the symmetrical falling trend, SOL price is positioned to rally towards the upper border in the coming days. A potential close above the symmetrical falling trend will propel SOL price towards the next short-term target of above $200. However, a further correction, in the coming days, will likely dump SOL price towards the next significant support level above $157.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 23:00:11

As ETH consolidates, Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are all seeing increased liquidity and investor attention, each positioning for the next major move in a shifting market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 40x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace among presales in 2025, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. Analysts are forecasting up to 40x returns before listings, driven by a capped 100 billion token supply, strong branding, and a Hashex audit for security. The project is dominating early-stage dashboards, with traders and analysts alike highlighting its Q3 listing narrative and daily community growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s structure and momentum are making it the top choice for those seeking powerful upside before the next wave of listings. As each stage fills, the entry window narrows, and those recognizing the setup are moving quickly. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Bitcoin: Liquidity Builds as Key Levels Approach Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at approximately $103,405, reflecting a 1.1% decline over the past 24 hours. The market is monitoring support above $100,000, with volatility intensifying after a weekend surge to $106,540. As institutional inflows remain steady, BTC’s price stability is encouraging capital to explore dynamic opportunities, including high-upside altcoins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana: Bullish Patterns and Institutional Optimism Solana (SOL) is priced at $171.54 as of May 19, 2025, consolidating just below resistance after a recent climb. Technical analysts suggest a breakout above $175 could trigger a move toward $200, but for now, some investors are rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper growth while SOL trades sideways. Avalanche: DeFi Growth and Technical Strength Avalanche (AVAX) is trading around $22.58, with analysts forecasting an average of $19.74 for May and a potential peak of $22.58.

Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Kaspa (KAS) continue to gain ground and attract attention, but another name is quickly becoming hard to ignore: BlockDAG. This rising project is shaping a strong case to join the ranks of leading digital currencies. Unlike quick-trending coins, BlockDAG offers practical features, meaningful partnerships, and a tech-driven structure that makes it stand out. Priced at just $0.0020 in its current crypto presale phase, BlockDAG aims for a launch price of $0.05, offering a projected 2,400% return. It may turn out to be one of the top crypto coins in 2025 worth watching. BlockDAG’s Momentum Grows With $255M Raised Recognized as one of the top crypto coins in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised $255 million in its presale while offering BDAG coins at $0.0020 for a limited time. With the launch price confirmed at $0.05, this gives buyers a projected ROI of 2,400%. Batch 28 is already at $0.0262, indicating swift progress through the presale stages. A total of 20.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold, reflecting growing interest. What separates BlockDAG from others is its EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, allowing developers to launch Ethereum-based dApps with ease. It’s tailored for builders seeking seamless usability. BlockDAG also passed a complete CertiK audit and sold over 17,600 mining units. It’s already operational, not just an idea. Five exchanges are confirmed to list BDAG, and 15 more will be announced during the awaited GO LIVE reveal. That’s 20 listings ready to go once trading begins. Those following the top crypto coins in 2025 with early access and a strong system will likely find BlockDAG a top choice. The $0.0020 price will soon be gone once its value becomes more widely recognized. Solana (SOL): Building Through Market Fluctuations Solana has shown it can recover fast. At about $173, it rebounded after news broke of FTX planning to offload $5 billion in assets, including $236 million in unstaked SOL. This raised some selling pressure but didn’t shake Solana’s overall standing. The platform’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) grew from $7.5 billion to $9.6 billion in May. This rise supports its status among the top crypto coins in 2025, especially for those drawn to reliable decentralized finance systems. Dogecoin (DOGE): Community-Driven Meme Coin Dogecoin holds near $0.2271 and is showing serious momentum. After the SEC acknowledged a 21Shares spot Dogecoin ETF filing, its active address count surged by 528%. Futures open interest climbed 70% to $1.65 billion. Many analysts expect DOGE to cross $0.24 and even aim for $0.40 if the trend keeps up. Despite its meme label, its growing use and speculative energy give it a position among the top crypto coins in 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Breaking Out Technically KAS saw a 30% jump over the last week, reaching around $0.1189. A bullish engulfing pattern and strong support at the $0.101 Fibonacci level are helping its case. Short-term goals are pointing toward $0.1554, and community enthusiasm remains high. Kaspa’s appeal includes its speed, low fees, and a solid development team, key traits among top crypto coins in 2025. To Sum Up! Who’s Leading the Pack? Solana continues gaining strength through its growing DeFi activity. Dogecoin earns attention from ETF buzz and user metrics. Kaspa’s upward trend remains intact due to chart setups and a loyal user base. Each is part of the discussion around top crypto coins in 2025. However, BlockDAG is stepping into a leading role. With its $0.0020 presale price and $0.05 confirmed launch value, EVM-compatible tech, solid audit record, and 20 exchange listings in motion, the project shows significant traction. Add the 20.8 billion coins already sold and 17,600 miners distributed, and it becomes clear that this network is well-prepared. For anyone following early-stage coins with real use and fast growth, BlockDAG ranks among the top crypto coins in 2025 that can’t be overlooked. Timing is key before wider attention sends it soaring.

Bitcoin has just recorded its highest-ever weekly close, brushing against its all-time high and sending ripples across the entire market. Confidence is back, and the numbers are loud. Sentiment charts have flipped bullish, daily volumes are climbing, and early adopters are scanning for the top coins to join today. With BTC holding firm, the rising tide could lift more than just legacy tokens—new players like Qubetics are showing signs of becoming serious contenders before even hitting major exchanges. Qubetics ($TICS) is rising as a strong alternative for those who missed out on earlier cycles. Its utility-first approach is putting it at the center of global finance conversations, especially with its recent spotlight on cross-border payments. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash is experiencing a technical comeback, supported by bullish community sentiment, and Filecoin is making headlines by joining forces with Lockheed Martin. These developments aren’t just news—they’re shaping the strategic plays for this quarter. Each of these coins is reacting to the new wave of crypto momentum, but the real edge could lie in knowing where the next breakout might come from. One name continues to come up: Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator with a growing presale narrative. How Qubetics Is Reshaping International Payments With Real-World Utility The growing need for fast, secure, and low-cost global payments is more than a fintech buzzword—it’s a daily operational demand. Qubetics answers this challenge head-on with its near-instant cross-border transaction solution that leverages the TICS token. It’s not just another blockchain tool—it’s built for the institutions and enterprises that fuel global trade. Whether it’s a U.S. startup working with remote developers across Southeast Asia, or a Canadian e-commerce business sourcing goods from Latin America, Qubetics removes the common roadblocks—transaction delays, high fees, and currency friction. For financial institutions, Qubetics brings the blockchain backbone needed to make settlements seamless and transparent. It streamlines fund transfers without needing to rely on outdated rails. Picture a mid-sized U.S. bank facilitating instant remittances for expats sending money to their families in developing economies—Qubetics makes that happen without intermediaries or unnecessary lag. And for everyday users? It’s about sending, spending, and converting digital assets on the go with no headaches. With this kind of practical firepower, Qubetics isn’t just joining the race—it’s changing how it’s run. That’s why it stands among the top coins to join today. Why the Qubetics Presale Stands Out as One of the Top Coins to Join Today The Qubetics presale isn’t your average crypto fundraising story—it’s built with structure, predictability, and real reward potential. Each presale stage lasts exactly seven days, ending every Sunday at 12 AM. And every week without fail, the price rises by 10%. That means early buyers know exactly when their entry window closes. Currently, the presale is in Stage 35 with a token price of $0.2785, over $17.1 million has already been raised, and more than 513 million $TICS tokens have been sold to over 26,700 holders. Now, what makes this one of the top coins to join today is the projected ROI baked into these price points. If $TICS reaches just $1 post-presale, that’s a 258.95% return. If it hits $5, the return jumps to 1,694.74%. At $6, that’s a 2,053.68% increase. A $10 price point after mainnet launch? That would be 3,489.47% ROI. And if Qubetics reaches $15 after launch, that’s a whopping 5,284.21% ROI. Take this for example: a $5,000 investment at today’s Stage 35 price nets you 17,950 $TICS. If $TICS climbs to $10, that stack becomes worth $179,500—with zero need to time the market, because the crypto presale itself is staged for growth. This kind of structure is rare in early crypto. It’s why the Qubetics presale is being tagged by many as the best crypto presale in 2025. For those still weighing their entry, this stage closes in days—not weeks. And with the mainnet dropping in Q2 2025, the clock’s ticking for those waiting on the sidelines. Bitcoin Cash Shows Renewed Energy With Bullish Sentiment Growing Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is picking up serious momentum among community members. As of today, it’s trading around $379.16, showing a daily dip of -5.04%, but the broader sentiment tells a different story. According to Binance’s consensus rating, 35.00% of users are “very bullish” on BCH’s future. Add to that 25% marking it as “bullish” and another 12.5% keeping a neutral stance, the outlook leans overwhelmingly positive. What makes this different from earlier cycles is the clear pattern seen on its technical forecast. The chart shows a post-2024 bounce, with projections heading towards the $450 to $500 zone by 2030 if trends continue. Market participants are reading this as an entry window while prices are still below the 2021 highs. It’s not just a historical bounce—it’s backed by a community that’s recalibrating its outlook amid broader market optimism. These signs aren’t abstract. They’re the same kind of patterns that predate significant rallies—especially when major tokens like Bitcoin are stabilizing near peak highs. BCH may not make flashy headlines every day, but it’s staking its place as one of the top coins to join today based on both sentiment data and upward technical movement. Filecoin’s Partnership With Lockheed Martin Could Redefine Space Data Storage Filecoin just stepped beyond blockchain and straight into aerospace. According to the latest reports, Filecoin has teamed up with Lockheed Martin, aiming to reshape how data is stored and transmitted in space. The partnership aims to leverage decentralized storage infrastructure for space missions—this is no longer just cloud vs. chain—it’s earth vs. orbit. This strategic collaboration brings serious real-world backing to Filecoin’s long-term vision. Lockheed Martin’s involvement speaks volumes about institutional confidence in Filecoin’s tech stack. While traditional storage systems rely on centralized control, this shift to decentralized protocol represents a massive leap toward faster, cheaper, and more secure space communications. And back on Earth, Filecoin’s credibility just skyrocketed. Its use case is no longer confined to Web3 data—this could be the architecture supporting tomorrow’s orbital networks. For community members looking for long-hold projects with government-aligned partnerships, Filecoin just made a serious case as one of the top coins to join today. Weekly Crypto Surge: What It Means for Qubetics, Filecoin, and Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin’s record-breaking weekly close isn’t just technical—it’s psychological. That bullish wave is setting the tone for other altcoins to find their footing and take off. The crypto market thrives on chain reactions, and BTC’s performance often opens doors for adjacent coins that show promise, structure, or real-world partnerships. Qubetics, which is still in its presale phase, offers a rare form of predictability amid all this volatility. With a guaranteed 10% weekly price rise, early buyers aren’t guessing—they’re planning. Bitcoin Cash is benefiting from this upward trend, reviving its bullish sentiment. And Filecoin? The Lockheed Martin deal now rides a tailwind from an increasingly optimistic market. These three are being pulled forward by different forces—but the destination looks the same. They’re not reactionary plays. They’re strategic entries in a market preparing for its next real breakout. Why These Are the Top Coins to Join Today in 2025 Each of these tokens—Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Filecoin—are delivering something different. BCH is riding a technical breakout with backing from a bullish community. Filecoin is proving it’s more than a Web3 storage player—it’s a frontier-tech protocol moving into aerospace. And Qubetics is building a payments solution on-chain that cuts across borders, fees, and friction. But what ties them all together is momentum. With BTC holding near all-time highs, the broader market is heating up. Projects with strong fundamentals, growth structures, and relevant use cases are moving to the front of the line. Qubetics, still in its presale, is being recognized among the top coins to join today, offering a lower-barrier entry with massive upside—especially considering its fixed 10% weekly increase and approaching Q2 2025 mainnet launch. For participants scanning for where to go next, the smart play is to join this best crypto presale while it’s still priced under $0.30—and to keep a close eye on Filecoin and Bitcoin Cash as this cycle unfolds.

Every stage closes on Sunday at 12 AM, with each new stage increasing token price by 10%. What is Filecoin’s role in space data transmission? Filecoin is partnering with Lockheed Martin to create decentralized data storage systems for space, marking a new use case for blockchain.

Per the newspaper Chungnyun Ilbo , experts say that US dollar-based stablecoins could have an impact on exchange rates and fiat currencies. Stablecoin Danger for South Korean Economy? The comments came at a digital assets-themed meeting of the Korea Economic Association at the FKI Tower Conference Center in Yeouido, Seoul, on May 19. The FKI Tower Conference Center in Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea. (Source: FKI TV/YouTube/Screenshot) An expert panel expressed concerns about the possible proliferation of dollar-based stablecoins in South Korea. The panel argued that stablecoin usage would reduce the volume of won-based payments made by both individuals and corporations in South Korea. It also claimed that the central Bank of Korea (BOK) could suffer as a result. The BOK, experts said, could lose the ability to manage money supplies or intervene in the foreign exchange markets. The BOK has made similar statements in recent days , in response to stablecoin-related manifesto pledges from the leading presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung .

Members of his party, the Democratic Party, have also argued that financial regulators – and not the BOK – should have the final say on stablecoin issuance. But others want to use existing stablecoins in their adoption drives. They claim that failing to adopt is hampering Seoul’s tech competitiveness. These advocates favor allowing South Korean firms and payments companies to work with high-cap stablecoins like USDT and USDC . However, Lee Seung-seok, a senior researcher at the Korea Economic Research Institute, warned: “If dollar-based stablecoins become established as a means of payment in South Korea, this could bring about structural changes in the won/dollar exchange rate determination mechanism. Exchange rates could soar due to a drop in KRW demand and an increase in demand for foreign currency.” The researcher added that dollar-based stablecoins allow for rapid capital mobility. He added that their decentralized nature “could result in large-scale capital outflows in the event of a crisis.” The market cap of USDC over the past month. (Source: CoinMarketCap) Kim Hyo-bong, a former Financial Supervisory Service official, said that Washington and Brussels were both likely to launch stablecoin legislation in 2025. Kim said: “South Korea should also make sure it acts in line with global trends.” Kang Tae-soo, a visiting professor at the KAIST Graduate School of Finance and a BOK Monetary Policy Committee member, said that stablecoins offer firms advantages in the payment and settlement spaces. But Kang concurred that stablecoins were difficult to control. He said they could sow uncertainty in the monetary and foreign exchange policy sectors. The academic argued that the BOK and the government needed to ensure adoption drives “minimize side effects and maximize advantages.” However, others warned against the dangers of over-regulation. Namgung Joo-hyun, an Associate Professor of Commercial Law at Sungkyunkwan University, said that the “global digital asset paradigm is rapidly changing.” He said: “We must take steps to ensure South Korea does not end up isolated due to excessive regulations. We need to establish a financial framework that provides both international consistency and industrial competitiveness.” Foreign direct investment in Korea fell four notches in 2024 from a year earlier, ranking 17th among the world’s top 30 economies, data from the Bank of Korea (BOK) showed Sunday. https://t.co/9oKM5UHpu1 pic.twitter.com/TWGwKHda7x — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 18, 2025 A War of Words Meanwhile, the presidential candidates’ stablecoin war of words continues. During the first televised debate between the four leading candidates for the June 3 poll, Lee Jae-myung reiterated his commitment to launching a KRW-pegged coin. But EToday reported that Lee Jun-seok, of the rival Reform Party, challenged the frontrunner on the matter. Lee Jae-myung refuted Lee Jun-seok’s challenge, claiming that “stablecoins based on fiat won collateral are stable.” However, Lee Jun-seok claimed that there were “no use cases” for any sort of stablecoins that use a peg other than the USD. He continued, explaining that USDC and USDT, combined, “account for 90% of the stablecoin market.” Lee Jun-seok asked the frontrunner what measures he would take “to prevent the illegal circulation of stablecoin funds, such as remittances to North Korea.” The post South Korean Experts Warn Seoul of Mounting ‘Stablecoin Danger’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|South Korea|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-19 23:30:00

XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Dominating Whale Accumulation in May",https://thecoinrise.com/final-pre-listing-window-xrp-solana-and-magacoin-finance-are-dominating-whale-accumulation-in-may/,"Introduction May 2025 is witnessing a sharp rotation of capital as whales accumulate select tokens. XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this movement, with on-chain data confirming high-conviction buying. Bitcoin and Hedera (HBAR) remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating 83,100 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. This strategic accumulation is happening as retail investors take profits, signaling growing institutional confidence. As BTC’s momentum steadies, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen whale accumulation surge as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project is audited by Hashex, features a capped 100 billion token supply, and offers scarcity-driven tokenomics. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading around $2.35, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next key resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Solana: Smart Money Bets on a Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading near $171, with whales accumulating over 61,000 SOL in recent months, signaling strong confidence in a potential price surge. Major smart money addresses have returned, making multi-million dollar purchases at current levels. As Solana’s whales build positions, many investors are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for similar early-stage momentum and breakout potential. HBAR: Institutional Interest and Uptrend Potential Hedera (HBAR) is trading at $0.19, with whale accumulation accelerating alongside XRP in early 2025. Analysts highlight the potential for a major rally if current support holds, especially with ETF speculation and institutional flows on the rise. In this environment, many are diversifying into high-upside projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next wave of growth. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Whale accumulation is setting the tone for May, with XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge. With a clear listing roadmap, robust demand, and Stage 8 nearly complete, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the month. The window for entry is closing-and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

Ethereum (ETH) is regaining ground with technical strength, Dogecoin (DOGE) is driven by renewed whale activity and community support, and the Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) is making waves on the back of politically powered news cycles. But for many investors looking beyond headlines, it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that is being quietly discussed as the boldest 50x entry of this crypto cycle. Here’s how these tokens are performing — and why MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly under the radar of early-stage investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A High-Momentum Entry Before Listings Begin MAGACOIN FINANCE gained traction immediately upon launch — and has maintained strong upward momentum ever since. Analysts now cite it as one of the most strategic early-stage altcoins of 2025. With investor demand already climbing, and projections forecasting up to 50x returns , MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious attention before listings have even begun. Its combination of community-first strategy, low initial pricing, and increasing visibility within crypto circles places it at the center of what many are calling 2025’s most compelling altcoin narrative . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Ethereum: Resuming Its Bullish Ascent Post-Pectra Upgrade Ethereum is now trading above $2,500 , with strong indicators following the recent Pectra upgrade , which improved network performance and scalability. Analysts forecast a potential breakout to $3,000 by month’s end, with further targets as high as $5,000–$12,000 into 2025. Institutional adoption, ETF demand, and onchain activity are all aligning to support Ethereum’s continued rise. Dogecoin: Whale Buys Drive Sentiment-Fueled Rally DOGE has rebounded from recent corrections and is building momentum once again. With over 1 billion DOGE scooped up by whales in the past month, the meme leader is showing clear signs of accumulation. Key resistance lies at $0.25–$0.26 , and a confirmed breakout could place DOGE back in a bullish trend similar to early 2021 patterns. Community sentiment and volume remain critical drivers. Official Trump Coin: Volatility Fueled by Political Utility The Official $TRUMP Coin is currently trading around $12.85 , showing signs of stabilization after a wave of volatility triggered by news of a private gala dinner with Donald Trump for top holders. The coin continues to attract politically aligned traders and event-driven speculation. While its current range is tightly bound between $10 and $14, some analysts forecast upside potential if the project sustains attention through real-world integrations and rewards. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Final Thoughts Ethereum is strengthening on the back of technical upgrades and institutional demand. Dogecoin is thriving again with clear signals of large investor accumulation. $TRUMP remains highly event-driven and speculative — tied to a broader cultural and political narrative. Yet among all this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the project many insiders and analysts are watching closest. With early interest mounting and bold ROI projections in the spotlight, it could very well be the standout performer of the 2025 altcoin rally .

XRP is showing short-term bullish momentum, and Chainlink is posting strong technical signals. But away from the spotlight, a lesser-known name, Unstaked, is quietly building a case for future gains. With a current price of $0.009267 and over $6.2 million raised by Stage 13 of its presale, Unstaked blends open metrics, task-based rewards, and a token model that’s drawing early attention. Analysts now say a $1 target by 2027 is not out of reach, placing it firmly in the race as the crypto with the most potential. While XRP and Chainlink continue their recovery, Unstaked is focused on building a system from the ground up. In a market leaning more toward fundamentals, that approach could make all the difference. XRP in Short-Term Rally: Price May Hit $5.50 in Under 2 Months XRP has seen a rebound in recent weeks. After reaching a yearly high of $3.40 in January, it dropped to $1.60 before climbing back above $2. Many analysts see this range as a setup for a larger breakout. Elliott Wave analyst XForceGlobal forecasts a move to $5.40 or $5.50 in the next 50 days, based on a pattern often followed by strong third-wave surges. This technical view is backed by recent events, like Ripple’s SEC settlement and the rising odds of a Spot XRP ETF approval, now estimated at over 75%. Still, some remain cautious. XRP’s short-term rally relies heavily on strong institutional use, which may take time to build. Because of this, some traders are also exploring early-stage projects with faster upside. Chainlink’s Bullish Signs Are Building, But Growth Remains Gradual Chainlink (LINK) is showing key signs of recovery after a long dip. At $17.27, LINK has gained 70% since its April low of $10.21 and is now above its 50-day average. Analysts point to several positive chart setups, including an inverse head-and-shoulders and a broadening pattern on the 4-hour chart. Open interest has doubled to $768 million, and funding rates have held positive for more than a week. These are strong signs of increased long positions and rising trader interest. Chainlink has also seen real progress, adding 12 new integrations across eight chains and becoming an official provider for BNB Chain’s Kickstart Program. These steps show growing demand and usage. Yet despite these Chainlink bullish signs, its price is still below this year’s high of $27.30. While the climb continues, it’s slower than what some are looking for. That’s why early-stage tokens gaining momentum are drawing more attention now. Unstaked Aims for $1 by 2027 with Task-Based Rewards While big-name tokens dominate the news, Unstaked is steadily gaining momentum and funding. Now priced at $0.009267, the project has already collected more than $6.2 million by Stage 13 of its presale, showing growing support from early participants. Unstaked works through a Proof of Intelligence model where rewards come from actions, input, and real user involvement. That means users earn for what they do instead of just holding. It’s a system based on verified results, made for long-term scaling and built around real activity. One of its strong points is liquidity support, built through structured presale phases and clear token planning. This helps make sure that once Unstaked reaches exchanges, there will be volume and depth, limiting price swings and slippage. The team has also launched a $1 million Gleam contest, giving 20 winners a $50,000 prize each. Entry requires task completion and a minimum of $100 in UNSD holdings. This approach brings new users and encourages real money to enter the system. With clear goals, useful features, and a working reward system, Unstaked is moving forward without relying on hype. Its structure and plans support its position as a top pick for long-term growth, including a possible $1 value by 2027. Given its confirmed launch price of $0.1819, early buyers are eyeing up to 27x returns before future gains are even counted. Final Say As crypto starts to rise again, the line between fast movement and real utility is more visible than ever. XRP shows strong short-term potential backed by ETF buzz and better legal footing. Chainlink (LINK) shows positive signs in its network, though its progress is steady rather than fast. At the same time, Unstaked is doing something else. It’s creating a full ecosystem that includes utility, clear rewards, and working tools. With $6.2 million already raised in crypto presale , a $1 million Gleam campaign in progress, and a reward model in place, the platform is already running on measurable results. For those looking at the crypto with the most potential, it might not be the most familiar name that takes the lead. It may be the one already proving its use at an early price. At $0.009267, Unstaked is one of the rare low-cost options already showing clear signs of delivery.

Bitcoin is reclaiming dominance, Ethereum is surging to new highs, and investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE-a rising altcoin that could become this year’s biggest early-stage win. With XRP, TON, and Solana also attracting capital, the altcoin market is entering a new phase of speculation and aggressive positioning. The big question now: Could these tokens deliver the next 15,000% run-up? Let’s break down the leaders that are capturing analysts’ attention right now-and the altcoin that’s turning heads as its listing nears. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Bitcoin Eyes $250,000 as Institutional Demand Accelerates Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $103,405, consolidating after a volatile weekend but holding above key support. Analysts from Unchained and Changelly forecast a possible run to $250,000 by year-end 2025, with an average price prediction for May around $120,555. Institutional inflows, ETF adoption, and a maturing macro backdrop are fueling bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes, capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where early-stage entries offer the potential for exponential returns. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing major attention in 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% potential returns, with some calling a $1 target by year-end “not out of reach” given current momentum. MAGA’s capped supply of 100 billion tokens (45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and unique political meme appeal are driving rapid community growth and early-stage investor participation. Key highlights : Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion token cap, 45% in presale HashEx-audited contracts and strong grassroots momentum Analysts forecast 35x–185x returns, with $1 as a stretch target As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity-one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with a more transparent structure and scarcity-driven upside. Analysts say a 35x surge looks conservative, with 50x or even 150x possible if current trends continue. Ethereum’s Bullish Breakout and Layer-2 Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators are bullish, with ETH breaking above its 50-day EMA and forming a classic bull flag pattern. If ETH can close above the $2,700 resistance, analysts see a move to $2,750–$2,900 in May and a year-end target between $4,392 and $5,925. Institutional adoption, DeFi growth, and Layer-2 upgrades are all strengthening ETH’s long-term outlook. As Ethereum’s rally matures, some investors are rotating capital into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. XRP: Institutional Flows and Bullish Projections XRP is trading at $2.33 and attracting whale accumulation, with over 880 million tokens acquired by large holders in May. Analysts expect a breakout to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end, with long-term targets as high as $12.50 if ETF approvals and global adoption accelerate. While XRP’s setup is strong, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns remains open. Toncoin and Solana: Quiet Strength and Technical Upside Toncoin (TON) is trading near $2.84, with forecasts for 2025 ranging from $2.77 to $2.96 and technical analysis pointing to steady growth as adoption increases. Solana (SOL) is holding at $172, consolidating after its 80% rally from recent lows, with analysts targeting $250–$400 as the next major resistance zone. As both TON and SOL maintain bullish structures, investors are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for the kind of early-stage momentum that can deliver outsized gains. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts Between Bitcoin’s ETF-driven surge, Ethereum’s bullish breakout, and the institutional momentum behind XRP, TON, and Solana, the next crypto cycle is already taking shape. But among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only early-stage entry still offering ground-floor potential and 15,000% upside. With a clear listing roadmap, robust investor demand, and Stage 8 nearing closure, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the best shot at a 25x–35x return in 2025. The opportunity is narrowing-and smart investors are already taking notice.

The Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction points toward $0.35, as Stellar gears up to bring $3 billion in real-world assets on-chain. Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) breakout news has traders buzzing after a 680% surge in daily users and $100 targets enter the chat. But if you’re hunting for the best new crypto to buy , there’s a different name stealing the spotlight, Web3 ai . This isn’t just a headline grabber. Web3 ai is already rolling out cross-chain AI utilities like trading bots, fraud detection, and DeFi analysis, all powered by its native token, $WAI. The presale price? Still just $0.000365. Early buyers got in at $0.0003, and analysts are calling the jump to $1 a realistic next step. With working tech and deep crypto integration, this is exactly what traders are racing to lock in. $WAI at $0.000365: Why Smart Money Is Rushing Into Web3 ai Web3 ai isn’t waiting around. It’s already shipping real products. While others pitch empty promises, this project has 12 live AI tools in development, built for everyday and pro users alike. Arbitrage bots, rebalancing engines, scam trackers, and alpha-generating signals, $WAI powers them all. Currently in stage 5 of a 50-stage presale, $WAI is selling for $0.000365. Stage 1 was priced at $0.0003, and the token will list at $0.005242. With $4.2 million already raised, it’s clear that momentum is building fast. The numbers say it all: a run from $0.000365 to $1 could turn early entries into massive wins. What separates Web3 ai from the pack? It’s delivering from day one. No waiting, no delays, just real AI tools ready to go. If you’ve been wondering what the best new crypto to buy looks like, this is the one analysts can’t ignore. It has the product, the price point, and the upside, all mapped out. Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction Looks Strong With RWA Momentum The Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction has turned bullish after a 50% bounce from April’s lows, now hovering around $0.30. Targets vary from $0.25 to $0.39, with some models even pointing to $0.88, driven by Stellar’s massive 2025 plan to bring $3 billion in real-world assets to its blockchain. With new support from Paxos, SG Forge, and Mastercard’s Crypto Credential network, Stellar is doubling down on cross-border payments and institutional adoption. Technical signs show a breakout forming, with resistance near $0.357. Still, how fast the Stellar Development Foundation executes will determine whether the next leg higher happens. For now, interest in Stellar is climbing alongside network upgrades. Avalanche (AVAX) Breakout News Sparks Bullish Sentiment The latest Avalanche (AVAX) breakout news is grabbing attention after AVAX hit $24.38 and daily users exploded by over 680% in just a month. A fresh $250 million funding round is fueling growth, while developers rush in with renewed interest. Analysts are eyeing a short-term cap at $30, with long-range targets stretching toward $100. AVAX is shaking off its corrective phase and entering a bullish structure. Support sits near $21, and daily stablecoin volumes are above $1.3 billion, showing serious liquidity. If Avalanche keeps this pace, its user base and token value could push it back into the top 10. Add platform upgrades this quarter, and AVAX is shaping up as a major contender again. Wrapping Up! Both the Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction and Avalanche (AVAX) breakout news have given traders reasons to stay bullish. But what analysts are really watching now is Web3 ai. At $0.000365 in stage 5 and a launch price of $0.005242, this AI-powered platform already raised $4.2 million and is gaining speed. This isn’t just a presale, it’s a project with working products, multi-chain access, and a token that powers real functionality. That’s why investors aren’t waiting. With every stage, the price rises, and the FOMO only gets stronger. For anyone tracking the best new crypto to buy , Web3 ai looks like the one you don’t want to miss.

Current Bitcoin Rally Not Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktakes post by contributor avocado_onchain, last year’s BTC bull cycle – which saw the leading cryptocurrency create and break multiple all-time highs (ATHs) – was accompanied by sharp spikes in Binance market buy volume and funding rates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stochastic RSI Signals Brewing Bullish Momentum – ATH Incoming? Notably, a sudden increase in funding rates was twice followed by a sharp price pullback due to overheating. In this context, overheating refers to excessive bullish leverage in futures markets that drives up the cost of long positions, signalling overly aggressive sentiment that often precedes a market correction. The following chart illustrates these corrections triggered by excessive leverage in BTC futures. Specifically, boxes 1 and 2 show sharp rises in Binance funding rates, initially accompanied by price increases, then extended periods of correction. However, the current rally appears different. According to avocado_onchain, Bitcoin’s ongoing rebound is occurring without an overheated funding rate. In fact, Binance market buy volume is trending downward – as shown in box 3 of the chart – which contrasts with previous bull cycles. The analyst argues that these are signs of a healthier rally, as earlier bull runs were marked by overheated funding rates and abrupt corrections, which weakened investor sentiment. In contrast, the current rally has maintained relatively stable funding rates, suggesting more cautious and sustainable market behavior. Despite short-term price fluctuations, market buy volume has shown a steady upward trend since 2023, as marked by the yellow arrow in the chart. The analyst notes: This indicates that buying sentiment remains favorable for further upside, suggesting that it’s not yet time to consider an exit. We can’t predict exactly when Bitcoin will break its previous high, but current on-chain and market data signals remain very constructive. Other Indicators Point Toward New ATH Besides the stable funding rates and encouraging market buy volumes, BTC is also showing several other positive signs pointing toward a new ATH for the flagship digital asset in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says For example, on-chain data shows that long-term holders are not selling, even as BTC trades near its previous ATH of $108,786, recorded in January. This behavior suggests that these investors anticipate further upside. That said, analysts caution against overly optimistic expectations, noting that Bitcoin may still be far from experiencing a true supply shock. At press time, BTC is trading at $102,393, down 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

While on a trip to Washington, D.C., where he advocates for balanced and inclusive digital asset regulations, Garlinghouse expressed disappointment on X (formerly Twitter). “I hope you will reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” Garlinghouse wrote, inviting Senator Lummis to join him for a public discussion via X Spaces or a live event . He stressed the importance of supporting all blockchain networks—not just Bitcoin—especially given Lummis chairs the Senate Digital Assets Subcommittee and represents Wyoming, a state known for its crypto-friendly stance. Crypto community divides as Garlinghouse challenges Senator Lummis’s Bitcoin-only focus Garlinghouse’s remarks underscore continuing fears that Bitcoin is making other digital assets and the firms that help develop blockchain technology obsolete. The scrapped meeting drew reactions from members of the crypto community. Some accused the Senator of being biased and expressed frustration over her stance. On X, user @DarkScarf89 expressed curiosity as to why the Senator had refused a meeting, pointing to a divergence in support of a level playing field that might not quite match the Bitcoin-only narrative. Bitcoin maximalists, however, lauded Lummis. Troy Cross thanked her “for fighting against the scammers,” a move that could suggest skepticism toward Ripple and its XRP token. This conversation illustrates the friction that exists between Bitcoin maximalists and proponents of a wider, more welcoming regulatory strategy. Industry participants increasingly demand models that apply to all digital assets, not only Bitcoin. The scandal has done little to waver Senator Lummis’ love for Bitcoin. She has advocated that Americans consider Bitcoin a long-term investment , a hedge against inflation, and a weakening U.S. dollar. “I encourage people to save Bitcoin for their retirement, for their future,” Lummis recently stated. Her strong Bitcoin focus has earned both praise from the Bitcoin community and criticism from other parts of the crypto ecosystem. Nonetheless, Lummis has worked collaboratively on crypto legislation beyond Bitcoin. She and Senator Bernie Moreno co-introduced a bill to improve digital asset tax treatment. They expressed frustration over the bipartisan GENIUS Act’s failure to pass—a bill designed to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. CME XRP futures ignite demand for Spot ETF approval and regulatory clarity Today’s launch of CME XRP futures shifts attention to the pending approval of a spot XRP ETF. With futures trading attracting institutional interest, regulatory clarity on XRP-related products is increasingly urgent. Garlinghouse previously expressed optimism that a spot XRP ETF could be approved by the end of 2025, especially following the conclusion of Ripple’s legal dispute with the SEC. Meanwhile, analysts like Fred Rispoli note XRP’s potential role in a proposed digital asset reserve outlined in a Trump-era executive order, adding another layer of complexity to XRP’s regulatory outlook. Garlinghouse backs pro-crypto legislation as Senate prepares to debate stablecoin bill Ripple CEO told his followers on X that he was heading to Washington to support what he called “sensible pro-crypto” legislation focused on stablecoins and market structure. He said he was encouraged to see lawmakers recognizing crypto as a multichain industry “as it should be.” Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin. They are typically pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar or commodities like gold. On December 17, 2024, Ripple launched its own stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). Senator Cynthia Lummis, a well-known crypto advocate, previously introduced the BITCOIN Act, which proposes creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. She recently said senators have agreed on the final wording of new Senate stablecoin legislation and expects the bill to reach the floor next week. The bill in question is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. Introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), it is co-sponsored by Senators Lummis, Tim Scott (R-SC), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The GENIUS bill has faced roadblocks — most notably due to Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), opposing it — owing to President Donald Trump-linked USD1 stablecoin .

ADA price has signaled bullish sentiment catalyzed by increased adoption from institutional investors. Cardano (ADA) price has moved in tandem with the wider altcoin market, amid anticipated altseason. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of $33 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $854 million, dropped around 10 percent in the past seven days to trade about $0.74 on Monday, during the late-North American trading session. Nonetheless, ADA price has been in a recovery mode in the past few weeks akin to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Moreover, on-chain data analysis shows an increased capital inflow to crypto investment products, fueled by the geo-political and economic uncertainty. Cardano Founder Under Scrutiny for Fraud Claims The Cardano network has found itself between thin ice as some on-chain analysis suggests a trust-misuse by founder Charles Hoskinson. According to Masato Alexander, an NFT artist, Hoskinson manipulated the Cardano network, during the 2021 Allegra hard fork, to seize control of 318 million ADA coins. Alexander noted that Hoskinson defrauded early investors by using Genesis keys to rewrite the Cardano ledger, by redirecting unclaimed tokens from the 2017 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) into Cardano’s reserves without community approval. “From the data we have, we know that a significant sum, totaling 318,200,635,000,000 Lovelace, which translates to 318,200,635 ADA, departed from our active set. These UTxOs, residing in 465 distinct addresses, played their part, however brief or long, in the immutable story of Cardano,” Alexander noted . Although the top Cardano team has denied the allegations including Hoskinson, an on-chain investigation is expected to be conducted in the coming weeks. Mid-term Expectations for ADA Price In the daily timeframe, ADA price has established a rising trend in the past few weeks. After breaking out of a macro-falling wedge pattern in April, ADA price has gradually gained bullish momentum characterized by higher highs and higher lows. In the four-hour time frame, ADA price has formed a falling symmetrical parallel channel, likely a continuation pattern. A consistent close above the upper border of the falling channel will set the precedent of a fresh rally towards the short term target about $1.14.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|FORKS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 00:15:24

Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19. Alpenglow consists of Votor, which processes voting transactions and block finalization logic, and Rotor, a data dissemination protocol that would replace Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping system and aim to reduce the time it takes for all nodes to agree on the network state. Source: Anza Anza researchers claimed that “Alpenglow will shatter both these latency bounds” and the project expects it to reach actual finality in about 150 milliseconds, rivaling internet infrastructure . “A median latency of 150 [milliseconds] does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance.” Votor — which would replace TowerBFT — would aim to finalize blocks in a single round if 80% of the stake is participating, and in two rounds if only 60% of the stake is responsive. Related: DeFi lender Aave reaches $40B in value locked onchain These two voting modes are integrated and run concurrently, with finalization taking place as soon as the faster of the two paths terminates. Anza’s researchers claimed this model would result in “unprecedented finalization latency” while enabling it to operate more effectively under “harsh network conditions.” Alpenglow won’t fix Solana’s network outages The project’s white paper noted that switching to Alpenglow wouldn’t completely shield Solana from the network outages that it has experienced in the past. Solana currently only has one production-ready client, Agave, meaning any security vulnerability in Agave can disrupt the entire Solana network. However, a new independent validator client called Firedancer is set to launch on Solana’s mainnet sometime this year, which will provide client diversification for the network.

And for those watching closely, it’s starting to feel like we’ve seen this story before. A Look Back: When ADA, SHIB, and DOGE Shocked the Market Cardano (ADA) wasn’t always a top-tier altcoin. It had spent years trading under the radar before smart contract capabilities were introduced through the Alonzo hard fork in September 2021. Around that time, ADA had surged to an all-time high of $3.10, driven by developer activity and ecosystem growth. That move placed Cardano squarely in the spotlight. Shiba Inu (SHIB), on the other hand, rose to fame in record time. Its price had skyrocketed by over 1,000% within weeks in 2021. Initially dismissed as another meme token, SHIB drew in a wave of investors and reached a peak of $0.000090. That rally showcased how quickly retail attention could turn into real momentum. Dogecoin (DOGE) followed a similar arc. In 2021, DOGE was propelled by social media and celebrity endorsements. One week in April saw the price jump more than 400%, and by May, it had reached $0.74—its all-time high. Despite being a joke coin at launch, DOGE’s community and visibility helped it carve out a lasting presence in the market. Each of these assets shared a common theme: they started from modest beginnings and reached massive valuations, fueled by a mix of community, development, and market timing. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized platform built on blockchain technology, designed to provide non-custodial lending and borrowing solutions. Its model empowers users to supply digital assets, earn passive income through mtTokens, or access liquidity by borrowing against their holdings—all while retaining control of their assets. The protocol is also building an overcollateralized stablecoin, backed entirely by assets deposited within Mutuum, providing users with a decentralized and transparent alternative to centralized stablecoins. Additionally, a Layer 2 solution is in development to improve transaction speed and significantly reduce gas fees, making the platform scalable and more accessible to a wide range of users. MUTM is now available at a price of $0.025 during the ongoing Phase 4 of its presale. Over 88% of this round has already sold, and the project has now raised over $8.6 million, with more than 10,000 holders on record. Once Phase 4 ends, the price will rise by 20% to $0.03, followed by a confirmed listing at $0.06. This structured pricing is drawing attention from early investors looking to get in before the next wave of exposure. These strong presale numbers, paired with increasing wallet adoption, signal growing confidence in MUTM’s fundamentals. Could MUTM Follow a Similar Path? While ADA had utility, SHIB had virality, and DOGE had community, MUTM is entering with real-world financial use cases, early development, and a clear path toward long-term sustainability. The upcoming beta platform launch, which is planned to go live shortly after token listing, will include lending, borrowing, and real-time mtToken integration—delivering functionality from day one. Unlike many projects that inflate supply through token printing, Mutuum uses a portion of its platform fees to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to active participants, creating natural demand and supporting token value. For those asking what crypto to buy now or searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in, MUTM presents a compelling mix of affordability, utility, and momentum—key components that fueled the rise of its predecessors. Experts are already forecasting that, based on utility, adoption, and tokenomics, MUTM has the potential to reach up to $7 over the long term. This projection is based on the layered value system being built—including mtTokens, the stablecoin framework, Layer 2 functionality, and a growing holder base. At the current price of $0.025, a simple investment of $800 would translate to a 280x return, or $224,000, when MUTM hits the projected $7 benchmark. This kind of upside is exactly what early investors are looking for—not just explosive short-term gains, but a token that can mature and hold value over time. MUTM is still early, but all the signals point to something much bigger in the making. The protocol is delivering features, the presale is gaining serious traction, and utility is already being built—not promised. With ADA, SHIB, and DOGE all rising from obscurity to dominance, MUTM may be the next to follow. And with prices set to increase in the next phase, the window to secure an early position is closing quickly.

This has attracted both developers and investors to its platform. But as Solana innovates in blockchain infrastructure, another project Ruvi AI is charting its own path by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain. Ruvi AI solves real problems in critical industries and opens up new opportunities for investors. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI is a platform that brings together AI’s ability to process vast amounts of data and blockchain’s transparency and security. It provides solutions for industries such as healthcare, finance and logistics. By using AI, Ruvi AI can identify trends, improve decision making and make operations more efficient. Blockchain ensures these improvements come with transparency and trust. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its tangible progress. The launch of its Beta platform allows you to try it out and see how it solves real world problems. By delivering results instead of promises, Ruvi AI is a project you can bank on. Presale Success Paves the Way for Growth Ruvi AI has already proven to be attractive to investors. In Phase 1 tokens were sold for $0.01 each. The phase sold out in 2 weeks and those who participated early have already seen their investment grow 50% as the token price has risen to $0.015 in Phase 2 . Market predictions suggest even more growth for Ruvi AI with the token expected to reach $1 shortly after listing on major exchanges. Early participants not only get bonuses but will also benefit as the project grows. Ruvi AI’s Commitment to Investors Ruvi AI has introduced a VIP rewards system to reward participants based on the amount of tokens they accumulate during the presale. The system adds bonuses to your initial holding, giving you even more opportunities to grow. Here’s how it works: VIP Tier 2 To accumulate 50,000 tokens you need to invest $750 at $0.015 token price. As a VIP Tier 2 you will get 40% bonus and get 20,000 tokens more, so your total will be 70,000 tokens .At $0.07 listing price these tokens will be worth $4,900 , 553% ROI. If the token reaches $1 your holdings will be $70,000 , 9,233% ROI. VIP Tier 3 To accumulate 100,000 tokens you need to invest $1,500 . As a VIP Tier 3 you will get 60% bonus and get 60,000 tokens more, so your total will be 160,000 tokens . At $0.07 listing price the tokens will be worth $11,200 , 1,020% ROI. If the token price reaches $1 your investment will be $160,000 , 10,567% ROI. VIP Tier 5 To get 500,000 tokens you need to invest $7,500 . As a VIP Tier 5 your holdings will be doubled with 100% bonus and you will have 1,000,000 tokens . At $0.07 listing price the tokens will be worth $70,000 , 833% ROI. If the token hits $1 the investment will be $1,000,000 , 12,233% ROI. These examples show how important it is to accumulate tokens early to get the full benefits of Ruvi AI’s rewards and growth. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Participants Ruvi AI also rewards its most active contributors through leaderboard rewards. The top investors get extra tokens: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens , worth $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1 . Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens , valued at $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1 . Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens , equal to $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1 .This shows Ruvi AI’s commitment to reward its investors. A Platform for Real Solutions Ruvi AI is transforming industries by using AI to solve complex problems and blockchain to ensure accountability and transparency. Whether a company needs to streamline healthcare logistics, sharpen financial forecasting or improve data sharing trust, Ruvi AI has solutions. The release of its Beta platform is proof that Ruvi AI isn’t just theory. It’s already delivering value to those who use and support it. Act Now Solana may be fast but Ruvi AI is focused on combining AI and blockchain to create solutions with real use cases.

Beneath the headlines, a new group of tokens is gaining traction ahead of what could be the next explosive cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, Solana, and NEAR Protocol are all drawing serious attention as Stage 8 of MAGACOIN FINANCE accelerates, and momentum builds across both established leaders and bold new contenders.Each project is showing signs of strategic positioning, technical strength, or early-stage investor demand – and the next moonshot may already be in play. Here’s a breakdown of the four coins analysts are watching now. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Breakout of the Year MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about early-stage entries of 2025. With Stage 8 now live and over $8 million raised, the project is ranked as the #1 presale of the year, and analysts are forecasting up to 40x returns before listings. Its capped 100 billion token supply, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and HashEx audit are fueling surging demand and rapid community growth. As each stage fills, urgency grows – and with a listing target of $0.007, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as a rare ground-floor opportunity by both retail and whale investors. For those seeking asymmetric returns, this is where speculation meets structure. XRP’s Payment Utility and Futures Momentum XRP is trading between $2.10 and $2.39 in May 2025, gaining momentum from payment adoption and the upcoming CME futures launch. Regulatory clarity is drawing institutional buyers, and analysts believe a surge to $5–$15 could happen quickly if liquidity conditions shift after futures approval.As XRP’s global utility grows, capital is also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the potential for exponential gains remains wide open. Solana: DeFi Dominance and a Technical Supercycle Solana (SOL) is trading at approximately $170.15, up more than 80% from its prior lows and standing out as one of the strongest Layer-1 performers. With DeFi apps thriving and network activity climbing, analysts are forecasting a move toward $250–$400 if the current trend continues.As Solana’s rally accelerates, investors are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside as the cycle extends. NEAR Protocol: Quiet Growth and Breakout Potential NEAR Protocol is quietly building momentum in 2025, with its developer ecosystem expanding and new integrations driving user growth. While NEAR isn’t yet in the spotlight like SOL or XRP, its scalable architecture and focus on usability position it as a sleeper candidate for the next breakout.As capital seeks undervalued networks, many are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion With Solana’s rally igniting the altcoin market, the focus is shifting to projects with clear upside and breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking off as Stage 8 nears completion, offering a rare early-stage entry point as listings approach. XRP and NEAR add further depth to the list of contenders, but among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most aggressive early entry for those seeking the next moonshot.The window for entry is narrowing – and this could be the moment to catch it.

The decision disclosed in a regulatory filing comes as the commission initiates formal proceedings to judge those proposals. The Commission announced that it is initiating proceedings to allow more time to assess whether the proposed rule change aligns with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. This section requires, among other provisions, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices and to protect investors and the public interest. The SEC initially accepted both applications earlier this year. Bitwise first submitted its proposal in January 2025 via the BZX Exchange . The agency issued its first delay on March 11, and with this latest development, the review process has now moved into a more formal and detailed stage. 21Shares, which already operates spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, was one of the earliest companies to apply for a Solana-based ETF in America’s market. However, like its competitors, the company has been stymied by regulation, as the SEC continues to be wary of financial products based on crypto. This delay is nothing out of the ordinary. The SEC also pushed off a decision on Grayscale’s proposed Solana ETF earlier this month, indicating the glacial pace of most digital asset ETF applications . Analysts predict high odds for Solana ETF in 2025 For their part, ETF experts remain unbothered by the latest delay. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas argue there’s still a good chance (70% in 2025) that there’s a Solana ETF approved in the U.S. The rush isn’t limited to 21Shares and Bitwise. Heavyweights like VanEck and Franklin Templeton have also filed for Solana ETFs. This demand for Solana suggests strong institutional demand for regulated SOL exposure vehicles. ETF products are also eyeing other altcoins like Litecoin and XRP. Litecoin ETF’s likely approval rates are around 90%, and XRP ETFs are at 85%. Dogecoin and Cardano ETFs follow closely, with approval probabilities of approximately 80% and 75%, respectively. However, approval for all of those products is still pending. The approval process is slow and unpredictable. Some of these filings may not receive final action until late-2025. Investors respond to SEC delays The price of Solana saw a small bump on the news. SOL/USD has suffered the most in the last 7 days, with a loss of about 1.2% to trade around $166 at the time of writing. The market is also heavily sensitive to any whiffs of regulation, particularly on how they’d impact investor confidence and future ETF product availability. Paradoxically, this decline is taking place at a time when institutions are showing even more interest in Solana. Some analysts believe the sluggish market may not be a long-term condition. As per recent trends, Solana has never been overbought. Thus, we can expect a more or less mid-term recovery. Adding to the bullish action is the word from CME Group that it will launch Solana’s future contracts. If successful, these futures would allow investors to hedge or speculate on SOL’s price in a regulated setting. And while the move is parsed as incremental, it is also predicted to make it easier for future ETFs to be approved. Futures products do not manage the ETF but enable institutions to speculate on Solana without owning the coin. This is especially important because the regulatory outlook for spot crypto markets remains highly uncertain.

Senators easily cleared the 60-vote threshold for the vote, which is intended to just move the legislation to a period of further debate before a final vote series to pass it out of the Senate. The House of Representatives is working its way through its own version of stablecoin legislation, which is intended to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins and their issuers in the U.S. The Senate previously failed to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance the bill during a vote on May 8, after Democratic lawmakers raised concerns about consumer protection and national security provisions. That vote had failed on a bipartisan basis, after Republicans Josh Hawley and Rand Paul also voted against cloture. Despite that earlier setback, industry participants expected easy passage on Monday after lawmakers spent much of the last week negotiating changes in language, though many of these changes seemed marginal . One individual following the negotiations told CoinDesk that ""there's enough"" in the newest version of the bill to address some of Democrats' concerns earlier on Monday, though the lawmakers negotiating language could have added more hefty consumer protection provisions.

However, this was followed by a return to consolidation around the $103,000 price level. This intense volatility in the past 24 hours suggests that the Bitcoin price still has a long way to go before it reaches a price top. Amid this volatile movement, a new macroeconomic model, the Decode Macro Trend Oscillator (MTO), has pointed out when to expect Bitcoin’s price to top this cycle. Decode’s Macro Trend Oscillator Model And Its Alignment With Bitcoin Peaks The Decode Macro Trend Oscillator is a sophisticated tool designed by a Bitcoin analyst known as Decode on the social media platform X. The oscillator aggregates around 40 macroeconomic indicators, ranging from interest rates and global liquidity to industrial production and market volatility, into 17 carefully selected leading metrics. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now These are then normalized and visualized as a histogram to produce a cyclical pattern that has historically aligned with Bitcoin’s major tops. A close look at the chart titled Bitcoin Liquid Index on the 1M candlestick timeframe reveals that the light green histogram bars have coincided with each of Bitcoin’s cycle peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021. These peaks are marked by vertical red lines, and the transitions from deep red to green territory on the oscillator appear to offer a visual cue for the end of bearish phases and the onset of price rallies. As of May 2025, the histogram remains in a deep red zone but has begun inching upward, with the most recent bar reading at -11.47, suggesting that macroeconomic conditions may soon start to favor a bigger rally for Bitcoin. BTC Mode Configuration Fine-Tunes Cycle Top Prediction Decode’s analysis goes beyond Bitcoin-specific indicators. In one of the accompanying charts of the S&P 500 Index of the 2M timeframe, a long-term comparison is made between the current global environment and the economic backdrop of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Interestingly, Decode’s macro trend oscillator proved reliable in estimating periods of downturns and expansions in both instances. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength In both instances, inflation pressure and declining consumer sentiment pushed the oscillator deep into negative territory for years. However, once the histogram flipped into the green, the economy and prices entered a prolonged phase of expansion. The third chart offers a more detailed view of Bitcoin’s weekly trend, including an overlay of M2 money supply growth, which is another popular monetary metric. This view highlights how the Macro Trend Oscillator, when switched to a configuration Decode called “Bitcoin Mode,” fine-tunes its sensitivity to metrics that directly impact crypto markets. In this configuration, only a few of the full 17 metrics that best identify Bitcoin cycle tops are used. As it stands, Bitcoin is still in the negative red histogram zone, even despite its rally in recent months. The first deep green histogram has yet to show up, not to mention the first light green bar that will mark the cycle peak. Based on this setup, the oscillator implies that Bitcoin still has a lot of room to run this cycle, and that a price top is unlikely to arrive in 2025.

A key procedural vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed in a 66-32 vote on May 20. Several Democrats changed their votes to pass the motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key backers, said on May 15 that she thinks it's a “fair target” to have the GENIUS Act passed by May 26 — Memorial Day in the US. The US Senate voted 66-32 to advance debate on the GENIUS stablecoin bill. Source: US Senate The GENIUS Act was introduced on Feb. 4 by US Senator Bill Hagerty and seeks to regulate the nearly $250 billion stablecoin market — currently dominated by Tether ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ). The bill requires stablecoins be fully backed, have regular security audits and approval from federal or state regulators. Only licensed entities can issue stablecoins, while algorithmic stablecoins are restricted. Several Democratic senators withdrew support for the bill on May 8, blocking a motion to move it forward, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest involving Trump’s crypto ventures and anti-money laundering provisions.

The motion to invoke cloture — which allows the Senate to proceed with debating the bill — was approved with a 66-32 vote. Interestingly, more than 15 Democratic senators, including Catherine Cortez Masto, Adam Schiff, Mark Warner, and Ruben Gallego, changed their earlier ‘no’ votes to ‘yes.’ However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted against the motion. Senator Josh Hawley was absent during the vote. However, this vote does not mean the GENIUS Act has become law. It simply allows the Senate to begin discussing, debating, and potentially amending the bill before a final vote. Why This Matters for Crypto Investors The GENIUS Act includes regulations for stablecoins — digital currencies tied to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. Many in the crypto community see this as a positive step because it introduces clear rules, ensuring stablecoin issuers hold proper reserves like U.S. treasury bonds. It also demands more transparency about how these stablecoins are backed. JUST IN: Motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the consideration of the GENIUS Act has PASSED. 15+ Dems flipped their votes from no to yes including @CortezMasto , @SenAdamSchiff , @MarkWarner , @SenRubenGallego , @SenatorWarnock and others. Senate Minority leader… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) May 20, 2025 Experts say this could strengthen trust in the crypto market and protect users from risks seen in the past when some stablecoin companies lacked proper financial backing. Concerns Around Stablecoins and Politics There’s ongoing debate about private tech companies like Meta or Square issuing their own stablecoins. Some see it as risky without strict regulations. Another concern is about political leaders, including President Trump, having financial interests in crypto-related projects, raising questions about fairness and possible conflicts of interest. While having government figures support crypto might sound positive, experts warn it could lead to future problems if decisions appear to benefit insiders. As reported by Eleanor Terrett, Josh Vlasto, spokesperson for CIFonX, said, “We congratulate the Senate on today’s vote. This action, and eventually passage of a stablecoin bill, clears the path for Congress to act on the mandate of voters to pass market structure legislation which creates clear rules of the road for digital assets.”",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 01:52:37

We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said. Michael Saylor comments on Dimon’s announcement. Source: Michael Saylor JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market. “I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.” “If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said. At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

Each offers a different value. ADA is moving upward in a strong rally, SHIB’s forecast points to a big breakout, and Web3 ai is becoming a top choice thanks to its AI-powered tools and growing presale. All three point to unique paths for potential future gains. While ADA and SHIB are seeing price surges and network updates, Web3 ai brings a complete platform that changes how people manage crypto. It’s no longer just about price moves; now it’s about tools, access, and control. The question is, which of these will stand out as the best crypto platform going forward? Cardano (ADA) Price Momentum Strengthens Toward $1.20 Momentum for Cardano (ADA) is rising steadily this May. A major reason is the growing open interest, now at $930 million, showing more activity from large-scale and leveraged market participants. This has pushed many to expect a breakout past the $1.20 mark. Technical indicators are also aligning well. ADA is showing higher lows, stronger volume, and stability near its 200-day moving average. With DeFi adoption increasing and new upgrades across its ecosystem, analysts believe ADA is still undervalued at today’s prices. ADA brings both steadiness and upward potential. While not as fast-moving as smaller coins, its developer community and expanding use make it a solid option for anyone considering the best crypto platform for longer-term growth. SHIB Forecast Signals a 105% Rise with Bullish Setup Shiba Inu (SHIB) is drawing fresh attention with a bullish forecast. Analysts now see the potential for a 105% increase if SHIB maintains its current trend. After moving above the $0.000026 resistance level, it could aim for $0.000053 soon. Several things are fueling this optimism: higher trade volume, better sentiment, and active work on its ecosystem. Shibarium is growing, and more SHIB coins are being burned, which helps it look more serious beyond just being a meme coin. Though SHIB carries some risks, its price pattern is attracting breakout traders and those who follow community-driven coins. If the momentum continues, SHIB could become a bigger part of the conversation around the best crypto platform. Web3 ai’s Presale Hits $4.2M as AI-Powered Crypto Tools Gain Ground Instead of following price trends alone, Web3 ai is building a smart, AI-focused system to support crypto users in real-time. With $4.2 million already raised in its presale and the current price at $0.000365 (Stage 5), Web3 ai is becoming a strong contender in 2025. This system brings together blockchain and AI to deliver automation, smart insights, and decision-making tools in one place. The platform includes modules like sentiment tracking, contract reviews, trading bots, and portfolio analysis, all in a single dashboard. It helps simplify complex tasks and reduces mistakes by centralizing tools. What makes Web3 ai different is its use of machine learning trained on big data, combined with real blockchain information. It features price predictions, scam alerts, staking guidance, and auto-strategies. $WAI is used across the system for rewards, feature access, and governance. Designed to be modular and cross-chain, Web3 ai values user privacy, control, and steady upgrades. With a projected ROI of 1,747% by launch and strong support in the presale phase, it’s positioning itself as a top contender for best crypto platform, not just this year, but for years to come. Final Thoughts! Cardano (ADA) brings solid fundamentals, high engagement, and a path to break $1.20. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing short-term excitement with its pattern and growing network support. Both projects are backed by strong price actions. Yet, Web3 ai is changing what people expect from crypto platforms. With a $4.2 million presale, a stage price of $0.000365, and a projected 1,747% return, it blends real tools and practical use into one smart platform. For anyone looking beyond just market movements, Web3 ai is shaping up as a top name among the best crypto platform picks .

XRP and Solana are drawing renewed attention, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum is turning heads among those seeking asymmetric upside. With Kaspa joining the list of contenders, the smart money is quietly positioning for the next phase of the bull cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating 2025 Altcoin Picks CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE has stormed into the 2025 cycle with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full, all while its token price remains under $0.001. Its capped 100 billion token supply and Hashex-audited smart contracts have created a scarcity-driven model that’s fueling strong demand and rapid presale sellouts.Analysts are forecasting 25x–35x returns, with some models calling for even more if momentum continues. Whale allocations and a unique blend of political narrative and structured tokenomics are positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP Inches Toward Futures and Institutional Access XRP is trading at $2.33 as of May 19, 2025, after a 3.3% dip, but the launch of CME Group’s XRP futures and Ripple’s expansion into the UAE are driving institutional interest. Despite short-term price pressure, analysts remain bullish, with targets of $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate.As XRP holders seek further upside, many are also rotating into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the growth curve is just beginning. Bitcoin: New Highs and Growing Demand Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,005, having closed the week above $106,000 for the first time ever and maintaining its position as the market’s anchor. With technical forecasts calling for a move to $114,289 in May and long-term projections as high as $210,000–$230,000 for 2025, institutional inflows and ETF demand are keeping sentiment bullish.As Bitcoin’s growth steadies, investors are increasingly seeking higher-multiple opportunities in early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana’s Consistent Climb Draws Institutional Eyes Solana (SOL) is trading at $171.54, up 3.38% from yesterday, and continues to be one of the strongest Layer-1 performers this cycle. Price forecasts for May 2025 suggest a range between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to $183 and beyond.As Solana’s fundamentals remain robust, some SOL holders are rotating into smaller-cap options like MAGACOIN FINANCE to chase outsized returns ahead of listings. Kaspa: Quietly Building Momentum Kaspa (KAS) is quietly gaining traction in 2025, with its proof-of-work model and expanding ecosystem attracting new capital. While not as high-profile as Bitcoin or Solana, KAS is being watched by analysts as a potential breakout candidate for the second half of the year.As capital rotates, many are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion While Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana remain foundational to any crypto portfolio, the search for the next breakout is intensifying. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the bold, high-upside pick that’s catching analyst attention as Stage 8 nears completion.With a clear listing roadmap, robust demand, and a narrowing entry window, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the defining early-stage opportunity of the 2025 cycle.

That’s exactly where Unstaked is stepping in, blending blockchain with AI in a way that brings immediate benefits. Rather than selling future potential, it’s already giving users working tools that help with decision-making, risk control, and portfolio management. Now in stage 13 and with over $6.2 million raised, Unstaked is building strong momentum. Many analysts are starting to recognise it as a serious contender for the top DeFi token of 2025, with growing belief that $UNSD could approach the $1 mark soon after launch. AI-Powered Tools That Help Users Make Smarter Moves What truly sets Unstaked apart is how it brings advanced AI technology directly to its users. Instead of simply offering another token to hold, it provides a toolkit packed with features, live trading alerts, scam detection, risk analysis, and portfolio optimisation. These tools aren’t promises for later. They’re built to function the moment the AI agents are live. Users can activate their own AI agents to run community engagement across platforms like Telegram and X. These agents do more than automate replies; they learn, adapt, and support long-term community growth. This shift from passive holding to active participation gives investors a stronger reason to be involved. With features that drive interaction and utility, Unstaked is positioning itself as a meaningful platform, and one that could rise as the top DeFi token of 2025 for users who want a function alongside investment potential. Presale Growth Reflects Rising Confidence in the Project The momentum behind Unstaked’s presale shows just how quickly interest is building. With the project now in stage 13, over $6.2 million has already been raised, and tokens are sold at $0.009267 each. That kind of traction doesn’t happen without a compelling offer. A key part of that appeal is Unstaked’s open and fair launch structure. With no private or early-stage allocations, the project attracts a broad mix of everyday investors who are drawn to transparency and accessibility. Unlike many DeFi projects that rely on speculation, Unstaked offers actual value through its functional AI agents. Additionally, its $1 million giveaway is helping build a strong and engaged community. With an expected launch price of $0.1819, early participants see plenty of room for growth. That optimism, tied to the project’s tangible offerings, is what’s making Unstaked one of the leading names among the top DeFi tokens of 2025 contenders. Could $UNSD Reach $1 After Listing? Some market watchers now suggest that Unstaked could climb past $1 shortly after it goes live. This view isn’t just based on hype. The project’s strong presale performance and wide support for utility-first DeFi solutions make a solid case. Unstaked’s unique proof-of-intelligence framework also plays a big role. It logs every action made by its AI agents on-chain, creating a public, transparent record of engagement and productivity. This data-driven approach adds credibility and makes user activity measurable, something not many other platforms offer. This kind of verifiable participation draws in a new type of investor, someone looking for impact they can track, not just tokens they can hold. With practical use cases and clear metrics already in play, Unstaked is making a name for itself among those looking for the top DeFi token of 2025 with more than just market buzz. Summing Up! DeFi is evolving, and the next generation of platforms will be judged by more than yield and tokenomics. Projects like Unstaked, which balance utility, transparency, and community interaction, lead the way. With presale stages advancing, AI tools already operational, and more than $6.2 million raised, it’s becoming harder to ignore what Unstaked is building.

Arthur Breitman’s Bet on Tokenized Uranium Could Signal a Tezos Revival Arthur Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, is placing a bold bet on tokenized uranium—a move that could mark a pivotal comeback for the once-hyped “Ethereum killer.” In a recent interview, Breitman reflected on Tezos’ evolution from a top-10 crypto project to a more subdued but resilient player in the blockchain space, now targeting the Real World Asset (RWA) sector. With its unique self-amending protocol and strong emphasis on decentralization, Tezos is aiming to reinvent itself by enabling secure and transparent uranium tokenization. Breitman emphasizes Tezos’ culture of “doing things for real,” contrasting its genuinely decentralized infrastructure with other projects driven by hype or custodial models. While Tezos has endured regulatory hurdles, shifting narratives, and market skepticism, its pivot toward tokenizing critical assets like uranium could redefine its place in the crypto ecosystem and reignite developer and institutional interest. Avalanche (AVAX) Surges 21%, But Ruvi AI (RUVI) Emerges as 2025’s Breakout Star with $2 Price Prediction and 20,000% Growth Forecast Avalanche (AVAX) has seen a significant 21% surge, hitting $22.80 amid growing adoption and bullish momentum, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $30.01 by 2030. However, market analysts are increasingly turning their attention to Ruvi AI (RUVI), a disruptive decentralized AI superapp that’s making waves with its innovative integration of Web3 technology. With a successful presale already under its belt—where early investors earned 50% gains—RUVI is now priced at just $0.015, yet experts forecast the token could reach $2 in 2025, representing a staggering 20,000% ROI. Combining blockchain utility with AI-driven content creation tools for text, video, audio, and images, Ruvi is quickly gaining traction as the next major player in the crypto space.

The exchange said in a May 16 filing to a New York federal court that its terms of service, which it claimed the class group agreed to, has a clause that users agree to arbitrate all claims, along with a clause preventing users from launching class actions against the crypto exchange . “The Court should hold that Plaintiffs are required to arbitrate claims that accrued after Feb. 20, 2019, even if the Court adheres to its initial decision as to claims that accrued before then and that the class-action waiver in the 2019 Terms of Use is enforceable for all of Plaintiffs’ claims,” Binance said. Binance argues that its terms of service have a clause about users agreeing to arbitrate all claims. Source: PACER In March, Judge Andrew Carter denied Binance’s request to have all of the class action’s claims sent to arbitration for users who bought tokens on the exchange between April 1, 2017, and Feb. 20, 2019, and partially denied the motion for users who bought tokens after 2019 until a decision could be made to what extend the arbitration clause would apply. Binance said in its latest filings that it updated its terms in February 2019 to include the arbitration clause and argued that an earlier version of the terms of service included a clause that informed users that Binance could amend the terms as needed without any individual notice. Binance case was previously dismissed Judge Carter had sided with Binance and dismissed the suit in March 2022. Binance had argued that it isn’t beholden to US securities laws because it doesn’t have a physical headquarters in the country. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned that decision in March 2024 , and the Supreme Court later declined to hear Binance’s appeal in January. Related: US judge transfers Binance lawsuit to Florida, citing first-to-file rule Binance’s legal entanglements in the US have escalated since mid-2023, when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company for selling unregistered securities, which was settled for $4.3 billion in November 2023. Binance was also slapped with a class action in Canada in April 2024 for allegedly violating securities laws after it announced its departure from the country in May 2023.

Despite these setbacks, the Pi Core Team has announced new job openings, leaving the community both puzzled and concerned. Price Drops Despite Fund Announcement After briefly spiking to $1.6796 on May 8, the price of Pi has pulled back sharply and is now trading at around $0.75. Although it remains slightly above its early April lows, the token’s value has dropped since peaking at $2.98 in late February. Even a major announcement on May 14, where the Pi Core Team unveiled a $100 million ecosystem fund to boost network development, failed to stop the price slide. In fact, some community members argue that this fund may be contributing to sell pressure rather than supporting the market. Technical analysts are keeping a close eye on the critical $0.70 support level. If this support breaks, it would invalidate the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, possibly opening the door for a drop to $0.40. Hiring Spree Amid the Chaos Interestingly, amidst the falling prices and growing controversies, the Pi Core Team has released a fresh list of job openings. This move comes at a time when investor confidence is shaky, leaving many to question the timing and motives behind the recruitment drive. Allegations of Pump-and-Dump and Wallet Concerns Along with falling prices, the Pi community is also raising concerns about possible pump-and-dump activity. Many believe the Pi Core Team controls over 10,000 wallets and sub-wallets, though only the 7 largest wallets are easy to track. In the last five months: 5.4 billion Pi were moved from the Foundation 1 wallet to the Foundation 3 wallet. About 700 million Pi were transferred from Foundation 3 to Foundation 2 in smaller batches. More than 1 billion Pi went directly from Foundation 1 to Foundation 2. Right now, the Foundation 3 wallet holds 4.7 billion Pi, while Foundation 2 has only 24 million Pi left. The community is demanding answers about where these large amounts of Pi have gone and is calling for better transparency and accountability from the Pi Core Team.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 02:36:23

In our previous entries, we covered moving averages and MACD , great for identifying trends and momentum. Now let’s look at RSI , a tool many traders use to time their trades with better confidence. What is RSI? RSI stands for Relative Strength Index. It helps you see if a coin has been bought or sold too much recently and might be ready to reverse. It’s plotted as a line that moves between 0 and 100. Most traders use it with a 14-period setting. Depending on your chart’s timeframe, this could mean 14 days, 14 hours, or even 14 minutes. Unlike price-following indicators, RSI doesn’t just track where price is. It tells you how extreme recent buying or selling pressure has been . That way, you can figure out if the market’s about to flip before it actually does. How to Read It: RSI above 70 = Overbought → Market may be due for a correction RSI below 30 = Oversold → Market may be due for a bounce RSI between 40–60 = Neutral → No strong signal Example in Action: RSI (Purple Panel): Overbought Alert RSI is sitting above 70 , signalling classic overbought conditions . This suggests that Bitcoin’s recent bullish run may be losing steam or approaching a natural correction. What Traders Are Watching: RSI dropping back below 70 could mean a pullback is starting. If BTC remains strong, RSI might stay overbought. This is a behavior common in strong uptrends but also a risky zone for late buyers. For better accuracy, use RSI together with MACD and Moving Averages to make more informed decisions. MACD : Bullish, but Momentum Slowing? MACD Line (Blue): 4,142 Signal Line (Orange): 3,536 Histogram: Positive but starting to flatten, hinting that momentum is slowing down . The MACD remains bullish with the blue line comfortably above the orange, but keep an eye on that histogram. If those bars start to shrink, it’s often the first clue that bullish momentum is fading. Moving Averages : Is BTC Overextended? 50-Day EMA (Yellow Line): 92,570 200-Day SMA (Blue Line): 91,673 BTC is trading well above both these critical moving averages, which confirms the strength of the current uptrend. But this also raises a flag: Is the market overstretched? When price pulls too far away from these averages, a healthy correction often follows, bringing price back toward the 50 EMA , a level many traders view as dynamic support in a bull market. Final Takeaways: Should You Act Now or Wait? Current Trend: Strongly bullish but potentially overextended. RSI: In overbought territory, exercise caution. MACD: Still bullish, but showing early signs of slowing momentum. Strategy: If you’re already in profit, this is a great time to consider securing gains or tightening your stop-losses. If you’re waiting to enter, watch for a pullback toward the 50 EMA for a stronger, lower-risk entry point. Pro Tips for Using RSI Like a Pro RSI is simple, but using it well is where it really counts. Here’s how experienced traders make the best of RSI: Understand Market Context RSI works beautifully in sideways or ranging markets , where price bounces between support and resistance. But in strong trends (like a bull run), RSI can stay overbought or oversold for weeks. So don’t hit that sell button just because RSI hits 70. Look at the bigger picture first. Combine It with Other Indicators RSI works best when it’s part of the conversation. Try pairing it with: MACD to check if momentum agrees with what RSI is telling you. Moving Averages (like the 50 EMA) to see if price is stretched too far from key support levels. Watch for Divergence If price makes a new high , but RSI doesn’t? That’s called bearish divergence , momentum could be slipping. If price makes a new low , but RSI doesn’t? That’s bullish divergence , a bounce might be around the corner. Divergence doesn’t always play out immediately, but it’s one of those clues that serious traders don’t ignore RSI Is an Early Indicator, Not a Direct Call to Action Just because RSI is flashing overbought or oversold doesn’t mean you need to rush into action. Use it as an early warning, not as a reason to panic-buy or panic-sell. Play with Timeframes to Refine Your Strategy RSI readings change based on the timeframe you’re looking at. If the daily RSI shows overbought , but the 1-hour RSI is cooling off , this often means the market is in a short-term pullback within a larger uptrend. Smart traders use this to their advantage, waiting for the short-term RSI to reset before jumping back into the larger trend. This approach helps you avoid chasing tops and gives you better, lower-risk entry points. Always check multiple timeframes before making your move.

From institutional Layer-1 giants to narrative-driven tokens and pre-listing breakouts, this list represents a strategic blend of infrastructure, utility, and momentum. Here are five cryptocurrencies traders are watching closely this quarter — each bringing something unique to the table, and one in particular still offering true early-stage entry potential . 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — A Pre-Listing Standout With 25x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines as a rare altcoin still offering early-stage positioning with a fixed listing target of $0.007 . Currently moving into Stage 9 , MAGA has become the go-to pick for traders who missed early SHIBA, PEPE, and DOGE cycles — but want exposure to a similarly explosive setup, with clearer tokenomics. Why it’s trending: Strong community backing and political branding Structured entry points with transparent ROI potential Analyst projections of 25x–35x upside from current levels With listings on the horizon, MAGA is quickly earning its place among 2025’s most-watched speculative allocations . 2. Cardano (ADA) — Layer-1 Strength With Breakout Setup Cardano (ADA) continues to show strength in its fundamentals, even as its price consolidates below $0.80. With ongoing upgrades like Hydra , growing DeFi participation, and solid developer traction, ADA is positioning for a technical breakout above $1.00 . Why ADA still matters: Scalable blockchain infrastructure with long-term ecosystem goals Low price entry relative to previous ATHs Viewed as a low-risk Layer-1 long play in 2025 Investors seeking a blend of stability and upside are still allocating to ADA — especially ahead of its next wave of ecosystem rollouts. 3. Avalanche (AVAX) — Real-World Growth at a Discount Avalanche is trading around $28–$30 and continues to impress institutional audiences with its subnet model and real-world partnerships . Major integrations with gaming and financial companies — including attention from BlackRock — have helped solidify its 2025 relevance. Why AVAX is considered undervalued: Enterprise-grade scalability Strong developer growth and subnet expansion Analysts targeting $60–$90 range by Q3 if momentum holds AVAX is viewed as one of the strongest alternatives to Ethereum , particularly for investors chasing innovation in DeFi and GameFi. 4. OFFICIAL $TRUMP (TRUMP) — Controversial but Climbing OFFICIALTRUMP has become one of the most discussed tokens of 2025 — and not just because of its meme appeal. With an exclusive $TRUMP holders dinner scheduled for May 22 , political speculation and global wallet activity have triggered major volatility — and major attention. Key headlines: Top 220 buyers spent $140M+ for access to Trump’s private event Justin Sun rumored to be the largest holder with $18M+ Under U.S. Senate investigation for foreign wallet dominance and supply centralization Despite (or because of) its controversy, analysts say $TRUMP could remain one of the most heavily traded tokens this quarter , especially with a speculative rebound toward $13–$14 in play. 5. XRP (XRP) — Legal Clarity + CME Futures = Strong Positioning XRP continues to hold steady above $2.30 , supported by recent U.S. legal victories and anticipation of CME futures integration . It remains a cornerstone of blockchain-based cross-border liquidity , with broad global appeal. Why investors are still holding XRP: Regulatory green light in major markets Real-world adoption for financial infrastructure Long-term analyst targets of $10–$15 remain active XRP offers both growth potential and portfolio balance , making it a favorite for investors rotating out of Bitcoin-heavy allocations. Conclusion If you’re looking to reposition your portfolio before June 2025, these five cryptocurrencies stand out for different reasons — but all share the common trait of being undervalued relative to their upside : MAGACOIN FINANCE for high-leverage early-stage exposure Cardano for technical consistency Avalanche for scalable enterprise adoption OFFICIALTRUMP for political-driven speculation XRP for regulatory and institutional strength All five offer strategic entry points this quarter — but only MAGACOIN FINANCE still trades below its listing price, making it the last high-upside presale many analysts are watching closely.

The rise is a welcome return to form for Bithumb, which has had a torrid 12 months. Founded in 2014 under the name Xcoin and rebranded in 2015, Bithumb once ruled the roost in South Korea with over 70% of trading volumes. However, the exchange began to fade after suffering hacks, including one in 2018 that saw it lose about $30 million. Meanwhile, rival Upbit rose to prominence after partnering with internet-only Kbank, which could help process new exchange users digitally. But by 2024, Bithumb came roaring back. It raised marketing expenses more than tenfold to 192 billion won in 2024, from 16 billion in 2023. Data from market data provider Kaiko shows that Bithumb held 36% of the trade in January 2024. Though those figures have since waned, the firm has maintained around 25%. That’s quite a bit higher than its high single-digit market share at the start of 2023. Bithumb’s sudden resurgence is throwing the market into disarray in a country where Upbit has long held a near-monopoly. For years, Upbit was a primary growth driver with Kbank, and it was able to roll out a digital onboarding process for customers. The return of Bithumb, however, indicates that the market is now better positioned to compete. Bithumb sets the stage for public listing Bithumb is presently in preparation for IPO . The exchange is now racing to reach 1 billion dollars in IPO goals. A listing is scheduled for the second half of 2025, with Samsung Securities as the lead underwriter. The bourse plans to list South Korea’s KOSDAQ stock market and is considering a dual listing of the cryptocurrency exchange operator on the United States’ NASDAQ market to attract more global investors, KRX said. Bithumb has already broken its non-exchange businesses into smaller units to make the company easier to manage ahead of the IPO chase. NYC 5G (Bithumb A) was spun off on 31 July 2025. This move is intended to simplify its corporate setup and remove core trading functions from other projects, such as “blockchain research, consulting, and NFT efforts.” Solid financials back Bithumb, and its upcoming IPO is seen as a strategic step toward greater transparency. The move comes as the company works to rebuild trust following past controversies, including investigations into former executives over allegations of fraud and embezzlement. Bithumb remains under regulatory scrutiny Despite a few recent wins, Bithumb remains under intense regulatory scrutiny. South Korea enforces some of the world’s strictest crypto regulations , where violations can result in severe penalties. In the first half of 2025, Bithumb was warned about potential regulatory suspension due to Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. The Financial Services Commission had to develop a countermeasure for over 400 suspected user accounts. That backdrop has pushed many smaller Korean crypto exchanges out of the business. Only two big players remain in the country: Bithumb and Upbit. International exchange players like Binance also encountered challenges from the authorities, and the tight data privacy law proved difficult to sidestep.

Bitcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Ethereum May Be Fueling the Breakout",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrps-push-past-20-bitcoin-magacoin-finance-and-ethereum-may-be-fueling-the-breakout/,"Introduction The whales are moving again-but this time, their focus extends far beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Large-cap crypto holders are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE, with early projections pointing to up to 40x upside if it mirrors the explosive performance of early SHIBA or DOGE.As Stage 8 heats up, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the high-reward entry favored by smart money, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP position for the next major move. Here’s why analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most explosive altcoin entry of the 2025 cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why Early Whales Are Targeting MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly dominating early 2025 as one of the most-watched presales in the market. With over $8 million raised, a price still under $0.001, and a listing target of $0.007, the project is ranked as the #1 presale of the year, with analysts forecasting up to 40x returns before listings. Its scarcity-driven model-a capped 100 billion token supply and 45% allocated to presale-combined with a Hashex audit, is fueling surging demand and rapid community growth.Whale allocations and stage-based momentum are setting the pace, and as each stage fills, urgency grows. For those seeking asymmetric returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as the lead entry for Q3 listings and beyond. Bitcoin’s Steady Climb Reinforces Market Confidence Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading near $95,466, with bullish momentum and analysts predicting a potential surge past $100,000 in May 2025. Institutional inflows remain robust, and ETF demand is at an all-time high, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as the macro anchor for the next crypto cycle.As BTC’s price stabilizes above $95,000, capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the potential for exponential returns is drawing new buyers. Ethereum’s Quiet Build-Up Toward ETF Catalysts Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $2,489, with analysts forecasting a rise to $6,700 by year-end if institutional adoption and Layer 2 upgrades continue to accelerate. The recent Pectra update and the possibility of an ETH ETF are fueling optimism, while whales are quietly accumulating in anticipation of a breakout.As ETH’s growth steadies, more investors are diversifying into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. XRP Futures and ETF Hopes Drive Institutional Interest XRP is trading at $2.36 as of May 19, 2025, following the launch of CME Group’s regulated XRP futures contracts. While price action has been mixed, the new futures market and pending ETF decisions are expected to boost institutional demand and price discovery. Analysts see $5–$10 as the next major target, with $20 possible if ETF approval and global adoption accelerate.As XRP’s narrative strengthens, capital is also flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE for those seeking the next breakout. Chainlink: Reliable Growth Amid Rotating Capital Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $15.14, maintaining steady growth as DeFi and oracle demand remain high. While not as explosive as some rivals, LINK’s consistent utility and integration across major protocols make it a core holding for many.As capital rotates, some LINK holders are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for a shot at early-stage, high-multiple returns. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion When whales start positioning early, it’s a clear sign they see something big on the horizon. With MAGACOIN FINANCE accelerating through Stage 8, its combination of timing, tokenomics, and narrative is drawing accumulation from large BTC, ETH, and XRP holders.While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the market’s anchors, it’s tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer true breakout potential-and with whales quietly loading up, that breakout could arrive much sooner than the market expects.

Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Z-Score Is Still Under Its Mean In a post on X, quant Frank has talked about how the Mayer Multiple of Bitcoin is looking right now. The “Mayer Multiple” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the BTC spot price and its 200-day moving average (MA). In other words, the metric represents the distance that the asset’s value has from the 200-day MA. The 200-day MA is a level that’s generally considered as an important boundary between macro bullish and bearish trends in the cryptocurrency, so it can be useful to know how far the coin is from this line. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up $18,000, But HODLer Profits Same As On April 1—Here’s Why In the context of the current discussion, the Mayer Multiple itself isn’t of interest, but rather its Z-Score. The Mayer Multiple Z-Score is an oscillator that tracks how much deviation the indicator has from its mean value. Now, here is the chart for the metric shared by the analyst: As is visible in the top graph, the Bitcoin price saw a dip under the 200-day MA during the earlier market downturn, but with the latest recovery run, it has broken back above the line. It would seem, though, that the asset hasn’t gained too much distance over the level so far, at least in historical context. And indeed, the Mayer Multiple Z-Score (bottom graph) confirms this, as its value is currently below zero. The zero level corresponds to the all-time mean of the Mayer Multiple. As such, a negative value like the current one suggests the metric is less than the average over history. More specifically, 53% of all days have witnessed the ratio being higher than the latest level. Based on this, the quant notes that Bitcoin remains relatively cool even at its current $103,000 price. From the chart, it’s visible that while the Z-Score is still negative, it’s much improved compared to the lows from earlier in the year. It’s possible that if BTC continues its bullish momentum, it will be challenging the zero level soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says In the current cycle, the Mayer Multiple has been higher than its mean on a few occasions already, with the largest separation occurring in the rally from Q1 2024, where the Z-Score surged above the level corresponding to a standard deviation of 1. So far, though, the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple hasn’t deviated to the same degree as during the bull run from the first half of 2021. It now remains to be seen whether the metric would heat up to similar levels in this cycle as well or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $102,700, down 1.5% over the last seven days.

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market. She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed. In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto “Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.” She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.” “I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SEC Crenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.” Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: Report Crenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said. “Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.” In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo” SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.” Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.” Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-20 03:08:27

Whether it will overcome it or not is uncertain. Like other altcoins, Hype’s recovery started last month after locating a solid ground level above $9. While this came after trending bearishly throughout the first quarter of the year, it initiated a buy and increased with a strong close above the psychological $20 level in the late month. The trading volume enhanced this month, and the price increased until it reached a crucial multi-month resistance level of $28.4 yesterday. Looking back from where the price picked up in April, Hype has seen an impressive recovery and is now looking highly bullish on a short-term scale. Although it is facing a serious hurdle at this crucial resistance. Increasing above this resistance could fuel a bigger price movement in the future. However, a continuous rejection there could trigger a drop capable of bringing a pullback in the market before exploding higher. Similarly, trading calmly around this crucial resistance could lead to a slight consolidation phase before deciding the next major direction of the market. The bulls are still in charge despite the latest rejection. HYPE’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview After last month’s breakup, it has created supports at $23.25, $19.5 and $16.9 respectively. If the price drops from the currently trading level, we may see a pullback into the mentioned support levels before rebounding. Flipping the $28.4 resistance level, the potential buying target would be $35.7 on the short-term scale. The $43.25 level is the next resistance to watch for a major breakup.

It currently appears strong, but is likely to break lower following a newly formed bearish pattern on the daily chart. Alpaca is considered one of the top gainers (if not the biggest) during the recent rally in altcoins following an over 20x increase within two weeks. However, the buying pressure stopped following a long-wick rejection at $1.28 in late April. The price nosedived, but managed to stay above $0.16 in the first week of this month. Holding this price level as support, it resurged and pushed briefly above the $0.7 level in the second week. A rejection occurred again and the crypto lost momentum throughout that week. It advanced selling this week and further dipped to the $0.15 level yesterday. Today came with a relief following a major gain in the last 24 hours, and as we can see, it is now looking strong on the day. Despite the recent drops, it is still up by 6x on a monthly. But looking at the current price action, it has formed a double-top pattern on the daily chart. A break below the $0.15 level should validate more bearish moves in the coming days. Alpaca’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview On the way down, the $0.147 level is providing support. A drop below it could slide us to $0.0876. The key level to watch for a retest is $0.061. If a rebound fails there, it may roll back to the bottom level of $0.028. Towards the upside, the $0.266 level is the closest resistance to watch on the daily chart. A resurge above this weekly resistance should rally us through $0.4 to $0.727 before reclaiming the $1.28 high, where it faced a rejection in April.

Bitcoin and Solana are both in breakout territory — but a newer name, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is attracting heavy buyer interest ahead of a potential 40x move. The common thread? Traders looking to turn $500 into something massive before Q3 are rotating into this group — while Stage 8 of MAGACOIN FINANCE is still open . HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Bitcoin (BTC): Big Money Bets on the $250K Target Bitcoin has surged above $105,000 , just 3.5% below its all-time high, with daily trading volume topping $38 billion . Institutional inflows remain strong, and CME futures open interest is climbing. Leading analysts, including JPMorgan and Scott Melker, are reiterating bold forecasts of $250K by year-end . BTC remains the anchor of market confidence — and it’s pulling everything else forward with it. Solana (SOL): The Infrastructure Star with Eyes on $372 Solana is up over 6% daily , now trading at $178.45 , and analysts are watching for a continued move toward $294–$372 . The announcement of native Metamask support and the “Build on Solana” initiative backed by Chainlink Labs have elevated its growth trajectory heading into Q3. It’s not just moving fast — it’s scaling at the right time. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Stage 8 Is Live, Demand Is Climbing, and 40x Is the Talk of the Market Investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE , now ranked as the #1 altcoin entry of 2025 . The project has gained serious traction with early-stage buyers, and Stage 8 is now open with demand accelerating daily. With a 40x projection built around strong chart setups, trader positioning, and listing anticipation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting investors looking for that rare mix of visibility and early timing. The project is also fully audited by Hashex , adding a level of trust few emerging assets can match. To celebrate its explosive growth, new buyers can use promo code PATRIOT50X for a limited-time 50% bonus — driving even more interest as Stage 8 quickly approaches sellout. XRP and XLM: Bullish Sentiment Builds Around Utility Tokens XRP is trading above $2.36 , with anticipation building for the May 19 CME Futures launch . Analysts are targeting $3.40–$5.50 , with longer-term models calling for $10+ if ETF approvals align. Stellar (XLM) is quietly gaining ground as well, with May averages forecast around $0.236 , supported by ecosystem activity and developer momentum. Both are drawing renewed attention — but neither matches the energy forming around the Stage 8 window now closing fast. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Final Thoughts Bitcoin is driving institutional capital. Solana is expanding infrastructure at pace. XRP and XLM are rebuilding momentum around utility. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the breakout altcoin of this phase — with Stage 8 still open, listings ahead, and a real shot at 40x returns before the broader market catches up. For those aiming to turn $500 into a breakout position , the timing couldn’t be clearer — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is where the buyers are already moving .

In the last 24 hours, Ethereum’s price rose by 6.93%, and over the past week, it’s up 5.61%, currently trading around $2,558.65. One of the factors behind this rise is a fresh update from the Ethereum Foundation. The organization announced changes to its leadership structure, naming Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak as new Co-Executive Directors. Along with a newly appointed President, this marks a step toward strengthening the foundation’s management and decision-making processes. The news has been well received within the Ethereum community, with many viewing it as a sign of renewed focus and direction for the network. While Ethereum has seen a bullish climb, other leading cryptocurrencies have struggled to match its pace. Bitcoin (BTC) posted a smaller daily gain of 1.83%, while Binance Coin (BNB), XRP, and other altcoins recorded even smaller increases. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC stayed flat, as expected. Ethereum Price Analysis Technical analysis adds another layer to Ethereum’s price movement. The cryptocurrency recently rebounded from a crucial support area and is now approaching resistance levels between $2,523 and $2,690. Analysts predict that the market structure is still uncertain, but this bounce leaves room for either a fresh rally or another corrective move. However, a decisive break below $2,464 could suggest the current rally has ended and further downside is ahead. For now, Ethereum’s combination of leadership changes and positive price action has set it apart from the rest of the market.

It fell from $0.25 down to about $0.21. Traders saw a brief bounce above $0.23 around May 17–18, but that did not last. As of today, DOGE sits near $0.21, marking a 10% weekly drop. Investors are watching the bigger picture, hoping long‑term signals point to a renewed uptrend. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? Analyst Maintains Bullish Outlook According to analyst Javon Marks, a key trendline gave way in late 2023. This line had capped Dogecoin since its $0.70 peak. He says the break ushered in higher highs and higher lows. A fresh low near $0.15 has held so far. Based on this view, he kept his $0.65 target, which would mean a 200% gain from $0.21. Marks also mentioned $0.74 and $1.25 as possible future milestones. $DOGE and a +174% climb to its first target at $0.6533 continues to be in the cards 🃏… https://t.co/7Jt82s0jLy — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) May 18, 2025 Resistance Levels Remain Key Barrier Based on reports from market watcher Ali Martinez, the $0.25–$0.26 range is a major hurdle. That zone worked as support in December 2024 but flipped to resistance in early 2025. Since then, the meme coin has tried and failed to push past it. In February, it hit $0.28 before reversing to below $0.15. A March rally saw a move above $0.19 but stopped short again. The most recent test in May peaked at $0.24 before closing at $0.22. Traders will be looking for a clear close above $0.26 to signal new momentum. On‑Chain Activity Sees Strong Uptick Based on latest data, wallet activity has jumped sharply. New addresses grew by over 100% in the last seven days. Active addresses climbed by 110%. Even zero‑balance addresses rose by 155%, which often hints at fresh participation or address cleanup. Higher on‑chain counts don’t always mean a price rise, but they do show more users are logging transactions again. Stretch Targets Face Big Hurdles Dogecoin’s long‑term goals may sound exciting, but getting there won’t be simple. A move to $0.6533 or beyond requires first holding above $0.26. Then it must break $0.28 with real volume behind it. Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Big price swings could scare some holders into booking profits. Even if the chart lines line up, outside events like social media buzz or exchange listings may be needed to push DOGE past $0.30. In the short term, traders will watch whether DOGE can reclaim $0.25 and hold it for a few days. If that happens, the higher‑low pattern stays intact. If it falls back below $0.21, the setup could collapse and open the door to further losses. For now, the coin sits in a tug‑of‑war between bullish chart fans and those who see more downside.

XRP: Futures Catalyst and Institutional Confidence in Motion XRP is currently trading above $2.36 , and all eyes are on the CME Futures launch on May 19 .

Ethereum: ETF Hype Meets On-Chain Fundamentals Ethereum is trading solidly above $2,600 and re-establishing itself as a cornerstone of the bull cycle. Between the successful Pectra upgrade , Layer-2 adoption, and anticipated spot ETF approval , ETH is positioned for a powerful second-half breakout. Forecasts from major research groups suggest movement toward $6,500–$12,000 , making it one of the few large-caps still loaded with upside. HBAR (Hedera): A Utility Giant Still Flying Under Radar HBAR continues to build through high-value enterprise integrations. From ESG reporting to payment rails, Hedera’s use cases remain strong. While it hasn’t exploded yet, many analysts believe it’s one catalyst away from being revalued significantly higher.

The provision, a major legislation, has established the first broad federal framework for overseeing stablecoins and constitutes a substantial leap toward mainstreaming digital assets. The development came just a week after a failed procedural vote. All 49 Democratic senators blocked a motion to invoke cloture on the bill’s consideration , halting its initial path to the floor. In the following days, reports surfaced of a bipartisan effort to revise the bill for another vote. Key Democrats jumped back aboard the measure. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Mark Warner (D-VA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-PA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD)—all of whom voted against cloture on the GENIUS Act earlier this month—supported the measure tonight. Alsobrooks and Gillibrand initially co-sponsored the bill. GENIUS Act gains momentum with bipartisan backing after procedural turnaround The bill has garnered more than 60 votes and is now expected to quickly move forward to a full floor vote, potentially as soon as tomorrow, a source familiar with the matter said. However, the bill still has to go through a vote in the House of Representatives and be signed into law by President Trump. If passed, the GENIUS Act will establish a legal basis for issuing stablecoins in the United States . Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) introduced the GENIUS Act. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Tim Scott (R-SC) served as co-sponsors of the legislation, which generated bipartisan momentum. The legislation seeks to lay down a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins that have grown substantially and now have an aggregate market cap exceeding $250 billion. Just days ago, the bill failed to clear a key procedural vote. At the time, a confluence of political factors undermined support from pro-crypto Democrats, such as concerns about President Donald Trump’s conflicts of interest related to cryptocurrency. Supporters hail the GENIUS Act as pro-dollar and innovation-driven Under the GENIUS Act, stablecoin issuers must hold cash and/or Treasury securities reserves and comply with AML/ATF standards. The bill also authorizes the Federal Reserve to regulate stablecoins so that these digital assets function safely and securely. Some members of Congress had criticized the GENIUS Act even as it won bipartisan backing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was worried that the measure would be a boon to President Donald Trump, who could use it to expand his stablecoin venture, “USD1,” and his meme coin. She said it allowed Trump to regulate his own digital currency. Supporters, however, viewed the GENIUS Act as a necessary step toward responsible innovation. Senator Bill Hagerty called it a “pro-growth” initiative and “the first-ever regulatory framework for payment stablecoins.” Next week, the Senate will make history when we pass the GENIUS Act that establishes the first ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. This bill will cement US dollar dominance, protect customers, increase demand for US treasuries, and ensure that innovation… — Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) May 16, 2025 Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, also endorsed the bill . The GENIUS Act is about securing the future of American finance.

Digital asset technology is the next generation of… — Bo Hines (@BoHines) May 16, 2025 Justin Slaughter, VP of regulatory affairs at Paradigm and a Democratic staffer, offered a pragmatic endorsement , saying this is “close to the best we can get for years and years.” Amanda Tuminelli, executive director and chief legal officer of the DeFi Education Fund, urged bipartisan backing , arguing that clear rules around stablecoins would benefit consumers, small businesses, and the global standing of the U.S. dollar. Echoing this sentiment, Ji Kim, acting CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, described the vote as “a critical step” toward regulatory clarity and said the legislation is vital for maintaining U.S. leadership in the digital finance space.

This pushed total inflows for the year to $7.5 billion, eclipsing the previous high of $7.2 billion seen in February. The influx has now erased the $7 billion in outflows from the February-March downturn. Interestingly, Ethereum stood out with strong performance. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , Ethereum experienced $205 million in inflows last week, bringing its year-to-date total to $575 million. This was indicative of a renewed investor confidence after the Pectra upgrade finally went live on May 7th, following a series of delays, as well as the appointment of co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak. Bitcoin also saw notable inflows of $557 million, though down from the previous week, possibly influenced by the Federal Reserve’s continued hawkish stance. Meanwhile, short-bitcoin products attracted $5.8 million for the fourth consecutive week, which suggested investor hedging as prices climb. During the same period, Sui and XRP recorded inflows of $9.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively, while Cardano and Chainlink posted smaller inflows of $0.5 million and $0.2 million. On the other hand, Solana witnessed $0.89 million in outflows, and multi-asset products saw a larger $2.9 million in withdrawals. Regional investor sentiment showed clear divisions. The US, for one, saw strong weekly inflows of $681 million, with Germany and Hong Kong contributing $86.3 million and $24.2 million, marking Hong Kong’s largest since November 2024. Australia and Switzerland followed with modest inflows of $13.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively. However, sentiment soured in Sweden, Canada, and Brazil, which recorded outflows of $16.3 million, $13.5 million, and $3.9 million over the past week, respectively.

After an initial macro-driven rally, a slight cooling of investor enthusiasm turned the backdrop into a almost-stable one for several significant token releases and project progressions. There has been no obvious mandate from the market for why this has been happening, except for the notion that sideways price action typically resolves itself either in the bullish direction or in a downward-breach direction. As noted in the Weekly Unlock Digest for the week of May 15, 2025, the market absorbed fresh emissions of tokens with minimal disruption. Ethereum was the most significant of these major assets, showing real strength and moving well ahead of the pack as it fought to reclaim previously lost ground after a recent period of underperformance. Meanwhile, several new product introductions and some really strong-looking new tokens captured our attention over the past week, including $ETHFI, a newly launched EFi token that is the first of its kind to go live on the Ethereum blockchain. Tariff Delay Baked In: Ethereum Pulls Ahead Amid Flat Market Last week in cryptocurrency was defined by a calming in the volatility department. The markets had already taken in the bullish effects of the U.S. and China moving to put off new tariffs for 90 days until December. This was a nice short-term boost, because we were headed for a possible trade deal; but still, it was nice to see the markets not worrying too much about this part of the global macroeconomic setup. While it was in relief-rally mode earlier this month, last week, it appeared risk assets were back to the good old grind, with most of the major cryptocurrencies taking it easy and mostly flat for the week. Nonetheless, Ethereum followed a completely different path. After underperforming in the first part of the quarter, it broke out in the second half to record an impressive run, notably rising throughout most of September and October. Market commentators have linked this shift directly to much healthier institutional flows into Ethereum. The trend has also been attributed to increased adoption of Ethereum layer-2 solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, at a time when some major Internet companies, like Amazon, have begun focusing on these solutions in their own infrastructures. Stable price action also created a good atmosphere for unlocks of tokens. Fresh emissions usually harm the market, but investors seem able to absorb most of what would have otherwise caused a major selloff. Overall, the market seems capable of handling any new supply without much fuss. $ETHFI Leads Performance Charts Amid Ecosystem Growth In terms of price performance among the tokens that are undergoing significant unlocks and supply expansions, $ETHFI seems to be the clear standout. In the past month, the token commonly referred to as $ETHFI has nearly doubled in price, touching $51. It has reached as high as $60 in that time span. It’s a new tool from the World Wildlife Fund, helpfully denoted with the ‘WWF’ logo right on the front, which allows users to donate directly to wildlife conservation across a range of species. After a strong month of gains driven by macro relief, the crypto market traded mostly sideways this past week. Weekly Unlock Digest – Week 3, May 2025 Investors appear to have already priced in the impact of the U.S. and China tariff delay. Despite this, Ethereum showed… pic.twitter.com/2ECrD8kjFH — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) May 19, 2025 Some of this rally can be linked directly to Ethereum’s resurgence in the past few months. However, $ETHFI’s surge is also being driven by several fundamental catalysts that are taking its value proposition to a whole new level. One of the most exciting developments is the recent launch of the ETHFI crypto credit card, which offers 2–3% cashback to users. This brings a real layer of world utility to the token’s ecosystem. Furthermore, a sustained source of demand has been created with the implementation of a token buyback and burn program. By actively decreasing circulating supply over time, the program has added deflationary pressure to the token. In turn, this has served to boost investor confidence. Even with the recent increases, $ETHFI is still significantly below where it was at its all-time high, with the price more than 80% lower than its peak valuation. This shows how serious its prior correction was — part of a broader crypto winter — and how much opportunity there is for it to recover, especially if it can keep favorable momentum going. Upcoming Unlocks to Watch Amid Growing Market Maturity Although the current market backdrop has permitted recent token unlocks to take place without major price disruption, this could change. It might change based on the direction that investor sentiment takes. One key factor to pay attention to is the percentage of the total token supply that is unlocked. With $ETHFI, only about 29% of the total token supply is actually unlocked right now. So, what does that leave us with? It leaves us with a lot of the tokens still locked up and some of them to be gradually released into the wild, i.e., into the hands of the market, i.e., onto exchanges, for trading. In the near future, upcoming schedules for unlocking will be very important in determining whether the prices will go up or down over the short to medium term. If people want the tokens and if they’re being used in a really useful way, then the newly unlocked tokens could just get taken up without any problems. But in a more uncertain or just plain volatile situation, the unlocking could add a little bit of downward pressure on the prices, especially for the tokens that are already having a tough time finding buyers. Simultaneously, fresh token generation events are gathering momentum yet again, with rebranded undertakings such as Solana Name Service ($SNS) reestablishing themselves in the marketplace. These circumstances underscore the evolution of the crypto space, in which would-be projects are beginning to adapt, evolve, and re-launch themselves with a greater deal of sophistication. All in all, the third week of May might not have given us any sensational stories, but it was a week that underscored stability and resilience, and even some selective outperformance, for the crypto markets. That dynamic could carry us through the summer of 2025. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

Its stablecoin, USDe, is too. Ethena’s USDe is growing rapidly, and its recent footprint is capturing the attention of crypto investors and market analysts. Over the course of just one week, USDe’s supply has increased by an impressive $300 million—in no small part due to improving funding rates across DeFi. This is an actual narrative shift. Many view this latest uptick in USDe supply as the harbinger of yet another explosive growth phase for Ethena’s ecosystem token, ENA—one that they see having the potential to mirror its meteoric rise in late 2024. A Flashback to October 2024: Explosive Growth and a 5x Rally The previous occasion on which USDe experienced such fast expansion was in October 2024, when its circulating supply shot up by $4 billion in just under two months. That remarkable growth period far outstripped inflows into all Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs combined and only strengthened Ethena Labs’ reputation as a rising force in decentralized finance. For eight weeks, ENA–Ethena’s native governance and incentive token–had a wild ride of appreciation in value. From a meager $0.25, starting point, the token shot up nearly 5 times in value to an all-time high of $1.25. Not only was the price movement exhilarating for investors already on board, but it also had the effect of attracting some big institutional and retail investor names to the project. $ENA is about to explode, mark my words USDe, $ENA stablecoin, just increased $300m in supply in the last week as funding rates have improved. Why is this a big deal? It’s showing us the next period of big growth for @ethena_labs just like last time The last time USDe… pic.twitter.com/JOTRso0gQF — Not Telling (@nottellingyou73) May 18, 2025 At present, the USDe supply is growing fast again, and the overall money funding conditions are looking quite nice. Seems like we are set up for a repeat performance of the last major ENA uptrend in summer 2020. A lot of investors are already placing their bets to take advantage of this setup. I personally have quite a nice position in ENA, and I plan to add quite a bit more soon. Strategic Partnerships and New Blockchain Push the Narrative Forward Bolstering the overall positive sentiment surrounding Ethena Labs is a rally of partnerships and numerous impactful developments that aim to strengthen its long-term value proposition. Most prominently, a recent announcement from Ethena reveals a partnership with Telegram to integrate USDe directly into its ecosystem; this partnership dramatically widens the potential user base for the stablecoin. With Telegram’s global reach—counting hundreds of millions of active users—this partnership could turn out to be a major driver of actual, real-world adoption of USDe that goes beyond DeFi-centric applications. Simultaneously, Ethena Labs is set to introduce a new blockchain called Converge, which is designed with a particular emphasis on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This venture is being carried out in concert with Securitize, an RWA platform that puts compliance first and is backed by none other than BlackRock. The partnership emphasizes Ethena’s commitment to connecting traditional finance with decentralized protocols, a storyline that is gathering more and more currency across the Web3 ecosystem. USDe—and, by extension, ENA—could become central players in on-chain finance if Converge sees a successful introduction. Converge could serve as a major catalyst for staking USDe, in equal parts utility tokens and governance tokens. ENA: Is This the Beginning of Another Parabolic Run? The supply of stablecoins is growing, and the conditions of the market are bright, and then there are those high-profile partnerships. Put all this together, and you have the present setup for ENA, which is looking more and more like the last rally it had, and which some in the crypto community are calling an “easy call” for a next breakout token. Aside from the imagineering upside, Ethena Labs is putting forth a larger vision—one that melds DeFi tools of the kind that can scale with the traditional financial infrastructure. In that world, the three projects we just mentioned would play a part. Ethena would serve users a yield-bearing, censorship-resistant stablecoin in USDe, while it and the two other projects would build out a regulated real-world asset (RWA) ecosystem—in other words, something that might get us to a usable crypto future faster than the un-usable present. Although no investment is without risk, Ethena Labs and ENA seem to be moving with momentum into a critical growth phase. If historical performance is any guide, the next few weeks could bring transformative changes both for the token and for the DeFi ecosystem that is closely observing from the sidelines.

Source: CompaniesMarketCap While the bellwether crypto aims to surpass Amazon’s $2.188 trillion and Apple’s $3.118 trillion, meme tokens linked to the Bitcoin ecosystem appear on steroids. Bitcoin Pepe , which looks to transform the BTC blockchain with increased earning opportunities for investors, rallies as it gains traction before its May 31 official launch. The new project has raised over $10.43 million, confirming investor confidence in its future potential. With timing proving paramount in the digital assets world, let’s evaluate BPEP’s potential in the upcoming months, especially as Bitcoin hints at long-term rallies. Bitcoin steadies above the $2 trillion mark The largest crypto by value first hit the $2 trillion milestone in late 2024. However, dwindling sentiments in Q1 2025 saw the metric plunge to around $1.5 trillion. However, Bitcoin reclaimed $2 trillion in early May as developments like the US-China trade deal revived risk-on appetite. Bitcoin trades at $105,757, with $2.109 trillion in market capitalization cementing its position in the top ten assets by value globally. Presuming the top five maintain constant market sizes, Bitcoin should hit $110,000 to overcome Amazon. Moreover, a new ATH above $158,000 is essential to flip Apple. That seems possible as analysts expect Bitcoin to hit the $200,000 landmark before the end of 2025.

That’s where BPEP comes in. The meme token combines two iconic symbols: the viral Pepe the Frog and Bitcoin. While themed tokens like DOGE and SHIB rely on social media hype and community enthusiasm, Bitcoin Pepe will leverage BTC’s robustness and security for heightened investor benefits. It plans to crack Bitcoin’s full potential through Solana-like functionalities, including staking, meme trading, NFTs, and DeFi activities. The more than $10 million raised in the ongoing presale indicates a positive response from crypto investors looking for long-term growth and utility. Who would want to miss this one-of-a-kind opportunity? Remember, BPEP introduced the world’s first ICO on Bitcoin. There are only eleven days left to board the train. What to anticipate as BPEP’s May 31 debut approaches? The altcoin will likely witness increased activity as its official listing nears. While adopters can experience heightened volatility, Bitcoin Pepe seems poised for key developments that could enrich its visibility. First and foremost, insiders hint at potential listing by top trading platforms, including Bybit and OKX. That will attract increased demand as more traders and investors access the token. Moreover, BPEP’s uniqueness could draw influencer buzz, amplifying attention to the digital token. Furthermore, enhanced market conditions as Bitcoin eyes extended growth could create a lucrative atmosphere for BPEP’s outperformance after its debut. The alt trades at $0.0359, and eyes 1,000x growth in the upcoming times. Source: Bitcoin Pepe You can learn more about Bitcoin Pepe via their website .

She said that, while many NFTs do not qualify as securities, certain NFTs designed to compensate creators over time could also fall outside the scope of federal securities laws. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force , led by Peirce since Jan. 2025, was created as part of the agency’s broader effort to establish clearer regulations in the rapidly growing and often confusing cryptocurrency sector. Under her leadership, the task force has been actively working on providing more defined regulatory guidance. This includes guidance for crypto assets, such as NFTs and stablecoins. ICYMI: HEAD OF CRYPTO TASK FORCE HESTER PEIRCE SHARES VIEW ON NFTS – ""MANY NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS (“NFTS”) ALSO ARE NOT SECURITIES, INCLUDING NFTS DESIGNED TO COMPENSATE THEIR CREATORS OVER TIME"" pic.twitter.com/5ETIaIQRxM — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) May 19, 2025 Hester Peirce Clarifies That Many NFTs, Including Creator Royalties, Are Not Securities Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom” for her vocal dissents on SEC enforcement actions against crypto firms, further clarified her position. She stated that many NFTs do not offer the economic rights typical of securities. These include those designed to compensate creators with royalties over time. These NFTs are powered by smart contracts. They allow artists to earn a portion of the resale price every time the NFT is sold. This works similarly to how streaming platforms pay royalties to creators. Peirce argued that these “creator royalties” do not involve ownership rights in a business. Additionally, they do not promise profits typically associated with securities. While Peirce has classified many NFTs as non-securities, the SEC itself has not yet provided its own official clarification on the matter, leaving ambiguity in how these digital assets should be regulated. This distinction shows her position as an advocate for clearer and more specific guidance from the agency. Peirce Champions for Understanding the ‘Economic Realities’ of Crypto to Shape Future Regulations Since her appointment to lead the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, Peirce has made significant progress in engaging with the industry. The task force has hosted multiple roundtables and received numerous public submissions. Additionally, it has worked closely with lawmakers to develop potential legislation for crypto’s complex regulatory landscape. Her leadership marks a shift from the approach of former chairman Gary Gensler, who was known for his skepticism of crypto. Peirce’s comments on NFTs focus on those that do not involve security-like rights. However, she also acknowledged the challenges posed by other digital assets. These assets might blur the lines between securities and non-securities, she noted.

The Jakarta-based Nasdaq-listed company said on May 19 that its board of directors approved creating a Bitcoin ( BTC ) “treasury reserve” and it was “committing up to 50% of any net profits generated to fund the acquisition of BTC.” DigiAsia said it was also “actively exploring a capital raise of up to US$100 million” to kickstart its Bitcoin holdings and would look to earn yield on its holdings through means like lending and staking. DigiAsia said it had “initiated discussions with regulated partners” on yield strategies and managing its planned Bitcoin holdings. The company added that it was also assessing whether to offer convertible notes or crypto finance instruments linked to its planned Bitcoin haul. DigiAsia stocks explode on Bitcoin plans Shares in DigiAsia Corp (FAAS) closed May 19 trading at a gain of just over 91% at 36 cents after the company’s Bitcoin announcement, according to Google Finance. DigiAsia’s Bitcoin plan has seen its stock price rise over 90% in the regular trading session. Source: Google Finance However, after the bell, DigiAsia stock dropped 22% to 28 cents. The company’s shares are down nearly 53% so far this year, having peaked at just under $12 in March 2024. In a financial update on April 1, DigiAsia reported its revenues grew 36% year-on-year to $101 million in 2024. It projected growth of 24% to $125 million in 2025, along with earnings before interest and taxes of $12 million. A growing number of companies are adding Bitcoin to their corporate holdings, following its popularization by Michael Saylor’s Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, which has the largest Bitcoin holdings of any public company at 576,230 BTC, worth nearly $60.9 billion. Strive Asset Management announced on May 7 that it’s going to transition into a Bitcoin treasury company , and video game retailer GameStop Corporation (GME) finished a convertible debt offering on April 1 that raised $1.5 billion , with some proceeds earmarked for buying Bitcoin.

Bitget CEO Gracy Chen took it to X to reveal that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed the $40 billion milestone in cumulative inflows. The largest crypto by value displays a strong performance, and savvy investors are looking for ways to leverage its growth. Gracy Chen @Bitget @GracyBitget · Follow $40B+ in cumulative flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. This is shaping up to be the most institutionally anchored and structurally supported cycle in crypto history. 8:28 PM · May 19, 2025 68 Reply Copy link Read 15 replies Prevailing trends show digital assets enthusiasts are pivoting to Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , a new project aiming to unlock BTC’s capabilities through speculative undertakings like meme trading, NFTs, and DeFi. Bitcoin Pepe has raised close to $10.5 million, with its presale selling out faster before its 31 May official listing. This article explores how BPEP prepares to ride Bitcoin’s wave in the upcoming months and years. Bitcoin ETFs attract $40B in inflows Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have performed incredibly since their much-awaited approval in early 2024 . The latest statistics show that investment products have officially surpassed $40 billion in inflows as of 19 May, 2025. That reflects massive demand from institutional investors, revealing their trust in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. What do such trends mean for retail players? The crypto market is maturing at an unprecedented pace. And altcoins, especially those with unique narratives like BPEP, tend to outperform amid Bitcoin’s rise. Bitcoin Pepe rides on BTC’s wave as listing approaches Meme tokens have dominated during bull cycles, and Bitcoin Pepe is leading the pack this time. BPEP plans to unlock Bitcoin’s full potential by unleashing trillions in dormant capital into the themed-tokens space. The project grabbed attention due to its one-of-a-kind approach, introducing the world’s first meme initial coin offering (ICO) on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, BPEP is witnessing soaring interest with increased accumulation before the 31 May debut. The project has raised $10,434,818, and looks ready to hit its presale target in the next eleven days. Source – Bitcoin Pepe Its listing appears to be timing as Bitcoin targets record all-time highs amidst institutional interest and positive sentiments. Speculations that Bitcoin Pepe could launch in leading centralized exchanges (CEXs), including OKX and Bybit, after 31 May have magnified the frenzy. Though without official confirmations, experts trust the post-launch craze will attract trading platforms that look to match prevailing trends. Such developments will potentially alleviate BPEP’s status in the meme token and broader crypto space. The alt trades at $0.0359, offering a lucrative discount for investors looking for projects with massive growth potential. Can the unique utility help BPEP outperform meme assets like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in hitting the $1 milestone? A doxed team , audited smart contracts, and revolutionary use cases make Bitcoin Pepe more than a meme token. You can learn more about Bitcoin Pepe here .

The latest activity, brought to attention by the on-chain analytics platform EmberCN, shows that the address has deposited yet another more than 3.5 million LDO—worth close to $3.1 million—into top-tier trading platforms, including but not limited to, Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Gate.io. This transfer is the latest in a series of large token moves that have corresponded with a sharp drop in the price of LDO. In the past six days, the wallet has sent 21.31 million LDO, worth about $21.24 million, into several exchanges. That same week, LDO’s price has dropped 24% from $1.16 to about $0.88. Heavy Selling Pressure Raises Community Concerns The uninterrupted dismantling of LDO from a digital wallet closely linked to Lido’s internal stakeholders or a connected firm has raised red flags in the crypto community. Some wonder whether Lido’s leadership is selling LDO to finance some kind of corporate endeavor or—less flatteringly—to hedge against the remote possibility of Lido becoming a much larger player in the crypto industry. Such a move would be hard to pull off, given the amount of LDO up for sale. But it’s also not clear why so much LDO has been—and apparently is being—sold. For a long time now, when large amounts of tokens have been transferred from project-affiliated wallets to centralized exchanges, people in the market have interpreted those transfers as the former projects’ team members potentially cashing out. And that interpretation has sometimes exerted downward pressure on the tokens’ prices. More recently, the interpretation that token transfers are a bad sign has become even more popular, as LDO’s value has dipped in tandem with the recent downwards movement of the price of a centralized cryptocurrency exchange. The discourse on this subject has been concentrated on social media platforms, especially X (formerly Twitter). Analysts and traders are asking whether this represents a planned treasury reallocation, operational funding needs, or a broader market strategy that has prompted this move. Price Action and Market Impact LDO has suffered significant losses since the initial transfer wave began nearly a week ago. As of this report , the token is trading around $0.88—down 24% from its recent high of $1.16. This steep drop has wiped out a big chunk of LDO’s recent gains and has caused a kerfuffle in its trading pairs across major exchanges. Although the wider cryptocurrency market has also been variable, with the post-FTX world looking ever closer to the 2008 market meltdown (for the first time since the Great Recession, the crypto world has clearly found itself in the hands of really bad regulators and untrustworthy companies), we feel certain that Lido’s moves have nothing to do with the market’s other weirdnesses. Lido isn’t doing what it’s doing because of crypto or macroeconomic conditions; instead, it’s taking these steps because it has internally decided to do so. In other words, there’s an internal catalyst at work. Market participants have responded with caution, and some have even speculated that the market may not have fully come to terms with the large-scale selling that has taken place. If ILO and the trend continues, the near-term IMM may experience increased resistance. That’s “reclaiming higher price levels” as some descriptions go. In simple terms, LDO seems at risk of much more significantly testing the $1.50 support level over the next few weeks. What Comes Next for Lido and LDO? The current situation raises significant concerns about how much light is being shed on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and their practices when it comes to managing tokens. Lido has not issued any public statement that would help to illuminate what’s happening with the wallet in question and the recent exchange activity tied to it. The silence from the protocol is conspicuous. If the team could provide clearer communication regarding whether the transactions are a part of a strategic treasury management effort or a pre-announced unlock schedule, it could help reduce the uncertainty that seems to surround both the transactions and the team’s overall decision-making. The team could then have that much more space to operate in with reduced regulatory risk if the transactions really are what the team says they are. As the DeFi space grows, events like this are being looked at more and more from the perspectives of both fiscal stability and governance. Is this simply a one-off event, or part of a larger trend that we can’t quite see yet? One thing’s for sure: all eyes are on this wallet and Lido right now, as observers try to suss out a likely narrative and watch for upcoming governance decisions.

The pull-back has done little to dent the conviction of market technician Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX), who argues that the decisive battleground is still three weeks away: the weekly close of 9 June, when the Tenkan-sen is projected to cross above the Kijun-sen on the Ichimoku chart. What This Means For Bitcoin Price In a post on X published on May 19, the analyst reminded followers that “some people don’t understand the concept of time-frames,” adding that “while now we have a clear rejection with volume, a lot of people decided to get scared … on the first red 4h candle which even if red, didn’t break support.” He framed the current setback as routine consolidation: “Since tomorrow ~99.9K is a super-strong support,” he wrote, identifying the high-liquidity pocket between $98,900 and $100,200 as an area that is “most likely” to be “bought up pretty quickly and decisively” should spot bids be tested. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $10,000 Stairway: Chart Signals March Toward $115,000 The crux of Dr Cat’s argument lies in the interaction of the fast-moving Tenkan-sen and the medium-term Kijun-sen on the weekly chart. An upward cross of the former above the latter—sometimes colloquially dubbed a “TK golden cross”—carries weight among Ichimoku practitioners because it signals that near-term momentum has finally overwhelmed the baseline trend. What makes the 9 June close especially delicate is the tightness of the current range. Dr Cat concedes that “it’s unclear which will come first, $99,000 or $109,000—and that doesn’t really matter,” but he is categorical that “any deeper retrace below $98,000 is very unlikely.” The rising Kijun-sen, itself a 26-period mid-point, has in effect ratcheted support higher with every week of sideways trade. Related Reading: Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000 Macro-sensitive traders will also be working around the publication of the May US Consumer Price Index on June 11—two days after the anticipated TK cross—and the Federal Reserve’s rate-setting meeting on June 17-18. With real-yield expectations still dominating risk-asset positioning, any upside surprise in core inflation could delay the confirmation of bullish chart patterns—or intensify them if the data land dovish. For now, the market remains range-bound. As long as $99,000 holds on a closing basis and the Chikou-span (lagging line) stays above price, Dr Cat sees little reason to abandon an all-time-high thesis. “If by the time of the cross the price is still holding above Tenkan Sen … if ATH is not seen by then, it should be seen pretty much immediately,” he wrote. Whether that confidence will survive the macro calendar is another question. What is clear is that both discretionary traders and systematic funds are marking 9 June as the moment the chart either validates the 2025 bull cycle—or postpones it once more.

With XRP charging forward and bullish sentiment rising, traders are identifying a shortlist of altcoins gaining steam. At the top of that list: MAGACOIN FINANCE , Cardano , and Bitcoin — three names building pressure for a potential eruption as we move deeper into 2025. XRP: Futures Launch Fueling the Rally Toward $50 XRP is now trading around $2.36 , with the launch of CME XRP futures scheduled for May 19 . The move is being treated as a milestone moment, giving XRP mainstream exposure through a regulated futures market. Analysts are calling for a rally toward $4–$5.50 in the short term, with extended targets of $10–$50 over the cycle if institutional capital and ETF approval follow.

Cardano (ADA): Whale Activity and Upgrade Buzz Cardano is holding above $0.75 , with strong whale accumulation in recent weeks. Over 80 million ADA was bought by large holders in just 48 hours, with speculation building around the Midnight airdrop and upcoming Leios upgrade . Many analysts expect ADA to move toward $1.20–$1.50 if it breaks through the key $0.80 resistance. Bitcoin (BTC): Cycle Leader Holding Firm Over $105K Bitcoin is stabilizing above $105,000 , with volume surging and open interest on CME futures climbing. The $250K price target remains on the table for many institutional models, and analysts are calling BTC’s current strength the foundation for a broader altcoin breakout. As Bitcoin holds, rotation into higher-upside coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE and ADA is accelerating . Solana and ATOM: Quiet Accumulation Could Flip Fast Solana is gaining strength above $178, with real ecosystem expansion through Metamask and Chainlink Labs integration. ATOM, meanwhile, is showing signs of accumulation around $4.73 despite forecasts of near-term volatility. If the next leg of altseason catches fire, both tokens are positioned to follow — but neither is moving as fast as MAGACOIN FINANCE right now.

SOL price is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above the $172 zone. SOL price started a fresh increase above the $165 level against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $172 resistance zone. Solana Price Recovers Above $165 Solana price formed a base above the $160 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace for a move above the $162 and $165 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the bears were active near the $172 resistance zone. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low is acting as a resistance. Solana is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $172 level. The next major resistance is near the $176 level. The main resistance could be $180. A successful close above the $180 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $192. Any more gains might send the price toward the $200 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $172 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $168 zone. The first major support is near the $165 level. A break below the $165 level might send the price toward the $162 zone. If there is a close below the $162 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support in the near term.

Many are asking — what’s so special about May 21st? Is XRP about to skyrocket, or will it drop? While no one can predict the market with complete certainty, analyst Levi said that there are a few reasons why this date has people talking. Global Tensions Affecting Markets Recently, tensions between the US and China have been heating up over trade deals. Both countries agreed to temporarily lower tariffs, but disagreements quickly followed. China is now threatening to retaliate against US export controls, especially involving computer chip supplies. This situation affects global markets — including stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies like XRP. When political and economic tensions rise between major countries, markets often become unstable. XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, tends to react to these global shifts. How Does This Impact XRP? Amid this uncertainty, XRP has been particularly volatile. After recent gains, the token slipped nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, erasing a 3% rise from the previous day. Crypto analysts are now watching the next 48 to 72 hours closely, anticipating a possible market bottom for XRP. Many traders are adopting a “buy-the-dip” strategy during these red days, hoping to capitalize on a rebound if historical patterns hold true. The price range between $2.31 and $2.15 is important. If the price reacts strongly and moves up from this area, it would be a good sign. The next important resistance to watch is at $2.61.

She added that more than 15 Democrats flipped their votes from no to yes, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted no. The passage has cleared a key procedural hurdle after Democratic senators initially blocked the bill earlier in May. This vote to invoke cloture, a procedural motion that limits debate on a matter and requires a super-majority vote, now sets up the bill for floor debate. BREAKING: GENIUS BILL PASSES THROUGH CLOTURE VOTE WITH 60 VOTES pic.twitter.com/ZDmZHe3qh4 — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 20, 2025 Stablecoin Regulation Moves Forward The GENIUS Act was introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty in February with the goal of regulating the $248 billion stablecoin market. The legislation would require stablecoins to be fully backed, undergo regular security audits, and receive approval from federal or state regulators. It restricts issuance to licensed entities and imposes limitations on algorithmic stablecoins and those without full backing. “This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation will bring America’s payment system into the 21st century,” said Senator Hagerty on X. He added that it will ensure US dollar dominance and protect customers. He also predicted that “the demand for US Treasuries will balloon to the tune of more than $1 trillion, and innovation in the digital asset space will thrive in the United States going forward.” “Digital assets are the future, and now we’re one step closer to ensuring America leads the way,” commented Senator Cynthia Lummis. Tonight, the Senate moved forward on the GENIUS Act. This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation will bring America’s payment system into the 21st century. The GENIUS Act skyrockets the United States with a digital payment framework with the fastest rails possible. It will… — Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) May 20, 2025 Democratic senators had previously withdrawn support, citing concerns about potential conflicts with President Trump’s crypto investments and anti-money laundering concerns. However, the legislation was subsequently revised to secure enough bipartisan support to move forward. It now heads to the floor where the Senate will engage in a formal debate on the bill, discuss its merits, propose amendments, and express concerns. Urgency Urged by Lummis Senator Lummis indicated she hopes to complete this process by May 26 (Memorial Day), suggesting an accelerated timeline for the remaining procedural steps. The stablecoin market is currently dominated by Tether, which has a commanding 61% market share with $151 billion USDT in circulation. Its closes rival, Circle, has a 24% market share with just over $60 billion USDC issued. In early April, related legislation, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, was passed by the House Financial Services Committee.

According to a Bloomberg report , Bithumb has surged to capture approximately 25% of the country’s total crypto trading volume, a significant leap from its single-digit presence in 2023. Bithumb’s Strategic Push The revival is largely credited to Bithumb’s bold marketing strategy. To regain its position, Bithumb has launched targeted campaigns to attract users who previously migrated to Upbit. The efforts appear to be working, with the exchange steadily rebuilding its user base and transaction volume. Upbit Still on Top 有几年是在韩国一线交易所工作，对韩国来说 #UPBIT 是一个宇宙级别的交易所，占韩国整个交易所交易量的 90%以上，仅Upbit的 $XRP 交易量就能超过韩国整个股票市场交易量，给大家解析一下 #UPBIT 很多人误区以为 #Bithumb 是韩国第一，但Bithumb交易量也就到 Upbit的 10%左右 01/ 背靠… pic.twitter.com/Yjzglvhitk — JET.K | Bluebird (@degen_jet) May 16, 2025 Despite the surge, Bithumb still trails far behind market leader Upbit. Analyst JET.K notes that Upbit controls over 90% of South Korea’s crypto volume, while Bithumb holds around 10%, highlighting the disparity between the two. This directly counters recent speculation that Bithumb may have overtaken its rival. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: U.S. Senate Moves GENIUS Act Forward with 66-32 Vote , IPO Plans on the Horizon The timing of Bithumb’s comeback is strategic, as the company gears up for an initial public offering expected by the end of 2025. Samsung Securities has been tapped as the lead underwriter for the listing. The IPO move signals Bithumb’s growing ambition to strengthen its position in the market while boosting its credibility with investors. As the rivalry heats up, all eyes are on whether Bithumb can continue closing the gap with Upbit or if Upbit’s first-mover advantage will remain unshaken. Challenging the Status Quo With a renewed user base and public listing in sight, Bithumb appears determined to challenge Upbit’s dominance. Still, the gap remains wide, and whether Bithumb can sustain its momentum remains to be seen. Bithumb’s push is a rare instance of a South Korean exchange bouncing back in a market largely monopolized by one player. As the IPO clock ticks down, the crypto industry will be watching closely to see if this comeback story can truly reshape the local exchange hierarchy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

If this stablecoin bill becomes law, crypto won’t just stabilize, it could explode. Big projects like XRP and Bitcoin might rise fast, while weaker ones could disappear. This bill isn’t just about rules. It could reset the whole crypto space. Why the GENIUS Act Is a Big Deal The GENIUS Act sets strict rules for stablecoins in the U.S. It first failed to pass the Senate on May 8 due to concerns about weak user protections and Trump’s influence. But things changed by May 19. After adding stronger rules, the bill passed a key vote with 66-32 support. Meanwhile, the updated bill requires stablecoins to have full 1:1 fiat backing, monthly audits, and clear redemption rules. This will help remove shady or risky coins and make stablecoins safer for both regular users to billion-dollar institutions. What Comes Next? House of Representatives – The bill moves to the House , where debate could focus on Trump’s coin, DeFi rules, and consumer protection. Reconciliation (if needed) – If the House edits the bill, both chambers must agree on a final version. Trump’s Signature – Trump is expected to sign it, especially since he supports stablecoin rules and backs USD1. Implementation – Includes 100% reserve backing, monthly audits, Fed/OCC oversight, and stricter rules for stablecoin issuers over $50B. XRP’s Secret Advantage in This Bill Stablecoins are a key part of the crypto world. While XRP is not a stablecoin, it could benefit a lot from stronger stablecoin rules. XRP is mainly used for cross-border payments, which need fast and smooth money transfers. Trusted stablecoins make these transactions easier and more reliable. So, the more stablecoins we have and the safer they are, the more useful XRP becomes for global banks and payments.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 05:20:39

Meanwhile, corporate interest in Bitcoin continues to rise as Canadian biotech firm Quantum Biopharma increased its crypto holdings to $4.5 million and plans to stake assets for additional yield. In Asia, Basel Medical also plans to acquire $1 billion in Bitcoin. Separately, Chinese printer company Procolored is facing backlash for distributing malware-infected drivers that stole almost $1 million in Bitcoin. JPMorgan to Open Bitcoin Access to Clients Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, announced a shift in the bank’s stance toward Bitcoin. Speaking at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19, Dimon revealed that the bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, although it will not offer custody services for the cryptocurrency. Instead, JPMorgan plans to include Bitcoin holdings in client statements without directly managing or storing the asset. “We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” According to a CNBC report , JPMorgan intends to offer clients access to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which gained a lot of traction in the US since their launch in January of 2024. These products have already attracted close to $42 billion in aggregate inflows, indicating a strong appetite among investors. Until now, JPMorgan's crypto exposure was largely limited to futures-based products rather than direct investments in Bitcoin. Dimon’s comments also still reflected his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies. He reiterated his concerns about their potential use in illicit activities like money laundering, sex trafficking, and terrorism. However, he framed his support for client access in libertarian terms: “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” This marks a big turn for Dimon, who has been one of the most vocal critics of Bitcoin over the years. In 2018, he called Bitcoin a scam , and in 2021, he said it was “worthless” during the height of the crypto bull market. During a 2023 Senate hearing, he characterized cryptocurrencies as primarily serving criminals and tax evaders. At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, even after Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 milestone, Dimon dismissed it as a “pet rock” that “does nothing.” Jamie Dimon Despite his personal misgivings, JPMorgan’s decision to offer access to spot Bitcoin ETFs aligns it with rivals like Morgan Stanley, which has also started offering the product to select clients. Quantum Biopharma Boosts Bitcoin Holdings Canadian biotechnology firm Quantum Biopharma also recently increased its exposure to digital assets by purchasing an additional $1 million worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The acquisition brings the company’s total crypto holdings to approximately $4.5 million, according to a press release that was issued on May 19. In line with a growing trend among corporations, Quantum announced it plans to stake part of its crypto holdings to generate additional revenue. The company sees its treasury strategy as a way to deliver returns to shareholders while also providing a hedge against the volatility of the Canadian dollar. Quantum’s stock price increase over the past 5 days (Source: Google Finance ) After the announcement, shares of Quantum’s stock surged by around 25%, according to data from Google Finance . This suggests that investors responded positively to the firm’s deeper involvement in the cryptocurrency market, which is increasingly considered as a strategic financial move by companies beyond the tech and finance sectors. Quantum is part of a wave of healthcare and biotech companies integrating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. Earlier in March, NASDAQ-listed Atai Life Sciences revealed plans to invest $5 million into Bitcoin. Atai founder Christian Angermayer has been a very vocal supporter of the strategy, and said in a post on X that Bitcoin should be included in every corporate treasury—particularly in the biotech industry. He argued that crypto assets can help firms endure the long and uncertain timelines that are associated with drug development by offering a buffer against inflation and potential liquidity issues. More recently, on May 16, Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced plans to acquire $1 billion worth of Bitcoin as part of its strategy to boost expansion across Asia. Basel said that the Bitcoin reserves would help build one of the strongest balance sheets among healthcare providers in the region, although its share price fell on the news. Corporate treasuries collectively hold over $83 billion in Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . Publicly traded companies now represent the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, second only to exchange-traded funds. Company Caught Distributing Bitcoin-Stealing Malware In other Bitcoin-related news, Chinese printer manufacturer Procolored is under fire after reports emerged that it distributed Bitcoin-stealing malware alongside its official printer drivers. According to a May 19 article by Chinese media outlet Landian News , the Shenzhen-based company uploaded infected drivers to cloud storage platforms, making them globally accessible for download. The malware was reportedly embedded in USB drivers used for Procolored printers, which ended up compromising unsuspecting users’ systems. The security breach reportedly led to the theft of 9.3 Bitcoin, valued at over $953,000. Cybersecurity firm Slow Mist offered a breakdown of just how the malware functions in a detailed post on X , and explained that it manipulates the system clipboard to replace copied Bitcoin addresses with those belonging to the attacker. This kind of malware is particularly dangerous as it remains stealthy and can redirect funds without user awareness at the moment of transaction. The initial warning was issued by YouTuber Cameron Coward , who discovered the malware while reviewing a Procolored UV printer. His antivirus software flagged the driver as being infected with a worm and a Trojan virus identified as Foxif. After Procolored dismissed the antivirus detection as a false positive, Coward escalated the matter to Reddit . This drew the attention of cybersecurity professionals, including those at G-Data. Procolored printers After an in-depth analysis, G-Data confirmed that the Procolored drivers contained two major forms of malware: Win32.Backdoor.XRedRAT.A and a sophisticated clipboard hijacker. These files, some of which had been hosted on the file-sharing platform MEGA since as early as October of 2023, were found to be capable of opening remote backdoors and executing commands from attackers. When contacted, Procolored claimed the malware was the result of a supply chain compromise. The company said infected USB devices unintentionally introduced the malicious software, which was then uploaded to their official driver distribution channel. According to the firm, the compromised files were removed on May 8 and all available drivers were re-scanned for safety.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-20 05:25:32

According to Krueger, the leader BTC will reach at least double its current level within this year. Krueger also warned users who postpone entering the market, saying, “Almost everyone gets out of the game trying to time it. And many who try to find the perfect entry point never get in the game.” Krueger, who admitted that Bitcoin could be affected by fluctuations in traditional markets such as Nasdaq in the short term, argued that the “HODL (holding assets without selling)” strategy would be profitable in the long term. He stated that it may be possible to achieve better results with derivative products such as options, but that this requires serious timing sensitivity. Related News: Is This Altcoin the New Favorite of Institutional Investors After Bitcoin? They've Been Buying for Weeks! Krueger also criticized financial institutions that prefer to keep Bitcoin on their company balance sheets, arguing that this approach goes against the basic philosophy of Bitcoin: “If you really understood Bitcoin, you would own it directly. But everyone's capacity is different.” Krueger heavily criticized the banking and finance sector, making the following comparison: “These sectors are like dinosaurs now. They are no different than Blockbuster Video, Tower Records or the horse-drawn carriage industry.” At the end of his statement, he made a striking emphasis: “There are only two things you should focus on right now: Bitcoin and artificial intelligence. Everything else is unimportant.” *This is not investment advice.

The bill, which sets licensing, collateralization, and compliance standards for stablecoin issuers, passed a key procedural vote with bipartisan support after facing delays tied to political concerns. As debate over crypto legislation intensifies in Washington, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, has quietly expanded its traditional asset holdings, surpassing Germany in US Treasury investments with over $120 billion. US Senate Advances GENIUS Stablecoin Bill Despite Democrat Concerns Over Trump’s Crypto Empire The United States Senate has taken a pivotal step toward comprehensive regulation of the stablecoin market, advancing the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act) in a 66–32 procedural vote. The vote sets the stage for formal debate on the Senate floor, potentially positioning the bill for final passage as early as Memorial Day, May 26. While the legislation represents a bipartisan breakthrough on stablecoin oversight, its trajectory has been clouded by intense political friction over President Donald Trump’s growing footprint in the cryptocurrency space. The GENIUS Act is designed to introduce clear regulatory standards for the burgeoning $250 billion stablecoin market, which is currently dominated by offshore giants like Tether’s USDT and domestic players such as Circle’s USDC. Introduced by Republican Senator Bill Hagerty on Feb. 4, the bill requires that all stablecoins: Be fully backed by reserves (not algorithmic), Undergo regular third-party security and reserve audits, Be issued only by licensed entities approved by federal or state regulators. The act also explicitly bans algorithmic stablecoins , a move that reflects lingering regulatory concerns after the spectacular 2022 collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin. Democrat Opposition Eases — With Caveats Earlier attempts to move the bill forward were derailed on May 8, when a bloc of Democratic senators blocked cloture due to unresolved concerns around potential conflicts of interest linked to Donald Trump’s personal and family cryptocurrency ventures. However, key Democrats, including Senators Mark Warner, Adam Schiff, and Ruben Gallego, reversed course and supported the motion to debate, acknowledging the urgency of setting regulatory standards. “Blockchain technology is here to stay,” Warner said in a post-vote statement. “We cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality. If American lawmakers don’t shape this ecosystem, other regimes will — and not in ways that reflect democratic values.” Despite their shift in tone, Democratic lawmakers made it clear that they expect stricter oversight to be added in the amendment process, particularly around Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) provisions. Still, not all Democrats are convinced. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent voice for tougher crypto regulation, remained firmly opposed to the bill, criticizing it for failing to curtail what she called Trump’s “blatant crypto corruption.” In a fiery floor speech ahead of the vote, Warren accused Trump and his family of attempting to “institutionalize” their crypto empire through legislation. “Trump and his family have already pocketed hundreds of millions from crypto,” she said, referencing Trump’s new USD1 stablecoin, which has reportedly become the seventh-largest stablecoin by market cap according to CoinGecko. “If this bill passes in its current form, they’ll make hundreds of millions more.” Largest stablecoins by market cap (Source: CoinGecko ) Warren’s remarks come amid widespread media coverage of Trump’s rapidly expanding crypto ventures, including: A meme coin ecosystem tied to the Trump brand, A new crypto mining company planning a public listing, A Trump-branded crypto platform, And the USD1 stablecoin, which has seen a meteoric rise in adoption and trading volume. Cynthia Lummis Targets Memorial Day Passage Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), one of the co-sponsors of the GENIUS Act and a long-time crypto advocate, said she believes the bill can be passed by Memorial Day, signaling urgency as the US races to establish legal clarity before foreign frameworks take precedence. The Senate’s decision to move forward on the GENIUS Act marks a rare bipartisan win in a deeply polarized political environment. But the involvement of Trump’s crypto business interests has complicated the narrative, turning a financial policy debate into a referendum on political ethics. Several Democrats indicated that amendments addressing ethical oversight and potential financial disclosures related to political figures and crypto companies will be tabled in the next phase. With the bill now headed for full Senate debate, the next week will be crucial. Lawmakers are expected to hash out potential amendments addressing: Conflicts of interest, Political beneficiary disclosures, More stringent AML/KYC requirements, Issuer transparency obligations, Guardrails against market manipulation. If the GENIUS Act survives the Senate in its current or amended form, it will head to the House of Representatives for final reconciliation, likely merging with the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, championed by former Representative Patrick McHenry. A Global Race for Stablecoin Leadership The GENIUS Act comes as stablecoins increasingly emerge as the backbone of the digital financial system. With countries like Japan, the UK, and the EU launching or regulating fiat-pegged digital currencies, the US is under mounting pressure to deliver its own rules of the road. A growing number of central banks and policymakers now recognize that stablecoins could either reinforce the dollar’s global dominance or, if left unchecked, open the door for foreign-controlled digital assets to bypass traditional financial oversight. Tether Surpasses Germany in US Treasury Holdings, Cementing Role as Global Dollar Liquidity Distributor In other stablecoin news, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USD₮ (USDT), has officially surpassed Germany in holdings of United States Treasury bills. According to data published by the US Department of the Treasury and confirmed in Tether’s Q1 2025 attestation report, the stablecoin giant now holds over $120 billion in US Treasurys, compared to Germany’s $111.4 billion. This vaults Tether into the 19th position globally among all countries and sovereign wealth entities in terms of US government debt ownership, ahead of nations like Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, and Norway. From Crypto Issuer to Global Bondholder Tether’s evolution from a crypto startup to a heavyweight in global finance has stunned skeptics and analysts alike. What began as a niche stablecoin issuer in 2014 has now become a central liquidity distributor for the US dollar, with significant influence not only in digital markets but in global monetary flows. “This milestone not only reinforces the company’s conservative reserve management strategy,” Tether stated in its Q1 report, “but also highlights Tether’s growing role in distributing dollar-denominated liquidity at scale.” Tether was the 7th largest US Treasuries holder in 2024 (Source: X ) Tether’s holdings are primarily in short-dated US Treasury bills, one of the safest and most liquid financial instruments in the world. These holdings serve as the backing reserves for its $151 billion supply of USD₮, helping to maintain its peg to the US dollar and instill confidence in users. The attestation report, which details the firm’s asset mix and profits for Q1 2025, revealed that Tether generated over $1 billion in operating profit during the first three months of the year. The firm credited this performance to strong returns from its Treasury holdings and its gold reserves, both of which helped offset turbulence in crypto markets. Gold in particular was cited as a key stabilizing factor. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies suffered pullbacks during Q1, gold’s performance in Tether’s portfolio “almost offset” the downturn, the report noted. Global Implications of Tether’s T-Bill Holdings Tether’s rise into the ranks of top US Treasury holders also has geopolitical implications. As stablecoins grow in cross-border adoption, particularly in emerging markets where inflation is rampant, Tether’s USD₮ often acts as a proxy for the dollar itself, enabling users to bypass capital controls and currency instability. Looking ahead, Tether is expected to continue building its traditional asset portfolio, while exploring expansion into tokenized government securities, private lending, and even central bank partnerships in frontier markets. Its Q1 report hints at ongoing dialogue with several jurisdictions interested in using stablecoins for real-time settlement and international remittances. Meanwhile, market analysts say that the firm’s transparency practices remain under intense scrutiny. While Tether has improved its reporting and introduced quarterly attestations, critics argue that nothing short of a full audit by a Big Four accounting firm will suffice to satisfy regulators and institutional investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-20 05:30:00

33767162,[object Object],1747719007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,SEC Chair Slams Agency’s Previous ‘Head-In-The-Sand’ Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinist.com/sec-chair-slams-head-in-the-sand-crypto-regulation/,"In a significant address aimed at revitalizing the relationship between regulators and the cryptocurrency market, new US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins outlined his vision for a more constructive regulatory environment. Trust Deficit Between SEC And Crypto Industry Speaking to capital markets on Monday, Atkins criticized the previous administration’s “regulation by enforcement” approach, which he believes has stifled innovation and left the crypto industry in a state of uncertainty. Atkins described the SEC’s past strategies as a “head-in-the-sand” approach, initially hoping that the crypto market would simply fade away. This was followed by a more aggressive “shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later” method, where market participants often found themselves facing subpoenas rather than receiving guidance. The new pro-crypto chair emphasized that this created a “Catch-22” — a difficult situation from which there is no escape — for those trying to navigate the regulatory landscape . He believes that this has led to a lack of trust between the SEC and the crypto industry. In his prepared remarks, Atkins stated, “The crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years.” He underscored the need for regulators to adapt existing rules to accommodate technological advancements, arguing that the SEC should use its authority to foster innovation rather than impede it. “Old ways of doing things should not be immutable,” he also noted while advocating for flexibility in regulatory frameworks to better align with the evolving nature of the digital asset market. Plans To Draft New Digital Asset Rules Atkins also highlighted the previous SEC leadership’s failure to facilitate open communication between staff and market participants, particularly when complex legal questions arose. To address this, Atkins has directed the Division of Corporation Finance to maintain transparent interactions with the public, allowing for more nimble capital allocation and fostering a more collaborative environment. As part of his commitment to reform, Atkins announced that the SEC staff is currently drafting rule proposals related to cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, he encouraged staff to provide useful insights through informal FAQs, which, although not formal regulations, can help clarify industry concerns. One of Atkins’ proposals includes allowing SEC registrants to custody and trade both securities and non-securities under one roof, a move he believes could streamline operations and reduce costs for investors. He envisions this as a step toward creating a “super-app” that could integrate various financial services, making them more accessible. Atkins concluded his address with a promise to prioritize innovation, stating, “We are getting back to our roots of promoting, rather than stifling, innovation.” He expressed optimism about the SEC’s future direction and its potential to enhance the market for investors.

Nate Geraci , president of the ETF Store and cofounder of the ETF Institute, believes this futures milestone could be the springboard XRP needs to secure an exchange-traded fund. Meanwhile Ripple vs SEC case has also struck in technical glitch creating clouds of confusion on XRP’s ETF prospects. Will XRP make it this time? Institutional Adoption Gets a Boost In a positive move, CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) has added XRP to its list of official crypto products, which shows that big financial players are becoming more confident in XRP. They’ve launched XRP futures contracts, a type of investment that lets people bet on XRP’s future price without actually owning the coins. These contracts are cash-settled, so when they end, investors get paid in dollars, not XRP. This setup makes it easier and safer for big institutions, like banks and hedge funds, to get involved with XRP in a regulated way. Also, the contracts have been approved by the CFTC, a U.S. regulator, which adds trust and makes it more appealing to serious investors. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse , said this is a big moment for XRP and the broader market. He mentioned that Hidden Road, a trading firm, made the first big trade on CME, and he called it an important step in XRP’s growth . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Set to Benefit as GENIUS Act Passes Key Senate Vote on Stablecoins , XRP ETF Hopes Rise Following the futures launch, Geraci predicted that an XRP ETF could be next. His optimism isn’t unfounded. A decision on the proposed Franklin XRP Fund , a spot ETF, is due from the SEC on June 17, 2025. If approved, it would open the door for even broader investor access, similar to how Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have brought in institutional capital and increased legitimacy. Adding weight to the argument is a 2023 ruling by the DC Circuit Court that criticized the SEC for denying Grayscale’s Bitcoin spot ETF while allowing futures-based ones. The court emphasized that if a crypto asset has an active CME futures market, it’s hard to justify blocking a spot ETF. XRP now fits that profile. XRP Price Analysis Despite the positive headlines, XRP’s price has shown little movement in the short term. It’s currently down 0.77% over the past 24 hours but has seen a 63.87% spike in trading volume, signaling heightened interest. As of now, XRP trades at $2.37. While XRP trades sideways, many believe the groundwork is being laid for a bigger run, especially if the ETF dream becomes a reality. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The announcement on Monday (which emphasized plans rather than executed actions) helped push DigiAsia’s shares up 91% during regular trading to 36 cents, before pulling back 22% after hours. The stock is still down more than 50% year-to-date. The company said its board had approved a strategy to allocate up to 50% of future net profits toward BTC purchases and was “actively exploring” a capital raise of up to $100 million, according to a press release. It also plans to pursue yield-generating strategies on its bitcoin holdings, including institutional lending and staking through regulated partners. “We believe bitcoin represents a compelling long-term investment and a foundational layer for modern treasury diversification,” said Prashant Gokarn, Co-CEO of DigiAsia, in the release. The firm added that it was evaluating financing methods such as convertible notes and crypto-linked instruments to support the initiative. In an April update , DigiAsia reported $101 million in revenue for 2024, with projected earnings before interest and taxes of $12 million this year.

We’re not going to custody it,” Dimon told investors . “We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” CEO Dimon has been a Bitcoin critic , comparing the world’s largest crypto to smoking. He previously claimed that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and is often misused by bad actors. During the World Economic Forum in Davos, 2024, he told CNBC that Bitcoin “does nothing,” calling it the pet rock and “hyped-up fraud.” However, on Sunday, he made it clear that his personal view on Bitcoin remains unchanged. He highlighted the crypto’s lack of ownership and issues such as its use in money laundering, terrorism and sex trafficking. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” JPMorgan CEO said. “I defend your right to buy bitcoin.” “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” – Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO https://t.co/zc8CjKdAb9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 19, 2025 The development follows a similar move by Morgan Stanley, which began allowing financial advisors to pitch spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to eligible clients. JPMorgan Reportedly Plans to Offer Bitcoin ETF Access A source close to the matter told CNBC that the bank is looking for ways to provide clients access to bitcoin ETFs. JPMorgan has so far limited its crypto exposure to offering futures and not direct Bitcoin ownership. This comes at a time when there is a major shift in the regulatory landscape under the pro-crypto Trump administration. The SEC, led by Gary Gensler, launched several legal battles against a string of crypto firms. The new wave of institutional adoption led by leading fintechs and banks comes as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) provided new guidance. The agency said that FDIC-supervised institutions can engage in crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval, provided they manage risks. Dimon Downplays Blockchain’s Importance In his speech, JPMorgan CEO Dimon pushed back the hype around blockchain tech, calling it less important than it is made to be. “We have been talking about blockchain for 12 to 15 years,” Dimon told investors. “We spend too much on it. It doesn’t matter as much as you all think.” In the past, he took a more positive view of blockchain technology , recognizing its practical uses. JPMorgan has been actively embracing the nascent tech for various projects, including its blockchain-based JPM Coin. Further, Kinexys, JPMorgan’s own blockchain platform, ran the first test transaction recently, settling a tokenized U.S. Treasury transaction on Ondo Chain’s testnet.

The downgrade triggered a broad market sell-off and raised alarms about the U.S. economy’s long-term stability, but it also reignited a long-standing warning from financial author Robert Kiyosaki, who sees this as the beginning of something far deeper and more dangerous. Markets Rattle as Moody’s Slashes U.S. Credit Rating Moody’s, the last of the major rating agencies to act, cut the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing ballooning deficits and rising interest costs that threaten America’s ability to manage its debt. Investors reacted swiftly: Nasdaq-100 futures plunged 1.6%, S&P 500 dropped 1.2%, and Dow futures fell 0.8%. At the same time, bond yields surged, with the 30-year Treasury piercing the 5% mark for the first time in years, a clear sign of investor nervousness about lending to the U.S. This came on the heels of one of Wall Street’s strongest weeks in months, where easing U.S.-China tensions had sent tech stocks soaring. But those gains now appear fragile as financial markets brace for the ripple effects of America’s downgraded fiscal image. Robert Kiyosaki’s Stark Warning: ‘Deadbeat Dad’ America Author and financial educator Robert Kiyosaki responded strongly to the news. He compared the U.S. to a “deadbeat dad” borrowing recklessly with no plan to pay it back. He warned that this downgrade will likely lead to higher interest rates, triggering a recession, rising unemployment, potential bank failures, and possibly a crash reminiscent of the Great Depression of 1929 . Kiyosaki said he foresaw this scenario in his 2013 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy and has long urged people to escape the trap of job security. Instead, he advises embracing entrepreneurship, investing in cash-flowing real estate during downturns, and saving real assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. “A depression can be the best time to become rich,” he wrote, encouraging people to think like entrepreneurs, not employees clinging to a steady paycheck and a shrinking 401k. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: U.S. Senate Moves GENIUS Act Forward with 66-32 Vote , It’s all Politics…. I think the main reason the markets did not react more sharply to the Moody's downgrade is that it's obvious the U.S. government will never honestly repay its debts. Default or inflation is inevitable. Credit ratings are basically irrelevant. They reflect politics, not economics. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 19, 2025 On the other side, Peter Schiff dismissed Moody’s downgrade as largely irrelevant, saying markets didn’t react strongly because it’s already clear the U.S. can’t repay its debts. He warned that default or inflation is inevitable and argued that credit ratings are political, not economic. Crisis = Opportunity With Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week, investors will be closely watching for signals on how policymakers interpret the downgrade and its potential influence on interest rate decisions. For Kiyosaki, however, the message is already clear for those who prepare wisely, with real assets and an entrepreneurial mindset, may turn crisis into opportunity. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The launch of regulated XRP Futures on @CMEGroup marks a key institutional milestone for XRP…and very excited to report that Hidden Road cleared the first block trade on CME at the opening! https://t.co/Njj8AUSY5K — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 Details of the CME XRP Futures Launch Launching these regulated futures contracts represents a significant development in XRP’s market evolution. On May 19, 2025, CME Group introduced cash-settled XRP futures , available in contract sizes of 2,500 and 50,000 tokens, both settled in U.S. dollars. These instruments are based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which provides a transparent and standardized pricing mechanism. The new futures are designed to meet growing institutional demand for access to XRP exposure without requiring direct custody of the underlying asset. Regulatory Clarity and Market Confidence According to Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Crypto Products at CME, the move to list XRP futures reflects increased market interest and confidence following recent regulatory clarity. He noted that CME doesn’t launch futures for assets without regulatory clarity, and this launch further reinforces XRP’s status as a commodity and not a security. XRP is also among the top traded cryptocurrencies in the market, making it a logical addition to CME’s expanding suite of crypto derivatives. Implications for Institutional Adoption and ETFs Market analysts have linked the XRP Futures to broader institutional acceptance. A popular crypto analyst recently stated that listing XRP on CME lays essential groundwork for potential future products such as a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). While he cautioned against expecting immediate price rallies, he emphasized that the regulated futures contracts open the door to new forms of liquidity and participation by traditional financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Significance of the First Block Trade The clearing of the first block trade by Hidden Road holds symbolic importance, as Ripple recently acquired the global prime broker . This move shows Ripple’s commitment to expanding its institutional reach and infrastructure. The fact that the first such trade on CME occurred through Hidden Road also highlights Ripple’s active role in facilitating institutional engagement with XRP futures from the outset. Looking Ahead As CME’s XRP futures contracts gain traction, their performance will offer insight into the depth of institutional demand for regulated XRP-related products and set the stage for spot XRP ETFs . While long-term effects cannot be determined, the launch marks a new phase in XRP’s integration into regulated financial markets.

The announcement, shared on a May 19 filing , indicates that the agency will “institute proceedings” to assess whether the ETF proposals meet regulatory standards. This procedural move allows the SEC to extend the review period and open a public comment window. The agency stressed that the institution of proceedings “does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions” on the filings. Instead, the SEC says it needs more time to examine the proposals under the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, particularly provisions related to fraud prevention and investor protection. Among the delayed filings is the Bitwise Solana ( SOL ) ETF, which was first submitted in January through Cboe’s BZX Exchange. Bitwise’s fund would hold SOL directly, with prices tracked against the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate. Similarly, 21Shares, already known for its spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs, filed its own Solana proposal earlier this year. You might also like: 72 crypto ETFs are awaiting SEC approval, from altcoins to memecoins Despite growing demand, no altcoin ETFs linked to Solana have been authorized in the U.S. to date. The SEC’s cautious approach to growing crypto-based investment products, particularly for assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum, is reflected in the delays. The SEC is assessing whether the proposals comply with Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), which requires that listed products be made to “protect investors and the public interest” and “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” according to the filing. The delay also comes amid a wider regulatory bottleneck for digital asset ETFs. Several filings for additional cryptocurrency ETFs, including those for Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and XRP ( XRP ), are still being examined. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF analysts, remain hopeful. They estimate a 90% chance of approval for Solana and Litecoin ETFs by late 2025, citing favorable commodity classifications and rising institutional demand. But the future is still unclear. Investors may be left in limbo if the SEC’s request for public input causes the timeline to be further extended.

According to a May 20 report by Bloomberg Law, Genesis accuses DCG and insiders of “self-dealing, fraud, and mismanagement,” claiming they funneled funds to themselves through reckless lending practices and deceptive financial disclosures. The complaint, partially redacted, seeks the return of 1 million digital assets worth approximately $2.1 billion to repay creditors. The Delaware suit alleges DCG and its affiliates, including Grayscale Investments, enriched themselves at the expense of Genesis customers by misleading the market about the lender’s financial health. In a separate lawsuit filed the same day in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Genesis seeks to claw back over $1 billion in transfers made in the year leading up to its bankruptcy in January 2023. These include $448 million to DCG, $136 million to DCG International, and $101 million to HQ Enhanced Yield Fund, among others. Genesis also wants to recover $34 million in tax-related payments it says were fraudulent.

According to reports, Genesis was already insolvent by the end of 2021 and owed $14 billion in unpaid loans. The legal team for Genesis argues that DCG insiders knew about the lender’s growing risks but did nothing about them. To protect DCG from Genesis’ financial consequences, they allegedly transferred assets internally instead. Genesis filed for Chapter 11 protection in January 2023 and completed its restructuring in August 2024, distributing roughly $4 billion in cash and crypto to creditors. That plan, which DCG opposed , included a $2.2 billion payout to Gemini Earn users and uncapped recoveries based on current asset prices. Both lawsuits seek to hold DCG responsible for its alleged involvement in Genesis’ demise and boost creditor recoveries.

MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGAFINANCE) — The Breakout Presale with 20x–35x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the top early-stage altcoins of 2025 — with many analysts calling it a rare opportunity for 20x–35x returns before listings begin . Currently nearing the start of Stage 9 , MAGA has a fixed listing target of $0.007 , a clear value proposition, and momentum that’s attracting investors rotating out of larger caps. Unlike meme coins with undefined roadmaps, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines political branding with structured tokenomics — and that’s why it’s taking the lead in May’s top altcoin rankings. 2. XRP (XRP) — Utility, Legal Clarity, and Institutional Momentum XRP is staging one of the strongest comebacks in crypto history. With full legal clarity in the U.S. and a CME futures launch on the horizon , it is being positioned as the primary settlement and liquidity token for global financial institutions . 3. Solana (SOL) — The Top Performing Layer-1 This Cycle Solana continues to hold its place as the fastest and most scalable Layer-1 blockchain . With active developer support and massive growth in DeFi, Solana is delivering both speed and reliability — two essentials as blockchain use cases expand. Now trading in the $170–$180 range, SOL is projected to hit $250–$400 , with further upside possible if Layer-1 capital rotation continues. It’s a staple for infrastructure-focused investors. 4. Cosmos (ATOM) — A Core Layer-0 Bet for Multichain Scalability Cosmos (ATOM) is often overlooked — but it’s quietly building the foundation for a multichain Web3 ecosystem . Its app-chain model is attracting developers who want modular, sovereign chain designs that still talk to the broader blockchain universe. With price currently between $4.00–$4.75 , ATOM is considered a mid-to-late cycle mover , and could deliver 5x–10x returns as adoption catches up with its tech. Conclusion If you’re building a serious altcoin portfolio for May 2025, this is the shortlist that analysts agree offers the best mix of early-stage upside and ecosystem strength: MAGACOIN FINANCE for raw ROI potential before listings XRP for cross-border payment dominance Solana for infrastructure and scalability Cosmos for multichain network architecture All four are on track to deliver 20x gains or more as the next wave of capital hits the market — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that charge .

Whale wallets tied to Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP are now being tracked building early positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE — a fast-moving altcoin currently in Stage 8 with bold upside forecasts from analysts. This move signals more than speculation — it reflects a growing belief that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the cycle’s biggest ROI entries, with some projections stretching as far as 20,000% before listings. Bitcoin (BTC): Leading the Macro Rally Bitcoin is holding firmly above $105,000 , reinforcing its role as the macro driver of the current cycle. Institutional inflows are continuing through ETF channels, and analysts still target $220K–$250K levels by year-end. With BTC stabilizing, capital is beginning to rotate toward higher-upside, earlier-stage altcoins — exactly where MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned now. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Strategic Accumulation, Stage 8 Momentum, and Massive ROI Projections MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the #1 high-ROI altcoin trade of 2025 , especially among whales looking for early-stage positioning before listings. Why traders are moving in: Stage 8 is live, with buyer volume climbing fast Whales from BTC, ETH, and XRP-linked wallets are now accumulating Audited by Hashex , adding credibility and trust Some analyst models point to 20,000% upside based on listing targets and tokenomics 50% bonus available for a limited time with promo code PATRIOT50X The momentum is real — and the shift is already underway. XRP: Futures Launch Brings New Visibility XRP remains one of the most discussed large-cap plays of the year. With CME XRP Futures launching on May 19 , institutional access is about to expand — and price targets between $5–$10+ are gaining credibility among long-term holders. As the asset gains traction, whale wallets are beginning to diversify — and data shows MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the top destinations for that liquidity. Polkadot (DOT): Expanding Use Case, Quiet Accumulation Polkadot continues to deliver on interoperability and cross-chain infrastructure, and while price action has remained subdued, large DOT holders are watching the meme and momentum sectors closely. Several DOT-linked addresses have recently initiated new entries into MAGACOIN FINANCE, following the broader whale rotation already seen from BTC and ETH. Ethereum (ETH): Foundation Strong, Capital Diversifying Ethereum continues to build strength above $2,600, with optimism surrounding spot ETF approval , on-chain development, and Layer-2 expansion. Still, large ETH holders are beginning to seek early-stage exposure — and MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly risen to the top of their radar. Whale activity shows this isn’t a casual watch — it’s active accumulation. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Final Thoughts Bitcoin is leading the macro trend. Ethereum and XRP are fueling the rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE is where smart capital is landing.

As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,153, representing a 1% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite this dip, the asset remains in a strong position overall, having posted significant gains over the past several weeks and retaining proximity to its all-time high levels. This price action follows a brief consolidation phase late last week, during which Bitcoin paused after climbing above $104,000. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain recently shared his interpretation of the trend based on derivatives and spot market data. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Whales About to Cash Out? Key Metric Signals Possible Profit-Taking Ahead Market Buy Volume and Funding Rates Show a Shift in Rally Behavior In his recent analysis, “Bitcoin’s Rebound Without Overheating Is a Clear Sign of a Healthy Bull Market,” Avocado Onchain pointed to a shift in Bitcoin’s behavior around key price milestones. In previous breakout attempts, he noted that Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs was often accompanied by a sharp rise in Binance’s market buy volume and funding rates, both of which signaled overheated conditions. These conditions typically resulted in short-term corrections, as traders locked in profits and leverage unwound. However, the analyst observed that the current rebound is unfolding differently. Funding rates on Binance remain stable, and market buy volume is trending downward, which Avocado interprets as a sign of restraint rather than weakness. He argued that, unlike the sharp speculative rallies seen in prior phases, the present environment reflects cautious optimism and sustained accumulation. According to him, this more tempered recovery could be less vulnerable to abrupt pullbacks and instead support a more stable path to potential new highs. 📋 과열 없는 비트코인 반등, 건강한 강세장의 신호(Bitcoin’s Rebound Without Overheating Is a Clear Sign of a Healthy Bull Market) 이번 시즌 비트코인 가격이 신고가를 갱신할 때마다 바이낸스 시장가 매수 거래량과 펀딩비는 크게 상승하였고, 그 후 과열로 인한 조정기간이 찾아오는 유사한… pic.twitter.com/c0JCPzgbfY — Avocado (@avocado_onchain) May 19, 2025 Bitcoin On-Chain Trends Point to Continued Accumulation Avocado further emphasized that although buying activity is not surging at the same rate as in prior runs, the overall trend in market buy volume has been gradually increasing since 2023. He referred to on-chain data that shows a consistent uptrend, suggesting that longer-term investor appetite remains intact. With sentiment still recovering from recent corrections and derivatives markets appearing less overheated, he suggested the market structure is favorable for additional upward momentum in the near to mid-term.

Herro and Folkman, previously running the now-defunct Dough Finance, had quietly abandoned hundreds of investors who lost millions in the collapse, and re-emerged with World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that now flows money straight into the Trump family’s pockets. According to Reuters , Jonathan Lopez, a 31-year-old crypto trader and motivational speaker from Miami, invested $1 million in Dough in May 2024. He was introduced to high-risk strategies like “looping,” which lets users borrow against crypto assets repeatedly. Herro guided him through it personally, telling him, “We get reward(s) for the risks we take. Lfg.” Then on July 12, everything was gone. Lopez’s funds and over $2.5 million in total were drained in a hack that Dough later admitted was caused by vulnerabilities in its own code. Herro promised to fix Dough while planning World Liberty with Trump In the aftermath of the breach, Herro texted Lopez saying, “I said we’d take care of it,” and claimed the team needed the weekend to sort things out. Folkman told users in Dough’s Telegram group that “We will not stop until everyone is made whole.” But by August 18, both founders went silent. Dough’s Telegram and X accounts were abandoned, and one private chat group was deleted entirely, according to former members. While investors waited, Herro and Folkman were already building World Liberty. They were introduced to Trump, Don Jr., and Eric Trump through presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, and the Trump family quickly jumped in. Trump took the title “Chief Crypto Advocate,” while his sons were labeled “Web3 Ambassadors.” None of them commented on the Dough scandal. When asked about Herro and Folkman’s roles, Eric Trump replied in an email, “They have overachieved our wildest goals and our current trajectory is nothing short of incredible.” The new venture has already pushed over $550 million worth of tokens. Of that, Herro and Folkman collected at least $65 million, while the Trump family reportedly received around $400 million. That money flowed even as former Dough users struggled to recover their losses. Lopez filed a lawsuit while Trump’s partners partied in DC In January 2025, Lopez sued Herro in Miami federal court, alleging fraud, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and securities violations. His attorney, Joseph Pardo, said Lopez invested based on promises Herro made about Dough’s safety and performance. Herro’s legal team responded by calling Lopez a “sophisticated” investor who should have understood the risks, and claimed the hack was outside Herro’s control. A trial is scheduled for April 2026. Before Dough collapsed, Herro called himself “the dirtbag of the internet” in a recorded pitch to investors, bragging, “I do what’s legal… besides that I don’t give a fuck.” Folkman’s earlier project was “Date Hotter Girls,” a site offering dating advice. Despite that track record, their new partnership with Trump has drawn little public scrutiny. Meanwhile, the Dough website is now locked and nearly empty, as tracked by DeFiLlama. In July, the company said $281,000 of the stolen assets had been recovered with help from security group SEAL 911, and promised pro-rata payouts. In September, data from CertiK showed that only $180,000 was sent to 134 wallets. Eight Dough users interviewed said they received nothing and didn’t know how payouts were selected. The legal challenges are stacking. Jonathan Cogan, attorney at Kobre & Kim, explained that most victims file negligence claims because they’re easier to prove than fraud. Joseph Cioffi, a partner at Davis+Gilbert, said promises to “make users whole” aren’t legally binding without a formal agreement. And Dough’s disclaimers–calling their tech “novel, experimental, and speculative”–don’t necessarily shield them from liability. On January 20, as Herro and Folkman’s victims waited for answers, the pair were seen in Washington, DC, celebrating at a black-tie inaugural ball for Trump’s return to the White House.

The survey of 3,345 respondents asked: “Assuming the United States was thinking of converting some of their gold reserve into Bitcoin, what percentage would you advise they convert?” The majority of respondents wanted between 1% and 30% converted, it revealed. 4 in 5 Americans want some US gold reserves converted to bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/ibxXfe04g5 — The Nakamoto Project (@NakamotoProjct) May 19, 2025 Lots of Skepticism Project co-founder Troy Cross said many were skeptical of the findings, suggesting that only Bitcoiners were surveyed. “We were also surprised too. But the results are the results. When given a slider and asked to advise the US government on the right proportion of Bitcoin and gold, subjects were very reluctant to put that slider on 0% Bitcoin and 100% gold. Instead, they settled around 10% Bitcoin,” he explained. The recommended proportions of BTC dropped significantly with age, which was not surprising given the inverse relationship the organization found in a previous survey between age and Bitcoin ownership. Satoshi Action Fund co-founder Dennis Porter said he didn’t believe it at first, adding that: “Americans just don’t care about gold that much, and most people are inclined towards diversification when given the choice.” The survey, which ran between February and mid-March, was conducted online, and participants were paid. However, the survey and data collection company Qualtrics was asked to match the US Census distribution in terms of age, gender, race, income, education, and geography as closely as possible, he added. The study also revealed that around 66% of respondents were neutral-to-positive about Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Uncle Sam also holds around 207,189 BTC worth around $22 billion, less than 3% of its gold reserves, according to BiTBO, so there is plenty of room for diversification. White House adviser Bo Hines has floated a new strategy that the Treasury might start buying Bitcoin using profits from its gold reserves. This plan, if enacted, could lead to the purchase of up to 1 million BTC over five years. He referenced Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025, stating in March, “If we actually realize the gains on these [gold certificate holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested matching the country’s gold reserves with Bitcoin in July.

The token remained consolidated within a narrow range for a long time, which helped the bulls to accumulate strength. As a result, the price attracted more than 20% gains while the buying volume increased by over 50%. With this, the price is slowly approaching the crucial threshold, which may not only form a new ATH but could also mark a 4-digit figure. Aave has been showing strong momentum driven by whale inflows and institutional interest. The price is nearing the monthly highs as bullish sentiment takes over the markets along with the backing received for AAVE as the core of DeFi’s infrastructure. With this, AAVE records a new Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $24 billion, which is also the new all-time high for the platform The DeFi lending protocol seems to be on fire, which flashes massive bullish signals for the future of decentralized finance. The AAVE price, which has been trading pretty strongly since the bounce from the lows close to $100, seems to be looking forward to a proper HTF bullish breakout from the structure. With this, the token displays the possibility of ranging beyond the final resistance below the ATH. The historical chart of AAVE suggests the price broke down from the rising wedge after accomplishing the parabolic recovery curve. Despite the drop in volume, the price rebounded from the local lows and surged by over 130%. With this, the technicals like MACD & RSI have turned bullish in the form of a bullish crossover and a u-shaped recovery. Hence, if the AAVE manages to rise and secure the resistance at $280, a monthly close above $300 could be imminent. In a wider perspective, the AAVE price is undergoing a V-shaped, steep recovery, and hence it is expected to reach the neckline between $422 and $443. A breakout above the range is believed to initiate a fresh upswing, which could push the price into a discovery phase and mark a new ATH, probably close to $1000.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,AAVE|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 06:14:06
