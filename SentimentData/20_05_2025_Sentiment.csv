Exculpatory Evidence Discovered, Lawyers for Roman Storm Say According to Storm’s counsel , the government has “possessed exculpatory materials” regarding evidence pertinent to the developer’s criminal trial since August 2023. NEW: Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm's attorneys moved to reconsider case dismissal, alleging prosecutors hid exculpatory 2023 FinCEN communications suggesting non-custodial cryptocurrency mixers aren't ""money transmitting businesses."" pic.twitter.com/9LmpyQtkIh — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) May 19, 2025 The defense lawyers claim that the federal prosecutors’ view of Tornado Cash as a “money-transmitting business” goes against their August 2023 statement where FinCEN officials claimed that fellow crypto mixer, Samourai Wallet, does not count as a money transmitter given its non-custodial nature. Given that Tornado Cash is also non-custodial, Storm’s team argues that the government is going against its own stance by indicting the crypto developer . “The disclosures in the Samourai case reveal that the government, at the very least, played fast and loose and, at worst, affirmatively misled this court,” the letter reads. U.S. Prosecutors Defend Their Stance Meanwhile, prosecutors are pushing back on the defense’s claims after Storm’s team expressed “concern about the government’s belated disclosures in the Samourai case” in a May 8 letter. “The Government disclosed all known substantive communications between the prosecution team and FinCEN regarding Samourai Wallet months in advance of pretrial motions and trial,” U.S. prosecutors said in a recent filing. “Indeed, the defendants will have seven months to make use of the information before trial,” they added. “Nothing more is warranted.” U.S. Sees Changing Crypto Regulations The controversial Tornado Cash case comes amid shifting crypto regulations in the United States as President Donald Trump relaxes rulemaking on the blockchain sector . On April 7, the Deputy Attorney General’s Office released a memorandum stating it would, in part, “no longer target virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and offline wallets for the acts of their end users or unwitting violations of regulations.” The post Roman Storm’s Defense Team Accuses U.S. Government Of Withholding Key Exculpatory Evidence appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Crypto mixers|Regulation|tornado cash,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-19 22:40:51

According to sources familiar with the matter cited by Bloomberg, the DOJ’s criminal division in Washington is examining the circumstances surrounding the breach, which has raised serious concerns about cybersecurity within the crypto sector. Coinbase Collaborates With DOJ Amid Major Data Breach Coinbase disclosed that the breach involved criminal actors bribing employees and contractors in India to gain access to sensitive client data. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, stated: We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Importantly, the exchange’s CLO clarified that while Coinbase itself is not under investigation, the DOJ is focused on the criminals involved in the breach. The incident first came to light when Coinbase received an email from an unidentified threat actor on May 11, claiming to possess information about certain customer accounts alongside internal documents. The company anticipates losses ranging from $180 million to $400 million due to the cyberattack. $20 Million Reward Fund After Rejecting Ransom While the attackers managed to steal some data, including names, addresses, and email addresses, the exchange confirmed that login credentials and passwords were not compromised. In a statement on May 15, Coinbase reassured its users via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that it would not succumb to the attackers’ demands. The criminals had requested a ransom of $20 million.

Trading volumes have nearly doubled in the same period, signaling heightened interest as DOGE approached the key $0.23 resistance level. Meanwhile, other leading meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) have also dipped around 4.4%, suggesting the entire sector is gearing up for a bounce as sellers get exhausted. So, is the baseline Dogecoin price prediction still bullish — or does this past week’s dip signal deeper trouble ahead for the top meme coin? Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Forms Bull Flag and Could Rise to $0.35 DOGE’s price action has stalled in the past week after the token reached the $0.25 area as it seems that this is a key level for market participants. The price has dropped to its lowest point in a week already at around $0.21 as momentum indicators were already flashing sell signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) had surged to overbought levels already while the MACD’s histogram had been trending lower for four days in a row. Although the price action still favors a bullish Dogecoin price prediciton, the rally had already reached a point of exhaustion already and justifies a pullback. However, this does not necessarily mean that the uptrend is over. DOGE has formed a bullish flag pattern that could result in a higher high if the price breaks the upper bound of this formation. This resistance currently stands at around $0.23 and it is the key level to watch in the following days. Based on the flag’s pole size, a bullish breakout could push DOGE to $0.35, meaning a potential 52% gain in a relatively short period. Meanwhile, the key support to watch apart from the flag’s lower bound would be the range between $0.18 and $0.19 as a bounce off this level will still maintain the asset’s bullish price structure intact. While DOGE’s outlook may be a bit uncertain at the time, the top crypto presales of the year like Best Wallet (BEST) offer the highest upside potential as their tokens are offered at a heavily discounted price. Best Wallet (BEST) Set to Launch Groundbreaking Web3 Storage Solution – $12.5M Raised and Counting Best Wallet (BEST) is rapidly positioning itself as a game-changer in the crypto space, offering a next-gen wallet that supports assets across 60 blockchains, delivers ultra-low swap fees, and is packed with powerful tools for modern traders.

Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty. Bitcoin ETF inflows are recovering, and analysts predict BTC could reach $110,000–$444,000 in 2025. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is holding above $100,000, leading Fidelity Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer to say the crypto asset could reclaim its position as a leading store-of-value contender. Timmer’s recent analysis highlights a convergence in the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two assets are increasingly comparable in risk-adjusted returns. The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility. The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio. Source: X.com From an allocation standpoint, Timmer recommended a 4:1 gold-to-Bitcoin ratio for a store-of-value hedge, highlighting an intriguing observation. Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!” While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic n ewsletter , pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated, “Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison. Source: X.com Gold, with a 30.33% price gain in 2025 compared to Bitcoin’s 3.84%, benefited from its stability during economic unease. Additionally, the analysis added that Bitcoin performed better as a “high-beta growth asset,” thriving in rising liquidity and fiat debasement environments. Recent developments signal a shift: US trade policy clarity, a softer Federal Reserve stance, and easing financial conditions have spurred steady inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Related: Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs Bitcoin is on track for new highs in 2025 A higher Sharpe ratio is a positive metric for Bitcoin, significantly increasing the probability of reaching new all-time highs above $110,000 in May.

Bitcoin Suisse head of research Dominic Weibei said, “In this environment, Bitcoin has emerged as the Swiss army knife asset. Whether equities rally or bonds crumble, BTC trades on its supply-demand fundamentals, delivering a win-win profile that traditional assets simply can't offer.” Similarly, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin has a ""decent chance"" of reaching $250,000 or more in 2025, driven by its interplay with gold, according to a gold-based forecast. The report uses a scenario-based framework rooted in its gold model to project Bitcoin’s potential revaluation as a non-sovereign hard asset. If Bitcoin’s network value, measured in gold, follows a power curve, and gold maintains its current value, analysts suggest it could hit $444,000 in 2025. However, a more conservative estimate by Bitcoin analyst Apsk32 points to a ""reasonable"" target of $220,000 for the year.

On-chain data shows the number of non-zero SOL addresses recently hit a new all-time high. Solana (SOL) price has regained bullish momentum since early April 2025. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $99.8 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $6 billion, has formed higher highs and higher lows in the past seven weeks, thus signaling a rising trend in the higher timeframe. The rising SOL trend coincides with the Bitcoin price rebound above $100k amid an anticipated reversal of the BTC’e weekly dominance. Furthermore, the rising crypto optimism favors an altseason in the coming months, bolstered by the notable rebound of Ether against BTC . Solana Network Records Mixed Fundamentals The Solana network remains a key player in the DeFi space, mostly in the memecoin ecosystem. The rising adoption of Solana-based memecoins has helped increase the non-zero SOL address in the recent past. According to on-chain data analysis from Glassnode, the number of Solana wallets holding at least 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high (ATH) of 11.16 million. Meanwhile, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on VanEck’s proposed Solana ETF on Monday for further review and consultations. Midterm Expectations for SOL Price After hitting a local target of above $174 in the past two weeks, the SOL price has been trapped in a short-term correction. In the 1-hour timeframe, SOL price has formed a parallel symmetrical falling trend in the past few days. Following Monday’s SOL price rebound from the lower border of the symmetrical falling trend, SOL price is positioned to rally towards the upper border in the coming days. A potential close above the symmetrical falling trend will propel SOL price towards the next short-term target of above $200. However, a further correction, in the coming days, will likely dump SOL price towards the next significant support level above $157.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-19 23:00:11

As ETH consolidates, Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are all seeing increased liquidity and investor attention, each positioning for the next major move in a shifting market. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 40x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace among presales in 2025, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. Analysts are forecasting up to 40x returns before listings, driven by a capped 100 billion token supply, strong branding, and a Hashex audit for security. The project is dominating early-stage dashboards, with traders and analysts alike highlighting its Q3 listing narrative and daily community growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s structure and momentum are making it the top choice for those seeking powerful upside before the next wave of listings. As each stage fills, the entry window narrows, and those recognizing the setup are moving quickly. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Bitcoin: Liquidity Builds as Key Levels Approach Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at approximately $103,405, reflecting a 1.1% decline over the past 24 hours. The market is monitoring support above $100,000, with volatility intensifying after a weekend surge to $106,540. As institutional inflows remain steady, BTC’s price stability is encouraging capital to explore dynamic opportunities, including high-upside altcoins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana: Bullish Patterns and Institutional Optimism Solana (SOL) is priced at $171.54 as of May 19, 2025, consolidating just below resistance after a recent climb. Technical analysts suggest a breakout above $175 could trigger a move toward $200, but for now, some investors are rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper growth while SOL trades sideways. Avalanche: DeFi Growth and Technical Strength Avalanche (AVAX) is trading around $22.58, with analysts forecasting an average of $19.74 for May and a potential peak of $22.58.

Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Kaspa (KAS) continue to gain ground and attract attention, but another name is quickly becoming hard to ignore: BlockDAG. This rising project is shaping a strong case to join the ranks of leading digital currencies. Unlike quick-trending coins, BlockDAG offers practical features, meaningful partnerships, and a tech-driven structure that makes it stand out. Priced at just $0.0020 in its current crypto presale phase, BlockDAG aims for a launch price of $0.05, offering a projected 2,400% return. It may turn out to be one of the top crypto coins in 2025 worth watching. BlockDAG’s Momentum Grows With $255M Raised Recognized as one of the top crypto coins in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised $255 million in its presale while offering BDAG coins at $0.0020 for a limited time. With the launch price confirmed at $0.05, this gives buyers a projected ROI of 2,400%. Batch 28 is already at $0.0262, indicating swift progress through the presale stages. A total of 20.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold, reflecting growing interest. What separates BlockDAG from others is its EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, allowing developers to launch Ethereum-based dApps with ease. It’s tailored for builders seeking seamless usability. BlockDAG also passed a complete CertiK audit and sold over 17,600 mining units. It’s already operational, not just an idea. Five exchanges are confirmed to list BDAG, and 15 more will be announced during the awaited GO LIVE reveal. That’s 20 listings ready to go once trading begins. Those following the top crypto coins in 2025 with early access and a strong system will likely find BlockDAG a top choice. The $0.0020 price will soon be gone once its value becomes more widely recognized. Solana (SOL): Building Through Market Fluctuations Solana has shown it can recover fast. At about $173, it rebounded after news broke of FTX planning to offload $5 billion in assets, including $236 million in unstaked SOL. This raised some selling pressure but didn’t shake Solana’s overall standing. The platform’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) grew from $7.5 billion to $9.6 billion in May. This rise supports its status among the top crypto coins in 2025, especially for those drawn to reliable decentralized finance systems. Dogecoin (DOGE): Community-Driven Meme Coin Dogecoin holds near $0.2271 and is showing serious momentum. After the SEC acknowledged a 21Shares spot Dogecoin ETF filing, its active address count surged by 528%. Futures open interest climbed 70% to $1.65 billion. Many analysts expect DOGE to cross $0.24 and even aim for $0.40 if the trend keeps up. Despite its meme label, its growing use and speculative energy give it a position among the top crypto coins in 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Breaking Out Technically KAS saw a 30% jump over the last week, reaching around $0.1189. A bullish engulfing pattern and strong support at the $0.101 Fibonacci level are helping its case. Short-term goals are pointing toward $0.1554, and community enthusiasm remains high. Kaspa’s appeal includes its speed, low fees, and a solid development team, key traits among top crypto coins in 2025. To Sum Up! Who’s Leading the Pack? Solana continues gaining strength through its growing DeFi activity. Dogecoin earns attention from ETF buzz and user metrics. Kaspa’s upward trend remains intact due to chart setups and a loyal user base. Each is part of the discussion around top crypto coins in 2025. However, BlockDAG is stepping into a leading role. With its $0.0020 presale price and $0.05 confirmed launch value, EVM-compatible tech, solid audit record, and 20 exchange listings in motion, the project shows significant traction. Add the 20.8 billion coins already sold and 17,600 miners distributed, and it becomes clear that this network is well-prepared. For anyone following early-stage coins with real use and fast growth, BlockDAG ranks among the top crypto coins in 2025 that can’t be overlooked. Timing is key before wider attention sends it soaring.

Bitcoin has just recorded its highest-ever weekly close, brushing against its all-time high and sending ripples across the entire market. Confidence is back, and the numbers are loud. Sentiment charts have flipped bullish, daily volumes are climbing, and early adopters are scanning for the top coins to join today. With BTC holding firm, the rising tide could lift more than just legacy tokens—new players like Qubetics are showing signs of becoming serious contenders before even hitting major exchanges. Qubetics ($TICS) is rising as a strong alternative for those who missed out on earlier cycles. Its utility-first approach is putting it at the center of global finance conversations, especially with its recent spotlight on cross-border payments. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash is experiencing a technical comeback, supported by bullish community sentiment, and Filecoin is making headlines by joining forces with Lockheed Martin. These developments aren’t just news—they’re shaping the strategic plays for this quarter. Each of these coins is reacting to the new wave of crypto momentum, but the real edge could lie in knowing where the next breakout might come from. One name continues to come up: Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator with a growing presale narrative. How Qubetics Is Reshaping International Payments With Real-World Utility The growing need for fast, secure, and low-cost global payments is more than a fintech buzzword—it’s a daily operational demand. Qubetics answers this challenge head-on with its near-instant cross-border transaction solution that leverages the TICS token. It’s not just another blockchain tool—it’s built for the institutions and enterprises that fuel global trade. Whether it’s a U.S. startup working with remote developers across Southeast Asia, or a Canadian e-commerce business sourcing goods from Latin America, Qubetics removes the common roadblocks—transaction delays, high fees, and currency friction. For financial institutions, Qubetics brings the blockchain backbone needed to make settlements seamless and transparent. It streamlines fund transfers without needing to rely on outdated rails. Picture a mid-sized U.S. bank facilitating instant remittances for expats sending money to their families in developing economies—Qubetics makes that happen without intermediaries or unnecessary lag. And for everyday users? It’s about sending, spending, and converting digital assets on the go with no headaches. With this kind of practical firepower, Qubetics isn’t just joining the race—it’s changing how it’s run. That’s why it stands among the top coins to join today. Why the Qubetics Presale Stands Out as One of the Top Coins to Join Today The Qubetics presale isn’t your average crypto fundraising story—it’s built with structure, predictability, and real reward potential. Each presale stage lasts exactly seven days, ending every Sunday at 12 AM. And every week without fail, the price rises by 10%. That means early buyers know exactly when their entry window closes. Currently, the presale is in Stage 35 with a token price of $0.2785, over $17.1 million has already been raised, and more than 513 million $TICS tokens have been sold to over 26,700 holders. Now, what makes this one of the top coins to join today is the projected ROI baked into these price points. If $TICS reaches just $1 post-presale, that’s a 258.95% return. If it hits $5, the return jumps to 1,694.74%. At $6, that’s a 2,053.68% increase. A $10 price point after mainnet launch? That would be 3,489.47% ROI. And if Qubetics reaches $15 after launch, that’s a whopping 5,284.21% ROI. Take this for example: a $5,000 investment at today’s Stage 35 price nets you 17,950 $TICS. If $TICS climbs to $10, that stack becomes worth $179,500—with zero need to time the market, because the crypto presale itself is staged for growth. This kind of structure is rare in early crypto. It’s why the Qubetics presale is being tagged by many as the best crypto presale in 2025. For those still weighing their entry, this stage closes in days—not weeks. And with the mainnet dropping in Q2 2025, the clock’s ticking for those waiting on the sidelines. Bitcoin Cash Shows Renewed Energy With Bullish Sentiment Growing Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is picking up serious momentum among community members. As of today, it’s trading around $379.16, showing a daily dip of -5.04%, but the broader sentiment tells a different story. According to Binance’s consensus rating, 35.00% of users are “very bullish” on BCH’s future. Add to that 25% marking it as “bullish” and another 12.5% keeping a neutral stance, the outlook leans overwhelmingly positive. What makes this different from earlier cycles is the clear pattern seen on its technical forecast. The chart shows a post-2024 bounce, with projections heading towards the $450 to $500 zone by 2030 if trends continue. Market participants are reading this as an entry window while prices are still below the 2021 highs. It’s not just a historical bounce—it’s backed by a community that’s recalibrating its outlook amid broader market optimism. These signs aren’t abstract. They’re the same kind of patterns that predate significant rallies—especially when major tokens like Bitcoin are stabilizing near peak highs. BCH may not make flashy headlines every day, but it’s staking its place as one of the top coins to join today based on both sentiment data and upward technical movement. Filecoin’s Partnership With Lockheed Martin Could Redefine Space Data Storage Filecoin just stepped beyond blockchain and straight into aerospace. According to the latest reports, Filecoin has teamed up with Lockheed Martin, aiming to reshape how data is stored and transmitted in space. The partnership aims to leverage decentralized storage infrastructure for space missions—this is no longer just cloud vs. chain—it’s earth vs. orbit. This strategic collaboration brings serious real-world backing to Filecoin’s long-term vision. Lockheed Martin’s involvement speaks volumes about institutional confidence in Filecoin’s tech stack. While traditional storage systems rely on centralized control, this shift to decentralized protocol represents a massive leap toward faster, cheaper, and more secure space communications. And back on Earth, Filecoin’s credibility just skyrocketed. Its use case is no longer confined to Web3 data—this could be the architecture supporting tomorrow’s orbital networks. For community members looking for long-hold projects with government-aligned partnerships, Filecoin just made a serious case as one of the top coins to join today. Weekly Crypto Surge: What It Means for Qubetics, Filecoin, and Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin’s record-breaking weekly close isn’t just technical—it’s psychological. That bullish wave is setting the tone for other altcoins to find their footing and take off. The crypto market thrives on chain reactions, and BTC’s performance often opens doors for adjacent coins that show promise, structure, or real-world partnerships. Qubetics, which is still in its presale phase, offers a rare form of predictability amid all this volatility. With a guaranteed 10% weekly price rise, early buyers aren’t guessing—they’re planning. Bitcoin Cash is benefiting from this upward trend, reviving its bullish sentiment. And Filecoin? The Lockheed Martin deal now rides a tailwind from an increasingly optimistic market. These three are being pulled forward by different forces—but the destination looks the same. They’re not reactionary plays. They’re strategic entries in a market preparing for its next real breakout. Why These Are the Top Coins to Join Today in 2025 Each of these tokens—Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Filecoin—are delivering something different. BCH is riding a technical breakout with backing from a bullish community. Filecoin is proving it’s more than a Web3 storage player—it’s a frontier-tech protocol moving into aerospace. And Qubetics is building a payments solution on-chain that cuts across borders, fees, and friction. But what ties them all together is momentum. With BTC holding near all-time highs, the broader market is heating up. Projects with strong fundamentals, growth structures, and relevant use cases are moving to the front of the line. Qubetics, still in its presale, is being recognized among the top coins to join today, offering a lower-barrier entry with massive upside—especially considering its fixed 10% weekly increase and approaching Q2 2025 mainnet launch. For participants scanning for where to go next, the smart play is to join this best crypto presale while it’s still priced under $0.30—and to keep a close eye on Filecoin and Bitcoin Cash as this cycle unfolds.

Every stage closes on Sunday at 12 AM, with each new stage increasing token price by 10%. What is Filecoin’s role in space data transmission? Filecoin is partnering with Lockheed Martin to create decentralized data storage systems for space, marking a new use case for blockchain.

Per the newspaper Chungnyun Ilbo , experts say that US dollar-based stablecoins could have an impact on exchange rates and fiat currencies. Stablecoin Danger for South Korean Economy? The comments came at a digital assets-themed meeting of the Korea Economic Association at the FKI Tower Conference Center in Yeouido, Seoul, on May 19. The FKI Tower Conference Center in Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea. (Source: FKI TV/YouTube/Screenshot) An expert panel expressed concerns about the possible proliferation of dollar-based stablecoins in South Korea. The panel argued that stablecoin usage would reduce the volume of won-based payments made by both individuals and corporations in South Korea. It also claimed that the central Bank of Korea (BOK) could suffer as a result. The BOK, experts said, could lose the ability to manage money supplies or intervene in the foreign exchange markets. The BOK has made similar statements in recent days , in response to stablecoin-related manifesto pledges from the leading presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung .

Members of his party, the Democratic Party, have also argued that financial regulators – and not the BOK – should have the final say on stablecoin issuance. But others want to use existing stablecoins in their adoption drives. They claim that failing to adopt is hampering Seoul’s tech competitiveness. These advocates favor allowing South Korean firms and payments companies to work with high-cap stablecoins like USDT and USDC . However, Lee Seung-seok, a senior researcher at the Korea Economic Research Institute, warned: “If dollar-based stablecoins become established as a means of payment in South Korea, this could bring about structural changes in the won/dollar exchange rate determination mechanism. Exchange rates could soar due to a drop in KRW demand and an increase in demand for foreign currency.” The researcher added that dollar-based stablecoins allow for rapid capital mobility. He added that their decentralized nature “could result in large-scale capital outflows in the event of a crisis.” The market cap of USDC over the past month. (Source: CoinMarketCap) Kim Hyo-bong, a former Financial Supervisory Service official, said that Washington and Brussels were both likely to launch stablecoin legislation in 2025. Kim said: “South Korea should also make sure it acts in line with global trends.” Kang Tae-soo, a visiting professor at the KAIST Graduate School of Finance and a BOK Monetary Policy Committee member, said that stablecoins offer firms advantages in the payment and settlement spaces. But Kang concurred that stablecoins were difficult to control. He said they could sow uncertainty in the monetary and foreign exchange policy sectors. The academic argued that the BOK and the government needed to ensure adoption drives “minimize side effects and maximize advantages.” However, others warned against the dangers of over-regulation. Namgung Joo-hyun, an Associate Professor of Commercial Law at Sungkyunkwan University, said that the “global digital asset paradigm is rapidly changing.” He said: “We must take steps to ensure South Korea does not end up isolated due to excessive regulations. We need to establish a financial framework that provides both international consistency and industrial competitiveness.” Foreign direct investment in Korea fell four notches in 2024 from a year earlier, ranking 17th among the world’s top 30 economies, data from the Bank of Korea (BOK) showed Sunday. https://t.co/9oKM5UHpu1 pic.twitter.com/TWGwKHda7x — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 18, 2025 A War of Words Meanwhile, the presidential candidates’ stablecoin war of words continues. During the first televised debate between the four leading candidates for the June 3 poll, Lee Jae-myung reiterated his commitment to launching a KRW-pegged coin. But EToday reported that Lee Jun-seok, of the rival Reform Party, challenged the frontrunner on the matter. Lee Jae-myung refuted Lee Jun-seok’s challenge, claiming that “stablecoins based on fiat won collateral are stable.” However, Lee Jun-seok claimed that there were “no use cases” for any sort of stablecoins that use a peg other than the USD. He continued, explaining that USDC and USDT, combined, “account for 90% of the stablecoin market.” Lee Jun-seok asked the frontrunner what measures he would take “to prevent the illegal circulation of stablecoin funds, such as remittances to North Korea.” The post South Korean Experts Warn Seoul of Mounting ‘Stablecoin Danger’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|South Korea|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-19 23:30:00

XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Dominating Whale Accumulation in May",https://thecoinrise.com/final-pre-listing-window-xrp-solana-and-magacoin-finance-are-dominating-whale-accumulation-in-may/,"Introduction May 2025 is witnessing a sharp rotation of capital as whales accumulate select tokens. XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this movement, with on-chain data confirming high-conviction buying. Bitcoin and Hedera (HBAR) remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating 83,100 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. This strategic accumulation is happening as retail investors take profits, signaling growing institutional confidence. As BTC’s momentum steadies, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen whale accumulation surge as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project is audited by Hashex, features a capped 100 billion token supply, and offers scarcity-driven tokenomics. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading around $2.35, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next key resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Solana: Smart Money Bets on a Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading near $171, with whales accumulating over 61,000 SOL in recent months, signaling strong confidence in a potential price surge. Major smart money addresses have returned, making multi-million dollar purchases at current levels. As Solana’s whales build positions, many investors are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for similar early-stage momentum and breakout potential. HBAR: Institutional Interest and Uptrend Potential Hedera (HBAR) is trading at $0.19, with whale accumulation accelerating alongside XRP in early 2025. Analysts highlight the potential for a major rally if current support holds, especially with ETF speculation and institutional flows on the rise. In this environment, many are diversifying into high-upside projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next wave of growth. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Whale accumulation is setting the tone for May, with XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge. With a clear listing roadmap, robust demand, and Stage 8 nearly complete, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the month. The window for entry is closing-and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

Ethereum (ETH) is regaining ground with technical strength, Dogecoin (DOGE) is driven by renewed whale activity and community support, and the Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) is making waves on the back of politically powered news cycles. But for many investors looking beyond headlines, it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that is being quietly discussed as the boldest 50x entry of this crypto cycle. Here’s how these tokens are performing — and why MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly under the radar of early-stage investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A High-Momentum Entry Before Listings Begin MAGACOIN FINANCE gained traction immediately upon launch — and has maintained strong upward momentum ever since. Analysts now cite it as one of the most strategic early-stage altcoins of 2025. With investor demand already climbing, and projections forecasting up to 50x returns , MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious attention before listings have even begun. Its combination of community-first strategy, low initial pricing, and increasing visibility within crypto circles places it at the center of what many are calling 2025’s most compelling altcoin narrative . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Ethereum: Resuming Its Bullish Ascent Post-Pectra Upgrade Ethereum is now trading above $2,500 , with strong indicators following the recent Pectra upgrade , which improved network performance and scalability. Analysts forecast a potential breakout to $3,000 by month’s end, with further targets as high as $5,000–$12,000 into 2025. Institutional adoption, ETF demand, and onchain activity are all aligning to support Ethereum’s continued rise. Dogecoin: Whale Buys Drive Sentiment-Fueled Rally DOGE has rebounded from recent corrections and is building momentum once again. With over 1 billion DOGE scooped up by whales in the past month, the meme leader is showing clear signs of accumulation. Key resistance lies at $0.25–$0.26 , and a confirmed breakout could place DOGE back in a bullish trend similar to early 2021 patterns. Community sentiment and volume remain critical drivers. Official Trump Coin: Volatility Fueled by Political Utility The Official $TRUMP Coin is currently trading around $12.85 , showing signs of stabilization after a wave of volatility triggered by news of a private gala dinner with Donald Trump for top holders. The coin continues to attract politically aligned traders and event-driven speculation. While its current range is tightly bound between $10 and $14, some analysts forecast upside potential if the project sustains attention through real-world integrations and rewards. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Final Thoughts Ethereum is strengthening on the back of technical upgrades and institutional demand. Dogecoin is thriving again with clear signals of large investor accumulation. $TRUMP remains highly event-driven and speculative — tied to a broader cultural and political narrative. Yet among all this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the project many insiders and analysts are watching closest. With early interest mounting and bold ROI projections in the spotlight, it could very well be the standout performer of the 2025 altcoin rally .

XRP is showing short-term bullish momentum, and Chainlink is posting strong technical signals. But away from the spotlight, a lesser-known name, Unstaked, is quietly building a case for future gains. With a current price of $0.009267 and over $6.2 million raised by Stage 13 of its presale, Unstaked blends open metrics, task-based rewards, and a token model that’s drawing early attention. Analysts now say a $1 target by 2027 is not out of reach, placing it firmly in the race as the crypto with the most potential. While XRP and Chainlink continue their recovery, Unstaked is focused on building a system from the ground up. In a market leaning more toward fundamentals, that approach could make all the difference. XRP in Short-Term Rally: Price May Hit $5.50 in Under 2 Months XRP has seen a rebound in recent weeks. After reaching a yearly high of $3.40 in January, it dropped to $1.60 before climbing back above $2. Many analysts see this range as a setup for a larger breakout. Elliott Wave analyst XForceGlobal forecasts a move to $5.40 or $5.50 in the next 50 days, based on a pattern often followed by strong third-wave surges. This technical view is backed by recent events, like Ripple’s SEC settlement and the rising odds of a Spot XRP ETF approval, now estimated at over 75%. Still, some remain cautious. XRP’s short-term rally relies heavily on strong institutional use, which may take time to build. Because of this, some traders are also exploring early-stage projects with faster upside. Chainlink’s Bullish Signs Are Building, But Growth Remains Gradual Chainlink (LINK) is showing key signs of recovery after a long dip. At $17.27, LINK has gained 70% since its April low of $10.21 and is now above its 50-day average. Analysts point to several positive chart setups, including an inverse head-and-shoulders and a broadening pattern on the 4-hour chart. Open interest has doubled to $768 million, and funding rates have held positive for more than a week. These are strong signs of increased long positions and rising trader interest. Chainlink has also seen real progress, adding 12 new integrations across eight chains and becoming an official provider for BNB Chain’s Kickstart Program. These steps show growing demand and usage. Yet despite these Chainlink bullish signs, its price is still below this year’s high of $27.30. While the climb continues, it’s slower than what some are looking for. That’s why early-stage tokens gaining momentum are drawing more attention now. Unstaked Aims for $1 by 2027 with Task-Based Rewards While big-name tokens dominate the news, Unstaked is steadily gaining momentum and funding. Now priced at $0.009267, the project has already collected more than $6.2 million by Stage 13 of its presale, showing growing support from early participants. Unstaked works through a Proof of Intelligence model where rewards come from actions, input, and real user involvement. That means users earn for what they do instead of just holding. It’s a system based on verified results, made for long-term scaling and built around real activity. One of its strong points is liquidity support, built through structured presale phases and clear token planning. This helps make sure that once Unstaked reaches exchanges, there will be volume and depth, limiting price swings and slippage. The team has also launched a $1 million Gleam contest, giving 20 winners a $50,000 prize each. Entry requires task completion and a minimum of $100 in UNSD holdings. This approach brings new users and encourages real money to enter the system. With clear goals, useful features, and a working reward system, Unstaked is moving forward without relying on hype. Its structure and plans support its position as a top pick for long-term growth, including a possible $1 value by 2027. Given its confirmed launch price of $0.1819, early buyers are eyeing up to 27x returns before future gains are even counted. Final Say As crypto starts to rise again, the line between fast movement and real utility is more visible than ever. XRP shows strong short-term potential backed by ETF buzz and better legal footing. Chainlink (LINK) shows positive signs in its network, though its progress is steady rather than fast. At the same time, Unstaked is doing something else. It’s creating a full ecosystem that includes utility, clear rewards, and working tools. With $6.2 million already raised in crypto presale , a $1 million Gleam campaign in progress, and a reward model in place, the platform is already running on measurable results. For those looking at the crypto with the most potential, it might not be the most familiar name that takes the lead. It may be the one already proving its use at an early price. At $0.009267, Unstaked is one of the rare low-cost options already showing clear signs of delivery.

Bitcoin is reclaiming dominance, Ethereum is surging to new highs, and investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE-a rising altcoin that could become this year’s biggest early-stage win. With XRP, TON, and Solana also attracting capital, the altcoin market is entering a new phase of speculation and aggressive positioning. The big question now: Could these tokens deliver the next 15,000% run-up? Let’s break down the leaders that are capturing analysts’ attention right now-and the altcoin that’s turning heads as its listing nears. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Bitcoin Eyes $250,000 as Institutional Demand Accelerates Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $103,405, consolidating after a volatile weekend but holding above key support. Analysts from Unchained and Changelly forecast a possible run to $250,000 by year-end 2025, with an average price prediction for May around $120,555. Institutional inflows, ETF adoption, and a maturing macro backdrop are fueling bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes, capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where early-stage entries offer the potential for exponential returns. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing major attention in 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% potential returns, with some calling a $1 target by year-end “not out of reach” given current momentum. MAGA’s capped supply of 100 billion tokens (45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and unique political meme appeal are driving rapid community growth and early-stage investor participation. Key highlights : Scarcity-driven model: 100 billion token cap, 45% in presale HashEx-audited contracts and strong grassroots momentum Analysts forecast 35x–185x returns, with $1 as a stretch target As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity-one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with a more transparent structure and scarcity-driven upside. Analysts say a 35x surge looks conservative, with 50x or even 150x possible if current trends continue. Ethereum’s Bullish Breakout and Layer-2 Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators are bullish, with ETH breaking above its 50-day EMA and forming a classic bull flag pattern. If ETH can close above the $2,700 resistance, analysts see a move to $2,750–$2,900 in May and a year-end target between $4,392 and $5,925. Institutional adoption, DeFi growth, and Layer-2 upgrades are all strengthening ETH’s long-term outlook. As Ethereum’s rally matures, some investors are rotating capital into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. XRP: Institutional Flows and Bullish Projections XRP is trading at $2.33 and attracting whale accumulation, with over 880 million tokens acquired by large holders in May. Analysts expect a breakout to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end, with long-term targets as high as $12.50 if ETF approvals and global adoption accelerate. While XRP’s setup is strong, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns remains open. Toncoin and Solana: Quiet Strength and Technical Upside Toncoin (TON) is trading near $2.84, with forecasts for 2025 ranging from $2.77 to $2.96 and technical analysis pointing to steady growth as adoption increases. Solana (SOL) is holding at $172, consolidating after its 80% rally from recent lows, with analysts targeting $250–$400 as the next major resistance zone. As both TON and SOL maintain bullish structures, investors are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for the kind of early-stage momentum that can deliver outsized gains. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts Between Bitcoin’s ETF-driven surge, Ethereum’s bullish breakout, and the institutional momentum behind XRP, TON, and Solana, the next crypto cycle is already taking shape. But among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only early-stage entry still offering ground-floor potential and 15,000% upside. With a clear listing roadmap, robust investor demand, and Stage 8 nearing closure, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the best shot at a 25x–35x return in 2025. The opportunity is narrowing-and smart investors are already taking notice.

The Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction points toward $0.35, as Stellar gears up to bring $3 billion in real-world assets on-chain. Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) breakout news has traders buzzing after a 680% surge in daily users and $100 targets enter the chat. But if you’re hunting for the best new crypto to buy , there’s a different name stealing the spotlight, Web3 ai . This isn’t just a headline grabber. Web3 ai is already rolling out cross-chain AI utilities like trading bots, fraud detection, and DeFi analysis, all powered by its native token, $WAI. The presale price? Still just $0.000365. Early buyers got in at $0.0003, and analysts are calling the jump to $1 a realistic next step. With working tech and deep crypto integration, this is exactly what traders are racing to lock in. $WAI at $0.000365: Why Smart Money Is Rushing Into Web3 ai Web3 ai isn’t waiting around. It’s already shipping real products. While others pitch empty promises, this project has 12 live AI tools in development, built for everyday and pro users alike. Arbitrage bots, rebalancing engines, scam trackers, and alpha-generating signals, $WAI powers them all. Currently in stage 5 of a 50-stage presale, $WAI is selling for $0.000365. Stage 1 was priced at $0.0003, and the token will list at $0.005242. With $4.2 million already raised, it’s clear that momentum is building fast. The numbers say it all: a run from $0.000365 to $1 could turn early entries into massive wins. What separates Web3 ai from the pack? It’s delivering from day one. No waiting, no delays, just real AI tools ready to go. If you’ve been wondering what the best new crypto to buy looks like, this is the one analysts can’t ignore. It has the product, the price point, and the upside, all mapped out. Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction Looks Strong With RWA Momentum The Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction has turned bullish after a 50% bounce from April’s lows, now hovering around $0.30. Targets vary from $0.25 to $0.39, with some models even pointing to $0.88, driven by Stellar’s massive 2025 plan to bring $3 billion in real-world assets to its blockchain. With new support from Paxos, SG Forge, and Mastercard’s Crypto Credential network, Stellar is doubling down on cross-border payments and institutional adoption. Technical signs show a breakout forming, with resistance near $0.357. Still, how fast the Stellar Development Foundation executes will determine whether the next leg higher happens. For now, interest in Stellar is climbing alongside network upgrades. Avalanche (AVAX) Breakout News Sparks Bullish Sentiment The latest Avalanche (AVAX) breakout news is grabbing attention after AVAX hit $24.38 and daily users exploded by over 680% in just a month. A fresh $250 million funding round is fueling growth, while developers rush in with renewed interest. Analysts are eyeing a short-term cap at $30, with long-range targets stretching toward $100. AVAX is shaking off its corrective phase and entering a bullish structure. Support sits near $21, and daily stablecoin volumes are above $1.3 billion, showing serious liquidity. If Avalanche keeps this pace, its user base and token value could push it back into the top 10. Add platform upgrades this quarter, and AVAX is shaping up as a major contender again. Wrapping Up! Both the Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction and Avalanche (AVAX) breakout news have given traders reasons to stay bullish. But what analysts are really watching now is Web3 ai. At $0.000365 in stage 5 and a launch price of $0.005242, this AI-powered platform already raised $4.2 million and is gaining speed. This isn’t just a presale, it’s a project with working products, multi-chain access, and a token that powers real functionality. That’s why investors aren’t waiting. With every stage, the price rises, and the FOMO only gets stronger. For anyone tracking the best new crypto to buy , Web3 ai looks like the one you don’t want to miss.

Current Bitcoin Rally Not Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktakes post by contributor avocado_onchain, last year’s BTC bull cycle – which saw the leading cryptocurrency create and break multiple all-time highs (ATHs) – was accompanied by sharp spikes in Binance market buy volume and funding rates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stochastic RSI Signals Brewing Bullish Momentum – ATH Incoming? Notably, a sudden increase in funding rates was twice followed by a sharp price pullback due to overheating. In this context, overheating refers to excessive bullish leverage in futures markets that drives up the cost of long positions, signalling overly aggressive sentiment that often precedes a market correction. The following chart illustrates these corrections triggered by excessive leverage in BTC futures. Specifically, boxes 1 and 2 show sharp rises in Binance funding rates, initially accompanied by price increases, then extended periods of correction. However, the current rally appears different. According to avocado_onchain, Bitcoin’s ongoing rebound is occurring without an overheated funding rate. In fact, Binance market buy volume is trending downward – as shown in box 3 of the chart – which contrasts with previous bull cycles. The analyst argues that these are signs of a healthier rally, as earlier bull runs were marked by overheated funding rates and abrupt corrections, which weakened investor sentiment. In contrast, the current rally has maintained relatively stable funding rates, suggesting more cautious and sustainable market behavior. Despite short-term price fluctuations, market buy volume has shown a steady upward trend since 2023, as marked by the yellow arrow in the chart. The analyst notes: This indicates that buying sentiment remains favorable for further upside, suggesting that it’s not yet time to consider an exit. We can’t predict exactly when Bitcoin will break its previous high, but current on-chain and market data signals remain very constructive. Other Indicators Point Toward New ATH Besides the stable funding rates and encouraging market buy volumes, BTC is also showing several other positive signs pointing toward a new ATH for the flagship digital asset in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says For example, on-chain data shows that long-term holders are not selling, even as BTC trades near its previous ATH of $108,786, recorded in January. This behavior suggests that these investors anticipate further upside. That said, analysts caution against overly optimistic expectations, noting that Bitcoin may still be far from experiencing a true supply shock. At press time, BTC is trading at $102,393, down 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

While on a trip to Washington, D.C., where he advocates for balanced and inclusive digital asset regulations, Garlinghouse expressed disappointment on X (formerly Twitter). “I hope you will reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” Garlinghouse wrote, inviting Senator Lummis to join him for a public discussion via X Spaces or a live event . He stressed the importance of supporting all blockchain networks—not just Bitcoin—especially given Lummis chairs the Senate Digital Assets Subcommittee and represents Wyoming, a state known for its crypto-friendly stance. Crypto community divides as Garlinghouse challenges Senator Lummis’s Bitcoin-only focus Garlinghouse’s remarks underscore continuing fears that Bitcoin is making other digital assets and the firms that help develop blockchain technology obsolete. The scrapped meeting drew reactions from members of the crypto community. Some accused the Senator of being biased and expressed frustration over her stance. On X, user @DarkScarf89 expressed curiosity as to why the Senator had refused a meeting, pointing to a divergence in support of a level playing field that might not quite match the Bitcoin-only narrative. Bitcoin maximalists, however, lauded Lummis. Troy Cross thanked her “for fighting against the scammers,” a move that could suggest skepticism toward Ripple and its XRP token. This conversation illustrates the friction that exists between Bitcoin maximalists and proponents of a wider, more welcoming regulatory strategy. Industry participants increasingly demand models that apply to all digital assets, not only Bitcoin. The scandal has done little to waver Senator Lummis’ love for Bitcoin. She has advocated that Americans consider Bitcoin a long-term investment , a hedge against inflation, and a weakening U.S. dollar. “I encourage people to save Bitcoin for their retirement, for their future,” Lummis recently stated. Her strong Bitcoin focus has earned both praise from the Bitcoin community and criticism from other parts of the crypto ecosystem. Nonetheless, Lummis has worked collaboratively on crypto legislation beyond Bitcoin. She and Senator Bernie Moreno co-introduced a bill to improve digital asset tax treatment. They expressed frustration over the bipartisan GENIUS Act’s failure to pass—a bill designed to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. CME XRP futures ignite demand for Spot ETF approval and regulatory clarity Today’s launch of CME XRP futures shifts attention to the pending approval of a spot XRP ETF. With futures trading attracting institutional interest, regulatory clarity on XRP-related products is increasingly urgent. Garlinghouse previously expressed optimism that a spot XRP ETF could be approved by the end of 2025, especially following the conclusion of Ripple’s legal dispute with the SEC. Meanwhile, analysts like Fred Rispoli note XRP’s potential role in a proposed digital asset reserve outlined in a Trump-era executive order, adding another layer of complexity to XRP’s regulatory outlook. Garlinghouse backs pro-crypto legislation as Senate prepares to debate stablecoin bill Ripple CEO told his followers on X that he was heading to Washington to support what he called “sensible pro-crypto” legislation focused on stablecoins and market structure. He said he was encouraged to see lawmakers recognizing crypto as a multichain industry “as it should be.” Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin. They are typically pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar or commodities like gold. On December 17, 2024, Ripple launched its own stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). Senator Cynthia Lummis, a well-known crypto advocate, previously introduced the BITCOIN Act, which proposes creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. She recently said senators have agreed on the final wording of new Senate stablecoin legislation and expects the bill to reach the floor next week. The bill in question is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. Introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), it is co-sponsored by Senators Lummis, Tim Scott (R-SC), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The GENIUS bill has faced roadblocks — most notably due to Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), opposing it — owing to President Donald Trump-linked USD1 stablecoin .

ADA price has signaled bullish sentiment catalyzed by increased adoption from institutional investors. Cardano (ADA) price has moved in tandem with the wider altcoin market, amid anticipated altseason. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of $33 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $854 million, dropped around 10 percent in the past seven days to trade about $0.74 on Monday, during the late-North American trading session. Nonetheless, ADA price has been in a recovery mode in the past few weeks akin to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Moreover, on-chain data analysis shows an increased capital inflow to crypto investment products, fueled by the geo-political and economic uncertainty. Cardano Founder Under Scrutiny for Fraud Claims The Cardano network has found itself between thin ice as some on-chain analysis suggests a trust-misuse by founder Charles Hoskinson. According to Masato Alexander, an NFT artist, Hoskinson manipulated the Cardano network, during the 2021 Allegra hard fork, to seize control of 318 million ADA coins. Alexander noted that Hoskinson defrauded early investors by using Genesis keys to rewrite the Cardano ledger, by redirecting unclaimed tokens from the 2017 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) into Cardano’s reserves without community approval. “From the data we have, we know that a significant sum, totaling 318,200,635,000,000 Lovelace, which translates to 318,200,635 ADA, departed from our active set. These UTxOs, residing in 465 distinct addresses, played their part, however brief or long, in the immutable story of Cardano,” Alexander noted . Although the top Cardano team has denied the allegations including Hoskinson, an on-chain investigation is expected to be conducted in the coming weeks. Mid-term Expectations for ADA Price In the daily timeframe, ADA price has established a rising trend in the past few weeks. After breaking out of a macro-falling wedge pattern in April, ADA price has gradually gained bullish momentum characterized by higher highs and higher lows. In the four-hour time frame, ADA price has formed a falling symmetrical parallel channel, likely a continuation pattern. A consistent close above the upper border of the falling channel will set the precedent of a fresh rally towards the short term target about $1.14.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|FORKS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 00:15:24

Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19. Alpenglow consists of Votor, which processes voting transactions and block finalization logic, and Rotor, a data dissemination protocol that would replace Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping system and aim to reduce the time it takes for all nodes to agree on the network state. Source: Anza Anza researchers claimed that “Alpenglow will shatter both these latency bounds” and the project expects it to reach actual finality in about 150 milliseconds, rivaling internet infrastructure . “A median latency of 150 [milliseconds] does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance.” Votor — which would replace TowerBFT — would aim to finalize blocks in a single round if 80% of the stake is participating, and in two rounds if only 60% of the stake is responsive. Related: DeFi lender Aave reaches $40B in value locked onchain These two voting modes are integrated and run concurrently, with finalization taking place as soon as the faster of the two paths terminates. Anza’s researchers claimed this model would result in “unprecedented finalization latency” while enabling it to operate more effectively under “harsh network conditions.” Alpenglow won’t fix Solana’s network outages The project’s white paper noted that switching to Alpenglow wouldn’t completely shield Solana from the network outages that it has experienced in the past. Solana currently only has one production-ready client, Agave, meaning any security vulnerability in Agave can disrupt the entire Solana network. However, a new independent validator client called Firedancer is set to launch on Solana’s mainnet sometime this year, which will provide client diversification for the network.

And for those watching closely, it’s starting to feel like we’ve seen this story before. A Look Back: When ADA, SHIB, and DOGE Shocked the Market Cardano (ADA) wasn’t always a top-tier altcoin. It had spent years trading under the radar before smart contract capabilities were introduced through the Alonzo hard fork in September 2021. Around that time, ADA had surged to an all-time high of $3.10, driven by developer activity and ecosystem growth. That move placed Cardano squarely in the spotlight. Shiba Inu (SHIB), on the other hand, rose to fame in record time. Its price had skyrocketed by over 1,000% within weeks in 2021. Initially dismissed as another meme token, SHIB drew in a wave of investors and reached a peak of $0.000090. That rally showcased how quickly retail attention could turn into real momentum. Dogecoin (DOGE) followed a similar arc. In 2021, DOGE was propelled by social media and celebrity endorsements. One week in April saw the price jump more than 400%, and by May, it had reached $0.74—its all-time high. Despite being a joke coin at launch, DOGE’s community and visibility helped it carve out a lasting presence in the market. Each of these assets shared a common theme: they started from modest beginnings and reached massive valuations, fueled by a mix of community, development, and market timing. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized platform built on blockchain technology, designed to provide non-custodial lending and borrowing solutions. Its model empowers users to supply digital assets, earn passive income through mtTokens, or access liquidity by borrowing against their holdings—all while retaining control of their assets. The protocol is also building an overcollateralized stablecoin, backed entirely by assets deposited within Mutuum, providing users with a decentralized and transparent alternative to centralized stablecoins. Additionally, a Layer 2 solution is in development to improve transaction speed and significantly reduce gas fees, making the platform scalable and more accessible to a wide range of users. MUTM is now available at a price of $0.025 during the ongoing Phase 4 of its presale. Over 88% of this round has already sold, and the project has now raised over $8.6 million, with more than 10,000 holders on record. Once Phase 4 ends, the price will rise by 20% to $0.03, followed by a confirmed listing at $0.06. This structured pricing is drawing attention from early investors looking to get in before the next wave of exposure. These strong presale numbers, paired with increasing wallet adoption, signal growing confidence in MUTM’s fundamentals. Could MUTM Follow a Similar Path? While ADA had utility, SHIB had virality, and DOGE had community, MUTM is entering with real-world financial use cases, early development, and a clear path toward long-term sustainability. The upcoming beta platform launch, which is planned to go live shortly after token listing, will include lending, borrowing, and real-time mtToken integration—delivering functionality from day one. Unlike many projects that inflate supply through token printing, Mutuum uses a portion of its platform fees to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to active participants, creating natural demand and supporting token value. For those asking what crypto to buy now or searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in, MUTM presents a compelling mix of affordability, utility, and momentum—key components that fueled the rise of its predecessors. Experts are already forecasting that, based on utility, adoption, and tokenomics, MUTM has the potential to reach up to $7 over the long term. This projection is based on the layered value system being built—including mtTokens, the stablecoin framework, Layer 2 functionality, and a growing holder base. At the current price of $0.025, a simple investment of $800 would translate to a 280x return, or $224,000, when MUTM hits the projected $7 benchmark. This kind of upside is exactly what early investors are looking for—not just explosive short-term gains, but a token that can mature and hold value over time. MUTM is still early, but all the signals point to something much bigger in the making. The protocol is delivering features, the presale is gaining serious traction, and utility is already being built—not promised. With ADA, SHIB, and DOGE all rising from obscurity to dominance, MUTM may be the next to follow. And with prices set to increase in the next phase, the window to secure an early position is closing quickly.

This has attracted both developers and investors to its platform. But as Solana innovates in blockchain infrastructure, another project Ruvi AI is charting its own path by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain. Ruvi AI solves real problems in critical industries and opens up new opportunities for investors. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI is a platform that brings together AI’s ability to process vast amounts of data and blockchain’s transparency and security. It provides solutions for industries such as healthcare, finance and logistics. By using AI, Ruvi AI can identify trends, improve decision making and make operations more efficient. Blockchain ensures these improvements come with transparency and trust. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its tangible progress. The launch of its Beta platform allows you to try it out and see how it solves real world problems. By delivering results instead of promises, Ruvi AI is a project you can bank on. Presale Success Paves the Way for Growth Ruvi AI has already proven to be attractive to investors. In Phase 1 tokens were sold for $0.01 each. The phase sold out in 2 weeks and those who participated early have already seen their investment grow 50% as the token price has risen to $0.015 in Phase 2 . Market predictions suggest even more growth for Ruvi AI with the token expected to reach $1 shortly after listing on major exchanges. Early participants not only get bonuses but will also benefit as the project grows. Ruvi AI’s Commitment to Investors Ruvi AI has introduced a VIP rewards system to reward participants based on the amount of tokens they accumulate during the presale. The system adds bonuses to your initial holding, giving you even more opportunities to grow. Here’s how it works: VIP Tier 2 To accumulate 50,000 tokens you need to invest $750 at $0.015 token price. As a VIP Tier 2 you will get 40% bonus and get 20,000 tokens more, so your total will be 70,000 tokens .At $0.07 listing price these tokens will be worth $4,900 , 553% ROI. If the token reaches $1 your holdings will be $70,000 , 9,233% ROI. VIP Tier 3 To accumulate 100,000 tokens you need to invest $1,500 . As a VIP Tier 3 you will get 60% bonus and get 60,000 tokens more, so your total will be 160,000 tokens . At $0.07 listing price the tokens will be worth $11,200 , 1,020% ROI. If the token price reaches $1 your investment will be $160,000 , 10,567% ROI. VIP Tier 5 To get 500,000 tokens you need to invest $7,500 . As a VIP Tier 5 your holdings will be doubled with 100% bonus and you will have 1,000,000 tokens . At $0.07 listing price the tokens will be worth $70,000 , 833% ROI. If the token hits $1 the investment will be $1,000,000 , 12,233% ROI. These examples show how important it is to accumulate tokens early to get the full benefits of Ruvi AI’s rewards and growth. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Participants Ruvi AI also rewards its most active contributors through leaderboard rewards. The top investors get extra tokens: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens , worth $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1 . Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens , valued at $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1 . Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens , equal to $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1 .This shows Ruvi AI’s commitment to reward its investors. A Platform for Real Solutions Ruvi AI is transforming industries by using AI to solve complex problems and blockchain to ensure accountability and transparency. Whether a company needs to streamline healthcare logistics, sharpen financial forecasting or improve data sharing trust, Ruvi AI has solutions. The release of its Beta platform is proof that Ruvi AI isn’t just theory. It’s already delivering value to those who use and support it. Act Now Solana may be fast but Ruvi AI is focused on combining AI and blockchain to create solutions with real use cases.

Beneath the headlines, a new group of tokens is gaining traction ahead of what could be the next explosive cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, Solana, and NEAR Protocol are all drawing serious attention as Stage 8 of MAGACOIN FINANCE accelerates, and momentum builds across both established leaders and bold new contenders.Each project is showing signs of strategic positioning, technical strength, or early-stage investor demand – and the next moonshot may already be in play. Here’s a breakdown of the four coins analysts are watching now. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Breakout of the Year MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about early-stage entries of 2025. With Stage 8 now live and over $8 million raised, the project is ranked as the #1 presale of the year, and analysts are forecasting up to 40x returns before listings. Its capped 100 billion token supply, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and HashEx audit are fueling surging demand and rapid community growth. As each stage fills, urgency grows – and with a listing target of $0.007, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as a rare ground-floor opportunity by both retail and whale investors. For those seeking asymmetric returns, this is where speculation meets structure. XRP’s Payment Utility and Futures Momentum XRP is trading between $2.10 and $2.39 in May 2025, gaining momentum from payment adoption and the upcoming CME futures launch. Regulatory clarity is drawing institutional buyers, and analysts believe a surge to $5–$15 could happen quickly if liquidity conditions shift after futures approval.As XRP’s global utility grows, capital is also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the potential for exponential gains remains wide open. Solana: DeFi Dominance and a Technical Supercycle Solana (SOL) is trading at approximately $170.15, up more than 80% from its prior lows and standing out as one of the strongest Layer-1 performers. With DeFi apps thriving and network activity climbing, analysts are forecasting a move toward $250–$400 if the current trend continues.As Solana’s rally accelerates, investors are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside as the cycle extends. NEAR Protocol: Quiet Growth and Breakout Potential NEAR Protocol is quietly building momentum in 2025, with its developer ecosystem expanding and new integrations driving user growth. While NEAR isn’t yet in the spotlight like SOL or XRP, its scalable architecture and focus on usability position it as a sleeper candidate for the next breakout.As capital seeks undervalued networks, many are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion With Solana’s rally igniting the altcoin market, the focus is shifting to projects with clear upside and breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking off as Stage 8 nears completion, offering a rare early-stage entry point as listings approach. XRP and NEAR add further depth to the list of contenders, but among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most aggressive early entry for those seeking the next moonshot.The window for entry is narrowing – and this could be the moment to catch it.

The decision disclosed in a regulatory filing comes as the commission initiates formal proceedings to judge those proposals. The Commission announced that it is initiating proceedings to allow more time to assess whether the proposed rule change aligns with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. This section requires, among other provisions, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices and to protect investors and the public interest. The SEC initially accepted both applications earlier this year. Bitwise first submitted its proposal in January 2025 via the BZX Exchange . The agency issued its first delay on March 11, and with this latest development, the review process has now moved into a more formal and detailed stage. 21Shares, which already operates spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, was one of the earliest companies to apply for a Solana-based ETF in America’s market. However, like its competitors, the company has been stymied by regulation, as the SEC continues to be wary of financial products based on crypto. This delay is nothing out of the ordinary. The SEC also pushed off a decision on Grayscale’s proposed Solana ETF earlier this month, indicating the glacial pace of most digital asset ETF applications . Analysts predict high odds for Solana ETF in 2025 For their part, ETF experts remain unbothered by the latest delay. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas argue there’s still a good chance (70% in 2025) that there’s a Solana ETF approved in the U.S. The rush isn’t limited to 21Shares and Bitwise. Heavyweights like VanEck and Franklin Templeton have also filed for Solana ETFs. This demand for Solana suggests strong institutional demand for regulated SOL exposure vehicles. ETF products are also eyeing other altcoins like Litecoin and XRP. Litecoin ETF’s likely approval rates are around 90%, and XRP ETFs are at 85%. Dogecoin and Cardano ETFs follow closely, with approval probabilities of approximately 80% and 75%, respectively. However, approval for all of those products is still pending. The approval process is slow and unpredictable. Some of these filings may not receive final action until late-2025. Investors respond to SEC delays The price of Solana saw a small bump on the news. SOL/USD has suffered the most in the last 7 days, with a loss of about 1.2% to trade around $166 at the time of writing. The market is also heavily sensitive to any whiffs of regulation, particularly on how they’d impact investor confidence and future ETF product availability. Paradoxically, this decline is taking place at a time when institutions are showing even more interest in Solana. Some analysts believe the sluggish market may not be a long-term condition. As per recent trends, Solana has never been overbought. Thus, we can expect a more or less mid-term recovery. Adding to the bullish action is the word from CME Group that it will launch Solana’s future contracts. If successful, these futures would allow investors to hedge or speculate on SOL’s price in a regulated setting. And while the move is parsed as incremental, it is also predicted to make it easier for future ETFs to be approved. Futures products do not manage the ETF but enable institutions to speculate on Solana without owning the coin. This is especially important because the regulatory outlook for spot crypto markets remains highly uncertain.

Senators easily cleared the 60-vote threshold for the vote, which is intended to just move the legislation to a period of further debate before a final vote series to pass it out of the Senate. The House of Representatives is working its way through its own version of stablecoin legislation, which is intended to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins and their issuers in the U.S. The Senate previously failed to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance the bill during a vote on May 8, after Democratic lawmakers raised concerns about consumer protection and national security provisions. That vote had failed on a bipartisan basis, after Republicans Josh Hawley and Rand Paul also voted against cloture. Despite that earlier setback, industry participants expected easy passage on Monday after lawmakers spent much of the last week negotiating changes in language, though many of these changes seemed marginal . One individual following the negotiations told CoinDesk that ""there's enough"" in the newest version of the bill to address some of Democrats' concerns earlier on Monday, though the lawmakers negotiating language could have added more hefty consumer protection provisions.

However, this was followed by a return to consolidation around the $103,000 price level. This intense volatility in the past 24 hours suggests that the Bitcoin price still has a long way to go before it reaches a price top. Amid this volatile movement, a new macroeconomic model, the Decode Macro Trend Oscillator (MTO), has pointed out when to expect Bitcoin’s price to top this cycle. Decode’s Macro Trend Oscillator Model And Its Alignment With Bitcoin Peaks The Decode Macro Trend Oscillator is a sophisticated tool designed by a Bitcoin analyst known as Decode on the social media platform X. The oscillator aggregates around 40 macroeconomic indicators, ranging from interest rates and global liquidity to industrial production and market volatility, into 17 carefully selected leading metrics. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now These are then normalized and visualized as a histogram to produce a cyclical pattern that has historically aligned with Bitcoin’s major tops. A close look at the chart titled Bitcoin Liquid Index on the 1M candlestick timeframe reveals that the light green histogram bars have coincided with each of Bitcoin’s cycle peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021. These peaks are marked by vertical red lines, and the transitions from deep red to green territory on the oscillator appear to offer a visual cue for the end of bearish phases and the onset of price rallies. As of May 2025, the histogram remains in a deep red zone but has begun inching upward, with the most recent bar reading at -11.47, suggesting that macroeconomic conditions may soon start to favor a bigger rally for Bitcoin. BTC Mode Configuration Fine-Tunes Cycle Top Prediction Decode’s analysis goes beyond Bitcoin-specific indicators. In one of the accompanying charts of the S&P 500 Index of the 2M timeframe, a long-term comparison is made between the current global environment and the economic backdrop of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Interestingly, Decode’s macro trend oscillator proved reliable in estimating periods of downturns and expansions in both instances. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength In both instances, inflation pressure and declining consumer sentiment pushed the oscillator deep into negative territory for years. However, once the histogram flipped into the green, the economy and prices entered a prolonged phase of expansion. The third chart offers a more detailed view of Bitcoin’s weekly trend, including an overlay of M2 money supply growth, which is another popular monetary metric. This view highlights how the Macro Trend Oscillator, when switched to a configuration Decode called “Bitcoin Mode,” fine-tunes its sensitivity to metrics that directly impact crypto markets. In this configuration, only a few of the full 17 metrics that best identify Bitcoin cycle tops are used. As it stands, Bitcoin is still in the negative red histogram zone, even despite its rally in recent months. The first deep green histogram has yet to show up, not to mention the first light green bar that will mark the cycle peak. Based on this setup, the oscillator implies that Bitcoin still has a lot of room to run this cycle, and that a price top is unlikely to arrive in 2025.

A key procedural vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed in a 66-32 vote on May 20. Several Democrats changed their votes to pass the motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key backers, said on May 15 that she thinks it's a “fair target” to have the GENIUS Act passed by May 26 — Memorial Day in the US. The US Senate voted 66-32 to advance debate on the GENIUS stablecoin bill. Source: US Senate The GENIUS Act was introduced on Feb. 4 by US Senator Bill Hagerty and seeks to regulate the nearly $250 billion stablecoin market — currently dominated by Tether ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ). The bill requires stablecoins be fully backed, have regular security audits and approval from federal or state regulators. Only licensed entities can issue stablecoins, while algorithmic stablecoins are restricted. Several Democratic senators withdrew support for the bill on May 8, blocking a motion to move it forward, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest involving Trump’s crypto ventures and anti-money laundering provisions.

The motion to invoke cloture — which allows the Senate to proceed with debating the bill — was approved with a 66-32 vote. Interestingly, more than 15 Democratic senators, including Catherine Cortez Masto, Adam Schiff, Mark Warner, and Ruben Gallego, changed their earlier ‘no’ votes to ‘yes.’ However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted against the motion. Senator Josh Hawley was absent during the vote. However, this vote does not mean the GENIUS Act has become law. It simply allows the Senate to begin discussing, debating, and potentially amending the bill before a final vote. Why This Matters for Crypto Investors The GENIUS Act includes regulations for stablecoins — digital currencies tied to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. Many in the crypto community see this as a positive step because it introduces clear rules, ensuring stablecoin issuers hold proper reserves like U.S. treasury bonds. It also demands more transparency about how these stablecoins are backed. JUST IN: Motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the consideration of the GENIUS Act has PASSED. 15+ Dems flipped their votes from no to yes including @CortezMasto , @SenAdamSchiff , @MarkWarner , @SenRubenGallego , @SenatorWarnock and others. Senate Minority leader… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) May 20, 2025 Experts say this could strengthen trust in the crypto market and protect users from risks seen in the past when some stablecoin companies lacked proper financial backing. Concerns Around Stablecoins and Politics There’s ongoing debate about private tech companies like Meta or Square issuing their own stablecoins. Some see it as risky without strict regulations. Another concern is about political leaders, including President Trump, having financial interests in crypto-related projects, raising questions about fairness and possible conflicts of interest. While having government figures support crypto might sound positive, experts warn it could lead to future problems if decisions appear to benefit insiders. As reported by Eleanor Terrett, Josh Vlasto, spokesperson for CIFonX, said, “We congratulate the Senate on today’s vote. This action, and eventually passage of a stablecoin bill, clears the path for Congress to act on the mandate of voters to pass market structure legislation which creates clear rules of the road for digital assets.”",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 01:52:37

We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said. Michael Saylor comments on Dimon’s announcement. Source: Michael Saylor JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market. “I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.” “If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said. At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

Each offers a different value. ADA is moving upward in a strong rally, SHIB’s forecast points to a big breakout, and Web3 ai is becoming a top choice thanks to its AI-powered tools and growing presale. All three point to unique paths for potential future gains. While ADA and SHIB are seeing price surges and network updates, Web3 ai brings a complete platform that changes how people manage crypto. It’s no longer just about price moves; now it’s about tools, access, and control. The question is, which of these will stand out as the best crypto platform going forward? Cardano (ADA) Price Momentum Strengthens Toward $1.20 Momentum for Cardano (ADA) is rising steadily this May. A major reason is the growing open interest, now at $930 million, showing more activity from large-scale and leveraged market participants. This has pushed many to expect a breakout past the $1.20 mark. Technical indicators are also aligning well. ADA is showing higher lows, stronger volume, and stability near its 200-day moving average. With DeFi adoption increasing and new upgrades across its ecosystem, analysts believe ADA is still undervalued at today’s prices. ADA brings both steadiness and upward potential. While not as fast-moving as smaller coins, its developer community and expanding use make it a solid option for anyone considering the best crypto platform for longer-term growth. SHIB Forecast Signals a 105% Rise with Bullish Setup Shiba Inu (SHIB) is drawing fresh attention with a bullish forecast. Analysts now see the potential for a 105% increase if SHIB maintains its current trend. After moving above the $0.000026 resistance level, it could aim for $0.000053 soon. Several things are fueling this optimism: higher trade volume, better sentiment, and active work on its ecosystem. Shibarium is growing, and more SHIB coins are being burned, which helps it look more serious beyond just being a meme coin. Though SHIB carries some risks, its price pattern is attracting breakout traders and those who follow community-driven coins. If the momentum continues, SHIB could become a bigger part of the conversation around the best crypto platform. Web3 ai’s Presale Hits $4.2M as AI-Powered Crypto Tools Gain Ground Instead of following price trends alone, Web3 ai is building a smart, AI-focused system to support crypto users in real-time. With $4.2 million already raised in its presale and the current price at $0.000365 (Stage 5), Web3 ai is becoming a strong contender in 2025. This system brings together blockchain and AI to deliver automation, smart insights, and decision-making tools in one place. The platform includes modules like sentiment tracking, contract reviews, trading bots, and portfolio analysis, all in a single dashboard. It helps simplify complex tasks and reduces mistakes by centralizing tools. What makes Web3 ai different is its use of machine learning trained on big data, combined with real blockchain information. It features price predictions, scam alerts, staking guidance, and auto-strategies. $WAI is used across the system for rewards, feature access, and governance. Designed to be modular and cross-chain, Web3 ai values user privacy, control, and steady upgrades. With a projected ROI of 1,747% by launch and strong support in the presale phase, it’s positioning itself as a top contender for best crypto platform, not just this year, but for years to come. Final Thoughts! Cardano (ADA) brings solid fundamentals, high engagement, and a path to break $1.20. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing short-term excitement with its pattern and growing network support. Both projects are backed by strong price actions. Yet, Web3 ai is changing what people expect from crypto platforms. With a $4.2 million presale, a stage price of $0.000365, and a projected 1,747% return, it blends real tools and practical use into one smart platform. For anyone looking beyond just market movements, Web3 ai is shaping up as a top name among the best crypto platform picks .

XRP and Solana are drawing renewed attention, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum is turning heads among those seeking asymmetric upside. With Kaspa joining the list of contenders, the smart money is quietly positioning for the next phase of the bull cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating 2025 Altcoin Picks CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE has stormed into the 2025 cycle with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full, all while its token price remains under $0.001. Its capped 100 billion token supply and Hashex-audited smart contracts have created a scarcity-driven model that’s fueling strong demand and rapid presale sellouts.Analysts are forecasting 25x–35x returns, with some models calling for even more if momentum continues. Whale allocations and a unique blend of political narrative and structured tokenomics are positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP Inches Toward Futures and Institutional Access XRP is trading at $2.33 as of May 19, 2025, after a 3.3% dip, but the launch of CME Group’s XRP futures and Ripple’s expansion into the UAE are driving institutional interest. Despite short-term price pressure, analysts remain bullish, with targets of $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate.As XRP holders seek further upside, many are also rotating into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the growth curve is just beginning. Bitcoin: New Highs and Growing Demand Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,005, having closed the week above $106,000 for the first time ever and maintaining its position as the market’s anchor. With technical forecasts calling for a move to $114,289 in May and long-term projections as high as $210,000–$230,000 for 2025, institutional inflows and ETF demand are keeping sentiment bullish.As Bitcoin’s growth steadies, investors are increasingly seeking higher-multiple opportunities in early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana’s Consistent Climb Draws Institutional Eyes Solana (SOL) is trading at $171.54, up 3.38% from yesterday, and continues to be one of the strongest Layer-1 performers this cycle. Price forecasts for May 2025 suggest a range between $158 and $175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to $183 and beyond.As Solana’s fundamentals remain robust, some SOL holders are rotating into smaller-cap options like MAGACOIN FINANCE to chase outsized returns ahead of listings. Kaspa: Quietly Building Momentum Kaspa (KAS) is quietly gaining traction in 2025, with its proof-of-work model and expanding ecosystem attracting new capital. While not as high-profile as Bitcoin or Solana, KAS is being watched by analysts as a potential breakout candidate for the second half of the year.As capital rotates, many are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion While Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana remain foundational to any crypto portfolio, the search for the next breakout is intensifying. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the bold, high-upside pick that’s catching analyst attention as Stage 8 nears completion.With a clear listing roadmap, robust demand, and a narrowing entry window, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the defining early-stage opportunity of the 2025 cycle.

That’s exactly where Unstaked is stepping in, blending blockchain with AI in a way that brings immediate benefits. Rather than selling future potential, it’s already giving users working tools that help with decision-making, risk control, and portfolio management. Now in stage 13 and with over $6.2 million raised, Unstaked is building strong momentum. Many analysts are starting to recognise it as a serious contender for the top DeFi token of 2025, with growing belief that $UNSD could approach the $1 mark soon after launch. AI-Powered Tools That Help Users Make Smarter Moves What truly sets Unstaked apart is how it brings advanced AI technology directly to its users. Instead of simply offering another token to hold, it provides a toolkit packed with features, live trading alerts, scam detection, risk analysis, and portfolio optimisation. These tools aren’t promises for later. They’re built to function the moment the AI agents are live. Users can activate their own AI agents to run community engagement across platforms like Telegram and X. These agents do more than automate replies; they learn, adapt, and support long-term community growth. This shift from passive holding to active participation gives investors a stronger reason to be involved. With features that drive interaction and utility, Unstaked is positioning itself as a meaningful platform, and one that could rise as the top DeFi token of 2025 for users who want a function alongside investment potential. Presale Growth Reflects Rising Confidence in the Project The momentum behind Unstaked’s presale shows just how quickly interest is building. With the project now in stage 13, over $6.2 million has already been raised, and tokens are sold at $0.009267 each. That kind of traction doesn’t happen without a compelling offer. A key part of that appeal is Unstaked’s open and fair launch structure. With no private or early-stage allocations, the project attracts a broad mix of everyday investors who are drawn to transparency and accessibility. Unlike many DeFi projects that rely on speculation, Unstaked offers actual value through its functional AI agents. Additionally, its $1 million giveaway is helping build a strong and engaged community. With an expected launch price of $0.1819, early participants see plenty of room for growth. That optimism, tied to the project’s tangible offerings, is what’s making Unstaked one of the leading names among the top DeFi tokens of 2025 contenders. Could $UNSD Reach $1 After Listing? Some market watchers now suggest that Unstaked could climb past $1 shortly after it goes live. This view isn’t just based on hype. The project’s strong presale performance and wide support for utility-first DeFi solutions make a solid case. Unstaked’s unique proof-of-intelligence framework also plays a big role. It logs every action made by its AI agents on-chain, creating a public, transparent record of engagement and productivity. This data-driven approach adds credibility and makes user activity measurable, something not many other platforms offer. This kind of verifiable participation draws in a new type of investor, someone looking for impact they can track, not just tokens they can hold. With practical use cases and clear metrics already in play, Unstaked is making a name for itself among those looking for the top DeFi token of 2025 with more than just market buzz. Summing Up! DeFi is evolving, and the next generation of platforms will be judged by more than yield and tokenomics. Projects like Unstaked, which balance utility, transparency, and community interaction, lead the way. With presale stages advancing, AI tools already operational, and more than $6.2 million raised, it’s becoming harder to ignore what Unstaked is building.

Arthur Breitman’s Bet on Tokenized Uranium Could Signal a Tezos Revival Arthur Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, is placing a bold bet on tokenized uranium—a move that could mark a pivotal comeback for the once-hyped “Ethereum killer.” In a recent interview, Breitman reflected on Tezos’ evolution from a top-10 crypto project to a more subdued but resilient player in the blockchain space, now targeting the Real World Asset (RWA) sector. With its unique self-amending protocol and strong emphasis on decentralization, Tezos is aiming to reinvent itself by enabling secure and transparent uranium tokenization. Breitman emphasizes Tezos’ culture of “doing things for real,” contrasting its genuinely decentralized infrastructure with other projects driven by hype or custodial models. While Tezos has endured regulatory hurdles, shifting narratives, and market skepticism, its pivot toward tokenizing critical assets like uranium could redefine its place in the crypto ecosystem and reignite developer and institutional interest. Avalanche (AVAX) Surges 21%, But Ruvi AI (RUVI) Emerges as 2025’s Breakout Star with $2 Price Prediction and 20,000% Growth Forecast Avalanche (AVAX) has seen a significant 21% surge, hitting $22.80 amid growing adoption and bullish momentum, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $30.01 by 2030. However, market analysts are increasingly turning their attention to Ruvi AI (RUVI), a disruptive decentralized AI superapp that’s making waves with its innovative integration of Web3 technology. With a successful presale already under its belt—where early investors earned 50% gains—RUVI is now priced at just $0.015, yet experts forecast the token could reach $2 in 2025, representing a staggering 20,000% ROI. Combining blockchain utility with AI-driven content creation tools for text, video, audio, and images, Ruvi is quickly gaining traction as the next major player in the crypto space.

The exchange said in a May 16 filing to a New York federal court that its terms of service, which it claimed the class group agreed to, has a clause that users agree to arbitrate all claims, along with a clause preventing users from launching class actions against the crypto exchange . “The Court should hold that Plaintiffs are required to arbitrate claims that accrued after Feb. 20, 2019, even if the Court adheres to its initial decision as to claims that accrued before then and that the class-action waiver in the 2019 Terms of Use is enforceable for all of Plaintiffs’ claims,” Binance said. Binance argues that its terms of service have a clause about users agreeing to arbitrate all claims. Source: PACER In March, Judge Andrew Carter denied Binance’s request to have all of the class action’s claims sent to arbitration for users who bought tokens on the exchange between April 1, 2017, and Feb. 20, 2019, and partially denied the motion for users who bought tokens after 2019 until a decision could be made to what extend the arbitration clause would apply. Binance said in its latest filings that it updated its terms in February 2019 to include the arbitration clause and argued that an earlier version of the terms of service included a clause that informed users that Binance could amend the terms as needed without any individual notice. Binance case was previously dismissed Judge Carter had sided with Binance and dismissed the suit in March 2022. Binance had argued that it isn’t beholden to US securities laws because it doesn’t have a physical headquarters in the country. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned that decision in March 2024 , and the Supreme Court later declined to hear Binance’s appeal in January. Related: US judge transfers Binance lawsuit to Florida, citing first-to-file rule Binance’s legal entanglements in the US have escalated since mid-2023, when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company for selling unregistered securities, which was settled for $4.3 billion in November 2023. Binance was also slapped with a class action in Canada in April 2024 for allegedly violating securities laws after it announced its departure from the country in May 2023.

Despite these setbacks, the Pi Core Team has announced new job openings, leaving the community both puzzled and concerned. Price Drops Despite Fund Announcement After briefly spiking to $1.6796 on May 8, the price of Pi has pulled back sharply and is now trading at around $0.75. Although it remains slightly above its early April lows, the token’s value has dropped since peaking at $2.98 in late February. Even a major announcement on May 14, where the Pi Core Team unveiled a $100 million ecosystem fund to boost network development, failed to stop the price slide. In fact, some community members argue that this fund may be contributing to sell pressure rather than supporting the market. Technical analysts are keeping a close eye on the critical $0.70 support level. If this support breaks, it would invalidate the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, possibly opening the door for a drop to $0.40. Hiring Spree Amid the Chaos Interestingly, amidst the falling prices and growing controversies, the Pi Core Team has released a fresh list of job openings. This move comes at a time when investor confidence is shaky, leaving many to question the timing and motives behind the recruitment drive. Allegations of Pump-and-Dump and Wallet Concerns Along with falling prices, the Pi community is also raising concerns about possible pump-and-dump activity. Many believe the Pi Core Team controls over 10,000 wallets and sub-wallets, though only the 7 largest wallets are easy to track. In the last five months: 5.4 billion Pi were moved from the Foundation 1 wallet to the Foundation 3 wallet. About 700 million Pi were transferred from Foundation 3 to Foundation 2 in smaller batches. More than 1 billion Pi went directly from Foundation 1 to Foundation 2. Right now, the Foundation 3 wallet holds 4.7 billion Pi, while Foundation 2 has only 24 million Pi left. The community is demanding answers about where these large amounts of Pi have gone and is calling for better transparency and accountability from the Pi Core Team.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 02:36:23

In our previous entries, we covered moving averages and MACD , great for identifying trends and momentum. Now let’s look at RSI , a tool many traders use to time their trades with better confidence. What is RSI? RSI stands for Relative Strength Index. It helps you see if a coin has been bought or sold too much recently and might be ready to reverse. It’s plotted as a line that moves between 0 and 100. Most traders use it with a 14-period setting. Depending on your chart’s timeframe, this could mean 14 days, 14 hours, or even 14 minutes. Unlike price-following indicators, RSI doesn’t just track where price is. It tells you how extreme recent buying or selling pressure has been . That way, you can figure out if the market’s about to flip before it actually does. How to Read It: RSI above 70 = Overbought → Market may be due for a correction RSI below 30 = Oversold → Market may be due for a bounce RSI between 40–60 = Neutral → No strong signal Example in Action: RSI (Purple Panel): Overbought Alert RSI is sitting above 70 , signalling classic overbought conditions . This suggests that Bitcoin’s recent bullish run may be losing steam or approaching a natural correction. What Traders Are Watching: RSI dropping back below 70 could mean a pullback is starting. If BTC remains strong, RSI might stay overbought. This is a behavior common in strong uptrends but also a risky zone for late buyers. For better accuracy, use RSI together with MACD and Moving Averages to make more informed decisions. MACD : Bullish, but Momentum Slowing? MACD Line (Blue): 4,142 Signal Line (Orange): 3,536 Histogram: Positive but starting to flatten, hinting that momentum is slowing down . The MACD remains bullish with the blue line comfortably above the orange, but keep an eye on that histogram. If those bars start to shrink, it’s often the first clue that bullish momentum is fading. Moving Averages : Is BTC Overextended? 50-Day EMA (Yellow Line): 92,570 200-Day SMA (Blue Line): 91,673 BTC is trading well above both these critical moving averages, which confirms the strength of the current uptrend. But this also raises a flag: Is the market overstretched? When price pulls too far away from these averages, a healthy correction often follows, bringing price back toward the 50 EMA , a level many traders view as dynamic support in a bull market. Final Takeaways: Should You Act Now or Wait? Current Trend: Strongly bullish but potentially overextended. RSI: In overbought territory, exercise caution. MACD: Still bullish, but showing early signs of slowing momentum. Strategy: If you’re already in profit, this is a great time to consider securing gains or tightening your stop-losses. If you’re waiting to enter, watch for a pullback toward the 50 EMA for a stronger, lower-risk entry point. Pro Tips for Using RSI Like a Pro RSI is simple, but using it well is where it really counts. Here’s how experienced traders make the best of RSI: Understand Market Context RSI works beautifully in sideways or ranging markets , where price bounces between support and resistance. But in strong trends (like a bull run), RSI can stay overbought or oversold for weeks. So don’t hit that sell button just because RSI hits 70. Look at the bigger picture first. Combine It with Other Indicators RSI works best when it’s part of the conversation. Try pairing it with: MACD to check if momentum agrees with what RSI is telling you. Moving Averages (like the 50 EMA) to see if price is stretched too far from key support levels. Watch for Divergence If price makes a new high , but RSI doesn’t? That’s called bearish divergence , momentum could be slipping. If price makes a new low , but RSI doesn’t? That’s bullish divergence , a bounce might be around the corner. Divergence doesn’t always play out immediately, but it’s one of those clues that serious traders don’t ignore RSI Is an Early Indicator, Not a Direct Call to Action Just because RSI is flashing overbought or oversold doesn’t mean you need to rush into action. Use it as an early warning, not as a reason to panic-buy or panic-sell. Play with Timeframes to Refine Your Strategy RSI readings change based on the timeframe you’re looking at. If the daily RSI shows overbought , but the 1-hour RSI is cooling off , this often means the market is in a short-term pullback within a larger uptrend. Smart traders use this to their advantage, waiting for the short-term RSI to reset before jumping back into the larger trend. This approach helps you avoid chasing tops and gives you better, lower-risk entry points. Always check multiple timeframes before making your move.

From institutional Layer-1 giants to narrative-driven tokens and pre-listing breakouts, this list represents a strategic blend of infrastructure, utility, and momentum. Here are five cryptocurrencies traders are watching closely this quarter — each bringing something unique to the table, and one in particular still offering true early-stage entry potential . 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — A Pre-Listing Standout With 25x+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines as a rare altcoin still offering early-stage positioning with a fixed listing target of $0.007 . Currently moving into Stage 9 , MAGA has become the go-to pick for traders who missed early SHIBA, PEPE, and DOGE cycles — but want exposure to a similarly explosive setup, with clearer tokenomics. Why it’s trending: Strong community backing and political branding Structured entry points with transparent ROI potential Analyst projections of 25x–35x upside from current levels With listings on the horizon, MAGA is quickly earning its place among 2025’s most-watched speculative allocations . 2. Cardano (ADA) — Layer-1 Strength With Breakout Setup Cardano (ADA) continues to show strength in its fundamentals, even as its price consolidates below $0.80. With ongoing upgrades like Hydra , growing DeFi participation, and solid developer traction, ADA is positioning for a technical breakout above $1.00 . Why ADA still matters: Scalable blockchain infrastructure with long-term ecosystem goals Low price entry relative to previous ATHs Viewed as a low-risk Layer-1 long play in 2025 Investors seeking a blend of stability and upside are still allocating to ADA — especially ahead of its next wave of ecosystem rollouts. 3. Avalanche (AVAX) — Real-World Growth at a Discount Avalanche is trading around $28–$30 and continues to impress institutional audiences with its subnet model and real-world partnerships . Major integrations with gaming and financial companies — including attention from BlackRock — have helped solidify its 2025 relevance. Why AVAX is considered undervalued: Enterprise-grade scalability Strong developer growth and subnet expansion Analysts targeting $60–$90 range by Q3 if momentum holds AVAX is viewed as one of the strongest alternatives to Ethereum , particularly for investors chasing innovation in DeFi and GameFi. 4. OFFICIAL $TRUMP (TRUMP) — Controversial but Climbing OFFICIALTRUMP has become one of the most discussed tokens of 2025 — and not just because of its meme appeal. With an exclusive $TRUMP holders dinner scheduled for May 22 , political speculation and global wallet activity have triggered major volatility — and major attention. Key headlines: Top 220 buyers spent $140M+ for access to Trump’s private event Justin Sun rumored to be the largest holder with $18M+ Under U.S. Senate investigation for foreign wallet dominance and supply centralization Despite (or because of) its controversy, analysts say $TRUMP could remain one of the most heavily traded tokens this quarter , especially with a speculative rebound toward $13–$14 in play. 5. XRP (XRP) — Legal Clarity + CME Futures = Strong Positioning XRP continues to hold steady above $2.30 , supported by recent U.S. legal victories and anticipation of CME futures integration . It remains a cornerstone of blockchain-based cross-border liquidity , with broad global appeal. Why investors are still holding XRP: Regulatory green light in major markets Real-world adoption for financial infrastructure Long-term analyst targets of $10–$15 remain active XRP offers both growth potential and portfolio balance , making it a favorite for investors rotating out of Bitcoin-heavy allocations. Conclusion If you’re looking to reposition your portfolio before June 2025, these five cryptocurrencies stand out for different reasons — but all share the common trait of being undervalued relative to their upside : MAGACOIN FINANCE for high-leverage early-stage exposure Cardano for technical consistency Avalanche for scalable enterprise adoption OFFICIALTRUMP for political-driven speculation XRP for regulatory and institutional strength All five offer strategic entry points this quarter — but only MAGACOIN FINANCE still trades below its listing price, making it the last high-upside presale many analysts are watching closely.

The rise is a welcome return to form for Bithumb, which has had a torrid 12 months. Founded in 2014 under the name Xcoin and rebranded in 2015, Bithumb once ruled the roost in South Korea with over 70% of trading volumes. However, the exchange began to fade after suffering hacks, including one in 2018 that saw it lose about $30 million. Meanwhile, rival Upbit rose to prominence after partnering with internet-only Kbank, which could help process new exchange users digitally. But by 2024, Bithumb came roaring back. It raised marketing expenses more than tenfold to 192 billion won in 2024, from 16 billion in 2023. Data from market data provider Kaiko shows that Bithumb held 36% of the trade in January 2024. Though those figures have since waned, the firm has maintained around 25%. That’s quite a bit higher than its high single-digit market share at the start of 2023. Bithumb’s sudden resurgence is throwing the market into disarray in a country where Upbit has long held a near-monopoly. For years, Upbit was a primary growth driver with Kbank, and it was able to roll out a digital onboarding process for customers. The return of Bithumb, however, indicates that the market is now better positioned to compete. Bithumb sets the stage for public listing Bithumb is presently in preparation for IPO . The exchange is now racing to reach 1 billion dollars in IPO goals. A listing is scheduled for the second half of 2025, with Samsung Securities as the lead underwriter. The bourse plans to list South Korea’s KOSDAQ stock market and is considering a dual listing of the cryptocurrency exchange operator on the United States’ NASDAQ market to attract more global investors, KRX said. Bithumb has already broken its non-exchange businesses into smaller units to make the company easier to manage ahead of the IPO chase. NYC 5G (Bithumb A) was spun off on 31 July 2025. This move is intended to simplify its corporate setup and remove core trading functions from other projects, such as “blockchain research, consulting, and NFT efforts.” Solid financials back Bithumb, and its upcoming IPO is seen as a strategic step toward greater transparency. The move comes as the company works to rebuild trust following past controversies, including investigations into former executives over allegations of fraud and embezzlement. Bithumb remains under regulatory scrutiny Despite a few recent wins, Bithumb remains under intense regulatory scrutiny. South Korea enforces some of the world’s strictest crypto regulations , where violations can result in severe penalties. In the first half of 2025, Bithumb was warned about potential regulatory suspension due to Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. The Financial Services Commission had to develop a countermeasure for over 400 suspected user accounts. That backdrop has pushed many smaller Korean crypto exchanges out of the business. Only two big players remain in the country: Bithumb and Upbit. International exchange players like Binance also encountered challenges from the authorities, and the tight data privacy law proved difficult to sidestep.

Bitcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Ethereum May Be Fueling the Breakout",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrps-push-past-20-bitcoin-magacoin-finance-and-ethereum-may-be-fueling-the-breakout/,"Introduction The whales are moving again-but this time, their focus extends far beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Large-cap crypto holders are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE, with early projections pointing to up to 40x upside if it mirrors the explosive performance of early SHIBA or DOGE.As Stage 8 heats up, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the high-reward entry favored by smart money, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP position for the next major move. Here’s why analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most explosive altcoin entry of the 2025 cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why Early Whales Are Targeting MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly dominating early 2025 as one of the most-watched presales in the market. With over $8 million raised, a price still under $0.001, and a listing target of $0.007, the project is ranked as the #1 presale of the year, with analysts forecasting up to 40x returns before listings. Its scarcity-driven model-a capped 100 billion token supply and 45% allocated to presale-combined with a Hashex audit, is fueling surging demand and rapid community growth.Whale allocations and stage-based momentum are setting the pace, and as each stage fills, urgency grows. For those seeking asymmetric returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as the lead entry for Q3 listings and beyond. Bitcoin’s Steady Climb Reinforces Market Confidence Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading near $95,466, with bullish momentum and analysts predicting a potential surge past $100,000 in May 2025. Institutional inflows remain robust, and ETF demand is at an all-time high, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as the macro anchor for the next crypto cycle.As BTC’s price stabilizes above $95,000, capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the potential for exponential returns is drawing new buyers. Ethereum’s Quiet Build-Up Toward ETF Catalysts Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $2,489, with analysts forecasting a rise to $6,700 by year-end if institutional adoption and Layer 2 upgrades continue to accelerate. The recent Pectra update and the possibility of an ETH ETF are fueling optimism, while whales are quietly accumulating in anticipation of a breakout.As ETH’s growth steadies, more investors are diversifying into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. XRP Futures and ETF Hopes Drive Institutional Interest XRP is trading at $2.36 as of May 19, 2025, following the launch of CME Group’s regulated XRP futures contracts. While price action has been mixed, the new futures market and pending ETF decisions are expected to boost institutional demand and price discovery. Analysts see $5–$10 as the next major target, with $20 possible if ETF approval and global adoption accelerate.As XRP’s narrative strengthens, capital is also flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE for those seeking the next breakout. Chainlink: Reliable Growth Amid Rotating Capital Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $15.14, maintaining steady growth as DeFi and oracle demand remain high. While not as explosive as some rivals, LINK’s consistent utility and integration across major protocols make it a core holding for many.As capital rotates, some LINK holders are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for a shot at early-stage, high-multiple returns. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion When whales start positioning early, it’s a clear sign they see something big on the horizon. With MAGACOIN FINANCE accelerating through Stage 8, its combination of timing, tokenomics, and narrative is drawing accumulation from large BTC, ETH, and XRP holders.While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the market’s anchors, it’s tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer true breakout potential-and with whales quietly loading up, that breakout could arrive much sooner than the market expects.

Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Z-Score Is Still Under Its Mean In a post on X, quant Frank has talked about how the Mayer Multiple of Bitcoin is looking right now. The “Mayer Multiple” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the BTC spot price and its 200-day moving average (MA). In other words, the metric represents the distance that the asset’s value has from the 200-day MA. The 200-day MA is a level that’s generally considered as an important boundary between macro bullish and bearish trends in the cryptocurrency, so it can be useful to know how far the coin is from this line. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up $18,000, But HODLer Profits Same As On April 1—Here’s Why In the context of the current discussion, the Mayer Multiple itself isn’t of interest, but rather its Z-Score. The Mayer Multiple Z-Score is an oscillator that tracks how much deviation the indicator has from its mean value. Now, here is the chart for the metric shared by the analyst: As is visible in the top graph, the Bitcoin price saw a dip under the 200-day MA during the earlier market downturn, but with the latest recovery run, it has broken back above the line. It would seem, though, that the asset hasn’t gained too much distance over the level so far, at least in historical context. And indeed, the Mayer Multiple Z-Score (bottom graph) confirms this, as its value is currently below zero. The zero level corresponds to the all-time mean of the Mayer Multiple. As such, a negative value like the current one suggests the metric is less than the average over history. More specifically, 53% of all days have witnessed the ratio being higher than the latest level. Based on this, the quant notes that Bitcoin remains relatively cool even at its current $103,000 price. From the chart, it’s visible that while the Z-Score is still negative, it’s much improved compared to the lows from earlier in the year. It’s possible that if BTC continues its bullish momentum, it will be challenging the zero level soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says In the current cycle, the Mayer Multiple has been higher than its mean on a few occasions already, with the largest separation occurring in the rally from Q1 2024, where the Z-Score surged above the level corresponding to a standard deviation of 1. So far, though, the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple hasn’t deviated to the same degree as during the bull run from the first half of 2021. It now remains to be seen whether the metric would heat up to similar levels in this cycle as well or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $102,700, down 1.5% over the last seven days.

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market. She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed. In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto “Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.” She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.” “I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SEC Crenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.” Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: Report Crenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said. “Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.” In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo” SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.” Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.” Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-20 03:08:27

Whether it will overcome it or not is uncertain. Like other altcoins, Hype’s recovery started last month after locating a solid ground level above $9. While this came after trending bearishly throughout the first quarter of the year, it initiated a buy and increased with a strong close above the psychological $20 level in the late month. The trading volume enhanced this month, and the price increased until it reached a crucial multi-month resistance level of $28.4 yesterday. Looking back from where the price picked up in April, Hype has seen an impressive recovery and is now looking highly bullish on a short-term scale. Although it is facing a serious hurdle at this crucial resistance. Increasing above this resistance could fuel a bigger price movement in the future. However, a continuous rejection there could trigger a drop capable of bringing a pullback in the market before exploding higher. Similarly, trading calmly around this crucial resistance could lead to a slight consolidation phase before deciding the next major direction of the market. The bulls are still in charge despite the latest rejection. HYPE’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview After last month’s breakup, it has created supports at $23.25, $19.5 and $16.9 respectively. If the price drops from the currently trading level, we may see a pullback into the mentioned support levels before rebounding. Flipping the $28.4 resistance level, the potential buying target would be $35.7 on the short-term scale. The $43.25 level is the next resistance to watch for a major breakup.

It currently appears strong, but is likely to break lower following a newly formed bearish pattern on the daily chart. Alpaca is considered one of the top gainers (if not the biggest) during the recent rally in altcoins following an over 20x increase within two weeks. However, the buying pressure stopped following a long-wick rejection at $1.28 in late April. The price nosedived, but managed to stay above $0.16 in the first week of this month. Holding this price level as support, it resurged and pushed briefly above the $0.7 level in the second week. A rejection occurred again and the crypto lost momentum throughout that week. It advanced selling this week and further dipped to the $0.15 level yesterday. Today came with a relief following a major gain in the last 24 hours, and as we can see, it is now looking strong on the day. Despite the recent drops, it is still up by 6x on a monthly. But looking at the current price action, it has formed a double-top pattern on the daily chart. A break below the $0.15 level should validate more bearish moves in the coming days. Alpaca’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview On the way down, the $0.147 level is providing support. A drop below it could slide us to $0.0876. The key level to watch for a retest is $0.061. If a rebound fails there, it may roll back to the bottom level of $0.028. Towards the upside, the $0.266 level is the closest resistance to watch on the daily chart. A resurge above this weekly resistance should rally us through $0.4 to $0.727 before reclaiming the $1.28 high, where it faced a rejection in April.

Bitcoin and Solana are both in breakout territory — but a newer name, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is attracting heavy buyer interest ahead of a potential 40x move. The common thread? Traders looking to turn $500 into something massive before Q3 are rotating into this group — while Stage 8 of MAGACOIN FINANCE is still open . HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Bitcoin (BTC): Big Money Bets on the $250K Target Bitcoin has surged above $105,000 , just 3.5% below its all-time high, with daily trading volume topping $38 billion . Institutional inflows remain strong, and CME futures open interest is climbing. Leading analysts, including JPMorgan and Scott Melker, are reiterating bold forecasts of $250K by year-end . BTC remains the anchor of market confidence — and it’s pulling everything else forward with it. Solana (SOL): The Infrastructure Star with Eyes on $372 Solana is up over 6% daily , now trading at $178.45 , and analysts are watching for a continued move toward $294–$372 . The announcement of native Metamask support and the “Build on Solana” initiative backed by Chainlink Labs have elevated its growth trajectory heading into Q3. It’s not just moving fast — it’s scaling at the right time. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Stage 8 Is Live, Demand Is Climbing, and 40x Is the Talk of the Market Investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE , now ranked as the #1 altcoin entry of 2025 . The project has gained serious traction with early-stage buyers, and Stage 8 is now open with demand accelerating daily. With a 40x projection built around strong chart setups, trader positioning, and listing anticipation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting investors looking for that rare mix of visibility and early timing. The project is also fully audited by Hashex , adding a level of trust few emerging assets can match. To celebrate its explosive growth, new buyers can use promo code PATRIOT50X for a limited-time 50% bonus — driving even more interest as Stage 8 quickly approaches sellout. XRP and XLM: Bullish Sentiment Builds Around Utility Tokens XRP is trading above $2.36 , with anticipation building for the May 19 CME Futures launch . Analysts are targeting $3.40–$5.50 , with longer-term models calling for $10+ if ETF approvals align. Stellar (XLM) is quietly gaining ground as well, with May averages forecast around $0.236 , supported by ecosystem activity and developer momentum. Both are drawing renewed attention — but neither matches the energy forming around the Stage 8 window now closing fast. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Final Thoughts Bitcoin is driving institutional capital. Solana is expanding infrastructure at pace. XRP and XLM are rebuilding momentum around utility. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the breakout altcoin of this phase — with Stage 8 still open, listings ahead, and a real shot at 40x returns before the broader market catches up. For those aiming to turn $500 into a breakout position , the timing couldn’t be clearer — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is where the buyers are already moving .

In the last 24 hours, Ethereum’s price rose by 6.93%, and over the past week, it’s up 5.61%, currently trading around $2,558.65. One of the factors behind this rise is a fresh update from the Ethereum Foundation. The organization announced changes to its leadership structure, naming Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak as new Co-Executive Directors. Along with a newly appointed President, this marks a step toward strengthening the foundation’s management and decision-making processes. The news has been well received within the Ethereum community, with many viewing it as a sign of renewed focus and direction for the network. While Ethereum has seen a bullish climb, other leading cryptocurrencies have struggled to match its pace. Bitcoin (BTC) posted a smaller daily gain of 1.83%, while Binance Coin (BNB), XRP, and other altcoins recorded even smaller increases. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC stayed flat, as expected. Ethereum Price Analysis Technical analysis adds another layer to Ethereum’s price movement. The cryptocurrency recently rebounded from a crucial support area and is now approaching resistance levels between $2,523 and $2,690. Analysts predict that the market structure is still uncertain, but this bounce leaves room for either a fresh rally or another corrective move. However, a decisive break below $2,464 could suggest the current rally has ended and further downside is ahead. For now, Ethereum’s combination of leadership changes and positive price action has set it apart from the rest of the market.

It fell from $0.25 down to about $0.21. Traders saw a brief bounce above $0.23 around May 17–18, but that did not last. As of today, DOGE sits near $0.21, marking a 10% weekly drop. Investors are watching the bigger picture, hoping long‑term signals point to a renewed uptrend. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? Analyst Maintains Bullish Outlook According to analyst Javon Marks, a key trendline gave way in late 2023. This line had capped Dogecoin since its $0.70 peak. He says the break ushered in higher highs and higher lows. A fresh low near $0.15 has held so far. Based on this view, he kept his $0.65 target, which would mean a 200% gain from $0.21. Marks also mentioned $0.74 and $1.25 as possible future milestones. $DOGE and a +174% climb to its first target at $0.6533 continues to be in the cards 🃏… https://t.co/7Jt82s0jLy — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) May 18, 2025 Resistance Levels Remain Key Barrier Based on reports from market watcher Ali Martinez, the $0.25–$0.26 range is a major hurdle. That zone worked as support in December 2024 but flipped to resistance in early 2025. Since then, the meme coin has tried and failed to push past it. In February, it hit $0.28 before reversing to below $0.15. A March rally saw a move above $0.19 but stopped short again. The most recent test in May peaked at $0.24 before closing at $0.22. Traders will be looking for a clear close above $0.26 to signal new momentum. On‑Chain Activity Sees Strong Uptick Based on latest data, wallet activity has jumped sharply. New addresses grew by over 100% in the last seven days. Active addresses climbed by 110%. Even zero‑balance addresses rose by 155%, which often hints at fresh participation or address cleanup. Higher on‑chain counts don’t always mean a price rise, but they do show more users are logging transactions again. Stretch Targets Face Big Hurdles Dogecoin’s long‑term goals may sound exciting, but getting there won’t be simple. A move to $0.6533 or beyond requires first holding above $0.26. Then it must break $0.28 with real volume behind it. Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Big price swings could scare some holders into booking profits. Even if the chart lines line up, outside events like social media buzz or exchange listings may be needed to push DOGE past $0.30. In the short term, traders will watch whether DOGE can reclaim $0.25 and hold it for a few days. If that happens, the higher‑low pattern stays intact. If it falls back below $0.21, the setup could collapse and open the door to further losses. For now, the coin sits in a tug‑of‑war between bullish chart fans and those who see more downside.

XRP: Futures Catalyst and Institutional Confidence in Motion XRP is currently trading above $2.36 , and all eyes are on the CME Futures launch on May 19 .

Ethereum: ETF Hype Meets On-Chain Fundamentals Ethereum is trading solidly above $2,600 and re-establishing itself as a cornerstone of the bull cycle. Between the successful Pectra upgrade , Layer-2 adoption, and anticipated spot ETF approval , ETH is positioned for a powerful second-half breakout. Forecasts from major research groups suggest movement toward $6,500–$12,000 , making it one of the few large-caps still loaded with upside. HBAR (Hedera): A Utility Giant Still Flying Under Radar HBAR continues to build through high-value enterprise integrations. From ESG reporting to payment rails, Hedera’s use cases remain strong. While it hasn’t exploded yet, many analysts believe it’s one catalyst away from being revalued significantly higher.

The provision, a major legislation, has established the first broad federal framework for overseeing stablecoins and constitutes a substantial leap toward mainstreaming digital assets. The development came just a week after a failed procedural vote. All 49 Democratic senators blocked a motion to invoke cloture on the bill’s consideration , halting its initial path to the floor. In the following days, reports surfaced of a bipartisan effort to revise the bill for another vote. Key Democrats jumped back aboard the measure. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Mark Warner (D-VA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-PA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD)—all of whom voted against cloture on the GENIUS Act earlier this month—supported the measure tonight. Alsobrooks and Gillibrand initially co-sponsored the bill. GENIUS Act gains momentum with bipartisan backing after procedural turnaround The bill has garnered more than 60 votes and is now expected to quickly move forward to a full floor vote, potentially as soon as tomorrow, a source familiar with the matter said. However, the bill still has to go through a vote in the House of Representatives and be signed into law by President Trump. If passed, the GENIUS Act will establish a legal basis for issuing stablecoins in the United States . Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) introduced the GENIUS Act. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Tim Scott (R-SC) served as co-sponsors of the legislation, which generated bipartisan momentum. The legislation seeks to lay down a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins that have grown substantially and now have an aggregate market cap exceeding $250 billion. Just days ago, the bill failed to clear a key procedural vote. At the time, a confluence of political factors undermined support from pro-crypto Democrats, such as concerns about President Donald Trump’s conflicts of interest related to cryptocurrency. Supporters hail the GENIUS Act as pro-dollar and innovation-driven Under the GENIUS Act, stablecoin issuers must hold cash and/or Treasury securities reserves and comply with AML/ATF standards. The bill also authorizes the Federal Reserve to regulate stablecoins so that these digital assets function safely and securely. Some members of Congress had criticized the GENIUS Act even as it won bipartisan backing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was worried that the measure would be a boon to President Donald Trump, who could use it to expand his stablecoin venture, “USD1,” and his meme coin. She said it allowed Trump to regulate his own digital currency. Supporters, however, viewed the GENIUS Act as a necessary step toward responsible innovation. Senator Bill Hagerty called it a “pro-growth” initiative and “the first-ever regulatory framework for payment stablecoins.” Next week, the Senate will make history when we pass the GENIUS Act that establishes the first ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. This bill will cement US dollar dominance, protect customers, increase demand for US treasuries, and ensure that innovation… — Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) May 16, 2025 Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, also endorsed the bill . The GENIUS Act is about securing the future of American finance.

Digital asset technology is the next generation of… — Bo Hines (@BoHines) May 16, 2025 Justin Slaughter, VP of regulatory affairs at Paradigm and a Democratic staffer, offered a pragmatic endorsement , saying this is “close to the best we can get for years and years.” Amanda Tuminelli, executive director and chief legal officer of the DeFi Education Fund, urged bipartisan backing , arguing that clear rules around stablecoins would benefit consumers, small businesses, and the global standing of the U.S. dollar. Echoing this sentiment, Ji Kim, acting CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, described the vote as “a critical step” toward regulatory clarity and said the legislation is vital for maintaining U.S. leadership in the digital finance space.

This pushed total inflows for the year to $7.5 billion, eclipsing the previous high of $7.2 billion seen in February. The influx has now erased the $7 billion in outflows from the February-March downturn. Interestingly, Ethereum stood out with strong performance. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , Ethereum experienced $205 million in inflows last week, bringing its year-to-date total to $575 million. This was indicative of a renewed investor confidence after the Pectra upgrade finally went live on May 7th, following a series of delays, as well as the appointment of co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak. Bitcoin also saw notable inflows of $557 million, though down from the previous week, possibly influenced by the Federal Reserve’s continued hawkish stance. Meanwhile, short-bitcoin products attracted $5.8 million for the fourth consecutive week, which suggested investor hedging as prices climb. During the same period, Sui and XRP recorded inflows of $9.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively, while Cardano and Chainlink posted smaller inflows of $0.5 million and $0.2 million. On the other hand, Solana witnessed $0.89 million in outflows, and multi-asset products saw a larger $2.9 million in withdrawals. Regional investor sentiment showed clear divisions. The US, for one, saw strong weekly inflows of $681 million, with Germany and Hong Kong contributing $86.3 million and $24.2 million, marking Hong Kong’s largest since November 2024. Australia and Switzerland followed with modest inflows of $13.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively. However, sentiment soured in Sweden, Canada, and Brazil, which recorded outflows of $16.3 million, $13.5 million, and $3.9 million over the past week, respectively.

After an initial macro-driven rally, a slight cooling of investor enthusiasm turned the backdrop into a almost-stable one for several significant token releases and project progressions. There has been no obvious mandate from the market for why this has been happening, except for the notion that sideways price action typically resolves itself either in the bullish direction or in a downward-breach direction. As noted in the Weekly Unlock Digest for the week of May 15, 2025, the market absorbed fresh emissions of tokens with minimal disruption. Ethereum was the most significant of these major assets, showing real strength and moving well ahead of the pack as it fought to reclaim previously lost ground after a recent period of underperformance. Meanwhile, several new product introductions and some really strong-looking new tokens captured our attention over the past week, including $ETHFI, a newly launched EFi token that is the first of its kind to go live on the Ethereum blockchain. Tariff Delay Baked In: Ethereum Pulls Ahead Amid Flat Market Last week in cryptocurrency was defined by a calming in the volatility department. The markets had already taken in the bullish effects of the U.S. and China moving to put off new tariffs for 90 days until December. This was a nice short-term boost, because we were headed for a possible trade deal; but still, it was nice to see the markets not worrying too much about this part of the global macroeconomic setup. While it was in relief-rally mode earlier this month, last week, it appeared risk assets were back to the good old grind, with most of the major cryptocurrencies taking it easy and mostly flat for the week. Nonetheless, Ethereum followed a completely different path. After underperforming in the first part of the quarter, it broke out in the second half to record an impressive run, notably rising throughout most of September and October. Market commentators have linked this shift directly to much healthier institutional flows into Ethereum. The trend has also been attributed to increased adoption of Ethereum layer-2 solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, at a time when some major Internet companies, like Amazon, have begun focusing on these solutions in their own infrastructures. Stable price action also created a good atmosphere for unlocks of tokens. Fresh emissions usually harm the market, but investors seem able to absorb most of what would have otherwise caused a major selloff. Overall, the market seems capable of handling any new supply without much fuss. $ETHFI Leads Performance Charts Amid Ecosystem Growth In terms of price performance among the tokens that are undergoing significant unlocks and supply expansions, $ETHFI seems to be the clear standout. In the past month, the token commonly referred to as $ETHFI has nearly doubled in price, touching $51. It has reached as high as $60 in that time span. It’s a new tool from the World Wildlife Fund, helpfully denoted with the ‘WWF’ logo right on the front, which allows users to donate directly to wildlife conservation across a range of species. After a strong month of gains driven by macro relief, the crypto market traded mostly sideways this past week. Weekly Unlock Digest – Week 3, May 2025 Investors appear to have already priced in the impact of the U.S. and China tariff delay. Despite this, Ethereum showed… pic.twitter.com/2ECrD8kjFH — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) May 19, 2025 Some of this rally can be linked directly to Ethereum’s resurgence in the past few months. However, $ETHFI’s surge is also being driven by several fundamental catalysts that are taking its value proposition to a whole new level. One of the most exciting developments is the recent launch of the ETHFI crypto credit card, which offers 2–3% cashback to users. This brings a real layer of world utility to the token’s ecosystem. Furthermore, a sustained source of demand has been created with the implementation of a token buyback and burn program. By actively decreasing circulating supply over time, the program has added deflationary pressure to the token. In turn, this has served to boost investor confidence. Even with the recent increases, $ETHFI is still significantly below where it was at its all-time high, with the price more than 80% lower than its peak valuation. This shows how serious its prior correction was — part of a broader crypto winter — and how much opportunity there is for it to recover, especially if it can keep favorable momentum going. Upcoming Unlocks to Watch Amid Growing Market Maturity Although the current market backdrop has permitted recent token unlocks to take place without major price disruption, this could change. It might change based on the direction that investor sentiment takes. One key factor to pay attention to is the percentage of the total token supply that is unlocked. With $ETHFI, only about 29% of the total token supply is actually unlocked right now. So, what does that leave us with? It leaves us with a lot of the tokens still locked up and some of them to be gradually released into the wild, i.e., into the hands of the market, i.e., onto exchanges, for trading. In the near future, upcoming schedules for unlocking will be very important in determining whether the prices will go up or down over the short to medium term. If people want the tokens and if they’re being used in a really useful way, then the newly unlocked tokens could just get taken up without any problems. But in a more uncertain or just plain volatile situation, the unlocking could add a little bit of downward pressure on the prices, especially for the tokens that are already having a tough time finding buyers. Simultaneously, fresh token generation events are gathering momentum yet again, with rebranded undertakings such as Solana Name Service ($SNS) reestablishing themselves in the marketplace. These circumstances underscore the evolution of the crypto space, in which would-be projects are beginning to adapt, evolve, and re-launch themselves with a greater deal of sophistication. All in all, the third week of May might not have given us any sensational stories, but it was a week that underscored stability and resilience, and even some selective outperformance, for the crypto markets. That dynamic could carry us through the summer of 2025. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

Its stablecoin, USDe, is too. Ethena’s USDe is growing rapidly, and its recent footprint is capturing the attention of crypto investors and market analysts. Over the course of just one week, USDe’s supply has increased by an impressive $300 million—in no small part due to improving funding rates across DeFi. This is an actual narrative shift. Many view this latest uptick in USDe supply as the harbinger of yet another explosive growth phase for Ethena’s ecosystem token, ENA—one that they see having the potential to mirror its meteoric rise in late 2024. A Flashback to October 2024: Explosive Growth and a 5x Rally The previous occasion on which USDe experienced such fast expansion was in October 2024, when its circulating supply shot up by $4 billion in just under two months. That remarkable growth period far outstripped inflows into all Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs combined and only strengthened Ethena Labs’ reputation as a rising force in decentralized finance. For eight weeks, ENA–Ethena’s native governance and incentive token–had a wild ride of appreciation in value. From a meager $0.25, starting point, the token shot up nearly 5 times in value to an all-time high of $1.25. Not only was the price movement exhilarating for investors already on board, but it also had the effect of attracting some big institutional and retail investor names to the project. $ENA is about to explode, mark my words USDe, $ENA stablecoin, just increased $300m in supply in the last week as funding rates have improved. Why is this a big deal? It’s showing us the next period of big growth for @ethena_labs just like last time The last time USDe… pic.twitter.com/JOTRso0gQF — Not Telling (@nottellingyou73) May 18, 2025 At present, the USDe supply is growing fast again, and the overall money funding conditions are looking quite nice. Seems like we are set up for a repeat performance of the last major ENA uptrend in summer 2020. A lot of investors are already placing their bets to take advantage of this setup. I personally have quite a nice position in ENA, and I plan to add quite a bit more soon. Strategic Partnerships and New Blockchain Push the Narrative Forward Bolstering the overall positive sentiment surrounding Ethena Labs is a rally of partnerships and numerous impactful developments that aim to strengthen its long-term value proposition. Most prominently, a recent announcement from Ethena reveals a partnership with Telegram to integrate USDe directly into its ecosystem; this partnership dramatically widens the potential user base for the stablecoin. With Telegram’s global reach—counting hundreds of millions of active users—this partnership could turn out to be a major driver of actual, real-world adoption of USDe that goes beyond DeFi-centric applications. Simultaneously, Ethena Labs is set to introduce a new blockchain called Converge, which is designed with a particular emphasis on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This venture is being carried out in concert with Securitize, an RWA platform that puts compliance first and is backed by none other than BlackRock. The partnership emphasizes Ethena’s commitment to connecting traditional finance with decentralized protocols, a storyline that is gathering more and more currency across the Web3 ecosystem. USDe—and, by extension, ENA—could become central players in on-chain finance if Converge sees a successful introduction. Converge could serve as a major catalyst for staking USDe, in equal parts utility tokens and governance tokens. ENA: Is This the Beginning of Another Parabolic Run? The supply of stablecoins is growing, and the conditions of the market are bright, and then there are those high-profile partnerships. Put all this together, and you have the present setup for ENA, which is looking more and more like the last rally it had, and which some in the crypto community are calling an “easy call” for a next breakout token. Aside from the imagineering upside, Ethena Labs is putting forth a larger vision—one that melds DeFi tools of the kind that can scale with the traditional financial infrastructure. In that world, the three projects we just mentioned would play a part. Ethena would serve users a yield-bearing, censorship-resistant stablecoin in USDe, while it and the two other projects would build out a regulated real-world asset (RWA) ecosystem—in other words, something that might get us to a usable crypto future faster than the un-usable present. Although no investment is without risk, Ethena Labs and ENA seem to be moving with momentum into a critical growth phase. If historical performance is any guide, the next few weeks could bring transformative changes both for the token and for the DeFi ecosystem that is closely observing from the sidelines.

Source: CompaniesMarketCap While the bellwether crypto aims to surpass Amazon’s $2.188 trillion and Apple’s $3.118 trillion, meme tokens linked to the Bitcoin ecosystem appear on steroids. Bitcoin Pepe , which looks to transform the BTC blockchain with increased earning opportunities for investors, rallies as it gains traction before its May 31 official launch. The new project has raised over $10.43 million, confirming investor confidence in its future potential. With timing proving paramount in the digital assets world, let’s evaluate BPEP’s potential in the upcoming months, especially as Bitcoin hints at long-term rallies. Bitcoin steadies above the $2 trillion mark The largest crypto by value first hit the $2 trillion milestone in late 2024. However, dwindling sentiments in Q1 2025 saw the metric plunge to around $1.5 trillion. However, Bitcoin reclaimed $2 trillion in early May as developments like the US-China trade deal revived risk-on appetite. Bitcoin trades at $105,757, with $2.109 trillion in market capitalization cementing its position in the top ten assets by value globally. Presuming the top five maintain constant market sizes, Bitcoin should hit $110,000 to overcome Amazon. Moreover, a new ATH above $158,000 is essential to flip Apple. That seems possible as analysts expect Bitcoin to hit the $200,000 landmark before the end of 2025.

That’s where BPEP comes in. The meme token combines two iconic symbols: the viral Pepe the Frog and Bitcoin. While themed tokens like DOGE and SHIB rely on social media hype and community enthusiasm, Bitcoin Pepe will leverage BTC’s robustness and security for heightened investor benefits. It plans to crack Bitcoin’s full potential through Solana-like functionalities, including staking, meme trading, NFTs, and DeFi activities. The more than $10 million raised in the ongoing presale indicates a positive response from crypto investors looking for long-term growth and utility. Who would want to miss this one-of-a-kind opportunity? Remember, BPEP introduced the world’s first ICO on Bitcoin. There are only eleven days left to board the train. What to anticipate as BPEP’s May 31 debut approaches? The altcoin will likely witness increased activity as its official listing nears. While adopters can experience heightened volatility, Bitcoin Pepe seems poised for key developments that could enrich its visibility. First and foremost, insiders hint at potential listing by top trading platforms, including Bybit and OKX. That will attract increased demand as more traders and investors access the token. Moreover, BPEP’s uniqueness could draw influencer buzz, amplifying attention to the digital token. Furthermore, enhanced market conditions as Bitcoin eyes extended growth could create a lucrative atmosphere for BPEP’s outperformance after its debut. The alt trades at $0.0359, and eyes 1,000x growth in the upcoming times. Source: Bitcoin Pepe You can learn more about Bitcoin Pepe via their website .

She said that, while many NFTs do not qualify as securities, certain NFTs designed to compensate creators over time could also fall outside the scope of federal securities laws. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force , led by Peirce since Jan. 2025, was created as part of the agency’s broader effort to establish clearer regulations in the rapidly growing and often confusing cryptocurrency sector. Under her leadership, the task force has been actively working on providing more defined regulatory guidance. This includes guidance for crypto assets, such as NFTs and stablecoins. ICYMI: HEAD OF CRYPTO TASK FORCE HESTER PEIRCE SHARES VIEW ON NFTS – ""MANY NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS (“NFTS”) ALSO ARE NOT SECURITIES, INCLUDING NFTS DESIGNED TO COMPENSATE THEIR CREATORS OVER TIME"" pic.twitter.com/5ETIaIQRxM — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) May 19, 2025 Hester Peirce Clarifies That Many NFTs, Including Creator Royalties, Are Not Securities Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom” for her vocal dissents on SEC enforcement actions against crypto firms, further clarified her position. She stated that many NFTs do not offer the economic rights typical of securities. These include those designed to compensate creators with royalties over time. These NFTs are powered by smart contracts. They allow artists to earn a portion of the resale price every time the NFT is sold. This works similarly to how streaming platforms pay royalties to creators. Peirce argued that these “creator royalties” do not involve ownership rights in a business. Additionally, they do not promise profits typically associated with securities. While Peirce has classified many NFTs as non-securities, the SEC itself has not yet provided its own official clarification on the matter, leaving ambiguity in how these digital assets should be regulated. This distinction shows her position as an advocate for clearer and more specific guidance from the agency. Peirce Champions for Understanding the ‘Economic Realities’ of Crypto to Shape Future Regulations Since her appointment to lead the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, Peirce has made significant progress in engaging with the industry. The task force has hosted multiple roundtables and received numerous public submissions. Additionally, it has worked closely with lawmakers to develop potential legislation for crypto’s complex regulatory landscape. Her leadership marks a shift from the approach of former chairman Gary Gensler, who was known for his skepticism of crypto. Peirce’s comments on NFTs focus on those that do not involve security-like rights. However, she also acknowledged the challenges posed by other digital assets. These assets might blur the lines between securities and non-securities, she noted. Further, she pointed to the importance of understanding the “economic realities” of these assets, rather than simply their form, to determine their regulatory classification. Looking ahead, Peirce stressed the need for clearer rules to facilitate the growth of the crypto market while ensuring investor protection.

The Jakarta-based Nasdaq-listed company said on May 19 that its board of directors approved creating a Bitcoin ( BTC ) “treasury reserve” and it was “committing up to 50% of any net profits generated to fund the acquisition of BTC.” DigiAsia said it was also “actively exploring a capital raise of up to US$100 million” to kickstart its Bitcoin holdings and would look to earn yield on its holdings through means like lending and staking. DigiAsia said it had “initiated discussions with regulated partners” on yield strategies and managing its planned Bitcoin holdings. The company added that it was also assessing whether to offer convertible notes or crypto finance instruments linked to its planned Bitcoin haul. DigiAsia stocks explode on Bitcoin plans Shares in DigiAsia Corp (FAAS) closed May 19 trading at a gain of just over 91% at 36 cents after the company’s Bitcoin announcement, according to Google Finance. DigiAsia’s Bitcoin plan has seen its stock price rise over 90% in the regular trading session. Source: Google Finance However, after the bell, DigiAsia stock dropped 22% to 28 cents. The company’s shares are down nearly 53% so far this year, having peaked at just under $12 in March 2024. In a financial update on April 1, DigiAsia reported its revenues grew 36% year-on-year to $101 million in 2024. It projected growth of 24% to $125 million in 2025, along with earnings before interest and taxes of $12 million. A growing number of companies are adding Bitcoin to their corporate holdings, following its popularization by Michael Saylor’s Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, which has the largest Bitcoin holdings of any public company at 576,230 BTC, worth nearly $60.9 billion. Strive Asset Management announced on May 7 that it’s going to transition into a Bitcoin treasury company , and video game retailer GameStop Corporation (GME) finished a convertible debt offering on April 1 that raised $1.5 billion , with some proceeds earmarked for buying Bitcoin.

Bitget CEO Gracy Chen took it to X to reveal that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed the $40 billion milestone in cumulative inflows. The largest crypto by value displays a strong performance, and savvy investors are looking for ways to leverage its growth. Gracy Chen @Bitget @GracyBitget · Follow $40B+ in cumulative flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. This is shaping up to be the most institutionally anchored and structurally supported cycle in crypto history. 8:28 PM · May 19, 2025 68 Reply Copy link Read 15 replies Prevailing trends show digital assets enthusiasts are pivoting to Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , a new project aiming to unlock BTC’s capabilities through speculative undertakings like meme trading, NFTs, and DeFi. Bitcoin Pepe has raised close to $10.5 million, with its presale selling out faster before its 31 May official listing. This article explores how BPEP prepares to ride Bitcoin’s wave in the upcoming months and years. Bitcoin ETFs attract $40B in inflows Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have performed incredibly since their much-awaited approval in early 2024 . The latest statistics show that investment products have officially surpassed $40 billion in inflows as of 19 May, 2025. That reflects massive demand from institutional investors, revealing their trust in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. What do such trends mean for retail players? The crypto market is maturing at an unprecedented pace. And altcoins, especially those with unique narratives like BPEP, tend to outperform amid Bitcoin’s rise. Bitcoin Pepe rides on BTC’s wave as listing approaches Meme tokens have dominated during bull cycles, and Bitcoin Pepe is leading the pack this time. BPEP plans to unlock Bitcoin’s full potential by unleashing trillions in dormant capital into the themed-tokens space. The project grabbed attention due to its one-of-a-kind approach, introducing the world’s first meme initial coin offering (ICO) on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, BPEP is witnessing soaring interest with increased accumulation before the 31 May debut. The project has raised $10,434,818, and looks ready to hit its presale target in the next eleven days. Source – Bitcoin Pepe Its listing appears to be timing as Bitcoin targets record all-time highs amidst institutional interest and positive sentiments. Speculations that Bitcoin Pepe could launch in leading centralized exchanges (CEXs), including OKX and Bybit, after 31 May have magnified the frenzy. Though without official confirmations, experts trust the post-launch craze will attract trading platforms that look to match prevailing trends. Such developments will potentially alleviate BPEP’s status in the meme token and broader crypto space. The alt trades at $0.0359, offering a lucrative discount for investors looking for projects with massive growth potential. Can the unique utility help BPEP outperform meme assets like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in hitting the $1 milestone? A doxed team , audited smart contracts, and revolutionary use cases make Bitcoin Pepe more than a meme token. You can learn more about Bitcoin Pepe here .

The latest activity, brought to attention by the on-chain analytics platform EmberCN, shows that the address has deposited yet another more than 3.5 million LDO—worth close to $3.1 million—into top-tier trading platforms, including but not limited to, Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Gate.io. This transfer is the latest in a series of large token moves that have corresponded with a sharp drop in the price of LDO. In the past six days, the wallet has sent 21.31 million LDO, worth about $21.24 million, into several exchanges. That same week, LDO’s price has dropped 24% from $1.16 to about $0.88. Heavy Selling Pressure Raises Community Concerns The uninterrupted dismantling of LDO from a digital wallet closely linked to Lido’s internal stakeholders or a connected firm has raised red flags in the crypto community. Some wonder whether Lido’s leadership is selling LDO to finance some kind of corporate endeavor or—less flatteringly—to hedge against the remote possibility of Lido becoming a much larger player in the crypto industry. Such a move would be hard to pull off, given the amount of LDO up for sale. But it’s also not clear why so much LDO has been—and apparently is being—sold. For a long time now, when large amounts of tokens have been transferred from project-affiliated wallets to centralized exchanges, people in the market have interpreted those transfers as the former projects’ team members potentially cashing out. And that interpretation has sometimes exerted downward pressure on the tokens’ prices. More recently, the interpretation that token transfers are a bad sign has become even more popular, as LDO’s value has dipped in tandem with the recent downwards movement of the price of a centralized cryptocurrency exchange. The discourse on this subject has been concentrated on social media platforms, especially X (formerly Twitter). Analysts and traders are asking whether this represents a planned treasury reallocation, operational funding needs, or a broader market strategy that has prompted this move. Price Action and Market Impact LDO has suffered significant losses since the initial transfer wave began nearly a week ago. As of this report , the token is trading around $0.88—down 24% from its recent high of $1.16. This steep drop has wiped out a big chunk of LDO’s recent gains and has caused a kerfuffle in its trading pairs across major exchanges. Although the wider cryptocurrency market has also been variable, with the post-FTX world looking ever closer to the 2008 market meltdown (for the first time since the Great Recession, the crypto world has clearly found itself in the hands of really bad regulators and untrustworthy companies), we feel certain that Lido’s moves have nothing to do with the market’s other weirdnesses. Lido isn’t doing what it’s doing because of crypto or macroeconomic conditions; instead, it’s taking these steps because it has internally decided to do so. In other words, there’s an internal catalyst at work. Market participants have responded with caution, and some have even speculated that the market may not have fully come to terms with the large-scale selling that has taken place. If ILO and the trend continues, the near-term IMM may experience increased resistance. That’s “reclaiming higher price levels” as some descriptions go. In simple terms, LDO seems at risk of much more significantly testing the $1.50 support level over the next few weeks. What Comes Next for Lido and LDO? The current situation raises significant concerns about how much light is being shed on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and their practices when it comes to managing tokens. Lido has not issued any public statement that would help to illuminate what’s happening with the wallet in question and the recent exchange activity tied to it. The silence from the protocol is conspicuous. If the team could provide clearer communication regarding whether the transactions are a part of a strategic treasury management effort or a pre-announced unlock schedule, it could help reduce the uncertainty that seems to surround both the transactions and the team’s overall decision-making. The team could then have that much more space to operate in with reduced regulatory risk if the transactions really are what the team says they are. As the DeFi space grows, events like this are being looked at more and more from the perspectives of both fiscal stability and governance. Is this simply a one-off event, or part of a larger trend that we can’t quite see yet? One thing’s for sure: all eyes are on this wallet and Lido right now, as observers try to suss out a likely narrative and watch for upcoming governance decisions.

The pull-back has done little to dent the conviction of market technician Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX), who argues that the decisive battleground is still three weeks away: the weekly close of 9 June, when the Tenkan-sen is projected to cross above the Kijun-sen on the Ichimoku chart. What This Means For Bitcoin Price In a post on X published on May 19, the analyst reminded followers that “some people don’t understand the concept of time-frames,” adding that “while now we have a clear rejection with volume, a lot of people decided to get scared … on the first red 4h candle which even if red, didn’t break support.” He framed the current setback as routine consolidation: “Since tomorrow ~99.9K is a super-strong support,” he wrote, identifying the high-liquidity pocket between $98,900 and $100,200 as an area that is “most likely” to be “bought up pretty quickly and decisively” should spot bids be tested. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $10,000 Stairway: Chart Signals March Toward $115,000 The crux of Dr Cat’s argument lies in the interaction of the fast-moving Tenkan-sen and the medium-term Kijun-sen on the weekly chart. An upward cross of the former above the latter—sometimes colloquially dubbed a “TK golden cross”—carries weight among Ichimoku practitioners because it signals that near-term momentum has finally overwhelmed the baseline trend. What makes the 9 June close especially delicate is the tightness of the current range. Dr Cat concedes that “it’s unclear which will come first, $99,000 or $109,000—and that doesn’t really matter,” but he is categorical that “any deeper retrace below $98,000 is very unlikely.” The rising Kijun-sen, itself a 26-period mid-point, has in effect ratcheted support higher with every week of sideways trade. Related Reading: Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000 Macro-sensitive traders will also be working around the publication of the May US Consumer Price Index on June 11—two days after the anticipated TK cross—and the Federal Reserve’s rate-setting meeting on June 17-18. With real-yield expectations still dominating risk-asset positioning, any upside surprise in core inflation could delay the confirmation of bullish chart patterns—or intensify them if the data land dovish. For now, the market remains range-bound. As long as $99,000 holds on a closing basis and the Chikou-span (lagging line) stays above price, Dr Cat sees little reason to abandon an all-time-high thesis. “If by the time of the cross the price is still holding above Tenkan Sen … if ATH is not seen by then, it should be seen pretty much immediately,” he wrote. Whether that confidence will survive the macro calendar is another question. What is clear is that both discretionary traders and systematic funds are marking 9 June as the moment the chart either validates the 2025 bull cycle—or postpones it once more.

With XRP charging forward and bullish sentiment rising, traders are identifying a shortlist of altcoins gaining steam. At the top of that list: MAGACOIN FINANCE , Cardano , and Bitcoin — three names building pressure for a potential eruption as we move deeper into 2025. XRP: Futures Launch Fueling the Rally Toward $50 XRP is now trading around $2.36 , with the launch of CME XRP futures scheduled for May 19 . The move is being treated as a milestone moment, giving XRP mainstream exposure through a regulated futures market. Analysts are calling for a rally toward $4–$5.50 in the short term, with extended targets of $10–$50 over the cycle if institutional capital and ETF approval follow.

Cardano (ADA): Whale Activity and Upgrade Buzz Cardano is holding above $0.75 , with strong whale accumulation in recent weeks. Over 80 million ADA was bought by large holders in just 48 hours, with speculation building around the Midnight airdrop and upcoming Leios upgrade . Many analysts expect ADA to move toward $1.20–$1.50 if it breaks through the key $0.80 resistance. Bitcoin (BTC): Cycle Leader Holding Firm Over $105K Bitcoin is stabilizing above $105,000 , with volume surging and open interest on CME futures climbing. The $250K price target remains on the table for many institutional models, and analysts are calling BTC’s current strength the foundation for a broader altcoin breakout. As Bitcoin holds, rotation into higher-upside coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE and ADA is accelerating . Solana and ATOM: Quiet Accumulation Could Flip Fast Solana is gaining strength above $178, with real ecosystem expansion through Metamask and Chainlink Labs integration. ATOM, meanwhile, is showing signs of accumulation around $4.73 despite forecasts of near-term volatility. If the next leg of altseason catches fire, both tokens are positioned to follow — but neither is moving as fast as MAGACOIN FINANCE right now.

The price is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $172 resistance zone. Solana Price Recovers Above $165 Solana price formed a base above the $160 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace for a move above the $162 and $165 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the bears were active near the $172 resistance zone. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low is acting as a resistance. Solana is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $172 level. The next major resistance is near the $176 level. The main resistance could be $180. A successful close above the $180 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $192. Any more gains might send the price toward the $200 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $172 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $168 zone. The first major support is near the $165 level. A break below the $165 level might send the price toward the $162 zone. If there is a close below the $162 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support in the near term.

Many are asking — what’s so special about May 21st? Is XRP about to skyrocket, or will it drop? While no one can predict the market with complete certainty, analyst Levi said that there are a few reasons why this date has people talking. Global Tensions Affecting Markets Recently, tensions between the US and China have been heating up over trade deals. Both countries agreed to temporarily lower tariffs, but disagreements quickly followed. China is now threatening to retaliate against US export controls, especially involving computer chip supplies. This situation affects global markets — including stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies like XRP. When political and economic tensions rise between major countries, markets often become unstable. XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, tends to react to these global shifts. How Does This Impact XRP? Amid this uncertainty, XRP has been particularly volatile. After recent gains, the token slipped nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, erasing a 3% rise from the previous day. Crypto analysts are now watching the next 48 to 72 hours closely, anticipating a possible market bottom for XRP. Many traders are adopting a “buy-the-dip” strategy during these red days, hoping to capitalize on a rebound if historical patterns hold true. The price range between $2.31 and $2.15 is important. If the price reacts strongly and moves up from this area, it would be a good sign. The next important resistance to watch is at $2.61.

She added that more than 15 Democrats flipped their votes from no to yes, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted no. The passage has cleared a key procedural hurdle after Democratic senators initially blocked the bill earlier in May. This vote to invoke cloture, a procedural motion that limits debate on a matter and requires a super-majority vote, now sets up the bill for floor debate. BREAKING: GENIUS BILL PASSES THROUGH CLOTURE VOTE WITH 60 VOTES pic.twitter.com/ZDmZHe3qh4 — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 20, 2025 Stablecoin Regulation Moves Forward The GENIUS Act was introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty in February with the goal of regulating the $248 billion stablecoin market. The legislation would require stablecoins to be fully backed, undergo regular security audits, and receive approval from federal or state regulators. It restricts issuance to licensed entities and imposes limitations on algorithmic stablecoins and those without full backing. “This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation will bring America’s payment system into the 21st century,” said Senator Hagerty on X. He added that it will ensure US dollar dominance and protect customers. He also predicted that “the demand for US Treasuries will balloon to the tune of more than $1 trillion, and innovation in the digital asset space will thrive in the United States going forward.” “Digital assets are the future, and now we’re one step closer to ensuring America leads the way,” commented Senator Cynthia Lummis. Tonight, the Senate moved forward on the GENIUS Act. This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation will bring America’s payment system into the 21st century. The GENIUS Act skyrockets the United States with a digital payment framework with the fastest rails possible. It will… — Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) May 20, 2025 Democratic senators had previously withdrawn support, citing concerns about potential conflicts with President Trump’s crypto investments and anti-money laundering concerns. However, the legislation was subsequently revised to secure enough bipartisan support to move forward. It now heads to the floor where the Senate will engage in a formal debate on the bill, discuss its merits, propose amendments, and express concerns. Urgency Urged by Lummis Senator Lummis indicated she hopes to complete this process by May 26 (Memorial Day), suggesting an accelerated timeline for the remaining procedural steps. The stablecoin market is currently dominated by Tether, which has a commanding 61% market share with $151 billion USDT in circulation. Its closes rival, Circle, has a 24% market share with just over $60 billion USDC issued. In early April, related legislation, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, was passed by the House Financial Services Committee.

According to a Bloomberg report , Bithumb has surged to capture approximately 25% of the country’s total crypto trading volume, a significant leap from its single-digit presence in 2023. Bithumb’s Strategic Push The revival is largely credited to Bithumb’s bold marketing strategy. To regain its position, Bithumb has launched targeted campaigns to attract users who previously migrated to Upbit. The efforts appear to be working, with the exchange steadily rebuilding its user base and transaction volume. Upbit Still on Top 有几年是在韩国一线交易所工作，对韩国来说 #UPBIT 是一个宇宙级别的交易所，占韩国整个交易所交易量的 90%以上，仅Upbit的 $XRP 交易量就能超过韩国整个股票市场交易量，给大家解析一下 #UPBIT 很多人误区以为 #Bithumb 是韩国第一，但Bithumb交易量也就到 Upbit的 10%左右 01/ 背靠… pic.twitter.com/Yjzglvhitk — JET.K | Bluebird (@degen_jet) May 16, 2025 Despite the surge, Bithumb still trails far behind market leader Upbit. Analyst JET.K notes that Upbit controls over 90% of South Korea’s crypto volume, while Bithumb holds around 10%, highlighting the disparity between the two. This directly counters recent speculation that Bithumb may have overtaken its rival. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: U.S. Senate Moves GENIUS Act Forward with 66-32 Vote , IPO Plans on the Horizon The timing of Bithumb’s comeback is strategic, as the company gears up for an initial public offering expected by the end of 2025. Samsung Securities has been tapped as the lead underwriter for the listing. The IPO move signals Bithumb’s growing ambition to strengthen its position in the market while boosting its credibility with investors. As the rivalry heats up, all eyes are on whether Bithumb can continue closing the gap with Upbit or if Upbit’s first-mover advantage will remain unshaken. Challenging the Status Quo With a renewed user base and public listing in sight, Bithumb appears determined to challenge Upbit’s dominance. Still, the gap remains wide, and whether Bithumb can sustain its momentum remains to be seen. Bithumb’s push is a rare instance of a South Korean exchange bouncing back in a market largely monopolized by one player. As the IPO clock ticks down, the crypto industry will be watching closely to see if this comeback story can truly reshape the local exchange hierarchy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

If this stablecoin bill becomes law, crypto won’t just stabilize, it could explode. Big projects like XRP and Bitcoin might rise fast, while weaker ones could disappear. This bill isn’t just about rules. It could reset the whole crypto space. Why the GENIUS Act Is a Big Deal The GENIUS Act sets strict rules for stablecoins in the U.S. It first failed to pass the Senate on May 8 due to concerns about weak user protections and Trump’s influence. But things changed by May 19. After adding stronger rules, the bill passed a key vote with 66-32 support. Meanwhile, the updated bill requires stablecoins to have full 1:1 fiat backing, monthly audits, and clear redemption rules. This will help remove shady or risky coins and make stablecoins safer for both regular users to billion-dollar institutions. What Comes Next? House of Representatives – The bill moves to the House , where debate could focus on Trump’s coin, DeFi rules, and consumer protection. Reconciliation (if needed) – If the House edits the bill, both chambers must agree on a final version. Trump’s Signature – Trump is expected to sign it, especially since he supports stablecoin rules and backs USD1. Implementation – Includes 100% reserve backing, monthly audits, Fed/OCC oversight, and stricter rules for stablecoin issuers over $50B. XRP’s Secret Advantage in This Bill Stablecoins are a key part of the crypto world. While XRP is not a stablecoin, it could benefit a lot from stronger stablecoin rules. XRP is mainly used for cross-border payments, which need fast and smooth money transfers. Trusted stablecoins make these transactions easier and more reliable. So, the more stablecoins we have and the safer they are, the more useful XRP becomes for global banks and payments.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 05:20:39

Meanwhile, corporate interest in Bitcoin continues to rise as Canadian biotech firm Quantum Biopharma increased its crypto holdings to $4.5 million and plans to stake assets for additional yield. In Asia, Basel Medical also plans to acquire $1 billion in Bitcoin. Separately, Chinese printer company Procolored is facing backlash for distributing malware-infected drivers that stole almost $1 million in Bitcoin. JPMorgan to Open Bitcoin Access to Clients Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, announced a shift in the bank’s stance toward Bitcoin. Speaking at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19, Dimon revealed that the bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, although it will not offer custody services for the cryptocurrency. Instead, JPMorgan plans to include Bitcoin holdings in client statements without directly managing or storing the asset. “We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” According to a CNBC report , JPMorgan intends to offer clients access to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which gained a lot of traction in the US since their launch in January of 2024. These products have already attracted close to $42 billion in aggregate inflows, indicating a strong appetite among investors. Until now, JPMorgan's crypto exposure was largely limited to futures-based products rather than direct investments in Bitcoin. Dimon’s comments also still reflected his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies. He reiterated his concerns about their potential use in illicit activities like money laundering, sex trafficking, and terrorism. However, he framed his support for client access in libertarian terms: “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” This marks a big turn for Dimon, who has been one of the most vocal critics of Bitcoin over the years. In 2018, he called Bitcoin a scam , and in 2021, he said it was “worthless” during the height of the crypto bull market. During a 2023 Senate hearing, he characterized cryptocurrencies as primarily serving criminals and tax evaders. At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, even after Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 milestone, Dimon dismissed it as a “pet rock” that “does nothing.” Jamie Dimon Despite his personal misgivings, JPMorgan’s decision to offer access to spot Bitcoin ETFs aligns it with rivals like Morgan Stanley, which has also started offering the product to select clients. Quantum Biopharma Boosts Bitcoin Holdings Canadian biotechnology firm Quantum Biopharma also recently increased its exposure to digital assets by purchasing an additional $1 million worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The acquisition brings the company’s total crypto holdings to approximately $4.5 million, according to a press release that was issued on May 19. In line with a growing trend among corporations, Quantum announced it plans to stake part of its crypto holdings to generate additional revenue. The company sees its treasury strategy as a way to deliver returns to shareholders while also providing a hedge against the volatility of the Canadian dollar. Quantum’s stock price increase over the past 5 days (Source: Google Finance ) After the announcement, shares of Quantum’s stock surged by around 25%, according to data from Google Finance . This suggests that investors responded positively to the firm’s deeper involvement in the cryptocurrency market, which is increasingly considered as a strategic financial move by companies beyond the tech and finance sectors. Quantum is part of a wave of healthcare and biotech companies integrating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. Earlier in March, NASDAQ-listed Atai Life Sciences revealed plans to invest $5 million into Bitcoin. Atai founder Christian Angermayer has been a very vocal supporter of the strategy, and said in a post on X that Bitcoin should be included in every corporate treasury—particularly in the biotech industry. He argued that crypto assets can help firms endure the long and uncertain timelines that are associated with drug development by offering a buffer against inflation and potential liquidity issues. More recently, on May 16, Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced plans to acquire $1 billion worth of Bitcoin as part of its strategy to boost expansion across Asia. Basel said that the Bitcoin reserves would help build one of the strongest balance sheets among healthcare providers in the region, although its share price fell on the news. Corporate treasuries collectively hold over $83 billion in Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . Publicly traded companies now represent the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, second only to exchange-traded funds. Company Caught Distributing Bitcoin-Stealing Malware In other Bitcoin-related news, Chinese printer manufacturer Procolored is under fire after reports emerged that it distributed Bitcoin-stealing malware alongside its official printer drivers. According to a May 19 article by Chinese media outlet Landian News , the Shenzhen-based company uploaded infected drivers to cloud storage platforms, making them globally accessible for download. The malware was reportedly embedded in USB drivers used for Procolored printers, which ended up compromising unsuspecting users’ systems. The security breach reportedly led to the theft of 9.3 Bitcoin, valued at over $953,000. Cybersecurity firm Slow Mist offered a breakdown of just how the malware functions in a detailed post on X , and explained that it manipulates the system clipboard to replace copied Bitcoin addresses with those belonging to the attacker. This kind of malware is particularly dangerous as it remains stealthy and can redirect funds without user awareness at the moment of transaction. The initial warning was issued by YouTuber Cameron Coward , who discovered the malware while reviewing a Procolored UV printer. His antivirus software flagged the driver as being infected with a worm and a Trojan virus identified as Foxif. After Procolored dismissed the antivirus detection as a false positive, Coward escalated the matter to Reddit . This drew the attention of cybersecurity professionals, including those at G-Data. Procolored printers After an in-depth analysis, G-Data confirmed that the Procolored drivers contained two major forms of malware: Win32.Backdoor.XRedRAT.A and a sophisticated clipboard hijacker. These files, some of which had been hosted on the file-sharing platform MEGA since as early as October of 2023, were found to be capable of opening remote backdoors and executing commands from attackers. When contacted, Procolored claimed the malware was the result of a supply chain compromise. The company said infected USB devices unintentionally introduced the malicious software, which was then uploaded to their official driver distribution channel. According to the firm, the compromised files were removed on May 8 and all available drivers were re-scanned for safety.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-20 05:25:32

According to Krueger, the leader BTC will reach at least double its current level within this year. Krueger also warned users who postpone entering the market, saying, “Almost everyone gets out of the game trying to time it. And many who try to find the perfect entry point never get in the game.” Krueger, who admitted that Bitcoin could be affected by fluctuations in traditional markets such as Nasdaq in the short term, argued that the “HODL (holding assets without selling)” strategy would be profitable in the long term. He stated that it may be possible to achieve better results with derivative products such as options, but that this requires serious timing sensitivity.

Krueger also criticized financial institutions that prefer to keep Bitcoin on their company balance sheets, arguing that this approach goes against the basic philosophy of Bitcoin: “If you really understood Bitcoin, you would own it directly. But everyone's capacity is different.” Krueger heavily criticized the banking and finance sector, making the following comparison: “These sectors are like dinosaurs now. They are no different than Blockbuster Video, Tower Records or the horse-drawn carriage industry.” At the end of his statement, he made a striking emphasis: “There are only two things you should focus on right now: Bitcoin and artificial intelligence. Everything else is unimportant.” *This is not investment advice.

The bill, which sets licensing, collateralization, and compliance standards for stablecoin issuers, passed a key procedural vote with bipartisan support after facing delays tied to political concerns. As debate over crypto legislation intensifies in Washington, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, has quietly expanded its traditional asset holdings, surpassing Germany in US Treasury investments with over $120 billion. US Senate Advances GENIUS Stablecoin Bill Despite Democrat Concerns Over Trump’s Crypto Empire The United States Senate has taken a pivotal step toward comprehensive regulation of the stablecoin market, advancing the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act) in a 66–32 procedural vote. The vote sets the stage for formal debate on the Senate floor, potentially positioning the bill for final passage as early as Memorial Day, May 26. While the legislation represents a bipartisan breakthrough on stablecoin oversight, its trajectory has been clouded by intense political friction over President Donald Trump’s growing footprint in the cryptocurrency space. The GENIUS Act is designed to introduce clear regulatory standards for the burgeoning $250 billion stablecoin market, which is currently dominated by offshore giants like Tether’s USDT and domestic players such as Circle’s USDC. Introduced by Republican Senator Bill Hagerty on Feb. 4, the bill requires that all stablecoins: Be fully backed by reserves (not algorithmic), Undergo regular third-party security and reserve audits, Be issued only by licensed entities approved by federal or state regulators. The act also explicitly bans algorithmic stablecoins , a move that reflects lingering regulatory concerns after the spectacular 2022 collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin. Democrat Opposition Eases — With Caveats Earlier attempts to move the bill forward were derailed on May 8, when a bloc of Democratic senators blocked cloture due to unresolved concerns around potential conflicts of interest linked to Donald Trump’s personal and family cryptocurrency ventures. However, key Democrats, including Senators Mark Warner, Adam Schiff, and Ruben Gallego, reversed course and supported the motion to debate, acknowledging the urgency of setting regulatory standards. “Blockchain technology is here to stay,” Warner said in a post-vote statement. “We cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality. If American lawmakers don’t shape this ecosystem, other regimes will — and not in ways that reflect democratic values.” Despite their shift in tone, Democratic lawmakers made it clear that they expect stricter oversight to be added in the amendment process, particularly around Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) provisions. Still, not all Democrats are convinced. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent voice for tougher crypto regulation, remained firmly opposed to the bill, criticizing it for failing to curtail what she called Trump’s “blatant crypto corruption.” In a fiery floor speech ahead of the vote, Warren accused Trump and his family of attempting to “institutionalize” their crypto empire through legislation. “Trump and his family have already pocketed hundreds of millions from crypto,” she said, referencing Trump’s new USD1 stablecoin, which has reportedly become the seventh-largest stablecoin by market cap according to CoinGecko. “If this bill passes in its current form, they’ll make hundreds of millions more.” Largest stablecoins by market cap (Source: CoinGecko ) Warren’s remarks come amid widespread media coverage of Trump’s rapidly expanding crypto ventures, including: A meme coin ecosystem tied to the Trump brand, A new crypto mining company planning a public listing, A Trump-branded crypto platform, And the USD1 stablecoin, which has seen a meteoric rise in adoption and trading volume. Cynthia Lummis Targets Memorial Day Passage Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), one of the co-sponsors of the GENIUS Act and a long-time crypto advocate, said she believes the bill can be passed by Memorial Day, signaling urgency as the US races to establish legal clarity before foreign frameworks take precedence. The Senate’s decision to move forward on the GENIUS Act marks a rare bipartisan win in a deeply polarized political environment. But the involvement of Trump’s crypto business interests has complicated the narrative, turning a financial policy debate into a referendum on political ethics. Several Democrats indicated that amendments addressing ethical oversight and potential financial disclosures related to political figures and crypto companies will be tabled in the next phase. With the bill now headed for full Senate debate, the next week will be crucial. Lawmakers are expected to hash out potential amendments addressing: Conflicts of interest, Political beneficiary disclosures, More stringent AML/KYC requirements, Issuer transparency obligations, Guardrails against market manipulation. If the GENIUS Act survives the Senate in its current or amended form, it will head to the House of Representatives for final reconciliation, likely merging with the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, championed by former Representative Patrick McHenry. A Global Race for Stablecoin Leadership The GENIUS Act comes as stablecoins increasingly emerge as the backbone of the digital financial system. With countries like Japan, the UK, and the EU launching or regulating fiat-pegged digital currencies, the US is under mounting pressure to deliver its own rules of the road. A growing number of central banks and policymakers now recognize that stablecoins could either reinforce the dollar’s global dominance or, if left unchecked, open the door for foreign-controlled digital assets to bypass traditional financial oversight. Tether Surpasses Germany in US Treasury Holdings, Cementing Role as Global Dollar Liquidity Distributor In other stablecoin news, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USD₮ (USDT), has officially surpassed Germany in holdings of United States Treasury bills. According to data published by the US Department of the Treasury and confirmed in Tether’s Q1 2025 attestation report, the stablecoin giant now holds over $120 billion in US Treasurys, compared to Germany’s $111.4 billion. This vaults Tether into the 19th position globally among all countries and sovereign wealth entities in terms of US government debt ownership, ahead of nations like Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, and Norway. From Crypto Issuer to Global Bondholder Tether’s evolution from a crypto startup to a heavyweight in global finance has stunned skeptics and analysts alike. What began as a niche stablecoin issuer in 2014 has now become a central liquidity distributor for the US dollar, with significant influence not only in digital markets but in global monetary flows. “This milestone not only reinforces the company’s conservative reserve management strategy,” Tether stated in its Q1 report, “but also highlights Tether’s growing role in distributing dollar-denominated liquidity at scale.” Tether was the 7th largest US Treasuries holder in 2024 (Source: X ) Tether’s holdings are primarily in short-dated US Treasury bills, one of the safest and most liquid financial instruments in the world. These holdings serve as the backing reserves for its $151 billion supply of USD₮, helping to maintain its peg to the US dollar and instill confidence in users. The attestation report, which details the firm’s asset mix and profits for Q1 2025, revealed that Tether generated over $1 billion in operating profit during the first three months of the year. The firm credited this performance to strong returns from its Treasury holdings and its gold reserves, both of which helped offset turbulence in crypto markets. Gold in particular was cited as a key stabilizing factor. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies suffered pullbacks during Q1, gold’s performance in Tether’s portfolio “almost offset” the downturn, the report noted. Global Implications of Tether’s T-Bill Holdings Tether’s rise into the ranks of top US Treasury holders also has geopolitical implications. As stablecoins grow in cross-border adoption, particularly in emerging markets where inflation is rampant, Tether’s USD₮ often acts as a proxy for the dollar itself, enabling users to bypass capital controls and currency instability. Looking ahead, Tether is expected to continue building its traditional asset portfolio, while exploring expansion into tokenized government securities, private lending, and even central bank partnerships in frontier markets. Its Q1 report hints at ongoing dialogue with several jurisdictions interested in using stablecoins for real-time settlement and international remittances. Meanwhile, market analysts say that the firm’s transparency practices remain under intense scrutiny. While Tether has improved its reporting and introduced quarterly attestations, critics argue that nothing short of a full audit by a Big Four accounting firm will suffice to satisfy regulators and institutional investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-20 05:30:00

Nate Geraci , president of the ETF Store and cofounder of the ETF Institute, believes this futures milestone could be the springboard XRP needs to secure an exchange-traded fund. Meanwhile Ripple vs SEC case has also struck in technical glitch creating clouds of confusion on XRP’s ETF prospects. Will XRP make it this time? Institutional Adoption Gets a Boost In a positive move, CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) has added XRP to its list of official crypto products, which shows that big financial players are becoming more confident in XRP. They’ve launched XRP futures contracts, a type of investment that lets people bet on XRP’s future price without actually owning the coins. These contracts are cash-settled, so when they end, investors get paid in dollars, not XRP. This setup makes it easier and safer for big institutions, like banks and hedge funds, to get involved with XRP in a regulated way. Also, the contracts have been approved by the CFTC, a U.S. regulator, which adds trust and makes it more appealing to serious investors. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse , said this is a big moment for XRP and the broader market. He mentioned that Hidden Road, a trading firm, made the first big trade on CME, and he called it an important step in XRP’s growth . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Set to Benefit as GENIUS Act Passes Key Senate Vote on Stablecoins , XRP ETF Hopes Rise Following the futures launch, Geraci predicted that an XRP ETF could be next. His optimism isn’t unfounded. A decision on the proposed Franklin XRP Fund , a spot ETF, is due from the SEC on June 17, 2025. If approved, it would open the door for even broader investor access, similar to how Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have brought in institutional capital and increased legitimacy. Adding weight to the argument is a 2023 ruling by the DC Circuit Court that criticized the SEC for denying Grayscale’s Bitcoin spot ETF while allowing futures-based ones. The court emphasized that if a crypto asset has an active CME futures market, it’s hard to justify blocking a spot ETF. XRP now fits that profile. XRP Price Analysis Despite the positive headlines, XRP’s price has shown little movement in the short term. It’s currently down 0.77% over the past 24 hours but has seen a 63.87% spike in trading volume, signaling heightened interest. As of now, XRP trades at $2.37. While XRP trades sideways, many believe the groundwork is being laid for a bigger run, especially if the ETF dream becomes a reality. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The announcement on Monday (which emphasized plans rather than executed actions) helped push DigiAsia’s shares up 91% during regular trading to 36 cents, before pulling back 22% after hours. The stock is still down more than 50% year-to-date. The company said its board had approved a strategy to allocate up to 50% of future net profits toward BTC purchases and was “actively exploring” a capital raise of up to $100 million, according to a press release. It also plans to pursue yield-generating strategies on its bitcoin holdings, including institutional lending and staking through regulated partners. “We believe bitcoin represents a compelling long-term investment and a foundational layer for modern treasury diversification,” said Prashant Gokarn, Co-CEO of DigiAsia, in the release. The firm added that it was evaluating financing methods such as convertible notes and crypto-linked instruments to support the initiative. In an April update , DigiAsia reported $101 million in revenue for 2024, with projected earnings before interest and taxes of $12 million this year.

We’re not going to custody it,” Dimon told investors . “We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” CEO Dimon has been a Bitcoin critic , comparing the world’s largest crypto to smoking. He previously claimed that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and is often misused by bad actors. During the World Economic Forum in Davos, 2024, he told CNBC that Bitcoin “does nothing,” calling it the pet rock and “hyped-up fraud.” However, on Sunday, he made it clear that his personal view on Bitcoin remains unchanged. He highlighted the crypto’s lack of ownership and issues such as its use in money laundering, terrorism and sex trafficking. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” JPMorgan CEO said. “I defend your right to buy bitcoin.” “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” – Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO https://t.co/zc8CjKdAb9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 19, 2025 The development follows a similar move by Morgan Stanley, which began allowing financial advisors to pitch spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to eligible clients. JPMorgan Reportedly Plans to Offer Bitcoin ETF Access A source close to the matter told CNBC that the bank is looking for ways to provide clients access to bitcoin ETFs. JPMorgan has so far limited its crypto exposure to offering futures and not direct Bitcoin ownership. This comes at a time when there is a major shift in the regulatory landscape under the pro-crypto Trump administration. The SEC, led by Gary Gensler, launched several legal battles against a string of crypto firms. The new wave of institutional adoption led by leading fintechs and banks comes as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) provided new guidance. The agency said that FDIC-supervised institutions can engage in crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval, provided they manage risks. Dimon Downplays Blockchain’s Importance In his speech, JPMorgan CEO Dimon pushed back the hype around blockchain tech, calling it less important than it is made to be. “We have been talking about blockchain for 12 to 15 years,” Dimon told investors. “We spend too much on it. It doesn’t matter as much as you all think.” In the past, he took a more positive view of blockchain technology , recognizing its practical uses. JPMorgan has been actively embracing the nascent tech for various projects, including its blockchain-based JPM Coin. Further, Kinexys, JPMorgan’s own blockchain platform, ran the first test transaction recently, settling a tokenized U.S. Treasury transaction on Ondo Chain’s testnet.

The downgrade triggered a broad market sell-off and raised alarms about the U.S. economy’s long-term stability, but it also reignited a long-standing warning from financial author Robert Kiyosaki, who sees this as the beginning of something far deeper and more dangerous. Markets Rattle as Moody’s Slashes U.S. Credit Rating Moody’s, the last of the major rating agencies to act, cut the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing ballooning deficits and rising interest costs that threaten America’s ability to manage its debt. Investors reacted swiftly: Nasdaq-100 futures plunged 1.6%, S&P 500 dropped 1.2%, and Dow futures fell 0.8%. At the same time, bond yields surged, with the 30-year Treasury piercing the 5% mark for the first time in years, a clear sign of investor nervousness about lending to the U.S. This came on the heels of one of Wall Street’s strongest weeks in months, where easing U.S.-China tensions had sent tech stocks soaring. But those gains now appear fragile as financial markets brace for the ripple effects of America’s downgraded fiscal image. Robert Kiyosaki’s Stark Warning: ‘Deadbeat Dad’ America Author and financial educator Robert Kiyosaki responded strongly to the news. He compared the U.S. to a “deadbeat dad” borrowing recklessly with no plan to pay it back. He warned that this downgrade will likely lead to higher interest rates, triggering a recession, rising unemployment, potential bank failures, and possibly a crash reminiscent of the Great Depression of 1929 . Kiyosaki said he foresaw this scenario in his 2013 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy and has long urged people to escape the trap of job security. Instead, he advises embracing entrepreneurship, investing in cash-flowing real estate during downturns, and saving real assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. “A depression can be the best time to become rich,” he wrote, encouraging people to think like entrepreneurs, not employees clinging to a steady paycheck and a shrinking 401k. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: U.S. Senate Moves GENIUS Act Forward with 66-32 Vote , It’s all Politics…. I think the main reason the markets did not react more sharply to the Moody's downgrade is that it's obvious the U.S. government will never honestly repay its debts. Default or inflation is inevitable. Credit ratings are basically irrelevant. They reflect politics, not economics. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 19, 2025 On the other side, Peter Schiff dismissed Moody’s downgrade as largely irrelevant, saying markets didn’t react strongly because it’s already clear the U.S. can’t repay its debts. He warned that default or inflation is inevitable and argued that credit ratings are political, not economic. Crisis = Opportunity With Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week, investors will be closely watching for signals on how policymakers interpret the downgrade and its potential influence on interest rate decisions. For Kiyosaki, however, the message is already clear for those who prepare wisely, with real assets and an entrepreneurial mindset, may turn crisis into opportunity. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The launch of regulated XRP Futures on @CMEGroup marks a key institutional milestone for XRP…and very excited to report that Hidden Road cleared the first block trade on CME at the opening! https://t.co/Njj8AUSY5K — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 Details of the CME XRP Futures Launch Launching these regulated futures contracts represents a significant development in XRP’s market evolution. On May 19, 2025, CME Group introduced cash-settled XRP futures , available in contract sizes of 2,500 and 50,000 tokens, both settled in U.S. dollars. These instruments are based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which provides a transparent and standardized pricing mechanism. The new futures are designed to meet growing institutional demand for access to XRP exposure without requiring direct custody of the underlying asset. Regulatory Clarity and Market Confidence According to Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Crypto Products at CME, the move to list XRP futures reflects increased market interest and confidence following recent regulatory clarity. He noted that CME doesn’t launch futures for assets without regulatory clarity, and this launch further reinforces XRP’s status as a commodity and not a security. XRP is also among the top traded cryptocurrencies in the market, making it a logical addition to CME’s expanding suite of crypto derivatives. Implications for Institutional Adoption and ETFs Market analysts have linked the XRP Futures to broader institutional acceptance. A popular crypto analyst recently stated that listing XRP on CME lays essential groundwork for potential future products such as a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). While he cautioned against expecting immediate price rallies, he emphasized that the regulated futures contracts open the door to new forms of liquidity and participation by traditional financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Significance of the First Block Trade The clearing of the first block trade by Hidden Road holds symbolic importance, as Ripple recently acquired the global prime broker . This move shows Ripple’s commitment to expanding its institutional reach and infrastructure. The fact that the first such trade on CME occurred through Hidden Road also highlights Ripple’s active role in facilitating institutional engagement with XRP futures from the outset. Looking Ahead As CME’s XRP futures contracts gain traction, their performance will offer insight into the depth of institutional demand for regulated XRP-related products and set the stage for spot XRP ETFs . While long-term effects cannot be determined, the launch marks a new phase in XRP’s integration into regulated financial markets.

The announcement, shared on a May 19 filing , indicates that the agency will “institute proceedings” to assess whether the ETF proposals meet regulatory standards. This procedural move allows the SEC to extend the review period and open a public comment window. The agency stressed that the institution of proceedings “does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions” on the filings. Instead, the SEC says it needs more time to examine the proposals under the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, particularly provisions related to fraud prevention and investor protection. Among the delayed filings is the Bitwise Solana ( SOL ) ETF, which was first submitted in January through Cboe’s BZX Exchange. Bitwise’s fund would hold SOL directly, with prices tracked against the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate. Similarly, 21Shares, already known for its spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs, filed its own Solana proposal earlier this year. You might also like: 72 crypto ETFs are awaiting SEC approval, from altcoins to memecoins Despite growing demand, no altcoin ETFs linked to Solana have been authorized in the U.S. to date. The SEC’s cautious approach to growing crypto-based investment products, particularly for assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum, is reflected in the delays. The SEC is assessing whether the proposals comply with Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), which requires that listed products be made to “protect investors and the public interest” and “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” according to the filing. The delay also comes amid a wider regulatory bottleneck for digital asset ETFs. Several filings for additional cryptocurrency ETFs, including those for Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and XRP ( XRP ), are still being examined. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF analysts, remain hopeful. They estimate a 90% chance of approval for Solana and Litecoin ETFs by late 2025, citing favorable commodity classifications and rising institutional demand. But the future is still unclear. Investors may be left in limbo if the SEC’s request for public input causes the timeline to be further extended.

According to a May 20 report by Bloomberg Law, Genesis accuses DCG and insiders of “self-dealing, fraud, and mismanagement,” claiming they funneled funds to themselves through reckless lending practices and deceptive financial disclosures. The complaint, partially redacted, seeks the return of 1 million digital assets worth approximately $2.1 billion to repay creditors. The Delaware suit alleges DCG and its affiliates, including Grayscale Investments, enriched themselves at the expense of Genesis customers by misleading the market about the lender’s financial health. In a separate lawsuit filed the same day in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Genesis seeks to claw back over $1 billion in transfers made in the year leading up to its bankruptcy in January 2023. These include $448 million to DCG, $136 million to DCG International, and $101 million to HQ Enhanced Yield Fund, among others. Genesis also wants to recover $34 million in tax-related payments it says were fraudulent.

According to reports, Genesis was already insolvent by the end of 2021 and owed $14 billion in unpaid loans. The legal team for Genesis argues that DCG insiders knew about the lender’s growing risks but did nothing about them. To protect DCG from Genesis’ financial consequences, they allegedly transferred assets internally instead. Genesis filed for Chapter 11 protection in January 2023 and completed its restructuring in August 2024, distributing roughly $4 billion in cash and crypto to creditors. That plan, which DCG opposed , included a $2.2 billion payout to Gemini Earn users and uncapped recoveries based on current asset prices. Both lawsuits seek to hold DCG responsible for its alleged involvement in Genesis’ demise and boost creditor recoveries.

MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGAFINANCE) — The Breakout Presale with 20x–35x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the top early-stage altcoins of 2025 — with many analysts calling it a rare opportunity for 20x–35x returns before listings begin . Currently nearing the start of Stage 9 , MAGA has a fixed listing target of $0.007 , a clear value proposition, and momentum that’s attracting investors rotating out of larger caps. Unlike meme coins with undefined roadmaps, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines political branding with structured tokenomics — and that’s why it’s taking the lead in May’s top altcoin rankings. 2. XRP (XRP) — Utility, Legal Clarity, and Institutional Momentum XRP is staging one of the strongest comebacks in crypto history. With full legal clarity in the U.S. and a CME futures launch on the horizon , it is being positioned as the primary settlement and liquidity token for global financial institutions . 3. Solana (SOL) — The Top Performing Layer-1 This Cycle Solana continues to hold its place as the fastest and most scalable Layer-1 blockchain . With active developer support and massive growth in DeFi, Solana is delivering both speed and reliability — two essentials as blockchain use cases expand. Now trading in the $170–$180 range, SOL is projected to hit $250–$400 , with further upside possible if Layer-1 capital rotation continues. It’s a staple for infrastructure-focused investors. 4. Cosmos (ATOM) — A Core Layer-0 Bet for Multichain Scalability Cosmos (ATOM) is often overlooked — but it’s quietly building the foundation for a multichain Web3 ecosystem . Its app-chain model is attracting developers who want modular, sovereign chain designs that still talk to the broader blockchain universe. With price currently between $4.00–$4.75 , ATOM is considered a mid-to-late cycle mover , and could deliver 5x–10x returns as adoption catches up with its tech. Conclusion If you’re building a serious altcoin portfolio for May 2025, this is the shortlist that analysts agree offers the best mix of early-stage upside and ecosystem strength: MAGACOIN FINANCE for raw ROI potential before listings XRP for cross-border payment dominance Solana for infrastructure and scalability Cosmos for multichain network architecture All four are on track to deliver 20x gains or more as the next wave of capital hits the market — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that charge .

Whale wallets tied to Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP are now being tracked building early positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE — a fast-moving altcoin currently in Stage 8 with bold upside forecasts from analysts. This move signals more than speculation — it reflects a growing belief that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the cycle’s biggest ROI entries, with some projections stretching as far as 20,000% before listings. Bitcoin (BTC): Leading the Macro Rally Bitcoin is holding firmly above $105,000 , reinforcing its role as the macro driver of the current cycle. Institutional inflows are continuing through ETF channels, and analysts still target $220K–$250K levels by year-end. With BTC stabilizing, capital is beginning to rotate toward higher-upside, earlier-stage altcoins — exactly where MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned now.

XRP: Futures Launch Brings New Visibility XRP remains one of the most discussed large-cap plays of the year. With CME XRP Futures launching on May 19 , institutional access is about to expand — and price targets between $5–$10+ are gaining credibility among long-term holders. As the asset gains traction, whale wallets are beginning to diversify — and data shows MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the top destinations for that liquidity. Polkadot (DOT): Expanding Use Case, Quiet Accumulation Polkadot continues to deliver on interoperability and cross-chain infrastructure, and while price action has remained subdued, large DOT holders are watching the meme and momentum sectors closely. Several DOT-linked addresses have recently initiated new entries into MAGACOIN FINANCE, following the broader whale rotation already seen from BTC and ETH. Ethereum (ETH): Foundation Strong, Capital Diversifying Ethereum continues to build strength above $2,600, with optimism surrounding spot ETF approval , on-chain development, and Layer-2 expansion. Still, large ETH holders are beginning to seek early-stage exposure — and MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly risen to the top of their radar. Whale activity shows this isn’t a casual watch — it’s active accumulation. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Final Thoughts Bitcoin is leading the macro trend. Ethereum and XRP are fueling the rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE is where smart capital is landing. With Stage 8 live, whales accumulating, and massive upside projections gaining traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the strategic entry traders are prioritizing ahead of listing events.

As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,153, representing a 1% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite this dip, the asset remains in a strong position overall, having posted significant gains over the past several weeks and retaining proximity to its all-time high levels. This price action follows a brief consolidation phase late last week, during which Bitcoin paused after climbing above $104,000. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain recently shared his interpretation of the trend based on derivatives and spot market data. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Whales About to Cash Out? Key Metric Signals Possible Profit-Taking Ahead Market Buy Volume and Funding Rates Show a Shift in Rally Behavior In his recent analysis, “Bitcoin’s Rebound Without Overheating Is a Clear Sign of a Healthy Bull Market,” Avocado Onchain pointed to a shift in Bitcoin’s behavior around key price milestones. In previous breakout attempts, he noted that Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs was often accompanied by a sharp rise in Binance’s market buy volume and funding rates, both of which signaled overheated conditions. These conditions typically resulted in short-term corrections, as traders locked in profits and leverage unwound. However, the analyst observed that the current rebound is unfolding differently. Funding rates on Binance remain stable, and market buy volume is trending downward, which Avocado interprets as a sign of restraint rather than weakness. He argued that, unlike the sharp speculative rallies seen in prior phases, the present environment reflects cautious optimism and sustained accumulation. According to him, this more tempered recovery could be less vulnerable to abrupt pullbacks and instead support a more stable path to potential new highs. 📋 과열 없는 비트코인 반등, 건강한 강세장의 신호(Bitcoin’s Rebound Without Overheating Is a Clear Sign of a Healthy Bull Market) 이번 시즌 비트코인 가격이 신고가를 갱신할 때마다 바이낸스 시장가 매수 거래량과 펀딩비는 크게 상승하였고, 그 후 과열로 인한 조정기간이 찾아오는 유사한… pic.twitter.com/c0JCPzgbfY — Avocado (@avocado_onchain) May 19, 2025 Bitcoin On-Chain Trends Point to Continued Accumulation Avocado further emphasized that although buying activity is not surging at the same rate as in prior runs, the overall trend in market buy volume has been gradually increasing since 2023. He referred to on-chain data that shows a consistent uptrend, suggesting that longer-term investor appetite remains intact. With sentiment still recovering from recent corrections and derivatives markets appearing less overheated, he suggested the market structure is favorable for additional upward momentum in the near to mid-term.

Herro and Folkman, previously running the now-defunct Dough Finance, had quietly abandoned hundreds of investors who lost millions in the collapse, and re-emerged with World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that now flows money straight into the Trump family’s pockets. According to Reuters , Jonathan Lopez, a 31-year-old crypto trader and motivational speaker from Miami, invested $1 million in Dough in May 2024. He was introduced to high-risk strategies like “looping,” which lets users borrow against crypto assets repeatedly. Herro guided him through it personally, telling him, “We get reward(s) for the risks we take. Lfg.” Then on July 12, everything was gone. Lopez’s funds and over $2.5 million in total were drained in a hack that Dough later admitted was caused by vulnerabilities in its own code. Herro promised to fix Dough while planning World Liberty with Trump In the aftermath of the breach, Herro texted Lopez saying, “I said we’d take care of it,” and claimed the team needed the weekend to sort things out. Folkman told users in Dough’s Telegram group that “We will not stop until everyone is made whole.” But by August 18, both founders went silent. Dough’s Telegram and X accounts were abandoned, and one private chat group was deleted entirely, according to former members. While investors waited, Herro and Folkman were already building World Liberty. They were introduced to Trump, Don Jr., and Eric Trump through presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, and the Trump family quickly jumped in. Trump took the title “Chief Crypto Advocate,” while his sons were labeled “Web3 Ambassadors.” None of them commented on the Dough scandal. When asked about Herro and Folkman’s roles, Eric Trump replied in an email, “They have overachieved our wildest goals and our current trajectory is nothing short of incredible.” The new venture has already pushed over $550 million worth of tokens. Of that, Herro and Folkman collected at least $65 million, while the Trump family reportedly received around $400 million. That money flowed even as former Dough users struggled to recover their losses. Lopez filed a lawsuit while Trump’s partners partied in DC In January 2025, Lopez sued Herro in Miami federal court, alleging fraud, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and securities violations. His attorney, Joseph Pardo, said Lopez invested based on promises Herro made about Dough’s safety and performance. Herro’s legal team responded by calling Lopez a “sophisticated” investor who should have understood the risks, and claimed the hack was outside Herro’s control. A trial is scheduled for April 2026. Before Dough collapsed, Herro called himself “the dirtbag of the internet” in a recorded pitch to investors, bragging, “I do what’s legal… besides that I don’t give a fuck.” Folkman’s earlier project was “Date Hotter Girls,” a site offering dating advice. Despite that track record, their new partnership with Trump has drawn little public scrutiny. Meanwhile, the Dough website is now locked and nearly empty, as tracked by DeFiLlama. In July, the company said $281,000 of the stolen assets had been recovered with help from security group SEAL 911, and promised pro-rata payouts. In September, data from CertiK showed that only $180,000 was sent to 134 wallets. Eight Dough users interviewed said they received nothing and didn’t know how payouts were selected. The legal challenges are stacking. Jonathan Cogan, attorney at Kobre & Kim, explained that most victims file negligence claims because they’re easier to prove than fraud. Joseph Cioffi, a partner at Davis+Gilbert, said promises to “make users whole” aren’t legally binding without a formal agreement. And Dough’s disclaimers–calling their tech “novel, experimental, and speculative”–don’t necessarily shield them from liability. On January 20, as Herro and Folkman’s victims waited for answers, the pair were seen in Washington, DC, celebrating at a black-tie inaugural ball for Trump’s return to the White House.

The survey of 3,345 respondents asked: “Assuming the United States was thinking of converting some of their gold reserve into Bitcoin, what percentage would you advise they convert?” The majority of respondents wanted between 1% and 30% converted, it revealed. 4 in 5 Americans want some US gold reserves converted to bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/ibxXfe04g5 — The Nakamoto Project (@NakamotoProjct) May 19, 2025 Lots of Skepticism Project co-founder Troy Cross said many were skeptical of the findings, suggesting that only Bitcoiners were surveyed. “We were also surprised too. But the results are the results. When given a slider and asked to advise the US government on the right proportion of Bitcoin and gold, subjects were very reluctant to put that slider on 0% Bitcoin and 100% gold. Instead, they settled around 10% Bitcoin,” he explained. The recommended proportions of BTC dropped significantly with age, which was not surprising given the inverse relationship the organization found in a previous survey between age and Bitcoin ownership. Satoshi Action Fund co-founder Dennis Porter said he didn’t believe it at first, adding that: “Americans just don’t care about gold that much, and most people are inclined towards diversification when given the choice.” The survey, which ran between February and mid-March, was conducted online, and participants were paid. However, the survey and data collection company Qualtrics was asked to match the US Census distribution in terms of age, gender, race, income, education, and geography as closely as possible, he added. The study also revealed that around 66% of respondents were neutral-to-positive about Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Uncle Sam also holds around 207,189 BTC worth around $22 billion, less than 3% of its gold reserves, according to BiTBO, so there is plenty of room for diversification. White House adviser Bo Hines has floated a new strategy that the Treasury might start buying Bitcoin using profits from its gold reserves. This plan, if enacted, could lead to the purchase of up to 1 million BTC over five years. He referenced Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025, stating in March, “If we actually realize the gains on these [gold certificate holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested matching the country’s gold reserves with Bitcoin in July.

The token remained consolidated within a narrow range for a long time, which helped the bulls to accumulate strength. As a result, the price attracted more than 20% gains while the buying volume increased by over 50%. With this, the price is slowly approaching the crucial threshold, which may not only form a new ATH but could also mark a 4-digit figure. Aave has been showing strong momentum driven by whale inflows and institutional interest. The price is nearing the monthly highs as bullish sentiment takes over the markets along with the backing received for AAVE as the core of DeFi’s infrastructure. With this, AAVE records a new Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $24 billion, which is also the new all-time high for the platform The DeFi lending protocol seems to be on fire, which flashes massive bullish signals for the future of decentralized finance. The AAVE price, which has been trading pretty strongly since the bounce from the lows close to $100, seems to be looking forward to a proper HTF bullish breakout from the structure. With this, the token displays the possibility of ranging beyond the final resistance below the ATH. The historical chart of AAVE suggests the price broke down from the rising wedge after accomplishing the parabolic recovery curve. Despite the drop in volume, the price rebounded from the local lows and surged by over 130%. With this, the technicals like MACD & RSI have turned bullish in the form of a bullish crossover and a u-shaped recovery. Hence, if the AAVE manages to rise and secure the resistance at $280, a monthly close above $300 could be imminent. In a wider perspective, the AAVE price is undergoing a V-shaped, steep recovery, and hence it is expected to reach the neckline between $422 and $443. A breakout above the range is believed to initiate a fresh upswing, which could push the price into a discovery phase and mark a new ATH, probably close to $1000.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,AAVE|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 06:14:06

The Jakarta-based firm revealed that its board has approved the creation of a Bitcoin treasury reserve . DigiAsia says it intends to allocate up to 50% of its net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how it plans to manage its capital amid growing corporate interest in digital assets. DigiAsia Eyes $100M Raise to Fuel Bitcoin Treasury Plan In addition to deploying profits into Bitcoin, DigiAsia is actively exploring a capital raise of up to $100 million to kickstart its holdings. The firm noted that it is in talks with regulated partners to develop yield-generating strategies for its Bitcoin, including lending and staking. DigiAsia is also weighing the issuance of convertible notes and crypto-linked financial instruments to support its treasury initiative. The company’s stock, which trades under the ticker FAAS, closed Monday at $0.36—a gain of more than 91% on the day. However, after-hours trading saw a sharp pullback, with shares slipping to $0.28. Despite the recent rally, DigiAsia stock is down nearly 53% year-to-date, after peaking near $12 in March. In its April financial update, DigiAsia reported a 36% increase in annual revenue, reaching $101 million in 2024. It projects revenues of $125 million for 2025, alongside expected earnings before interest and taxes of $12 million. DigiAsia joins a growing list of firms moving Bitcoin onto their balance sheets. Companies such as MicroStrategy, which holds over 576,000 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion, have led the way.

Collectively, corporate treasuries now hold over three million BTC, valued at more than $340 billion, according to data from Bitbo. Industry figures like Blockstream CEO Adam Back argue this trend is accelerating Bitcoin adoption and could propel its market capitalization to $200 trillion in the coming decade. For now, Bitcoin’s market cap hovers around $2 trillion, with the asset trading at $105,642, up 2% in the last 24 hours. Public Companies Increase Bitcoin Exposure Public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, leading the charge. The Virginia-based company recently announced it would double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion in order to acquire more Bitcoin. This includes plans to sell an additional $21 billion in common stock, following the full utilization of a prior program approved in October. In addition to equity sales, Strategy has also expanded its debt issuance target from $21 billion to $42 billion, with $14.6 billion still available under the current authorization. This trend reflects a broader institutional interest in Bitcoin. During the first quarter of the year, publicly listed firms collectively grew their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% , indicating continued confidence in the asset despite persistent market volatility.

This latest analysis, shared publicly through a tweet on May 18, 2025, presents two structured paths, highlighting bullish projections for XRP’s price in the medium to long term. #XRP Color Code Upgraded Version 2.0 (Target: $8-$13 / $18-$27): Many of you remember how many times I updated the #XRP Color Code Chart, and after many moons, I was 100% correct—the breakout was successful! Just check the previous links for reference: 1⃣ Color… pic.twitter.com/XNHleWevlB — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 18, 2025 The Color Code chart, which has become a cornerstone of Egrag Crypto’s XRP analysis, is characterized by distinct colored zones: green for bullish price zones, blue for supply zones, yellow for ranging periods, orange for accumulation, and red for demand zones or “Red Flag” areas. According to Egrag, the breakout from the accumulation and ranging zones has occurred successfully, validating the previous Color Code analysis. He claims the structure was repeatedly revised over time and has proved correct. Scenario One: The $8–$13 Price Target In Version 2.0, two major potential wave structures are outlined. The first structure begins with Wave 1 starting in January 2023. This upward impulse concluded with Wave 2 on July 4, 2024, a date Egrag emphasizes due to its significance as U.S. Independence Day. According to the chart, Wave 3, typically the strongest in Elliott Wave theory, ended around January 16, 2025. The correction that followed, Wave 4, is identified as having likely concluded on April 6, 2025. Egrag states that XRP is now in the early phase of Wave 5, which has begun with a sub-wave 1, indicating the start of another bullish leg. In this scenario, the target range for XRP lies between $8 and $13. These price points correspond to various Fibonacci levels highlighted in the chart. Notably, the 2.0 Fibonacci level is around $7.15, 2.272 at approximately $8.75, and the 2.618 level near $11.32. According to the Color Code model, these zones fall within the broader green area on the chart, signaling strong bullish sentiment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Scenario Two: Long-Term Projection to $27 The second wave structure is a more extended and aggressive bullish projection. Here, Wave 1 is set to begin on July 4, 2024, and Wave 2 is considered to have potentially ended around April 6, 2025. The upcoming Wave 3, which Egrag describes as potentially producing a “blow-off top” or highly impulsive move, is expected to unfold during the summer months, likely peaking around September 2025. A corrective Wave 4 is forecasted to occur in the fourth quarter of 2025. The final Wave 5, described as the strongest cycle, is projected to push XRP toward the $27 price level by the first quarter of 2026. Both scenarios incorporate key Fibonacci extensions, with 3.272 marked at approximately $18.41 and 3.888 reaching as high as $29.10. These targets reflect the full potential of the long-term bullish wave structure if XRP continues to follow the Elliott Wave model presented in the charts. Community Input and Final Observations In his closing remarks, Egrag asks his audience which of the two scenarios they consider more likely, suggesting flexibility in interpreting market developments.

Dogecoin’s daily active addresses have skyrocketed from 45,000 to over 680,000 in days, yet its price lingers at $0.22. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing crowds in its presale phase 4, raising $8,900,000 with over 500 million tokens sold to 10,700 holders. The current price of $0.025, up from $0.01 in the first phase, reflects strong demand. As phase 4 nears 95% sold, investors are racing against a 20% price hike to $0.03 in phase 5. This frenzy underscores why these cryptos are among the best to buy now. Dogecoin’s Network Surge Falls Flat Dogecoin (DOGE) is experiencing a whirlwind of on-chain activity. Active addresses have soared fifteenfold, hinting at robust user engagement. Typically, such spikes fuel crypto prices, but Dogecoin remains stuck at $0.22, unable to breach the $0.24 resistance. This disconnect raises eyebrows in the crypto market. Are whales accumulating for a breakout, or is this just fleeting hype? The Long/Short Ratio on Binance, now above 3.0, reveals traders’ bullish bets. Yet, this optimism carries risks. Overcrowded long positions could trigger forced selling if prices falter. Technical indicators offer mixed signals. The 20-day moving average provides support, but the Relative Strength Index at 61 shows waning momentum. Dogecoin’s path forward depends on sustained buyer conviction, making it a risky top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Ignites FOMO Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is commanding attention in its phase 4 presale, priced at $0.025. With 95% of tokens sold, urgency is palpable. The project has raised $8,900,000, distributing over 500 million tokens to 10,700 holders since the presale began. Phase 4’s end looms, with phase 5 set to lift prices 20% to $0.03, offering current investors an instant gain. This structured tokenomics ensures a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50 in 2025, delivering a 9,900% ROI. The team is finalizing a Certik smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social platforms, boosting trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a top cryptocurrency for investors seeking high-yield DeFi opportunities. Innovative Lending Drives Mutuum’s Appeal Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its lending model. Users deposit assets like ETH to earn mtTokens, which accrue interest over time. Borrowers secure loans with overcollateralized assets, ensuring stability. This system contrasts with Dogecoin’s reliance on market sentiment. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. This gamified loyalty system sparks competition, driving demand. The buy-and-distribute mechanism uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates constant buy pressure, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a best crypto to invest in for long-term gains. As phase 4 sells out, investors are scrambling to join this new crypto coin before prices climb. Racing Against the Clock Whale activity is lighting up Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), but their paths diverge sharply. Dogecoin’s network surge lacks price follow-through, leaving investors cautious about its next move. Its speculative nature makes it a gamble among top cryptocurrencies. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a calculated entry into DeFi. With phase 4 at $0.025 and 95% sold, the 20% jump to $0.03 in phase 5 looms. The 140% listing return and potential 9,900% ROI at $2.50 in 2025 position it as a best crypto to buy. Investors eyeing the next big cryptocurrency should act fast.

In the last 24 hours, ETH has jumped 8% , climbing above $2,540 and pushing its market cap to $307 billion. This sharp move comes as ETH supply on exchanges has dropped to just 4.9%, the lowest in its 10-year history. With fewer coins available to sell, many believe a supply squeeze is kicking in. Some crypto experts say this growing scarcity could help push Ethereum to $5,000. Let’s break it down. Ethereum Hits Record-Low Exchange Supply According to new data, Ethereum’s exchange supply has dropped to an all-time low of just 4.9%, the lowest level in its 10-year history. For context, this means that out of all the ETH in circulation, less than 5% is sitting on trading platforms. Meanwhile, over the past five years, 15.3 million Ethereum have been moved off exchanges. These coins didn’t disappear, they’ve likely been transferred to cold wallets, long-term holdings, and institutional custody. LOOK: Ethereum supply on exchanges just hit ALL-TIME LOW of 4.9% in its 10-year history, while Bitcoin's exchange supply dropped to lowest level since 2018 (7.1%)! What happens next is simple economics: 1) 1.7M $BTC & 15.3M $ETH moved OFF exchanges in 5 years 2)… pic.twitter.com/Ji3dBEbfBV — CryptoBusy (@CryptoBusy) May 20, 2025 Combining that with a fresh wave of institutional demands in Ethereum ETFs. Suddenly, we’re looking at a classic case of low supply and rising demand. Bitcoin Not Far Behind Bitcoin is showing a similar trend. Only 7.1% of the BTC supply now sits on exchanges, the lowest level since November 2018. History shows that every major bull run in crypto has been preceded by this kind of supply squeeze. The last time Bitcoin’s exchange supply was this low, it surged nearly 20x over the next couple of years. ETH Eyeing a Bigger Rally Looking at the Ethereum price, it has jumped 8% in the past 24 hours, rising from $2,346 to around $2,537. This recovery follows change in leadership at the Ethereum Foundation, where Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak were named Co-Executive Directors, along with a new President. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Crypto Patel highlighted a “Golden Cross” pattern on ETH’s 1-day chart often a sign of a strong rally ahead. He predicts ETH could soon aim for $4000 to $5,000 if this trend continues.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 07:30:03

A Notable Amount Of Bitcoin Has Cost Basis At $106,600 In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about the Bitcoin Cost Basis Distribution for the levels nearby to the current spot price. The “Cost Basis Distribution” (CBD) here refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us about how much of the asset’s supply was purchased at what price levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $103,000 Relatively Cool Per This Indicator, Quant Says Below is the CBD chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the data related to price levels above $101,500. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin price levels near to the all-time high (ATH) aren’t too dense with supply, meaning that not a lot of buying took place there and many investors who did buy there already capitulated. A level that immediately stands out, however, is $106,600, where holders last purchased around 31,000 BTC. According to Glassnode, this particular supply cluster originated on the 16th of December. The owners of these tokens have held tight through all the volatility that has emerged since then. Generally, large supply walls that are situated at levels higher than the spot price can act as probable points of resistance in the near future, as underwater investors can be desperate for the asset to return to their break-even level so that they can just exit with all their capital back. From the chart, it’s apparent that Bitcoin’s sharp burst of bullish momentum earlier had its price close in on this level and it did find a rejection around there. The source of the resistance wasn’t selling from the underwater holders who purchased at $106,600, however, as the supply cluster is still holding strong. It would appear that the owners of these tokens may be quite the resolute hands, as they are still waiting patiently even though the cryptocurrency is offering them an opportunity to sell. The analytics firm has noted that this could make the level an important one to watch in the short term.

However, a large amount of Pi Coins is being moved between wallets and exchanges. Here’s what’s happening. Recently, about 14 million Pi tokens were moved from an exchange into Pi wallets. This usually means that some big investors or holders are taking their Pi off the market to hold onto it safely, which often shows they believe in Pi’s future.

The poll, conducted by the Nakamoto Project—a nonprofit focused on Bitcoin education and advocacy—surveyed 3,345 Americans online between February and mid-March 2025. Respondents were asked what percentage of US gold reserves they would advise converting into Bitcoin. The majority recommended an allocation between 1% and 30%. The survey aimed to reflect the US Census distribution in age, gender, race, income, education, and geography. It was administered via Qualtrics, with participants compensated for their time. Co-founder comes in defence as survey met with skepticism Despite the strong result in favour of Bitcoin, the survey was met with skepticism on social media. Critics questioned whether only crypto-enthusiasts had been surveyed. Troy Cross, co-founder of the Nakamoto Project, acknowledged the doubts but stood by the data. “We were surprised too. But the results are the results,” he said. “When given the choice, people were hesitant to select 0% Bitcoin. Most hovered around 10%.” Troy Cross @thetrocro · Follow Many of you are skeptical of our finding, released this morning that 4 in 5 Americans would convert some US gold reserves into bitcoin.“Yeah right! You must have done your survey at a bitcoin conference!”We were also surprised too. But the results are the results.The 1:15 am · 20 May 2025 228 Reply Copy link Read 29 replies Cross added that Bitcoin allocation recommendations fell as age increased—mirroring past findings of an inverse correlation between age and Bitcoin ownership. Dennis Porter, co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, echoed the sentiment, noting that the broader public seems less attached to gold than expected. “Americans just don’t care about gold that much, and most are naturally inclined toward diversification,” he said. Strategic interest grows in Washington The survey also found that 66% of respondents were neutral to positive about Donald Trump’s push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This growing support appears to be influencing Washington’s stance. White House adviser Bo Hines has floated a plan for the Treasury to buy Bitcoin using profits from the country’s gold reserves. If enacted, the proposal could see the US purchase up to 1 million BTC over five years. Hines cited Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025 as a legislative foundation. “If we actually realize the gains on these gold holdings, that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin,” he said. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested in July that the US could go further, proposing that Bitcoin reserves be matched one-to-one with gold holdings. Currently, the United States holds 8,133 tons of gold worth over $830 billion, alongside 207,189 BTC valued at around $22 billion—less than 3% of its gold holdings.

Let’s find out what’s behind this prediction. Table of Contents Unilabs: The AI-powered alternative with real utility Analysts see “discount zone” as ADA prepares for breakout $600k raised already? Unilabs ICO gathers momentum As Cardano begins its journey back toward previous highs, a bold forecast from AI has turned every head in crypto: Unilabs, a next-gen AI-powered asset manager, could be the next ADA, and it’s still trading for less than $0.01. Unilabs is already disrupting DeFi with institutional-level tools, automated portfolio intelligence, and real-time passive income strategies. The comparison may seem bold now, but given the history of the crypto market, everything is possible. Let’s break down what’s behind the hype. Unilabs: The AI-powered alternative with real utility While the Cardano price seems all set to take a ride to its previous highs, Unilabs (UNIL) is under the spotlight for its utility-centric approach to investment. It is the first entirely AI-powered asset manager that is here to change the perspective of investments for all. Despite stepping recently in the market recently, this DeFi investment protocol manages over $30m in Assets Under Management (AUM). One of the most sought-after features of this asset manager is that it gives access to four advanced AI-powered funds. These include the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund. This massive variety of investment funds caters to a broad range of investors, offering them exactly what they are looking for. Unilabs goes one step further than its competitors and offers passive income opportunities through staking.

Tokens from Cardano’s privacy-focused sidechain, Midnight, will be distributed via airdrop to about 37m wallets on eight blockchains. As part of the distribution, users on these networks will receive either DUST (privacy token) or NIGHT (governance token). Hoskinson declared that venture capital firms will not be allowed to participate in the airdrop at all, which sets this apart from industry standards. Analysts have pointed out possible pricing implications of this on the Cardano price, even while the Midnight project is primarily focused on technical and community development. ADA currently has a risk model score of 42 according to Crypto Capital Venture (CCV). The last time this score was seen was before ADA’s late 2017 and 2020 bull runs. According to some market analysts, this means that the Cardano price will rise once again, possibly to $2. Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, experts refer to the Cardano current price of about $0.78 as the “discount zone.” The 0.62 Fibonacci level is about $2.01, while the 0.50 level is at $1.67. With a 233% rise, the Cardano price has made significant progress after falling to $0.23 in late 2023. It is still 74% lower than its peak, which was about $3.10. $600k raised already? Unilabs ICO gathers momentum As AI claims Unilabs to be the next Cardano, there is massive hype surrounding this asset manager. It is currently in its ICO phase and has taken off with a great start. As of stage 2, each UNIL token is available for $0.0051. Already over $600,000 has been collected from investors, clearly reflecting the demand for its technology. The price per UNIL token is expected to rise in the subsequent rounds, generating a decent ROI for all its early investors even before the official listing. Unilabs further offers multiple benefits to early UNIL holders, such as up to 30% reduction in the platform’s fees. Additionally, it offers users a chance to earn passive income with its referral program. To learn more about Unilabs, visit its website, Telegram , and Twitter.

BTC price strength remains “intact,” says Swissblock Technologies, removing the risk of a double top. Historically, a return to within 10% of all-time highs delivers price discovery almost every time. Bitcoin ( BTC ) does not risk a “double top” bull market reversal with its trip past $107,000, new analysis says. In one of its latest X updates , private wealth manager Swissblock Technologies described BTC price strength as “intact.” BTC price indicator ignores double top “noise” Bitcoin shows “no signs of bearish divergence,” as seen through the lens of a basket of network indicators. Commenting on the latest signals from its Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI), Swissblock argues that despite being less than $5,000 from all-time highs, BTC/USD is not about to abandon its push into price discovery. “A lot of noise about a potential double top as $BTC struggles to break ATH,” it summarized. BFI combines various extant indicators into a single oscillator to provide insight into trend strength at a given price point. Since August 2024, BFI has stuck rigidly to its middle territory around the 50/100 mark, irrespective of price action. “Even during the Feb–Mar pullback, it held neutral, never dipped into weakness,” the post notes. Swissblock explained that if BTC/USD were to reverse now and head lower, leaving all-time highs untouched, BFI would already be “breaking down.” “On-chain strength is intact,” it concludes. “Bears: not this time, got to wait.” Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI).

On that topic, network economist Timothy Peterson used statistical analysis to assume a trip to at least $115,000 by the end of June. “Bitcoin has pulled to within 10% of its all-time high,” part of his own X post from May 9 reads. “What happens next? This has happened nearly 300 times since 2015. Within 50 days, Bitcoin made a new all-time high 98% of the time.” Peterson acknowledged that post-2020 gains have been more modest than those before, with an average 8% move giving BTC/USD a target of up to $125,000.

Genesis has brought legal action in the courts of Delaware and New York following bankruptcy proceedings, which concluded in August 2024. The litigation seeks to recover approximately $2.1 billion in disputed transfers to benefit creditors. Genesis accuses DCG and executives of fraud and self-dealing The lawsuit filed in Delaware Chancery Court by Genesis Global Capital contains serious allegations against Digital Currency Group, its founder and CEO Barry Silbert, and other company insiders. In order to pay back the creditors of the cryptocurrency lender, the complaint requests the recovery of one million coins, which are worth around $2.1 billion. According to court documents made public on Monday, Genesis accuses DCG and its leadership of engaging in reckless loan activities and operating without reasonable risk management protocols. According to the petition, the defendants allegedly took advantage of Genesis’ creditors and consumers by using “other people’s money” to profit themselves. The partially redacted complaint details what Genesis describes as an intentional “misinformation” campaign where Silbert and other executives allegedly misled customers about the company’s financial stability. The suit claims DCG manipulated financial disclosures to hide the true state of the business while benefiting DCG and its bitcoin trust, Grayscale Investments LLC. Philippe Selendy of Selendy Gay, who represented the Genesis litigation oversight committee, spoke about the situation. He stated it was showing “a pattern of self-dealing, fraud, and mismanagement that deprived hundreds of individual Genesis creditors and institutional lenders of billions of dollars of value in crypto and fiat assets.” The Delaware case is one of the most significant bodies of litigation in Genesis’ overall strategy following the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in January 2023. The company finalized restructuring in August 2024 and distributed around $4 billion in cash and cryptocurrency to the creditors. The plan, to which DCG objected, involved a $2.2 billion payout to Gemini Earn customers and uncapped recoveries based on prevailing asset prices. New York bankruptcy trial filing targets $1 billion of preferential transfers Genesis filed a second lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, US Bankruptcy Court, in a similar case. The suit claimed over $1 billion in allegedly wrongful transfers during the year prior to its bankruptcy filing. The suit is directed at insider transfers during Genesis’s insolvency. New York’s filing seeks to qualify these transactions as preferential transfers in bankruptcy and recover their value on behalf of the creditors. The disputed crypto payments are in excess of $582 million, and the total preferential transfers are in excess of $1.2 billion as of March 31, according to the court filing. The lawsuit mentions other transactions, including $101 million to the DCG subsidiary HQ Enhanced Yield Fund, $136 million to DCG International, and $448 million to DCG. Genesis is further claiming recovery of $34 million of tax payments to DCG. They further claimed that transfers were unauthorized and not valid liabilities. Genesis asserts that these transfers took place at a period of record market volatility in the crypto space. These were the collapse of stablecoin Terra-Luna, the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, and the FTX Trading 2022 bankruptcy scandal. The lawsuit claims that DCG was aware that Genesis’ business was on the verge of collapse during the period. “DCG recognized the existential threat to Genesis and, with it, to DCG and the Insider Defendants that had loaned Genesis hundreds of millions of dollars,” the firm stated in court documents. The lawsuit contends Genesis was actually insolvent by the end of 2021 and accumulated $14 billion in outstanding loans. The crypto lender attributes its insolvency to structural risks and inadequate internal controls that its parent company and insiders allegedly knew about but failed to address.

Though it may be glib and a little over simplified, it appears to 'ring' true, as the U.S. financial markets are now exhibiting traits similar to pro-wrestling's concept of "" kayfabe ."" Kayfabe means an illusion that the in-ring scripted action is real, with the audience buying the same while suspending their belief for entertainment. A similar dynamic has played out in the financial market for at least a decade, where the U.S. government has repeatedly hit its self-imposed debt ceiling , or borrowing limit, a sign of fiscal crisis. Still, investors continued lending money to the government at ultra-low yields, including during times of stress in the global economy, thereby maintaining the kayfabe that the government is a safe and reliable borrower. Recently, however, bond market participants have exposed kayfabe, as legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones had warned , weakening the illusion and strengthening the case for investing in assets with haven and store-of-value appeal like bitcoin (BTC) and gold. Bonds blast the kayfabe This week's big news is the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield topping the 5% mark and how it could destabilize financial markets. However, we have been there before in October last year, according to the data source TradingView. Read more: U.S. 30-Year Treasury Yield Breaches 5% Amid Moody's Rating Downgrade, Fiscal Concerns The real story is the spike in yields on the Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). Their principal amount is adjusted for inflation. The 30-year TIPS yield recently rose above 2.7%, the highest since 2001. In other words, investors demand a yield at least 2.7% greater than inflation in return for loaning money to the government for three decades. This comes as the consumer price index (CPI) growth continued to slow toward the Fed's 2% target, and the market-based forward-looking inflation measures like breakevens remain stable in familiar ranges seen since 2022. Plus, the supposedly inflationary U.S.-China tariff war has eased. Divergence is a clear indicator that investors are seeking the most expensive real yield due to concerns about fiscal policy and not inflation, tariffs, or growth dynamics. ""The world is saying, we don't trust your long-term fiscal trajectory and we want to be compensated for it,"" pseudonymous analyst EndGame Macro said in an explainer on X. As of May 19, the U.S. national debt, also known as the total public debt, stood at $36.22 trillion. It is projected to rise by $22 trillion over the next 10 years, with debt-to-GDP reaching 156% by 2055 , according to analysis conducted by EY's Quantitative Economics and Statistics (QUEST) practice. The QUEST report also said the burgeoning debt will weigh heavily on economic growth. Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, pointed to the five-year forward real interest rate as evidence of bond players questioning the fiscal sustainability. ""The 5y5y forward real interest rate now stands at 2.5%, which is the highest level going all the way back to 2010. Most importantly, it far exceeds levels seen during hawkish Fed episodes, like the 2013 ""taper tantrum"" or the 2022/23 hiking cycle after the COVID inflation scare,"" Brooks said in a Substack post , while noting the stability in the 5y5y forward inflation breakevens. ""That makes it all the more likely that many years of irresponsible fiscal policy are catching up with the U.S, adding urgency to the need to get our fiscal house in order,"" Brooks added. FX-bond correlations are dead Another sign that the market is waking up to the fact that the emperor has no clothes is the breakdown in the traditional correlation between the foreign exchange (forex) and bond markets. Typically, rising bond yields boost the appeal of the home currency, causing it to appreciate against other fiat currencies. For example, the EUR/USD has historically closely tracked the spread between yields on German and U.S. two-year government bonds. But not anymore. The EUR/USD has risen sharply since early April despite the narrowing of the two-year yield differential, led by a sharp rise in the U.S. two-year yield. The breakdown in correlations indicates that concerns over fiscal stability have likely prompted investors to move away from U.S. assets. The degree of dollar bearishness is evident from the options market, which is now most bullish on EUR/USD since COVID. It's unusual for the options market to put a greater premium on the upside in euro than the downside, according to Brooks. Bullish bitcoin and gold Historically, governments facing fiscal concerns have resorted to inflation and repaying debt by printing more money. They will likely retake the same road, incentivizing demand for hard assets like gold and bitcoin. ""All roads lead to inflation. That’s historically the way every civilization has gotten out is that they inflated away their debts,"" Tudor Jones said last year, while naming BTC, gold, and commodities as preferred holdings over longer duration bonds. Two years ago, Economist Russell Napier voiced a similar opinion, saying , ""We need to prepare for an era of increasing financial repression and persistently high inflation."" Financial repression refers to government policies that direct funds from the private sector to the public sector to help reduce national debt. The scenario is characterized by the inflation rate exceeding the return on savings, capital controls and interest rate caps, all of which could bode well for bitcoin and gold. Interest rate caps are usually implemented through policies like yield curve control, which has the central bank targeting a specific level for the long bond yields, let's say 5%. Every time, the yield looks to rise above the said level, the central bank steps up bond purchases, injecting liquidity into the system. Arthur Hayes, CIO and founder of Maelstrom, has said that yield curve control will eventually be implemented in the U.S., torching a record rally in bitcoin. Hayes recently said that President Donald Trump's decision to water down trade tariffs after early April panic in financial markets is evidence that the financial system is too levered for tough reforms and warrants additional money creation. “They can call it whatever they want—just don’t call it QE—but it has the same effect: liquidity rises and Bitcoin benefits,"" Hayes said . Impending rally won't be smooth The bullish case for BTC does not necessarily mean there won't be hiccups. The U.S. Treasury market serves as a bedrock of global finance and increased volatility in these bonds could cause financial tightening, potentially triggering a global dash for cash that sees investors sell every asset, including bitcoin. As of now, however, the MOVE index, which represents the 30-day implied or expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury notes, remains in a downtrend.",Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Markets|market analysis|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-20 07:52:52

Bulls have been optimistic of a Ripple spike for a few weeks now, but events have caused the XRP price to stall considerably. And while Ripple struggles to generate profits in the crypto market, competition arrives in the form of a new PayFi project. Remittix is planning a new use case for crypto assets, one where users will be able to pay for goods and services online using their crypto assets directly. The features on Remittix are set to drive traffic to the platform, but the ongoing presale is already setting the stage for a massive RTX launch . Stay tuned for more from the token. Ripple ETFs: SEC Postpones Decision The Ripple Exchange-traded Funds are perhaps the most anticipated crypto products in the market currently. Since Ethereum launched its ETFs in 2024, top altcoins like Solana, Ripple and Dogecoin have been tipped to be next in line. There have been several applications submitted to the SEC for Solana, Ripple, and Dogecoin spot ETFs, but the SEC in the US has postponed its decision on them till June. Ripple could have its Futures ETFs from ProShares in the market soon, but the anticipated XRP price boost will come from the spot ETF approval. It is not factual, but the delay in Ripple ETF approvals might be one reason for the recent dip in XRP price. The token trades at $2.32, a significant 10.62% down on the weekly charts. XRP Price Levels to Watch For a while, the best thing going for Ripple is that it has kept the support level at $2. With such a strong base for price rebounds, XRP is expected to withstand the volatility in the market with minimal fuss. Still, the XRP price has been losing its confrontations with the resistance levels. CryptoPotato places the foreseeable resistance levels at $2.3, $2.6, and $3, with the token losing its $2.3 momentum in the past seven days. Ripple has crossed the $2.3 barrier, but with buyer hesitation, the bears are back in business. A delay in the SEC lawsuit resolution has also halted bullish trading on Ripple. The $50 million settlement terms have been adjudged to lack the proper legal justification, and Judge Analisa Torres has rejected the appeal. Ripple’s current struggles might open the way for Remittix (RTX) to stage a spectacular launch this year. Already, the new project has momentum with its revolutionary features. Crypto traders can’t seem to get enough Remittix tokens. More Use For Your Crypto Withdrawals Remittix Ripple opened the doors to crypto overlapping with fiat currencies, but Remittix is offering an interesting perspective with its features. The platform on Remittix allows users to settle crypto tokens directly into fiat bank accounts without intermediaries or bank charges. It gets better too, knowing that the withdrawals processed through Remittix can be across country borders too. All the user needs are the account details for the receiving bank account and gas fee payment. Upon approval, the crypto assets are moved into a one-time-generated deposit address on Remittix. Smart contracts convert the crypto into the desired fiat currency and the funds are resolved in the provided bank account. Remittix is another step in the growing acceptance of crypto tokens as payments globally. With the new platform, users will be able to make payments for goods and services without having to liquidate their crypto assets first.

Peirce has proposed a time-limited “safe harbor” proposal that would see cryptocurrency projects exempt from securities regulations under certain conditions. Hester Peirce: “There Should Be a Certain Period of Time for Cryptocurrencies Not to Be Considered as Securities After Their Launch” According to Peirce’s proposal, crypto assets that could be included in the scope of investment contracts could be exempted from SEC registration obligations for a limited period of time if they meet certain transparency and investor protection requirements. During this process, projects would be given time to add functionality or decentralize the network. Peirce also said that airdrops, NFTs and some stablecoin types should be considered outside the scope of securities, and argued that clear and permanent exceptions should be made for these assets. Peirce, who took office as the SEC’s Crypto Task Force Chair, stated that to date, the commission has created uncertainty in crypto regulation and its approach to penalizing the industry has been inadequate. Related News: Cardano (ADA) Founder Responds to Allegations of Stealing $600 Million Worth of ADA “The biggest problem with crypto is that it is not clear when a crypto asset that starts under an investment contract can be traded as an independent asset,” Peirce said, adding that clear criteria should be defined for when the investment contract’s connection with the crypto asset is severed. Peirce also said that the Commission’s past litigation has pushed entrepreneurs out of the U.S., so it’s time to create a regulatory framework that respects investor protection but also encourages innovation. “Initial sales may be securities, but assets that become functional or decentralized should no longer be covered by that contract,” he said. Under the new safe harbor framework, issuers are expected to be required to publicly disclose their commitments and regularly notify investors about goals such as fulfilling the technical functionality of the network or decentralization. Peirce also called for a special exemption regime to ensure that token distributions, particularly via airdrops, are not considered registered sales. *This is not investment advice.

On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health. Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse. As per the complaint , Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin ( BTC ), 69,197 Ether ( ETH ) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025. At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments. DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcy The complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors. “In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks. “GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants. Source: GenesisLOC Related: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuring A second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy. These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent. Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed. Genesis seeks to recover billions In total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits. In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward. The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note. While Gemini and Genesis have settled , DCG and the executives have fought the charges . Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.

While much of the broader conversation remains focused on legal developments and banking partnerships surrounding XRP, this post emphasized the growing role of XRP in facilitating real-time, continuous-value transactions. The tweet argued that the real opportunity for XRP lies not in regulatory matters or institutional adoption alone, but in the rapidly growing utility for streaming payments, micropayments, and machine-to-machine financial interactions. EVERYONE’S FOCUSED ON XRP’S LAWSUITS AND BANKING TIES… But no one’s talking about the real $100B+ opportunity: Streaming payments Micropayments Devices paying each other in real time This isn’t some future use case. It’s already happening. XRP might end up… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 17, 2025 The commentator described these functions as current and active developments within the ecosystem. According to the post, these innovations represent a $100 billion-plus opportunity, positioning XRP as a potential leader in this high-frequency digital value transfer niche. Retail Sentiment Reflects Confidence Community engagement on the post included comments that echoed and expanded on the central argument. An X user named Blueman commented on the financial limitations faced by retail investors, stating , “It’s not that people don’t know about it, it’s that we have no more money left to buy more LOL.” Blueman’s comment reflects the recognition of XRP’s potential and a limitation in capital allocation among retail participants. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Protocol-Level Value Seen as Long-Term Driver Another comment by XRPayments.X highlighted the value of the underlying technology rather than solely focusing on the asset itself. The comment stated, “The value is in the protocol (XRP Ledger). These use cases are key to bring value onchain & all the streaming payments, micropayments + AI buying, selling & transacting on our behalf, will ensure Trillions in tranx 24/7/365. It’s the tranx volume that will help drive XRP price.” This aligns with the original post by suggesting that the true driver of XRP’s long-term value will likely come from transaction volume generated by automated and intelligent systems operating continuously across a decentralized infrastructure. Real-Time, Automated Transactions Are No Longer Theoretical The comments and original tweet are based on the XRP Ledger’s core strengths, including low-cost, fast, and scalable transactions, making it uniquely suitable for modern payment demands. The growing integration of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) will catalyze broader adoption, where devices autonomously transact in real time without human intervention. These capabilities are already being explored in various sectors, including online content monetization, smart contracts, and machine-based services. Broader Utility May Redefine Crypto Success Metrics As discussions in the crypto space often remain focused on price speculation and legal battles, this thread draws renewed attention to the technological underpinnings of digital assets like XRP. The emphasis on actual implementation and transaction throughput highlights the potential shift in how success is measured—not just by market cap, but by utility, adoption, and volume. The assertions made in the tweet suggest that if the XRP Ledger continues to develop in the direction of facilitating frictionless micro- and machine-level payments, it could establish a foundational role in the next generation of digital finance.

Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet . On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero ( XMR ). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions. Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses. Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers , further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339. The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms , making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms. Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft. This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility. What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved? Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans: Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit. These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required. Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust. Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible. Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders. High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users. Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking. Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance. Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds. Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work. Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use: Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets. Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets. Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers. Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems. Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks. Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses. Ronin Network attack In March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity , suffered a $600 million exploit . Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offer The Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions. Discord phishing scams Discord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses. Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users. How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks: Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers. Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters. Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access. Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters. Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source. Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand. Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes.

According to a recent X post by crypto analyst Amelie, Circle is engaged in informal discussions to sell itself to Coinbase or Ripple. This development adds a new dimension to the ongoing saga of Circle’s strategic direction, previously highlighted in Timetabloid’s coverage of Ripple’s acquisition attempts. BREAKING NEWS: CIRCLE $USDC IN ""INFORMAL TALKS"" TO SELL ITSELF TO COINBASE OR RIPPLE! #XRP https://t.co/4CDBYgdFeI pic.twitter.com/VOIZdzUgAl — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 19, 2025 Ripple’s Ambitious Pursuit Ripple Labs, known for its XRP cryptocurrency and blockchain-based payment solutions, has made significant moves to acquire Circle. In late April 2025, Ripple reportedly offered $5 billion for Circle, which was ultimately rejected for being too low. Undeterred, Ripple allegedly increased its bid to a staggering $20 billion , signaling its determination to secure a dominant position in the stablecoin market. Acquiring Circle would provide Ripple with immediate access to USDC’s extensive infrastructure, regulatory relationships, and market share. Such a move aligns with Ripple’s broader strategy to integrate blockchain technology into global finance and could accelerate the adoption of its stablecoin, RLUSD. However, Circle’s management has expressed concerns about merging with a firm that has faced regulatory challenges, fearing it could jeopardize USDC’s reputation for compliance and transparency. Coinbase’s Strategic Interest Coinbase, a longstanding partner and distributor of USDC, is also reportedly in informal talks to acquire Circle. The exchange already plays a significant role in USDC’s distribution, receiving over 60% of Circle’s interest earnings as part of their revenue-sharing arrangement. An acquisition would consolidate Coinbase’s position in the stablecoin market and provide greater control over USDC’s issuance and integration across its platform. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Circle’s Independent Path Despite acquisition interests, Circle appears committed to pursuing an independent path. The company filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in April 2025, indicating its desire to remain autonomous and capitalize on its strong market position. Circle’s management believes that maintaining strategic independence is crucial for USDC’s continued growth and widespread adoption across various financial institutions and platforms. Implications for the Stablecoin Market The potential acquisition of Circle by either Ripple or Coinbase underscores the increasing importance of stablecoins in the digital asset ecosystem. As regulatory frameworks evolve and institutional adoption grows, control over leading stablecoins like USDC becomes a strategic asset. Whether Circle remains independent or aligns with a larger entity will have significant implications for the future of digital finance and the competitive dynamics within the stablecoin market. As the situation develops, stakeholders and observers will monitor how these informal talks progress and what they mean for the broader crypto landscape.

Nearly half of these inflows, $306 million, went into iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), now at $45.9 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors. The renewed demand follows bitcoin’s strong price performance, having traded above $100,000 for 11 consecutive days, which has helped restore market confidence. Additionally, the annualized basis trade, a strategy where investors go long on the spot ETF and simultaneously short bitcoin futures contracts on the CME, has become increasingly attractive, with yields approaching 9% almost double what was seen in April. According to Velo data, this has sparked a modest uptick in basis trade activity as evidenced by an increase in trading activity in the CME futures. On Monday, CME futures volumes hit $8.4 billion (roughly 80,000 BTC), the highest since April 23. Meanwhile, open interest stood at 158,000 BTC, up over 30,000 BTC contracts from April’s lows, further underscoring the growing appetite for leveraged and arbitrage strategies. That said, both both futures volume and open interest remain well below the levels seen during bitcoin’s all-time high of $109,000 in January, indicating there’s still significant headroom for further growth. The upswing in the basis suggests the growth may be already happening, bringing back players that left the market early this year when the basis dropped to under 5%. Recent 13F filings revealed that the Wisconsin State Pension Board exited its ETF position in Q1, likely in response to a then-less favorable basis trade environment. However, given that 13F data lags by a quarter and the basis spread has since widened from 5% to nearly 10%, it is plausible that they have re-entered the market in Q2 to capitalize on the improved arbitrage opportunity.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-20 08:08:49

The justices emphasized the necessity of monitoring and controlling digital currencies effectively, urging the central authorities to expedite the creation of comprehensive regulations.

Justice Suryakant remarked, “If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it.” This call for regulation comes amid ongoing investigations into illegal Bitcoin trading activities, such as the case involving Shailesh Babulal Bhatt, who is accused of extorting significant amounts of cryptocurrencies and cash. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court dismissed a ₹2,000Cr . The WazirX hack case is only because India still has no clear crypto regulation .

In a post on X, Balchunas said the firm might eventually allow its clients to trade the Bitcoin ETFs through its platform. According to Balchunas, the demand from Vanguard clients could force the firm to change its position once Bitcoin gets to the $150,000 – $200,000 range. My take: Vanguard won't launch a bitcoin ETF prob ever. But.. I could see them lightening up and letting them be traded on their platform in next year or two, esp if bitcoin hits $150k or $200k, they gonna get sick of being asked about it by customers and their new CEO is one of… https://t.co/SHj75lywUo — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 19, 2025 Balchunas added that, due to the fact that Vanguard’s current CEO, Salim Ramji, is also one of the creators of the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT could eventually influence its decision to allow it. Ramji led the BlackRock ETF business before moving to Vanguard. Other experts also appear to agree with Balchunas’s take. Many previously predicted that Vanguard would eventually offer its users access to a Bitcoin ETF. One analyst noted that Vanguard will likely gain more exposure to Bitcoin through its VOO ETF once Strategy MSTR joins the S&P 500. Vanguard stands alone as more institutions embrace Bitcoin Vanguard’s decision not to issue Bitcoin ETFs or allow the trading of existing Bitcoin ETFs on its platform makes it unique compared to other asset issuers. The firm claims to focus on tested and trusted products to help investors protect their money, especially during downturns. However, Bitcoin’s consistently strong performance means that many Vanguard users without exposure to the asset are now complaining. Interestingly, some customers are also considering migrating to other brokers offering access to Bitcoin products. For instance, Fidelity and BlackRock, major competitors of Vanguard, have their own Bitcoin ETFs and allow users to trade other crypto ETFs on their platforms. Even better, these firms also allow other Bitcoin-focused products with Fidelity trading platforms, allowing exposure to Metaplanet stock. Meanwhile, if Vanguard eventually changes its mind, it will not be the first traditional institution to do a 180-degree turnaround on Bitcoin. Investment bank JP Morgan recently announced that it will allow its customers to buy Bitcoin. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon announced the move, which marks a complete departure from Dimon’s previous criticisms of the crypto industry and Bitcoin, which he considers a Ponzi scheme and tool for criminals. Interestingly, Dimon’s anti-Bitcoin position remains with the executive. He notes that he will never buy BTC personally, but will let personal sentiment prevent JP Morgan customers from accessing it. He noted that he would defend customers’ right to buy Bitcoin just as he would defend a person’s right to smoke a cigarette. Bitcoin steadies at $105k as the market looks for a new all-time high While traditional institutions continue to change their stance on Bitcoin, the flagship crypto asset has been up almost 3% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. It now appears to have broken out of the $104,000 range after peaking at $106,814 today before settling above $105,000. BTC’s positive performance means it has been up 11.88% year to date. Its positive performance has allowed altcoins to see massive gains today, even as they pale compared to long-term price movements. It is unclear what is responsible for the recent increase in value, but there are lots of positive fundamentals backing it up. According to crypto analyst Carmelo Alemán , Bitcoin has accumulated over $906 billion in realized capitalization. Realized capitalization describes the total amount invested in Bitcoin, which has been trending upward for four consecutive weeks. If that trend continues, experts believe BTC will reach a new ATH. Bitcoin realized cap (Source: CryptoQuant) He said: “If the trend of increasing Realized Capitalization continues, suggesting ongoing investor confidence in Bitcoin, it is very likely that Bitcoin will surpass its ATH in the near future. This could set the stage for a historic bull run.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s spot net volume in the US dollar is now up on Binance, a signal that selling pressure has declined and buying activity is increasing.

Wayfinder (PROMPT) jumped 13% in the past 24 hours, currently trading around $0.28 after rallying from an opening price of $0.26 to an intraday high of $0.30. The surge comes alongside a 35% uptick in trading volume and was likely driven by PROMPT listing on Bithumb , expanding its presence across major CEXs including Coinbase, OKX , Bitget, MEXC, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com, and BingX. With today’s surge, PROMPT price broke above both the 20 EMA and 50 SMA, although the 20 EMA remains below the 50 SMA following a bearish crossover that occurred in mid-May, which had coincided with the start of a steep leg down. Despite that, recent price action suggests that a local bottom may have formed around the $0.24 – $0.25 level. It also seems to be coming off a double bottom pattern at this level. After bottoming out at $0.24 – $0.25 level, PROMPT price went on to print a higher high and a higher low. Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators further support the bullish outlook, with the RSI currently siting at 58, indicating upward momentum while remaining far from overbought territory. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line and green histogram bars continue rising. Volume has also increased significantly on recent green candles, suggesting accumulation.

A decisive breakout above this level with sustained buying could pave the way for the next major resistance at $0.35. This level previously acted as a strong support zone after April 30 swing high before being flipped into resistance following a breakdown to the $0.30 level. If current momentum holds and buying pressure continues, Wayfinder could be poised for a broader recovery and potentially reach $0.42, where support formed after a breakdown from its post-launch peak at $0.61 .

According to a May 19 blog post , Anza described Alpenglow as the “biggest change” to Solana’s architecture since its inception, calling it a “turning point for Solana.” The protocol would replace Solana’s existing TowerBFT and Proof-of-History (PoH) systems with a new architecture built around two key components, namely, Votor and Rotor. Votor handles the voting and block finalization process, while Rotor serves as the data dissemination protocol. Unlike the current design, which relies on gossip-based communication and PoH for timestamping, Alpenglow introduces direct messaging and erasure-coded data propagation. Rotor builds on Solana’s existing Turbine model but reduces network hops and refines node relay selection. Meanwhile, Votor introduces a dual-mode voting system that attempts to finalize blocks in a single round when at least 80% of the stake is active, or within two rounds when participation drops to 60%. Both modes operate simultaneously, allowing the protocol to finalize blocks through whichever path completes first. You might also like: Solana spikes 7% as Anza releases update to resolve congestion issues Anza estimates the upgrade could reduce median block finality to around 150 milliseconds, and as low as 100 milliseconds under optimal conditions. These latency estimates, based on simulations, would bring Solana’s performance closer to that of traditional Web2 infrastructure. “A median latency of 150 ms does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski, and Roger Wattenhofer noted. The protocol also includes a “20+20” resilience model, meaning it can maintain network safety and liveness even if up to 20% of validators behave maliciously and another 20% are offline or unresponsive. According to Anza, this design accounts for both adversarial threats and real-world conditions like outages or latency issues, aiming to ensure consistent finality even under degraded network performance. While Alpenglow is expected to introduce significant improvements in network latency and resilience, Anza notes in its white paper that the upgrade alone will not fully prevent future outages, especially given the network’s current reliance on a single validator client. Solana has struggled with network outages in the past years, often tied to congestion and validator overload. Its current architecture, which lacks a mempool and processes transactions directly, has made it especially vulnerable to spikes in transaction volume, particularly during periods of high activity. Anza has played a key role in fortifying Solana’s infrastructure through its work on Agave , the network’s primary production-grade validator client. The firm continues to refine the client’s performance, most recently contributing to Agave v2.2 , which raised compute unit limits and improved transaction throughput.

Crypto traders might want to cancel their summer vacations as options markets are flashing signs that the coming months could be anything but quiet. Despite the season’s reputation for sluggish activity, where both crypto and equities often cool off, current data suggests the market might be in for a hotter, more volatile stretch, Kaiko’s analysts say. In a recent research note, the analysts pointed out that since 2020, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has regularly seen its lowest trading volumes during the third quarter — peak summer months — except in 2022, when a wave of bankruptcies, including Celsius Network and Three Arrows Capital , sent markets into turmoil.

In particular, June 27 expiry options have seen a spike in volume, with bullish bets targeting eye-catching strike prices of $110,000 and $120,000. These positions suggest some traders expect Bitcoin to reach new highs, even as macroeconomic uncertainty lingers. Several catalysts are converging to stir up market expectations. The Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting could impact broader financial conditions, while former President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline introduces added geopolitical risk, the analysts say. At the same time, major U.S. crypto legislation is anticipated before Congress breaks for its August recess, adding further uncertainty to the months ahead. Traditionally, summer brings a cooldown. Stock trading volume in August tends to drop significantly. Crypto often follows suit, with on-chain and exchange volumes typically slumping in August. For instance, spot trading fell by nearly 20% in August 2023, and total exchange volume dropped by over 11%, according to market data.

U.S. authorities have launched a criminal investigation into how hackers managed to steal sensitive user data from Coinbase by bribing overseas support staff, Bloomberg has learned , citign a person familiar with the matter. The Department of Justice’s criminal division in Washington is reportedly looking into how hackers gained access to sensitive user data by bribing customer service workers in India . Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, told Bloomberg that the company had notified and was working with the DOJ and other U.S. and international law enforcement agencies, and that it welcomed law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against those responsible. The company itself isn’t under investigation, according to Grewal.

But the ransom demand had actually arrived earlier, via an anonymous email sent on May 11, per a regulatory filing. It’s still unclear why it took several days for the exchange to publicly report the breach. Coinbase said the attackers accessed names, addresses, phone numbers, government-issued IDs, and other account data. The breach may have started as early as January. The company fired the customer service workers involved and estimated the breach could cost up to $400 million to resolve. The exchange claims that only a small portion of users — less than 1% — were affected, though one of them was Sequoia Capital managing partner Roelof Botha, whose personal information was accessed.

Aave ( AAVE ) soared to an intraday high of $269 on May 20 afternoon Asian time, marking its highest level since February and making it one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the market right now. From its April low, AAVE has now climbed more than 132%. The surge came alongside a spike in trading volume. According to data from crypto.news, over $800 million worth of AAVE changed hands today, its most active day since early March. Meanwhile, AAVE’s futures open interest hit an all-time high of $569 million, reflecting strong demand from derivatives traders. Its positive funding rate for two straight weeks also suggests the majority of the market is still betting on more upside, with long traders currently paying short traders. Traders appeared to welcome progress on the GENIUS Act , which recently cleared a key procedural vote in the U.S. Senate. The bill proposes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, an area critical to DeFi protocols like Aave. Given Aave’s reliance on stablecoins like USDC, DAI, and its native GHO, the prospect of regulatory clarity could encourage more institutional participation and bolster confidence across its ecosystem.

According to DeFiLlama , its total value locked jumped nearly 40% in the past month to reach $40.7 billion, far surpassing Lido, which has $23.3 billion. This growth is translating into real revenue. AAVE has raked in over $250 million in fees year-to-date, putting it among the most profitable protocols in the space. Momentum on the technical front is also being matched by a rise in daily active addresses, which have spiked 57% over the past two days.

The court questioned the Centre’s lack of action on framing crypto policies. The matter came into light on Monday while hearing a case from a petitioner who faced allegations of cryptocurrency fraud. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said that unregulated Bitcoin trading was “nothing but a more polished form of Hawala.” Per a local report , they suggested that regulation could provide supervision on the sector and curb its use in illicit operations. “Why does Centre not come out with a clear-cut policy on regulating cryptocurrency?” the court asked on Monday. “There is a parallel under-market for it and it can affect the economy. By regulating the cryptocurrency, you can keep an eye on the trade.” Banning Crypto Will Not Be Wise: Supreme Court Further, the court emphasized that almost “two years ago” it had sought clarification on India’s stance towards digital assets. The Justice bench has also said that banning these wouldn’t be a wise decision, but regulating them would be. “Nobody is saying to stop it, because wouldn’t not be wise for the economy,” the court observed. “Banning may be shutting your eyes from ground reality. But what about regulating it?” (Shailesh Babulal Bhatt v.

Early this month, law authorities highlighted the growing disconnect between rising Bitcoin trading and lack of proper regulations. The same two-judge bench reiterated that the legality of Bitcoin trading remains murky in India. In February 2022, the court had asked the government to clarify whether cryptocurrency trading was legal in India and to outline a roadmap for enforcement. However, in January 2024, the Centre responded to the court’s questions saying that a decision on regulating cryptocurrencies was still pending.

After briefly reaching a 24-hour high of $106,518, the asset retraced slightly and now trades at $104,820, reflecting a modest 0.5% decrease over the past day. Still, the cryptocurrency remains just 3.8% below its all-time high of $109,000 set in January, keeping traders and analysts closely focused on its next move. Notably, the current price action comes as changes in trading behavior emerge across major exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Face Make-Or-Break Moment At $106,500 Resistance – Details Binance Spot Volume Signals Renewed Interest Amid Controlled Market Activity One notable development is the return of positive spot net volume delta on Binance, according to a new analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost. This metric, which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume on spot markets, suggests that spot demand for Bitcoin is increasing once again. Darkfost emphasizes that while rising spot volume can reflect growing interest, sharp spikes, especially during euphoric rallies or profit-taking phases, can sometimes coincide with local tops. Darkfost notes that previous surges in Binance spot volume were often linked to key market tops, driven by rapid sentiment shifts. Such volume expansions tend to result from two primary drivers: enthusiasm that leads traders to chase price action, and experienced investors taking profits after breaching key resistance zones. While these volume shifts don’t necessarily point to imminent reversals, they highlight periods where risk management becomes increasingly important. In the current cycle, however, the uptick in volume appears more gradual, which the analyst views as a healthier sign for market continuation rather than a sign of overheating. Binance’s position as the top global crypto exchange gives these trends additional weight. According to data referenced in Darkfost’s analysis, Binance accounts for more than 26% of global spot volume, far outpacing other platforms like Coinbase. Monitoring activity on such a dominant exchange provides useful insights into broader market sentiment, especially in periods where Bitcoin approaches key psychological levels like $100,000 or higher. Bitcoin MVRV Momentum Divergence Highlights Short-Term Risk Pockets In a separate report, another CryptoQuant analyst, Crazzyblockk, examined the market through the lens of MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) momentum across both short- and long-term holders. The analysis found that while both groups are sitting on significant unrealized profits, short-term holders have seen their weekly MVRV momentum decline. This means that those who entered the market recently may not be achieving expected returns, which could increase the likelihood of short-term sell pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up $18,000, But HODLer Profits Same As On April 1—Here’s Why The divergence in MVRV momentum between long-term and short-term holders is often seen as an early signal of a shift in market dynamics. If long-term holders begin to distribute profits while newer market entrants grow frustrated, short bursts of volatility could emerge. However, broader positive momentum and the resilience of spot market demand suggest that Bitcoin remains positioned for continued strength, provided these emerging risk signals do not escalate in the near term.

While there is still room for some more sideways choppiness, a surge up and past the all-time high and into price discovery may not be far off. Price spike or triple top rejection? Source: TradingView As can be seen in the daily chart above, the $BTC price is gathering beyond the $104,000 horizontal level, which has just become tentative support. If a few more daily closes can take place above this level, the launchpad for the next, and possibly last, leg of this bull market would be in place. On the other hand, if a breakout past the all-time high does not happen soon, and the price begins to roll over, could this be the formation of a bearish triple top that signals a descent to much lower levels, or even the end of this current bull market? At this point it could be argued that there are more reasons for a bull market continuation than a bull market top. First among these is that the trend is still up, and that the full measured move out of the bull flag has not yet reached fruition. This would occur at around $120,000. Another good reason for continued upside is that the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs , Michael Saylor’s Strategy, various other Bitcoin treasuries, and possibly sovereign nations other than those already known about, are all still buying. $BTC bearish scenario Source: TradingView Nevertheless, there are still concerns that must be taken into consideration. Chief among these might be where this current weekly candle closes in roughly six days time. If the candle closes below that $104,000 support, a retreat back to the top of the bull flag, or even to $93,000 could be the next move. Another factor to bear in mind is that the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators are now reaching the top. It’s probable that both indicators will be at the very top at the end of this weekly close. If there is a rejection from $104,000, the blue indicator line could then cross below the red, potentially signalling that a top would be in. 4-year cycle takes potential top to Q4 2025 There are various scenarios that could play out. It must be noted that the 4-year cycle is not complete until later in Q4 of this year. Therefore, even if there was a rejection here, there could still be time for the price to come back to the $93,000 support, and then run up again for one last hurrah into price discovery. This would mean the weekly Stochastic RSI coming back down, and then returning to the top by the end of the year - a realistic possibility, but probably one for the crystal ball at this stage. It might also be borne in mind that a 4-year cycle is not set in stone. It has been the cycle length for the life of Bitcoin up to now, but many analysts are suggesting that this cycle may be longer, and could end in Q1 or even Q2 of 2026. Monthly $BTC chart displays bullish setup Source: TradingView Finally, if one looks at the much higher scale picture of the monthly time frame, it can be seen that the horizontal support level is actually lower at $102,000. This suggests that if the price can hold above this level by the end of May, the scene could be set for a last big surge into the final stage of this bull market. The monthly Stochastic RSI is posturing a cross-up of the fast (blue) indicator line over the slow (red) line, signalling a good period of upside price momentum. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index has the indicator line already crossing above the moving average line (yellow). If the indicator line can then cross up through the descending trendline, this would be extremely bullish. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The latest Dogecoin price update suggests a slight bearish tilt forming on lower timeframes, with the broader trend caught between tightening Bollinger Bands and fading momentum indicators.

DOGE price analysis (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, Dogecoin price action shows a clear descending trendline capping upside since the mid-May peak around $0.258. After multiple failed attempts to break above $0.236, DOGE is now testing support near $0.222—coinciding with the 50-EMA and the lower edge of the Bollinger mid-band.

Many altcoins have posted impressive gains on a daily scale, including ETH, which has jumped past $2,500. BTC’s Ride The bears seemed in charge at the end of the previous business week when they pushed bitcoin to under $102,000 on Thursday. However, the asset bounced off rather quickly and surged past $103,000 on Friday and spent most of the weekend trading sideways around that level. On Sunday evening, though, the cryptocurrency started to gain traction and pumped to $106,000. It was stopped there and driven south to under $103,500, but the bulls initiated an even more impressive price surge in the following hours, resulting in BTC exceeding $107,000 for the first time since last January. As bitcoin was nearing its all-time high, the landscape changed once again, and it slumped toward $102,000. Yet, that was not the end of the massively volatile ride as it skyrocketed once again, this time to a more modest peak of $106,600. It was stopped there once again, but has managed to remain above $105,000 as of now. Its market cap has neared $2.090 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 60.7%. BTCUSD.

XRP defended a crucial support line and now sits at $2.35. SOL, TRX, SUI, LINK, AVAX, SHIB, HBAR, and TAO have posted gains of up to 7%. However, AAVE stands in a league of its own from the larger-cap alts. The asset has skyrocketed by over 20% and now trades at $265.

XRP’s consolidation phase signals an imminent breakout, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight. Its presale, now in phase 4 at $0.025, has raised $8,900,000, with over 500 million tokens sold to 11000 holders. Experts predict Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could hit $5 post-launch, driven by its innovative buy-and-distribute system. This new crypto coin is emerging as a top crypto to buy now, offering unmatched potential in the crypto market. XRP’s bullish surge XRP is riding a wave of optimism in the crypto market. Technical analysis points to a breakout from a symmetrical triangle, with weekly green candles signaling strong momentum. Fibonacci levels suggest resistance at $2.71, but a push past $4.5 could propel XRP to $6.8. Traders are heavily bullish, with a Long/Short Ratio above 3.0 on Binance. Yet, crowded long positions raise risks of a pullback if momentum stalls. XRP’s active addresses are climbing, reflecting user engagement, but price action remains range-bound. This consolidation is a precursor to growth, yet XRP lacks the fresh utility of newer projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its DeFi focus, offers a compelling alternative. Mutuum Finance’s presale frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting investor fervor in its phase 4 presale, now 92% filled at $0.025. The project has raised $8,900,000, with 10,600 holders securing over 500 million tokens. Phase 5 looms, bringing a 20% price hike to $0.03, yielding a 20% gain for current investors. The tokenomics guarantee a 140% ROI at the $0.06 listing price, but experts forecast a soar to $5 post-launch, a 19,900% surge. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing a leaderboard for the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. This incentivizes holding, amplifying demand in the crypto investment space. The presale’s rapid sell-out underscores Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to buy. Innovative DeFi mechanics Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with practical utility. Its lending platform allows users to deposit assets into liquidity pools, earning interest via mtTokens like mtETH or mtDAI. These tokens accrue value over time, offering passive income. Borrowers access funds by posting overcollateralized assets, ensuring stability. A peer-to-peer lending feature lets users negotiate terms for niche assets, boosting flexibility. The buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates relentless buy pressure, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top cryptocurrency to invest in. The team is finalizing a Certik audit, with results soon to be shared on socials, enhancing trust. Why Mutuum outshines XRP XRP’s price predictions are enticing, but its growth relies on market sentiment and technical breakouts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility through DeFi lending, appealing to investors seeking real-world applications. While XRP battles resistance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale is a low-entry opportunity, with phase 4 nearly sold out. The 140% ROI at listing is just the start, with a $5 target signaling massive potential. XRP’s network activity is robust, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s innovative mechanics and structured tokenomics provide a clearer path to gains. For those eyeing the best crypto to invest, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto prices today. Sealing the deal Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in the crypto market, blending DeFi utility with explosive growth potential. Its phase 4 presale, priced at $0.025, is a fleeting chance to join a project targeting $5 post-launch. XRP’s $6.8 forecast is notable, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresher entry for investors chasing the next big cryptocurrency. The project’s buy-and-distribute model and mtToken system ensure sustained demand, making it a top crypto to buy now. Don’t miss out—explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) today and secure your stake in this rising DeFi star.

While his view of BTC has not changed over the years, Dimon has stated that he is not interested in buying Bitcoin, viewing it as worthless and a scam. “I've always been deeply against crypto, against Bitcoin. The only real use case for them is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax evasion. If I were the government, I would shut them down,” he said in a speech. *This is not investment advice.

They both have seen drops on the weekly charts. Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL) , now in its second presale phase, has rewarded early buyers with nearly a 30% return. Interest in this project is rising as it will be the first AI-driven DeFi asset management platform with $30M AUM. Given that platforms like Lido surged post-launch, Unilabs's deeper AI connection could make it one of the hottest platforms in this space. Due to all these factors, traders are in a hurry to get the UNIL crypto coin as its upside potential appears amazing. Unilabs (UNIL) Seen As the Crypto Coin With the Most Room for Growth While the Ripple price and the price of Cardano are seeing some drops, Unilabs (UNIL) is stealing the spotlight. This is all thanks to its presale performance which has already helped Unilabs raise over $600K. Early buyers of the UNIL crypto coin are already enjoying nearly a 30% return. With this crypto ICO event in phase two now, these numbers are bound to skyrocket before it ends. Also, people are growing more excited for Unilabs as it changes the DeFi market forever. It is the first AI-powered DeFi asset management platform. On it, users can locate the most promising crypto coins before they make headlines thanks to the Unilabs Launchpad. Currently, Unilabs offers four types of fund options: the AI fund, mining fund, RWA fund and BTC fund. Thus, users will gain access to a wide range of assets. Traders are rushing to buy the UNIL crypto coin since it is now available for only $0.0051. They will get governance voting rights and staking rewards of up to 122% APY by holding it. A referral program also lets users earn passively by simply inviting their friends to join the Unilabs platform. Due to all these factors, traders think UNIL is one of the top crypto coins to watch for fast returns in 2025. Expert Forecasts the Ripple Price Could Reach $3 Ripple (XRP) has been seeing some pullbacks on the price charts. According to CoinMarketCap, the Ripple price fell over 5% in the past seven days. In that period, its value fluctuated between $2.40 and $2.30. However, market expert Bitunix remains optimistic about the Ripple (XRP) price movement. In a recent post, he told his X followers that this crypto coin is seeing a V-shaped recovery pattern. If the Ripple price manages to soar past the $2.60 resistance level, it may even hit $3 as per Bitunix. Despite this bullish Ripple price prediction, many traders are still skeptical. Given that the Ripple price has surged nearly 350% in the past 12 months, its highest upswings could have passed. Therefore, investors are focusing on crypto coins like UNIL instead. Ali: The Price of Cardano (ADA) May See an Upswing to $0.92 Cardano (ADA) is another crypto coin facing some turbulent waters. After rising over 15% on the one-month chart, its value saw a correction of over 10% in just one week, as per CoinMarketCap. In other words, the price of Cardano dipped from around $0.80 to nearly $0.70. The community thinks the price of Cardano (ADA) could see a rebound thanks to bullish statements from analysts like Ali. For example, Ali made an X post saying that if the current structure is an ascending triangle, a potential jump to $0.92 may come for the price of Cardano. Although this Cardano price prediction has made some waves, some investors are sidestepping it for UNIL. Since it has a high market cap of around $25B, a lot of new money must come in for the price of Cardano to see a noteworthy jump. Meanwhile, UNIL will not have this issue. Why Are Traders Turning to Unilabs (UNI) Over Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA)? Even top crypto coins like Ripple and Cardano are seeing big price dips quickly. Because of this volatility, many traders are choosing Unilabs (UNIL) instead. Its ongoing growth shows people's confidence in its AI-driven asset management approach. Plus, demand for the UNIL crypto coin is rising, with over 130M tokens sold in the second presale stage alone. Considering the fast pace at which these tokens are being sold, interested users should hurry and get it before its value skyrockets.

Phase 4 is currently underway, 92% filled at $0.025 per token, a jump from the opening phase’s $0.01. Investors are flocking to this new cryptocurrency, drawn by its structured tokenomics promising a 140% return at its $0.06 listing price. Unlike Pepe’s meme-driven volatility or XRP’s consolidation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility through decentralized lending. But why is MUTM the best crypto to buy now for staggering gains, outpacing its rivals? Pepe’s fading momentum Pepe (PEPE) surged in April 2025, riding a wave of social media hype. Its price climbed from $0.00000045 to $0.00000168, fueled by retail enthusiasm. Yet, technical indicators now signal a stall. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped to 68.82, hinting at waning buying pressure. The MACD histogram shows shrinking bars, suggesting a potential bearish crossover. Pepe’s reliance on meme coin sentiment makes it vulnerable to sharp corrections. Support levels at $0.00000134 are under threat, and a broader pullback looms. While Pepe remains a top crypto for short-term traders, its long-term outlook lacks stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, offers a more grounded approach, as its presale success underscores. XRP’s consolidation conundrum XRP is navigating a critical phase, trading within a tight range dubbed a “pandora box” by analysts. After a 2024 rally, it entered consolidation, forming a symmetrical triangle. A breakout occurred on April 7, 2025, sparking green weekly candles. Fibonacci levels peg resistance at $2.05 and $2.71, with a potential climb to $5.9. Yet, XRP’s trajectory hinges on breaching the $4.5 barrier. Its price action reflects indecision, trapping momentum in a volatile zone. While XRP ranks among top cryptocurrencies, its growth feels tethered compared to newer projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sidesteps such uncertainty, leveraging its lending model to drive demand. Mutuum Finance’s presale power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is commanding attention as phase 4 of its presale races toward completion. Priced at $0.025, tokens are selling fast, with only 8% remaining before phase 5’s 20% price hike to $0.03. This shift offers current investors a 20% gain upon phase 5’s opening. The project’s tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price, but analysts predict a post-launch surge to $1.50, yielding a 5,900% ROI. Over 10,600 holders have secured 500 million tokens, reflecting robust demand. The team is auditing its smart contract with Certik, with results soon to be shared on socials. This transparency bolsters MUTM’s appeal as the best crypto to invest in. Innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) redefines DeFi with its overcollateralized lending system. Users deposit assets like ETH, receiving mtTokens such as mtETH, which accrue interest over time. Borrowers lock collateral exceeding loan values, ensuring stability. A buy-and-distribute mechanism funnels platform revenue into repurchasing MUTM tokens, rewarding stakers and fueling buy pressure. Recently, MUTM launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, who earn bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. This gamified incentive drives engagement. Unlike Pepe’s speculative spikes or XRP’s sluggish climb, MUTM’s utility positions it as the next big cryptocurrency, blending passive income with growth potential. Why MUTM leads the pack Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands tall as the best cryptocurrency to invest today. Its presale, now 92% filled in phase 4, signals urgency for investors eyeing the cheapest cryptocurrency with explosive potential. Pepe’s meme-driven run lacks staying power, while XRP’s consolidation delays its ascent. MUTM’s 140% listing return and projected 5,900% post-launch gain to $1.50 dwarf their prospects. The crypto market craves utility, and MUTM delivers with lending, staking, and buy pressure. Investors seeking the next crypto to hit $1 should act swiftly.

The BitMEX co-founder predicts in a new interview with Fortune that the top crypto asset could hit $200,000 in the current run and $250,000 by the end of the year. “I believe that the US government has to borrow more money than what we think, and therefore, [Treasury Secretary] Bessent will have to issue more debt and therefore he needs to find a way for these individuals to obtain as much leverage as possible through the banking system and ultimately that means that there’s more dollars floating around in the world because the US government is spending more money on stuff. So that’s kind of the TLDR (too long, didn’t read) on what a buyback is and how I believe it’s positive for liquidity in the market and which is why I think Bitcoin bottomed on April 9th and will continue much, much higher as the government continues to borrow money and Bessent does what is necessary to make sure they’re funded at an affordable rate.” BTC is trading at $105,379 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 1% in the past 24 hours. Hayes also predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million by the end of Donald Trump’s presidency in 2028.

Technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest a potential breakout, despite overbought conditions. A decisive move above $110K could trigger a rapid surge toward $125K, according to John Deaton. Bitcoin ($BTC) is trading just above $105,400 as of May 21, gaining nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. The price now presses against a major resistance zone at $106,600, a level where Glassnode identifies a significant supply cluster of 31,000 BTC acquired in December.

With Q2 of 2025 wrapping up and Bitcoin holding steady near $104,000, investor optimism is picking up steam. Institutional inflows are rising, on-chain activity is heating up, and bullish predictions are spreading across the board. This is the kind of climate where early entries can become life-changing wins. But while Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, smart money is already looking deeper—toward altcoins with real traction, AI integration, and meme-level virality. And one project that keeps landing on investor watchlists? Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) . Let’s dive into the market trends, what makes a crypto explode, and which coins—new and established—could lead the charge into Q3. Q2 2025 Market Predictions: The Big Picture As April’s fear turns to May’s greed, momentum is clearly building in the crypto sector. Here’s what top analysts are saying about the rest of Q2: Bitcoin’s Still Leading, But Altcoins Are Moving Bitcoin remains the main driver, with Standard Chartered forecasting $120K by July and even $200K by year-end. But with dominance hovering near 52%, altcoins are starting to stir, and many believe the true “altseason” will kick off before Q3. AI and Meme Coins Are Dominating Narratives In 2025, successful tokens aren’t random—they follow hot trends. AI-powered crypto, real-world assets (RWAs), Layer-2 scaling, and community-first meme coins are the four dominant narratives right now. Tokens like Dawgz AI check more than one of these boxes, increasing their visibility. Sentiment Is Rising According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, investor mood has flipped from neutral to greed in early May. This shift is a common early indicator of major breakout phases. Technicals Remain Bullish With BTC and ETH both holding above key moving averages, momentum is still strong. Any minor pullbacks are being seen as buying opportunities—especially for undervalued altcoins. What Makes a Crypto “Explode”? Not all gains are equal. While BTC grinding to $200K could 2x your investment, newer tokens can deliver 10x or even 100x returns—if they have the right setup. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now , understanding what drives explosive growth is key. Here’s what explosive coins tend to have in common: Low Market Cap at Launch: The smaller the market cap, the more room to grow. Hot Narrative Fit: AI and meme coin combos are 2025’s most talked-about pairings. Clear Utility or Roadmap: Hype fades. Real-world use cases help projects hold value. Engaged Community: Explosions are powered by virality, memes, and constant chatter. Smart Tokenomics: Limited supply, staking rewards, and burn mechanisms can create supply shocks. Presale Success: A presale that raises millions—like Dawgz AI’s—builds early trust and firepower. Exchange Momentum: Listings on platforms like Binance or Coinbase often signal the spark before a pump. Next Crypto to Explode? Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) Among the rising wave of new projects, one name keeps surfacing in Q2 prediction lists: Dawgz AI. It’s early. It’s hyped. But most importantly—it’s planned. What Makes Dawgz AI Stand Out? Presale Pricing: With a token price of $0.004, Dawgz AI is a penny token with room to run. The low entry point is ideal for those looking for a 50x–100x upside. AI Utility: Its AI-backed trading tools are built to assist retail users with market signals and automation—something previously only hedge funds had. Meme Coin Branding: As a meme token, it has viral potential. But unlike DOGE or SHIB, it adds real utility to the formula. Proven Early Demand: Dawgz AI has already raised over $3.5 million during presale—a strong signal that retail and early-stage investors are confident. Audit and Tokenomics: Audited by SolidProof 30% of tokens allocated to presale buyers 20% reserved for staking rewards 15% focused on community incentives It’s not just hype—it’s structured for sustainability. And that’s rare in meme coins. Want to see more? Watch this video breakdown of Dawgz AI to hear why influencers are paying attention. Established Cryptos to Watch in Late Q2 While Dawgz AI is the top early-stage pick, these established players still offer strong momentum plays as we close out the quarter: Ethereum (ETH) With DeFi TVL over $62B, Ethereum remains the king of smart contracts. Upcoming Ethereum ETF announcements, increased L2 adoption, and continued dApp growth suggest ETH’s $3K range could soon be a springboard. Solana (SOL) Trading under $150, SOL remains a retail favorite. With a thriving NFT scene, gaming infrastructure, and blazing speed, analysts predict a retest of $200+ if altseason hits. Cardano (ADA) Steady, scalable, and research-driven, Cardano is building out quietly. If altcoin narratives shift toward energy efficiency and smart governance, ADA could be a dark horse with 3x potential. Tips for Riding the Next Bullish Wave Explosions are rare—but smart positioning can increase your odds. Here’s how to play Q2 smart: 1. Buy Narratives, Not Just Tokens AI, DePIN, Web3 Gaming, and meme utility are leading. Pick tokens that fit the story. 2. Stack Entry Points Use dollar-cost averaging to avoid going all-in at a local top. 3. Track Presale Stats Strong early traction usually signals momentum. Dawgz AI’s $3.4M raise is a good example. 4. Follow Developer Activity Watch for active GitHubs, roadmap updates, and new partnerships. 5. Take Partial Profits When your token pumps 5x–10x, consider locking in some profits to fund the next bet. Conclusion: Dawgz AI Leads the Early Movers With Q2 ending on bullish signals across the board, the market is preparing for movement. Bitcoin sets the tone, but altcoins are where real gains are made—especially early-stage tokens with strong fundamentals. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) fits this bill perfectly. It’s new, it’s timely, and it’s structured to ride both the AI revolution and meme wave of 2025. For those looking to catch the next big breakout before it happens, Dawgz AI is one of the best cryptos to buy now—before the next leg up begins. FAQs Section What's the next 1000x crypto? Early-stage projects like Dawgz AI, with low market cap and strong narratives, offer explosive potential if momentum holds. What is the most bullish crypto right now? Bitcoin remains bullish overall, but Dawgz AI is trending among early investors as a bullish small-cap opportunity. Which crypto to buy for the next bull run? Ethereum and Solana are reliable picks. For higher risk/reward, Dawgz AI and other AI-integrated tokens stand out. Which coin will reach $1 in 2025? If adoption accelerates, tokens like Dawgz AI—currently at $0.004—could hit $1 with continued community and utility development.

Resistance at $2.69 stifles upward momentum, while selling pressure hints at limited breakout potential. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi star, captivates investors with its presale soaring past $8,900,000 and over 500 million tokens sold to 10,600 holders. Phase 4, now 92% filled at $0.025, signals urgency as prices will jump 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5. Unlike XRP’s uncertain trajectory, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility, positioning it as the best crypto to buy now for explosive 35x gains. XRP’s stagnant outlook XRP is struggling to breach the $2.69 resistance, a critical barrier on crypto charts. Trading at $2.54, it faces persistent selling pressure, with the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio at 0.91, indicating dominant bearishbirds. The MACD shows bullish momentum, but the RSI hovers above 50, suggesting only moderate strength. Open interest on Binance has rebounded to $530 million from a low, yet the neutral funding rate reflects balanced bullish and bearish bets. Support at $2.51 holds for now, but a drop below could see prices test $2.45. Despite some analysts’ lofty $1,000 predictions, heavy resistance and low momentum make new XRP highs unlikely. XRP’s path to $3 remains fraught with obstacles, dimming its appeal among top cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines bright Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is captivating the crypto market with its innovative DeFi lending model. Phase 4 of its presale is underway, with tokens priced at $0.025, up from the first phase’s $0.01. Investors are rushing in, driven by a 140% return on investment projection at the $0.06 listing price. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, offering a staggering 9,900% ROI. The project has raised $8,900,000, with over 500 million tokens sold to 10,600 holders. Phase 4 is 92% filled, and Phase 5 will bring a 20% price hike to $0.03, yielding a 20% gain for current investors. According to this expert analysis, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a top crypto to buy now. Robust lending model drives demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its overcollateralized lending system. Users deposit assets like ETH to receive mtTokens, such as mtETH, which accrue interest over time. Borrowers lock collateral exceeding loan values, ensuring stability. The buy-and-distribute mechanism uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates constant buy pressure, boosting long-term value. A new dashboard recently launched, showcasing a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens. The team is finalizing a Certik smart contract audit, with updates soon on socials. This best crypto coin to buy offers unmatched utility and growth potential. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto investment space. Its presale success reflects soaring demand, with Phase 4 nearly sold out. The structured tokenomics ensure a 140% return at launch, with predictions of a 35x surge to $2.50 post-launch.

44846321,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67763,1747732801,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"ChatGPT Predicts XRP Price for June 1, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/chatgpt-predicts-xrp-price-for-june-1-2025/,"In a bold prediction that has captured the attention of XRP enthusiasts, ChatGPT has forecasted a significant price increase for XRP by June 1, 2025. The AI model projects that XRP could climb approximately 18% from its current level, reaching $2.80 within the next two weeks. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.36, marking a 3.2% gain in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. This short-term momentum, broader market trends, and institutional developments lend weight to ChatGPT’s forecast. “Based on current market dynamics, increased institutional activity, and recent price momentum, XRP is positioned to reach around $2.80 by June 1, 2025 — an estimated 18% increase from its current level,” said ChatGPT. “This outlook is influenced by both macro trends in the crypto space and positive XRP-specific developments.” Bitcoin Rally Sets the Stage for Altcoin Momentum One of the most notable drivers of market sentiment has been the sustained bullish trend in Bitcoin. As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is trading at $105,545, up a remarkable 24% in the last 30 days. Historically, strong Bitcoin rallies have often paved the way for altcoins to follow suit, particularly those with established ecosystems and institutional interest, such as XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 CME Launch of XRP Futures Marks Institutional Breakthrough Further supporting the bullish case for XRP is the recent announcement that CME Group has launched XRP futures contracts, marking a significant milestone in institutional acceptance. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed the move as a “key institutional milestone,” underlining the growing demand from professional investors to gain exposure to XRP in regulated markets. In a post made shortly after the market opened, Garlinghouse confirmed that Hidden Road, a global prime broker, had cleared the first block trade on CME. This event signals rising confidence in XRP and the development of deeper liquidity and improved price discovery mechanisms, often prerequisites for sustained growth in any financial asset. Eyes on June: Can XRP Hit $2.80? With these developments, analysts and market observers are increasingly optimistic about XRP’s near-term outlook. While price predictions are always subject to volatility and external factors, the convergence of rising Bitcoin dominance, enhanced institutional infrastructure for XRP, and increasing trading activity paints a promising picture. As June approaches, all eyes are now on whether XRP will fulfill ChatGPT’s projection and cross the $2.80 mark.

The seasoned entrepreneur engaged in a compelling 60-minute conversation with host Lilly Douse on BrandTalks , offering invaluable insights drawn from his journey building the premier decentralized exchange on Polygon.The interview showcased Zacharias's impressive journey through the blockchain space, highlighting how his principles-driven approach transformed QuickSwap from a simple Uniswap fork into a market leader in DeFi innovation. Beyond discussing QuickSwap's impressive milestones and recent developments, Zacharias delivered three crucial pieces of advice for aspiring Web3 founders – wisdom that could prove instrumental for navigating the volatile yet promising blockchain landscape.As someone who has weathered numerous market cycles and technological shifts, Zacharias's guidance carries significant weight. His insights on preparation, continuous learning, and resilience offer a roadmap for entrepreneurs looking to make their mark in this rapidly evolving industry. For anyone seeking to understand what drives success in the wild Web3 startup scene, Zacharias's candid reflections and ahead-of-his-time perspective make the interview essential viewing. Insight Number One: Overcome Obstacles with Preparation First and foremost, Roc emphasized preparation as non-negotiable Web3 founders. Drawing from his extensive experience navigating the volatile cryptocurrency landscape, Zacharias stressed that entrepreneurs must anticipate and plan for extreme market fluctuations to avoid being blindsided by them. ""There are a lot of ups and downs in the market, so you have to plan for really hard times,"" Zacharias cautioned. As many projects have learned the hard way, managing capital to ensure sufficient runway isn't just good business practice – it's essential for survival in Web3. Zacharias highlighted how the unique challenges of the blockchain industry compound traditional business difficulties. Beyond typical startup hurdles, Web3 entrepreneurs must contend with regulatory uncertainty, technological growing pains, and market sentiment that can shift dramatically based on factors entirely beyond their control. ""It's a challenge every week,"" Zacharais admitted. ""You need to hope for the best, but always plan for the worst."" Roc’s pragmatic approach has helped QuickSwap weather multiple market cycles, including severe downturns that eliminated many promising projects that lacked adequate preparation.Continuous Learning: The Power of Podcasts and Audiobooks The second pivotal piece of advice Zacharias shared during his BrandTalks interview centered on continuous learning. With characteristic enthusiasm, Roc advocated for consuming educational content ""24/7"" through podcasts and audiobooks, transforming otherwise idle time into valuable learning opportunities. He also believes that anyone that wants to make it in Web3 must be a self-starter, and that means staying hungry for new information.Zacharias credited his own success largely to his voracious appetite for knowledge. He described how he maximizes every available moment – during commutes, workouts, and even household chores – by listening to industry podcasts and business audiobooks. Habitual learning has allowed him to absorb insights from countless experts, identify emerging trends before they become public knowledge, and develop a comprehensive understanding of both blockchain technology and business fundamentals. Resilience: Roc’s Timeless Virtue for Web3 Success The final and perhaps most fundamental piece of advice Zacharias shared during his BrandTalks interview was the timeless virtue of resilience. He stated emphatically, ""never give up. If you fail, try again.” Speaking candidly about the numerous setbacks and challenges he's faced in his own career in Web3 – from market crashes that decimated token values to technical challenges that required pivoting – Roc credits his uncanny ability to solve problems to persistence and determination. Zacharias also highlighted the importance of learning from others' mistakes rather than having to make every error personally. This way, entrepreneurs can develop resilience without experiencing the full cost of every potential misstep.The QuickSwap co-founder also noted that resilience isn't merely about stubbornness or refusing to change direction. Instead, it involves maintaining commitment to core goals while remaining flexible about the specific path to achieving them. Sometimes resilience means pivoting strategies or reimagining products rather than simply persisting with approaches that aren't working. Zacharias's Expanding Influence in Web3 Beyond his roles serving as CEO for Web3 incubator and marketing agency Lunar Digital Assets and co-founder at QuickSwap, Roc Zacharias has established himself as a multifaceted leader within the broader Web3 ecosystem. His BrandTalks interview revealed the impressive scope of his current activities and the extent of his influence across multiple sectors of the blockchain industry. Zacharias currently serves on the Board for Polygon's grants program, where he helps direct funding to promising projects that enhance the Polygon DeFi ecosystem and strengthen its Layer 2 infrastructure. Extending his impact even further, Zacharias serves as a mentor for Tim Draper's BitcoinFi accelerator and as a city leader for the BitAngels Pitch network.Wherever Web3 heads from here in 2025, entrepreneurs and innovators in the space have their work cut out for them, with Roc Zacharias’ insights as a guiding light illuminating the path ahead.

Speaking during a recent policy discussion, Lee argued that a won-based stablecoin would allow South Korea to retain wealth domestically while reducing reliance on foreign-issued digital assets like USDt ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ), according to The Korea Herald. Currently, South Korean law prohibits the issuance of domestic stablecoins, forcing local exchanges to rely on US dollar-based alternatives. Between January and March, crypto exchanges in the country recorded 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) in asset outflows, nearly half of which were linked to foreign stablecoins, the report said. “We need to establish a won-backed stablecoin market to prevent national wealth from leaking overseas,” Lee reportedly said. Related: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFs South Korean candidates make pro-crypto promises The proposal is part of Lee’s broader digital asset strategy, which includes legalizing spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Both Lee and rival Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party have pledged to support the introduction of spot crypto ETFs. Source: Konstantin Tkachuk Lee’s campaign also calls for the National Pension Fund and other institutional players to be allowed to invest in cryptocurrencies once price stability criteria are met. To facilitate this, he proposed an integrated monitoring system and lower transaction fees, making crypto more accessible under government oversight. However, the stablecoin proposal has sparked concern among economists. Shin Bo-sung, a senior Korea Capital Market Institute researcher, warned that stablecoins could inflate the money supply and shift monetary control to private issuers. “We must not overlook the economic principles behind them. Stablecoins are essentially another form of banking, creating money out of nothing,” Shin said. Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cards Democratic Party sets up “Digital Asset Committee” On May 13, South Korea’s Democratic Party launched a Digital Asset Committee focused on developing cryptocurrency policies and promoting industry growth. The committee, which held its inaugural meeting at the National Assembly Members’ Hall in Seoul, highlighted the importance of resolving regulatory uncertainty and addressing issues like stablecoin regulation. The new committee joins similar organizations in South Korea, including the Virtual Asset Committee launched in late 2024 and another public-private crypto task force introduced in 2022, both initiated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The Democratic Party is also set to introduce the Digital Asset Basic Act . The bill would establish a legal framework for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, requiring issuers to hold at least 50 billion won in reserves and gain approval from the FSC.

Bitcoin Price Analysis: Bulls Hold $105K in Channel Technically BTC/USD is in a channel trading at $105,294 after bouncing off $104,235 support. The 50-EMA ($103,559) is support and price action shows spinning top candles which is indecision. A break above $106,000 could target $107,084 and then $108,619 but if BTC goes below $104,235 expect $103,000 or $102,185. For beginners: Imagine BTC is moving within a lane—it needs strength to break higher or risk slipping back down. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.98M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As BTC holding near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $6.01 million out of its $6.98 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,015,311/ $6,981,682 Token Price: $0.00252 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

The May 19 Lawsuit filing claims Strategy hid the associated risks, citing a $5.9 billion unrealized Q1 loss that triggered an 8.67% drop in MSTR shares during April 7 trading. The “anticipated profitability” and “risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility” were referenced as misrepresented by Strategy officials. One focal point is the company’s repeated emphasis on key performance indicators like BTC Yield—tracking the ratio between Bitcoin holdings and common shares outstanding. These metrics allegedly downplayed the risks tied to adopting a fair-value accounting model for its Bitcoin reserves. Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, president and CEO Phong Le, and executive vice president and chief financial officer Andrew Kang are all defendants in the suit. Strategy Continues to Buy, Other Firms Follow As of May 18, Strategy holds 576,230 BTC acquired for around $40.2 billion at an average price of $69,726 per coin. Never short a man who buys orange ink by the barrel. pic.twitter.com/4h2sEbIraT — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 18, 2025 At current prices, the company’s total holdings are valued at more than $59.2 billion, representing an unrealized gain of $19.2 billion, or 47%. Since the filing, Strategy continues to acquire Bitcoin with its latest 7,390 BTC purchase valued at $764.9 million. A new projection by research and brokerage firm Bernstein suggests that corporations could collectively allocate as much as $330 billion into Bitcoin by 2029. Bernstein analysts believe this surge will primarily be driven by public companies emulating MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. BitBO data further illustrates the growing institutional interest, showing that public companies now collectively hold more than 739,501 BTC worth over $68 billion. Bitcoin treasuries by category.

Speculators Fear the Strategy Lawsuit Could Prompt Further Enforcement Action Commentators fear the Strategy lawsuit could set a precedent for broader enforcement, posing a threat to corporate Bitcoin treasuries. Pseudonymous X analyst Vagada noted that the lawsuit could “test the legal frontier” of corporate Bitcoin adoption. If true, this could test more than just Saylor’s strategy—it tests the legal frontier of corporate Bitcoin adoption. But conviction under fire? That’s when legends or liabilities are made. — vagada (@vagam00n) May 19, 2025 Others, however, argue the suit lacks merit. Pseudonymous developer 0xngmi from DeFiLlama criticized the case in a May 19 X post. the lawsuit seems to be people complaining that microstrategy understated how much money it could lose if BTC went down but if you're buying a company that is self-labelled as ""leverage on bitcoin"", what do you expect? it's pretty clear what will happen if btc goes down https://t.co/w0Dis8ZUM9 pic.twitter.com/I6Uw6zMcqJ — 0xngmi (@0xngmi) May 19, 2025 He dismissed claims of understated risks, stating, “You’re buying a company that is self-labelled as ‘leverage on Bitcoin,’ what do you expect?

Priced at $0.025, up from $0.01 in the opening phase, this DeFi project sparks excitement with its lending model and buy-and-distribute system. Phase 4, now 90% filled, nears its end, with phase 5 set to hike prices 20% to $0.03. This surge in demand signals Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to buy now, drawing comparisons to Solana’s meteoric rise. Could this be the next big cryptocurrency? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ignites Investor Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing the crypto market’s attention with its decentralized lending platform. Investors are rushing to secure tokens at $0.025 before the imminent price jump. The project’s presale success, amassing $8,900,000, underscores its allure as a new crypto coin. Unlike speculative assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility, enabling users to lend, borrow, and earn passive income. Its overcollateralized model ensures stability, making it a top crypto to invest in. As phase 4 races toward a sell-out, the fear of missing out intensifies. The team is finalizing a Certik audit, with results soon to be shared on social platforms, boosting trust. Lending Model Fuels Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its robust lending system. Users deposit assets like ETH or DAI into liquidity pools, receiving mtTokens that accrue interest over time. These mtTokens, such as mtETH, grow in value, offering passive income while maintaining liquidity. Borrowers access funds by providing collateral exceeding loan values, ensuring safety. For instance, borrowing $5,000 in USDT requires $7,000 in ETH collateral. This structure minimizes defaults, attracting risk-averse investors. The platform’s peer-to-peer lending option allows direct negotiations, even for niche assets like meme coins. Such versatility positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top cryptocurrency for long-term gains. Buy-and-Distribute Drives Value The buy-and-distribute mechanism propels Mutuum Finance (MUTM) forward. Platform revenue funds MUTM token repurchasing, redistributing them to mtToken stakers. This creates constant buy pressure, stabilizing prices and rewarding holders. Unlike volatile crypto coins, this system fosters sustained demand, making MUTM a best cheap crypto to buy now. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, who earn bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. This gamified approach sparks community engagement, further driving interest. With a $100,000 giveaway underway, early investors are incentivized, cementing MUTM’s place among the best cryptos to buy. Presale Profits Soar Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors are eyeing substantial returns. Purchasing at $0.025 in phase 4 yields a 20% gain when phase 5 begins at $0.03. At the $0.06 listing price, tokenomics guarantee a 140% profit. Post-launch, analysts predict a climb to $2.50, delivering a 9,900% ROI. This potential makes MUTM a next crypto to explode. The presale’s structured pricing rewards early entrants, with phase 4’s 90% fill rate signaling urgency. As crypto prices fluctuate, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a calculated entry into DeFi, appealing to those seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest today. Solana’s Shadow Looms Solana, once a crypto market darling, faces challenges that dim its shine. Network congestion and regulatory pressures have sparked volatility, pushing investors toward alternatives. While Solana’s speed and DeFi ecosystem remain notable, its instability deters some. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its lower entry price and practical utility, emerges as a stronger bet for 2025. Investors seeking the next big crypto see MUTM’s lending model and tokenomics as superior. Unlike Solana’s reliance on market sentiment, MUTM’s buy-and-distribute system ensures steady growth, making it a top crypto to buy now. Bright Horizons Ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a path to dominate the DeFi crypto space. Its presale triumph, raising millions, reflects investor confidence in its long-term potential. The impending Certik audit and innovative mtTokens enhance its appeal as the best crypto to invest right now. With phase 4 nearly sold out, the window to buy at $0.025 is closing fast. As the crypto market seeks stability, MUTM’s lending platform and buy pressure system position it as a leader.

On Monday, the apex court sharply questioned why no regulatory framework has been introduced to govern cryptocurrency in India. This comes in when the biggest economies in the world are taking steps to regulate crypto and develop a working framework for investors. Recently, the US Senate voted to move ahead on stablecoin legislation, which marked a big win for the crypto industry. However, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is already in its implementation phase. According to reports , a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh made it clear that “banning crypto is not the solution, but regulation is urgently needed”. The Bench highlighted crypto’s growing role in the global economy and noted that ignoring it would be akin to “shutting your eyes to ground reality.” They added, “We aren’t experts. Experts would examine it, but some steps to regulate it and keep an eye on it are necessary.” Justice Kant reportedly referenced a two-year-old observation to the Attorney General. He had then said the government couldn’t regulate crypto due to its international nature. The Court now says that’s no longer acceptable. The court noted that the taxing of Bitcoin profits at 30% already signals a form of legal recognition. Meanwhile, if that’s the case, then why is regulation still missing? Justice Kant, while addressing ASG Aishwarya Bhati, added that courts are now facing practical challenges in crypto cases. He stated, “Tomorrow, somebody will ask me, you please prove—what is the asset? How are we going to prove it?” The ASG responded that she would seek instructions from the Centre. Indian investors have already seen the WazirX hack in the absence of regulations. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)rejected a class action filed by 40 individuals affected by WazirX’s alleged $233 million hack in July 2024. The NCDRC pointed out that cryptos are not recognized as legal tender or a permitted investment asset in India. BitConnect fraud case heating up in India The apex court resumed hearings in a case involving multi-state cryptocurrency fraud. The case centers around petitioner Shailesh Babulal Bhatt. He has been accused of abducting two employees of the now-defunct BitConnect platform in 2018 and allegedly extorting 2,091 Bitcoins, 11,000 Litecoins, and ₹14.5 crore in cash. Bhatt has reportedly mentioned that his motive was to recover losses from his investment in BitConnect. During the hearing, the Court asked Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati for an update on the investigation timeline. The matter has been listed for further hearing on May 30, with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) directed to complete further investigation by that date. Back in 2018, Bitcoin was trading at $10,000 after hitting $17,000 in 2017. BTC price dropped to hover around the $3,000-$4,000 zone later in the year. However, Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $105,161 at the press time. BTC went on to hit its all-time high (ATH) of $109,114 on January 20, 2025. The global digital assets market printed green indexes all around on Tuesday morning. Its cumulative market cap surged by more than 2% over the last day to stand at $3.33 trillion with a trading volume of $126 billion.

Among the top picks - Litecoin, Solana, and rising AI-powered disruptor Lightchain AI. While these three projects come from very different categories—payments, smart contracts, and decentralized AI—they share one key trait - they’re all showing resilience and upside in a market still full of uncertainty. Let’s break down why analysts believe these three tokens could lead the next altcoin rally. Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) - Fast, Reliable, and Earning Trust Litecoin (LTC) and Solana (SOL) are a shining example of why crypto can be a ton of fun. Solana is constructed for speed — it can process up to 65,000 transactions a second — making it ideal for running decentralized apps and NFTs. Scalability is preserved by its unique #Proof of History consensus and low fees, making it a developer and user’s favorite. In contrast, Litecoin has proven itself over the ages. It was launched in 2011 and is known for reliability and consistency, including fast 2.5-minute block times. Given its long history with a track record of success, it has gained the trust of new investors, particularly after the spot ETF approval looks to be a bright 90%. Solana isn’t free and clear of regulatory challenges, but its fast run-up and interest from institutions demonstrate that it’s a force to be reckoned with. Between them, Solana and Litecoin demonstrate that whether it’s cutting-edge speed or reliable stability, there’s a place for both in the cryptoverse as it continues to change shape — and investors are waking up to that fact. Lightchain AI (LCAI) - Game-Changer in Blockchain and AI Lightchain AI is making waves as one of the most exciting newcomers in the blockchain and AI space. With its presale price at just $0.007125, it has already raised an impressive $20.3 million—clear proof of growing investor confidence. What sets Lightchain AI apart? It’s not just another altcoin. By seamlessly blending blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, it tackles major challenges like scalability and privacy, carving out its place as a leader in decentralized intelligence and real-world applications. This is a next-gen infrastructure project built for real, long-term impact. The tokenomics behind the LCAI token are just as solid. With a total supply of 10 billion, 40% is dedicated to presale, 28.5% fuels staking rewards, 15% supports liquidity, and strategic allocations ensure sustainability—with 5% set aside for marketing, 6.5% for the treasury, and 5% for the team. Lightchain AI isn’t just gaining momentum—it’s redefining what’s possible in the blockchain and AI revolution. Don’t miss out on what could be the next big thing. Momentum Is Building—and These 3 Are Taking the Lead Litecoin has earned a reputation for reliability, while Solana dazzles with its high performance. Both have cemented their place as power players in the crypto world, offering distinct benefits that attract investors and users alike. But now, a new contender has entered the scene— Lightchain AI . With groundbreaking technology, it’s shaking up the altcoin space and redefining what’s possible. Analysts are buzzing: Litecoin, Solana, and Lightchain AI are set to ignite altcoin momentum not just through June but well into the second half of the year. Their cutting-edge features and ability to adapt to market demands are driving this surge, paving the way for exciting advancements in the crypto landscape. The future looks bright—and these three are leading the charge! Website : Whitepaper : Twitter : Telegram Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While its price action signals potential, many investors are turning their eyes to Remittix, a project gaining momentum and predicted to deliver bigger returns in 2025. This article dives into Solana’s current market status and explores why Remittix could become a breakout star this year. Solana Price Action Shows Promise Amid Market Activity Solana remains a crypto giant with a market cap of $83.77 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $5.31 billion, up 129.81%. The 5.86% drop in the past 24 hours is a manifestation of short-term volatility and does not nullify Solana’s underlying strength. Solana, through its fast transaction speed and low cost, has attracted developers and users who build decentralized applications and NFTs. Its growing ecosystem continues to support sustained interest from investors who believe the recent price drop could provide a buying opportunity. However, the market is saturated and some are seeking alternative projects with fresh utility and growth potential. Why Remittix Could Outperform in 2025 Remittix (RTX ) is quickly emerging as one of the most potential projects in the cryptocurrency cosmos. Priced at $0.0757 presently, Remittix has raised over $15.1 million with over 536 million tokens sold so far. The reason why Remittix is so different is that it is transforming the world of payments with a seamless crypto-to-fiat bridge. The tech allows users to send cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and XRP directly into traditional bank accounts within minutes. By removing one of the largest crypto adoption barriers fast and easy conversion into fiat currency Remittix is poised to take a slice of the $190 trillion payments industry globally. Early investors see RTX following the same growth pattern as Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) did in their early stages but with faster real-world adoption. The scale of investment and people’s interest has prompted analysts to refer to Remittix as a high-flying altcoin in the upcoming bull run. Remittix Adoption Accelerates on the Strength of Real-World Utility Remittix’s value extends beyond hype; it solves actual problems. An Eastern European freelance translator who gets paid by international clients on a regular basis is an example. Traditional bank transfers cause days of delay and are costly. With Remittix, this translator is now able to receive crypto payments, which are directly exchanged and sent to their local bank account. This reduces a lot of waiting time and charges, hence making it easier to manage revenue. Similarly, small import-export businesses that cross borders are subject to currency volatility. Remittix enables companies to have stable fiat settlements, removing uncertainty and simplifying cash flow. These use cases reflect the utility of Remittix technology to consumers and businesses on a daily basis, which is driving faster adoption. Solana vs. Remittix: What Investors Should Know While Solana remains strong with its stable blockchain infrastructure and busy ecosystem, Remittix offers another proposition with a clear, real-world problem-solving benefit. Solana’s focus on NFTs and decentralized apps has attracted lots of attention, but the payment solutions of Remittix target a massive, practical market. Remittix’s massive fundraising of $15.10 million and volume of token sales indicate high market confidence. As more people require less expensive and faster ways of sending money globally, Remittix’s crypto-to-fiat bridge could catapult it to new heights. Investors looking for growth in 2025 need to keep a close eye on Remittix’s progress. With adoption gaining momentum and having its unique use case, RTX could deliver life-changing returns, perhaps outpacing most altcoins like SOL.

He emphasized that daily divergences tend to have a higher success rate than those seen on longer time frames.

He noted that BTC recently broke out of a significant double bottom formation and is now testing previous highs. A critical factor in his outlook is the substantial accumulation by US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are reportedly purchasing Bitcoin at a rate eight times greater than its current mining output. This aggressive accumulation phase, according to Doctor Profit, indicates institutional interest remains robust, even as retail traders have largely stayed on the sidelines during recent volatility. BTC Could Dip To $90,000 The analyst also highlighted that the strongest retail buying occurred around the $90,000 mark, which also represents a liquidity hotspot. Should the market revisit this level, he sees it as an optimal entry point, perfectly positioned at the bottom of the established trading box. Looking ahead, Doctor Profit anticipates volatility, particularly in light of Moody’s recent downgrade of the US credit rating from AAA to AA1—the first major downgrade since S&P’s similar action in 2011. Historical context suggests that such downgrades can lead to swift market corrections. In August 2011, following a downgrade, markets dropped by 5.5% in a single day. Doctor Profit believes that Bitcoin could similarly dip into the $90,000 range to capture liquidity before rebounding. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Despite potential short-term fluctuations due to the downgrade, Doctor Profit maintains a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, reiterating his target of $116,000 to $120,000. He noted that the market had largely priced in the downgrade, and historically, stocks have rallied following such events. With major institutions, including BlackRock, increasing their Bitcoin purchases in the exchange-traded fund arena, Doctor Profit sees no signs of weakness in the market, pointing to further price gains for the market’s leading cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,400, marking a 12% increase over the past two weeks and a nearly 24% increase over the past month. Year-to-date, the cryptocurrency has gained 60%, lagging behind XRP’s gains of over 300% in the same period.

Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed that less than 1% of its transacting monthly users were affected in an attack that may cost the exchange up to $400 million in reimbursement expenses, Cointelegraph reported on May 15. However, the “human cost” of this data breach may be much higher for users, according to Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and Arrington Capital. “Very disappointed in Coinbase right now. Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price,” Arrington said in a May 20 X post , adding: “Something that has to be said though - this hack - which includes home addresses and account balances - will lead to people dying. It probably has already.” Source: Michael Arrington While no passwords, private keys or account funds were exposed, cybercriminals reportedly bribed overseas customer service contractors to access internal systems. This allowed them to steal personal data that could be used in social engineering scams or even physical extortion attempts.

Experts warn that leaked address data could expose high-net-worth individuals to real-world risks. On May 16, Cointelegraph reported on six violent robberies that targeted cryptocurrency investors, aiming to extort digital assets via kidnapping or torture. In a ruthless attack on May 4, the father of a French crypto entrepreneur was abducted in Paris, France. The kidnappers cut the victim’s finger and sent a video to his son, demanding 5 million euros in crypto. The victim was held for two days before French police were able to find and rescue him. According to CNN, five people were arrested in connection with the kidnapping. Related: US crypto funds top $7.5B inflows in 2025 as investor appetite grows Crypto exchanges need “layered” cybersecurity To prevent similar user data breaches, crypto exchanges need to adopt a “layered defense strategy,” according to Ronghui Gu, the co-founder of CertiK Web3 security firm. “This can include privileged access management, zero trust architecture, multifactor authentication across internal systems, and continuous monitoring with behavioral analytics,” Gu told Cointelegraph, adding: “Preventive measures such as regular phishing simulations, tailored security training, and restricting third-party access to sensitive systems may help reduce these risks.” However, crypto platforms will need to “rethink their security posture” as attackers “increasingly target human vulnerabilities rather than technical ones,” added Gu, warning of the rising threat of social engineering schemes.

Usual Protocol is headed by CEO Pierre Person, a former French politician and National Assembly member who played a key role in shaping the country’s crypto asset legislation. “Existing stablecoin models lack transparency and equitable value distribution, privatizing their gains and socializing their losses, and going against the ethos that web3 was built on,” explained Person. “Usual is proud to be addressing this void by providing a permissionless, real-asset backed stablecoin that shares our profits directly with the community, and empowers our token holders to guide us to the future that they see fit.” Usual launched USD0 stablecoin alongside its liquid bond product USD0++ in July last year. USD0++ is a liquid staking token that allows users to lock USD0 for up to four years, earning rewards in USUAL tokens. This token is tradable in secondary markets, offering liquidity alongside staking benefits. In December 2024, Usual’s TVL surpassed $1.4 billion, ranking it among the top five stablecoins.

The allegations are serious— fraud, reckless mismanagement, and siphoning over $1 billion in assets from Genesis. At the heart of the case: Genesis’s creditors are still owed over $2.2 billion , and the company now seeks to recover $3.3 billion through legal action. Key Allegations Against DCG and Barry Silbert Sham transactions and insider deals allegedly drained Genesis of its assets. Genesis accuses DCG of using the company like a “corporate ATM.” The lawsuits claim strategic mismanagement led to forced exposure to risky, illiquid assets like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares. Over $1.2 billion was withdrawn from Genesis after it was allegedly already insolvent. Let’s break down the two lawsuits. Lawsuit 1: Genesis vs DCG in Delaware Court Filed in Delaware , this lawsuit targets fraud and reckless mismanagement by DCG and CEO Barry Silbert. The filing outlines a series of questionable decisions made to favor DCG and its subsidiaries —especially Grayscale —at the expense of Genesis and its creditors. Highlights: Genesis claims it was forced to accept GBTC shares as collateral, a move that amplified risk due to their illiquidity. DCG is accused of draining over $1 billion in value through insider loans and financial engineering. The suit alleges DCG prioritized its own interests while retail and institutional lenders suffered massive losses. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : South Korea Eyes Won-Backed Stablecoin Ahead of 2025 Presidential Election , Lawsuit 2: Bankruptcy Filing in New York Court The second lawsuit, filed in the New York bankruptcy court , dives deeper into insider withdrawals and mismanagement during market turmoil . Key Points: DCG allegedly withdrew $1.2 billion in crypto and cash while Genesis was insolvent. The withdrawals occurred during major crypto crashes —including Terra-Luna, 3AC, and FTX . Meanwhile, insiders reportedly recovered almost all their funds , while external clients remain at a loss. Who’s Paying the Price? Despite the legal action, it’s the retail and institutional clients who bear the brunt of Genesis’s collapse.

That’s its job. Rather than forcing you to visit a payment gateway every time you need to pay for something online, or to open your banking app when you order an Uber, embedded finance brings the checkout to you. By integrating directly into the social media apps and other non-financial platforms you use, it makes life that little bit simpler by eliminating friction. Even if you haven’t used the term, you’ve certainly used embedded financial services in your daily life. Powered by APIs and smart fintech solutions, the technology enhances user experience and expands access to financial services. And we’re not just talking about traditional financial services either: the same trend applies equally to crypto, which has been quietly making in-roads into mainstream apps and websites. Credit for driving this stealth takeover must go to the following crypto companies in particular, which have done more than most to deeply embed web3 services into every facet of our digital lives. Stripe As a global fintech payments leader, Stripe needs no introduction. It does it all and that includes crypto. Despite not being a crypto-native company, Stripe’s on- and off-ramp APIs allow developers to connect crypto to their apps effortlessly. From Coinbase to Uniswap and MetaMask to Phantom, Stripe’s worked with a host of leading crypto companies and its pilot with Solana and USDC is a case study in how major fintechs can embrace digital assets. Like Circle, Stripe is primarily interested in stablecoins when it comes to crypto acceptance and it deserves credit for working quietly yet efficiently to mainstream stablecoin acceptance among global businesses. Thanks to its Stablecoin Financial Accounts service, companies in more than 100 companies can accept assets such as USDC and connect blockchain rails to traditional financial ones such as SEPA and ACH. Mercuryo Mercuryo is a full-stack fiat-crypto infrastructure provider that’s intent on making it easier to move money in and out of the thriving cryptoconomy. It’s deeply integrated into a slew of fintech applications, both web3 and web2, making fiat-crypto conversion a cinch. Mercuryo’s on-ramps can be found in the apps you use everyday and the DeFi services you connect to using your web wallet, bolstered by Passkey login for biometric UX that adds an additional layer of security while simplifying authentication. When you decide it’s time to convert your cold storage crypto back into fiat, for example, Mercuryo’s Ledger Live integration is the solution you turn to. Its Spend crypto debit card, embedded in Ledger Live and other major wallets such as MetaMask, securely facilitates this. Mercuryo does similar for centralized crypto exchanges too such as Bitget and Bybit and has recently added partners such as zkSync and 1inch. The power of Mercuryo lies in its ability to make crypto spendable in the real world without needing to leave the sanctity of your web wallet or switching apps. It’s convenient and it’s just what crypto needs to inch its way into mainstream finance. Circle You might not have interacted with them directly, but if you’re a crypto user, you’ve almost certainly used Circle . Issuer of USDC, the second largest stablecoin by market cap with a total supply approaching $50B , Circle has done more than virtually any other company to mainstream crypto adoption. Not by shilling volatile tokens, but by quietly providing the infrastructure for blockchain-based payments to flourish. Dull, predictable, and drama-free, USDC does everything you could ever wish of a stablecoin. But driving mainstream adoption of stablecoins calls for more than merely issuing millions of the tokens onchain: there needs to be a way of getting them into the wallets of ordinary people – people who might not ordinarily have cause to consider using crypto. To achieve that, Circle’s constructed APIs and SDKs to embed stablecoin payments and treasury management into web2 and web3 platforms. Circle has its tentacles into fintech and e-commerce apps all over the web, making it easier to pay for goods and services using USDC. Zero Hash Zero Hash is a lot better than it sounds. Its API-based infra is all about making crypto easier for businesses to accept – with a particular focus on stablecoins. Are you spotting a pattern yet? Zero Hash has proven to be particularly popular with neobanks and fintechs that are looking to add crypto functionality. After getting them accustomed to the softer stuff – stablecoins – Zero Hash is amenable to serving them harder cryptos such as BTC, but all in good time. A phrase you’ll encounter a lot in the context of embedded finance is “turnkey” which can be loosely translated as “we’ll do the hard work for you.” Zero Hash’s turnkey solution allows your business to send and receive crypto without getting bogged down in integration and regulation. With more than $45B in volume settled through its infra, Zero Hash is the largest crypto company you’ve never heard of. That’s because it’s all abstracted away, freeing the company to focus on supplying crypto-as-a-service infrastructure to power trading, custody, and rewards in apps such as Step and Stripe. Ramp Network Looking for an on-ramp? An off-ramp perhaps? There’s a full-stack crypto provider out there that’s got what you need. Ramp Network is in the ramp business, giving web2 and web3 companies the tools they need to move from onchain to off and then back again on a dime. Its embeddable fiat-crypto ramps, complete with customizable UX, slot seamlessly into your app – that’s why they call it embedded finance. There’s a lot to like about Ramp, such as free integration, excellent support, and the promise of ultra-fast transactions, putting an end to interminable waiting for crypto to confirm. This may not mean much to the current generation of crypto kids, but to the OGs who were raised on Bitcoin’s 10-minute block times – with no instant mempool confirmation – it means a lot. Integrated into leading wallets such as Ledger, Brave, and Trust Wallet, Ramp is a much-loved gateway to and from the cryptosphere. All roads lead through Ramp. Stables No surprises for guessing what Stables is all about. The Australian startup offers stablecoin-powered wallets and Mastercard debit cards that integrate into everyday apps. The firm’s all about making it easier to use dollar-pegged tokens in daily life, be it for savings, bill payments, or groceries. Users can access Apple or Google Pay via the Stables app, with the crypto-fiat conversion slickly handled in the background. Stables is also popular with users requiring remittance services – something that stablecoins are well equipped to do given their borderless nature and instant settlement. The Stables app allows users to send stablecoins and receive cash, converting to more than 30 fiat currencies. Particularly popular across APAC markets, Stables is bringing onchain payments into the real world by blurring the lines between where one ends and the other begins. Unlimit Unlimit is a UK-based payment processor that bridges traditional finance and crypto via embedded rails for DeFi, wallets, and exchanges. Its cross-border, plug-and-play payment modules are prized by crypto companies expanding into global markets. Unlimit’s target market is businesses operating across EMEA, APAC, and LatAm, but it’ll work anywhere there’s a web connection and a need to convert between currencies. Unlimit helps businesses accept credit and debit cards in multiple currencies and from all the major card issuers. As a result, it forms a universal solution for businesses that are looking to expand but don’t want to get bogged down in regional regulations and red tape. A single API integration courtesy of Unlimit allows web businesses to accept it all. Nunchuk Nunchuk is a little different from the other companies featured here in that its primary business is Bitcoin custody. But make no mistake, it’s still a participant in embedded finance, since its multisig solutions are designed to be easily integrated by third parties. Nunchuk allows multisig key management, spending policies, and hardware security to be embedded into DeFi and treasury tools. As Bitcoin evolves into a global currency and digital gold – the bedrock for a host of other financial products – it’s critical that security for managing it is top-notch. In the future, you’ll take a loan against your BTC assets and Nunchuk’s multsig technology will protect it all, ensuring that everyone from DAOs to institutions is able to offer Bitcoin-backed products. Embedded Finance Is Taking Root Embedded crypto finance is the quiet revolution, mainstreaming digital assets from stablecoins to BTC with little fanfare. When it’s working properly – as it invariably is – you don’t even notice it’s there. But that’s the whole point. Its role is to meet people where they are on their turf, be it their favorite video game or their go-to social media app. For payments and savings; for tipping and remittance; for on-ramping and off-ramping. For value transfer of all kinds, crypto’s leading payment specialists are proving that anything traditional finance can do, they can do every bit as well.",Information,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 11:40:38

Dogecoin ( DOGE ) dropped to $0.2200 on Tuesday, down by 15% from its highest point this month. This decline, however, could be a calm before the storm ahead of an eventual rebound. Whale accumulation is continuing One of the top leading indicators in crypto fundamental analysis is whale activity. Whales, or large investors, are often seen as being more sophisticated and experienced players in the crypto market. In most cases, these whales accumulate when they expect that an asset’s price will bounce back and short when they see it falling. Data shows that Dogecoin whales have started buying it. Santiment data reveals that addresses with between 1 million and 10 million DOGE coins hold 10.56 billion coins, up from 10.48 billion on May 10. Similarly, addresses holding between 100 million and 1 billion tokens now hold 25.86 billion coins, an increase from 25.53 billion earlier this month. Dogecoin whales buying | Source: Santiment You might also like: AAVE rallies over 25% as a golden cross pattern nears Dogecoin price formed a bullish flag pattern DOGE daily chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Dogecoin price peaked at $0.2600 last week and then embarked on a downward trend to $0.2200 today. It has formed a bullish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign. This pattern comprises a vertical line and a consolidation that resembles a hoisted flag. In most cases, this pattern results into a strong breakout. Before this flag happened, DOGE price also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern. The head section was at $0.1298, its lowest point on April 7, while the shoulders were at $0.1520. Dogecoin has also moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Therefore, the coin will likely break out and then hit the November 2024 high of $0.4820, up by 120% from the current level. DOGE price forms giant megaphone on the weekly chart Dogecoin price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart also points to more Dogecoin price gains as it has formed a giant megaphone pattern. This pattern is made up of two ascending and diverging trendlines. In this case, the lower line connects the lowest swing since January 2022, while the upper one links the higher highs since January 2023. The pattern also usually leads to more gains. If this happens, the first point to watch will be at $0.4820. A move above that level will signal more upside, potentially to the psychological point at $1.

Traders executed 30,000 contracts of the $3,500/$6,000 call spreads across 10 separate trades, spending just over $7 million in initial debt/cost. The strategy will yield the highest profit if ether rises to or beyond $6,000 by Dec. 26. On Paradigm and Deribit, one options contract represents one ETH. Therefore, the large volume of the $3,500/$6,000 call spreads indicates a strong expectation of a bullish move to $6,000 by the end of the year. As of writing, ether changed hands at $2,510, according to CoinDesk data. Note that if ETH stays below $3,600, the strategy will expire worth less, limiting the loss to the initial cost of $7 million. Another downside of this strategy is that traders stand to lose out on potential upside above $6,000 due to the short position at that strike level. Ether's price has risen over 80% to $2,500 since early April, when the broader market panic saw ETH hit a low of around $1,390 on several exchanges. Magadini said there is no reason to call tops in ETH right now. ""I continue to like these upside trades, especially for the beat-up Ethereum, as risk assets continue to rally. There's a good argument for ETH ""catching-up"" as spot ETFs with staking rewards could be a catalyst for institutional participation and sentiment turns around. No reason to be calling tops right now,"" Magadini said.",Markets|Ether|Options|Markets|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-20 11:45:24
44851085,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67772,1747741537,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s Why Real Vision CEO Says XRP Will Soon See Fresh Rally,https://timestabloid.com/heres-why-real-vision-ceo-says-xrp-will-see-fresh-rally/,"Renowned macro investor and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal believes that XRP is preparing for further price appreciation, citing technical indicators that suggest the asset may soon break out of its current consolidation phase. His analysis, shared during a recent episode of the Rekt Vision podcast, highlights a bullish continuation pattern on XRP’s weekly chart. Technical Setup Suggests Upward Momentum According to Pal, XRP’s recent price movements align with the characteristics of a bull flag pattern, a technical structure often viewed as a sign of continued bullish momentum. This pattern typically consists of a sharp upward movement followed by a period of price consolidation. A breakout from this consolidation zone often signals the resumption of the previous uptrend. Pal identified that XRP entered this consolidation range following a significant rally between November 2024 and January 2025. During that period, XRP surged from $0.50 to a seven-year high of $3.40, marking a 580% increase. This dramatic rise formed the “flagpole” of the bull flag structure. However, after reaching its peak, XRP encountered resistance at the $3.40 level, triggering a correction that pulled the price below $2. Since then, the asset has gradually stabilized above the $2 threshold, trading in a narrow range for approximately four months.

The investor noted that while XRP has registered lower highs in recent weeks, indicating that bearish forces still exert some control, the broader technical setup supports the possibility of a breakout. Although Pal disclosed that he is not currently holding XRP, he acknowledged the strength of the chart pattern, stating that it points to potential upside in the near term. He referred to the setup as noteworthy and expressed confidence that XRP will likely enter another upward phase. Notably, Pal’s stance marks a shift from his previous outlook on XRP. He had advised investors to seek alternative assets when XRP was struggling around the $0.50 level. However, following the substantial rally sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s election victory in November 2024, which fueled broader market optimism, Pal revised his position and adopted a more bullish view. Estimating the Breakout Target While Pal did not specify a precise price target, standard technical analysis offers a method to project potential outcomes. In bull flag formations, the projected breakout target is calculated by adding the length of the flagpole to the price at which the breakout occurs. Given that the initial rally covered a $2.90 increase, and assuming a breakout above the current resistance level of $2.60, the implied target would be approximately $5.50. With the token currently trading at $2.32, achieving this target would require a gain of about 138%. Pal’s assessment adds to growing expectations that the asset may soon resume its upward trajectory, provided it breaks above key resistance levels and maintains bullish momentum.

The cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by 1.2% over the past 24 hours, now standing at $3.46 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $124 billion at the time of writing. TLDR: The crypto market has recorded a significant upswing, turning all the top 100 coins green; BTC briefly surpassed the weekly high of $106,500 yet again, before pulling back to $105,500; ‘Current Price May Be a New Baseline, Not a Transient Bubble’; Institutional interest and positive regulatory developments support the rally, primarily the US stablecoin bill advancement and the JPMorgan BTC announcement; The rally may be sustainable, not including typical pullbacks, but worries remain about overconfidence leading to corrections. Why Is Crypto Up Today – May 20, 2025: Crypto Winners & Losers In a sharp reversal from yesterday, when all top 10 coins per market cap were red, all have turned green today. Recording the highest decrease a day ago, Ethereum (ETH) is the best performer today. It’s up 7.1% to the price of $2,544. Its daily high is $2,693. Solana (SOL) is the second-highest gainer, having risen 4.8% to $168. At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated 3%, now trading at $105,498. This is a pullback from the day’s high of $106,518. Notably, not a single one of the top 100 coins saw their prices decrease in this time frame. Three recorded double-digit increases, becoming the day’s best performers. Aave (AAVE) is up 24.3% to the current price of $267.23, while Curve DAO (CRV) increased by 11% to the price of $0.7346. Lastly, Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) is up 10%, now changing hands at $1.97. Overall, the current upswing in the crypto market seems to be the result of a beneficial combination of institutional involvement, regulatory developments, macroeconomic factors, and technical market indicators. More specifically, following a week of intense negotiations, the US Senate has voted to advance the GENIUS Act , which would regulate stablecoins at the federal level. However, a final vote to pass the act will likely have to wait until after a federal holiday on 26 May. Tonight, the Senate moved forward on the GENIUS Act. This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation will bring America’s payment system into the 21st century. The GENIUS Act skyrockets the United States with a digital payment framework with the fastest rails possible. It will… — Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) May 20, 2025 ‘Current Price May Be a New Baseline, Not a Transient Bubble’ James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, commented on the similarities between the current bull run and BTC’s boom in November 2024, especially given the proximity to the all-time high. “There are definitely echoes of similarity,” he argues. In May 2025, Bitcoin increased from $94,000 to over $106,000, which was a 13% rise. Yes, “November’s bull run was far more energetic.” The price went up by 37% in a month, from $70,000 to $96,000. Nonetheless, “many of the driving forces appear to be the same with both periods marked by rapid price increases and strong institutional interest,” Toledano says. The current rise is fueled by the cooling tariffs, which helped ease market chaos and increased ETF inflows. Also, “unlike the largely sentiment-driven November rally, the current uptrend seems to be underpinned by tangible institutional adoption and policy support, suggesting a more sustainable growth trajectory.” According to Toledano, speculative elements remain, but the combination of institutional adoption and favorable economic conditions “suggests that the current price levels may represent a new baseline rather than a transient bubble, but as always anything is possible in crypto.” #BTC 's price surge stalled just below $106.6K – a level with 31K $BTC held at that cost basis. This supply cluster originated on Dec 16 and remains unshaken. Holders haven’t redistributed, nor averaged down – making $106.6K an important level to watch in the short term. pic.twitter.com/f7rXqtP6qD — glassnode (@glassnode) May 19, 2025 Levels & Events to Watch Next Since yesterday, Bitcoin has surpassed the weekly high of $104,400, previously seen in December 2024, and it has hit a new weekly high of $106,518. As BTC broke briefly through the $106,000 level, it now needs to be seen if it’ll be able to grab and hold it for long enough to be propelled further up. On the other hand, a support level is at $103,870, followed by the next significant one at $102,250, and then $97,000. The latter one is critical as a previous consolidation zone. Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has decreased from 71 to 68. This suggests optimistic sentiment, signaling investor confidence and willingness to take risks. This is typically the result of rising prices, increased buying, and high trading volumes. However, greed can also signal overvaluation and precede corrections. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, the market is boosted by investors entering it. Notably, US Banking giant JPMorgan will soon let clients buy Bitcoin . CEO and Bitcoin critic Jamie Dimon said on Monday: “We are going to allow you to buy it. We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.” “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” – Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO https://t.co/zc8CjKdAb9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 19, 2025 Additionally, there have been consistent spot ETF inflows supporting the price rise. According to a May 19 report by digital asset manager CoinShares , digital asset investment products recorded a fifth consecutive week of inflows last week, with $785 million. With this, the year-to-date inflows increased to $7.5 billion. On the one hand, this amount surpassed the previous high of $7.2 billion from early February. On the other hand, it “also fully recovers the near $7 billion of outflows experienced during the February–March price correction.” Source: CoinChares Meanwhile, the US Justice Department has opened an investigation into the recent security breach at Coinbase Global. Depending on the course of the investigation, it may have an impact on the market. What kind of impact, remains to be seen. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? Both the crypto market and the US stock markets posted gains due to the increase in investor optimism and macro elements overall. While the crypto market turned green across the board since yesterday, the S&P 500 went up 0.088%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.089%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.32%. That said, investors seem slightly more confident in the crypto markets today, especially as the US dollar has weakened. Is this dip sustainable? The current rally seems to be supported by significant institutional interest, as well as encouraging regulatory developments and macroeconomic conditions. Still, liquidity and market sentiment remain a concern, signaling continued caution.

The Mad Money host believes news publications are spreading negative news about the US market, saying it’s becoming “so difficult to own American stocks.” Cramer gave his opinion on social platform X early Monday, asserting that the WSJ’s top stories were damaging to investor confidence. “ The top ten stories in the WSJ today are even more negative than the top ten stories from yesterday!” he reckoned. Lots of negative news reports on the US market state Among the “front-page” stories on the publication is one headlined: “America’s Fiscal Situation Threatens the Good Mood on Wall Street.” The article explained how investors are selling US Treasuries, after financial firm Moody’s decision to cut the country’s last triple-A credit rating last week. In the bond market, Monday saw a sharp sell-off in US Treasuries, pushing yields to multi-month highs. The 30-year Treasury yield briefly surged above 5% before closing at 4.937%, up from 4.786% at the end of last year. The 10-year note rose to 4.473% from 4.437% on Friday. “ The size of recent budget deficits is particularly alarming because they’ve appeared during a period of economic strength ,” said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer at the United Nations Federal Credit Union. “ If we’re putting up deficits of this type now, what might it be like when the economy does run into any form of trouble? ” In another article, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Monday warned that US tariffs have not yet had their full economic impact. Dimon said the effects of new costs on goods and materials could slump company earnings and cause a pullback in the stock market. WSJ also published a report about the US Justice Department charging a Democratic congresswoman with assault following a confrontation involving federal agents and Newark’s mayor outside an immigration detention center. WSJ made fake reports about Elon Musk, Tesla struggles Earlier in May, a report from WSJ claimed Tesla’s board had begun looking for a new CEO because “Elon Musk was spending too much time in Washington, DC.” The Journal noted that Musk’s association with President Donald Trump has hurt Tesla’s image with some consumers. During the earnings call, CEO Elon Musk promised to use more of his time on raising the stock price of the EV business and announced plans for a robotaxi rollout in Austin this June. Analysts have continued to lower forecasts, now expecting 2025 EPS to fall to $2.03, down from $3.34 late last year. Yet, the stock’s price went up, pushing its 2025 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio from 94.6 on March 31 to a staggering 172.02 by mid-May. UnitedHealth rocked by DOJ probe report Last Thursday, WSJ posted an exclusive on UnitedHealth Group. According to the publication, the Justice Department is looking into Medicare fraud involving the healthcare giant. The probe, reportedly overseen by the department’s criminal fraud unit, has been active since at least the summer of 2024. This latest investigation joins a list of legal disputes for UnitedHealth. The company is also facing inquiries into possible antitrust violations and a civil investigation into its Medicare billing practices, as first reported by the Journal in February. However, in a statement shared by The Kobeissi Letter, the company said it had not been notified of any such criminal investigation and accused WSJ of publishing “deeply irresponsible” news.

Some Traders Are Betting on Ozak AI to Hit $1 Sooner,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/xrp-to-10-some-traders-are-betting-on-ozak-ai-to-hit-1-sooner/,"The post XRP to $10? Some Traders Are Betting on Ozak AI to Hit $1 Sooner appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto market gears up for another potential bull run, seasoned buyers are once again revisiting big-cap tokens like XRP, even as more modern entrants are exploring high-upside options like Ozak AI (OZ) . XRP has long been considered as a sleeping large because of its utility in cross-border bills and ongoing legal battle with the SEC. But can it realistically hit $10 in 2025, or is Ozak AI’s $1 target a greater viable and worthwhile bet? XRP Price Outlook: Can It Break $10? Currently trading around $2.31, XRP has proven resilience through regulatory hurdles and market volatility. Its all-time high of $3.84, reached all through the 2017 bull run, stays a key reference point for long-term holders. However, with the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit nonetheless unresolved, investor sentiment around XRP stays cautiously positive. Technical analysis suggests that for XRP to approach $10, it should break beyond key resistance degrees at $3.35 and $4.50. These degrees have historically acted as psychological and technical barriers. On the downside, XRP has organization help zones around $1.42 and $0.30, which have helped the token stabilize all through bearish stages. Some analysts agree with an agreement or win in Ripple’s desire to act as a first-rate catalyst, potentially pushing XRP above its preceding all-time high. However, accomplishing a 20x return to reach $10 would nevertheless require a big influx of capital and broader market enthusiasm—especially given XRP’s massive circulating supply. Youtube embed: $1 Target Set for OZAK, Buy OZAK AI at $0.003 is The Best Altcoin investment of 2025 Ozak AI (OZ) On the other side of the spectrum is Ozak AI , a new player that merges the power of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Priced at just $0.003 in its ongoing presale, Ozak AI has already raised over $1 million, highlighting strong investor interest. With its unique value proposition—offering AI-powered data solutions, predictive analytics, and intelligent trading models—Ozak AI is being eyed as one of the next big altcoin movers. Given its tiny market cap and early-stage pricing, the token would need a 300x move to reach $1—a feat that some traders believe is more plausible than XRP’s jump to $10. Why? Because Ozak AI doesn’t face the same regulatory baggage and is riding the wave of surging interest in artificial intelligence across all sectors. What sets Ozak AI apart is its utility-focused approach and real-world application. Unlike many speculative altcoins, OZ has a clearly defined use-case, making it attractive to both retail and institutional investors seeking exposure to the AI-blockchain intersection. While XRP’s fundamentals remain strong and a price surge could follow favorable legal developments, the path to $10 is steep and filled with uncertainty. Breaking past resistance at $3.35 and $4.50 is no small feat, especially in the current regulatory climate. Conversely, Ozak AI’s $1 target—though ambitious—might be more attainable given its low entry point, rising AI relevance, and early-stage momentum. For risk-tolerant investors chasing high returns in 2025, Ozak AI may offer the more explosive upside—making it a favorite among those betting on the next breakout star in crypto.

The crypto exchange's perpetual and fixed maturity futures contracts will now be available for retail and institutional customers in the European Economic Area (EEA), the firm said on Tuesday. Permission to trade crypto derivatives came via a Cypriot investment firm called Greenfield Wealth, which Kraken acquired earlier this year , securing the exchange a license from the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). The crypto derivatives space has seen some significant moves lately, with big players like U.S.-listed Coinbase (COIN) acquiring leading trading platform Deribit. In Europe, exchanges such as Bitstamp and Gemini are entering the fold, while the MiFID II license held by FTX EU has been acquired by BackPack . Kraken also made a $1.5 billion acquisition of NinjaTrader to drive derivatives trading in the U.S. As well as its European license, Kraken acquired Crypto Facilities, a U.K. FCA-regulated crypto futures platform, in 2019. Kraken’s joined-up approach means the contracts European clients will have access to already command a relatively high volume, roughly between $1 billion and $2 billion per day, according to Shannon Kurtas, head of exchange at Kraken. “This is not offering access to a new trading venue or new contracts,” Kurtas said in an interview. “These are existing contracts that have material volume trading on them and along with that comes established liquidity, better execution costs and fiat rails for getting collateral in and out efficiently and cheaply.” The recent introduction of Kraken’s Embed crypto connectivity application means neobanks and fintechs in Europe can also offer derivatives, as well as spot, to their clients, Kurtas said. Picking up licenses in smaller and arguably more nimble jurisdictions like Cyprus and Malta has become a well-trodden path for Crypto firms with deep pockets. “More nimble is probably a fair characterization,” Kurtas said. “Also, there's been an established set of firms, particularly in the CFD space, who traditionally have offered retail access to FX derivatives and CFDs, and so there's kind of a nexus of individuals, firms and know-how, if you will, in the area for these products.”",Finance|Kraken|Crypto Derivatives|Europe|MiFID II|News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-20 12:00:00

For BlockDAG (BDAG), that defining moment is set for June 13 during its official GO LIVE reveal. On this date, BlockDAG will announce all 20 exchanges where its coin will be listed. This move is expected to unlock wide access and strong liquidity. So far, five names are out: MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. These confirmed listings already place BlockDAG among the most credible launches of 2025. With its presale price frozen at $0.0020 and expectations rising, BlockDAG is emerging as the best upcoming crypto that could soon enter the top 50 rankings. BlockGAG’s Strong Presale Growth with Price Still Locked The presale phase of BlockDAG has gathered serious pace. It has now raised over $258 million and sold more than 20.8 billion coins. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262, which represents a gain of 2,520% from Batch 1. Despite this sharp growth, the project continues to offer its entry price of $0.0020 until June 13. What sets BlockDAG apart is the project’s real-world delivery and clear strategy. This is not a random coin push. It has a functioning system, ongoing releases, and actual confirmed listings. Market watchers now see BlockDAG as one of the top choices heading into Q3 2025. BDAG Exchange Listings Could Spark Early Market Traction The GO LIVE reveal is more than a simple roadmap update. It signals the start of widespread trading. With five exchanges already confirmed and fifteen more on the way, BlockDAG is preparing for a large-scale listing effort that few new coins manage. This push is not only about getting attention. It’s about gaining easy entry for buyers and creating multiple trading avenues. This kind of access often leads to early price discovery and rising market activity. As presale nears its end, the growing buyer base adds further fuel. Analysts believe this listing wave could push BlockDAG into the top 50 by market cap soon after launch. BlockDAG Begins Delivering X Series Miners BlockDAG is gaining traction because it brings more than talk. Actual product rollouts are happening. Its mining equipment is already being delivered, and video confirmations are expected soon. On top of that, BlockDAG includes a referral system that rewards users and a Buyer Battles feature that boosts daily engagement. These elements are not just added bonuses. They increase community involvement, raise on-chain activity, and promote holding. The more participants stay engaged, the stronger the ecosystem becomes. This consistent delivery is why many are calling it the best upcoming crypto to follow. Summing Up With $258 million raised, a price still fixed at $0.0020, and 20 exchange listings on the way, BlockDAG is heading into a key moment. The June 13 GO LIVE reveal is expected to open the door to higher liquidity and a possible top-tier ranking. For those entering late, the current price window offers rare value. As trading volume starts picking up post-reveal, BlockDAG could transition from a presale project into a top crypto with daily traction. That makes it not only a strong project but the best upcoming crypto to watch right now.

What The Volume Trend Says,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/can-dogecoin-price-reach-0-7/,"The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more.

33767162,[object Object],1747742448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against Strategy Over Alleged Bitcoin Misleading,https://bitcoinist.com/class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-strategy/,"On May 16, a class action lawsuit was filed against Michael Saylor’s Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) and its top executives, including President and CEO Phong Le and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang. The plaintiff , Anas Hamza, alleges that the Bitcoin (BTC) proxy firm misrepresented crucial aspects of its Bitcoin investment strategy, potentially violating federal securities laws. Plaintiff Anas Hamza Sues Strategy The lawsuit claims that Strategy’s disclosures misled investors regarding material facts about its Bitcoin holdings and corporate strategy. Hamza is bringing this suit on behalf of other shareholders who may have suffered losses due to the company’s alleged misleading communications. Specifically, the case cites violations of the Securities Exchange Act, which governs the accurate disclosure of information to investors, searching damages for these alleged violations. Some of the firm’s skeptics, like Bank of America analyst Craig Coben, are worried that the firm’s aggressive approach to Bitcoin accumulation could expose stockholders to a lot of volatility in the market. The expert has earlier stated that this continued accumulation could turn into a “vicious cycle” if the Bitcoin price collapses. However, Coben highlighted that as long as Strategy can fetch a premium to its net asset value , shareholders will benefit. Michael Saylor has also previously promised the firm’s investors that the company would be fine even if the cryptocurrency’s value dropped 90% and stayed that low for another four or five years. Saylor Reveals New Bitcoin Purchases Despite the legal challenges, Michael Saylor has not publicly commented on the lawsuit. However, he disclosed on Monday further Bitcoin purchases on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), indicating that the company remains committed to its aggressive acquisition strategy. Through a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing , the Bitcoin proxy firm disclosed its acquisition of an additional 7,390 Bitcoin for approximately $764.9 million, purchasing these coins at an average price of $103,498 each. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, valued at around $40.18 billion. Saylor further noted that the firm achieved a Bitcoin yield of 16.3% year-to-date (YTD) for 2025. Since reaching a yearly low of $232 in April, the firm’s stock, MSTR, has also achieved notable gains. It now trades at $410, reflecting a 76% increase that mirrors Bitcoin’s price recovery above the pivotal $100,000 threshold, indicating a resurgence of capital in the market following a challenging end to the first quarter of the year.

The rally comes as the GENIUS stablecoin bill passed a key vote in the Senate, which lifted market confidence. If BTC breaks past its $109K all-time high, it could drive prices even higher, triggering a full-blown altcoin season. Crypto market just broke out after 3 years and retested key levels. Analysts believe that altcoins will rally more than BTC due to the upcoming rate cuts, staking ETFs, and new regulations that will boost risk assets. Bitcoin vs Altcoins The battle between Bitcoin and altcoins is heating up and it all comes down to one crucial level on the Bitcoin Dominance chart. Bitcoin Dominance is currently at 64%, a crossroads that could either send altcoins crashing or launch them into a new rally. What happens next could shape the short to mid-term outlook for altcoins. What If Bitcoin Dominance Rises? If Bitcoin moves higher from here, breaking above the 64% dominance, then it could attract even more attention and capital. This could mean that altcoins might stay weak or even drop further. But if Bitcoin gets pushed down below 64%, then altcoins could bounce, sparking an altcoin rally in the market. If Bitcoin’s price keeps climbing, then BTC dominance could stay high and altcoins will lag behind. And if Bitcoin pulls back or stays steady, altcoins will get a chance to shine on. Altcoin Season To Start After BTC Hits Key Level Arthur Hayes predicts that altcoin season will not start until Bitcoin breaks above $110,000. Once that level is cleared, Bitcoin could rally toward $150K–$200K by summer, with profits likely flowing into altcoins soon after. He expects the 2025 alt season to be smaller than 2021’s noting that many older tokens with high FDVs and low demand may not bounce back. Is It Too Early For Altcoin Season? Ethereum has outpaced Bitcoin, pushing the ETH/BTC pair up 34% in a week, its first major breakout since Dec 2024. This has fueled altcoin season talks. However, key indicators say it’s not here yet. Altseason isn't cancelled. It's delayed! pic.twitter.com/iyykrJD68J — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) May 20, 2025 In 2022, Ethereum jumped 121% in just over a month, that sparked a major altcoin season. Back then, 75% of the top 50 coins outperformed Bitcoin, and the altcoin season index hit 96. However, currently the Altcoin Season Index is just at 25, and only 18% of top 50 coins are outperfroming BTC. A full altcoin season may still be a few weeks away, but its not confirmed yet. Bitcoin Dominance has dropped to 63% as of writing. Will Markets Stablilise? Some analysts claim that the drop in Bitcoin dominance does not guarantee an altcoin season. Investors might shift to Bitcoin if volatility kicks in again due to the ongoing macro uncertainties. Instead, with both bitcoin and altcoins having strong reasons to stay, the market could stabilize rather than shift dramatically.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 12:03:14

This initiative is part of Beijing’s broader strategy to lessen reliance on the U.S. dollar and increase its presence in international trade and financial markets. By promoting the yuan's international use, China hopes to boost its economic influence worldwide . China’s yuan has the potential to rival the U.S. dollar as a global currency, but only if it becomes more accessible and convertible, says economist Hoe Ee Khor from the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office. Khor believes the era of U.S. financial dominance is fading , and that the yuan—already used in cross-border payments—could step in, provided China opens its markets to foreign investors. He points to China's bond and stock market “connect” schemes with Hong Kong as a promising model, but stresses that broader access and freely tradable yuan-backed assets are still needed . Without these changes, global adoption of the yuan remains limited. Khor also referenced Asia’s $240 billion Chiang Mai Initiative, a financial safety net that could reduce regional dependence on the dollar in times of crisis. While unused so far, it reflects growing economic independence in Asia. Despite U.S. tariffs and global disruptions, Khor suggests East Asia will adapt, increasingly trading within the region and building stronger ties beyond American influence.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-20 12:05:51

Strategy’s (MSTR) perpetual preferred stock, STRK, achieved the largest proceeds from its weekly at-the-market (ATM) issuance since the program started in February, according to X account DogCandles , raising $59.7 million that was used to buy more bitcoin BTC, according to a Monday SEC filing. That amount corresponds to the issuance of approximately 621,555 STRK shares. Strategy has about $20.79 billion still available in the STRK ATM facility. The company led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is plowing ahead with its bitcoin-buying strategy even as the price of the largest cryptocurrency holds above $100,000, with an eye on its January record of $109,000. Strategy's Monday BTC purchase took its total holdings to 576,230 BTC. This represents a 16.3% BTC yield , a key performance indicator (KPI) that reflects the year-to-date percentage increase in the ratio of MSTR’s bitcoin holdings to its assumed diluted shares outstanding, effectively measuring the growth in BTC exposure on a per-share basis. The recent STRK issuance represents just under 9% of the total proceeds generated from the ATM program for the common stock, which has raised $705.7 million to date. This highlights the increasing role STRK is playing in Strategy’s bitcoin acquisition model. STRK features a fixed 8% annual dividend, which is based on the $100 per share liquidation preference, resulting in an annual payout of $8.00 per share. That gives it an effective yield, annual dividend divided by STRK share price, of 8.1%. Importantly, this yield is inversely related to the share price. As STRK trades higher, the yield decreases, and vice versa. Since its launch on Feb. 10, STRK has risen by 16%, outperforming both bitcoin, which has added 10%, and the S&P 500, which has declined by 2% over the same period. According to data from the Strategy dashboard, STRK exhibits the lowest correlation with MSTR common stock, sitting at just 44%. In contrast, STRK maintains relatively higher correlations with broader market benchmarks: 71% with bitcoin and 72% with the SPY exchange-traded fund. This suggests that STRK trades with a unique profile, potentially appealing to investors seeking differentiated exposure due to its hybrid nature as a preferred equity instrument with bitcoin-tied capital deployment.",Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|S&P 500|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-20 12:08:30

Shares of the company surged more than 90% during regular trading hours on Monday following the news. Nasdaq-Listed DigiAsia Plans $100 Million Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Strategy The company announced in a press release that its board of directors approved a strategy to allocate 50% of its future net profit to Bitcoin (BTC) purchases. While no BTC has been purchased yet, DigiAsia has emphasized that it is “actively exploring” raising capital to fund this initiative, revealing its intention to join the number of public companies that have integrated Bitcoin into their balance sheets. Shares of DigiAsia rose 91% to $0.36 in Monday trading, but were down 22% in after-hours trading. Despite that gain, the stock is still down more than 50% since the beginning of the year. “We believe Bitcoin is an attractive long-term investment and a foundational asset for modern treasury diversification.” — Prashant Gokarn, DigiAsia Corp. Co-CEO The company added that it is evaluating various financing mechanisms, including convertible bonds and crypto-linked instruments, to support its Bitcoin strategy. It also plans to generate returns on its assets through institutional lending and staking through regulated partners. DigiAsia reported in an update in April that it forecast $101 million in revenue and $12 million in EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for 2024. It remains to be seen whether the company will successfully raise funds and implement its Bitcoin purchasing strategy, but the announcement has clearly piqued the interest of investors. DigiAsia joins companies like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet that are positioning Bitcoin as a long-term institutional asset. *This is not investment advice.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $3.54. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $5.76 and an average forecast price of $5.53. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The network has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.762 Market Cap $1.19B Trading Volume $1.19B Circulating Supply 1.56B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4802 (Oct 23, 2017) 24-hour High $0.7862 24-hour Low $0.7552 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 11.56% 50-Day SMA $0.721859 14-Day RSI 50.63 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.635997 EOS price analysis: EOS falls toward $0.75 as sellers lead the market TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a downtrend as sellers plunged the price toward $0.75. The altcoin lost 1.68% of value. EOS coin prices seek support around $0.725. On May 20, 2025, EOS price analysis revealed a bearish trend for the altcoin. The EOS value further dipped toward a $0.7552 low in the past 24 hours. From an overall analysis, the altcoin suffered up to 1.68% of a loss today, as bears are maintaining a strong grip on the price charts. However, the price may get some cushion around the $0.725 support zone. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirmed a downward price trend. EOS/USD value has stepped down to $0.7552 in the day. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify an intensifying bearish drift. Selling pressure has trapped the market for the altcoin, plunging the price toward the low of $0.7552. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is still high, leading to high volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.950. Whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.648. EOS/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present below the neutral line. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 48.58. The downward curve on the RSI graph signifies a rising bearish strength. If the selling activities continue to intensify, further instability within the market conditions can be expected. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin confirmed a downward trend in the market. The altcoin value has dropped down to $0.7552 as bears continue to defend an upward move. The decline in volatility marks a lower chance of a reversal in the market trends. The Bollinger bands have shrunk, hinting at a decline in the volatility. This decline in volatility signifies a lower market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.830, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.745, marking the support. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is present below the mid-line. Currently, at 41.41, the RSI level is declining from its previous level, confirming the bearish domination around EMA trend lines. The steep bearish slope on the indicator’s graph refers to a rising selling pressure. If the selling activities continue to dominate over the buying activities, further descent can be expected.

EOS price analysis gives out a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. EOS/USD value has stepped down to a $0.7552 low in the past 24 hours. If sellers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a decline toward immediate support line of $0.725. On the other hand, a push by the buyers could create a strong rebound on the price chart. As a result, EOS price might see a strong push toward $0.95. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 35% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1. Why is EOS down? Following the recent rejection around the $0.812 level on the EOS price chart, sellers gained control and plunged the price below immediate support channels around $0.755. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.725 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the end of 2026 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2030. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $5.76 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 63rd ranked cryptocurrency. It also observed good bullish sentiment in November last year when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $5.76 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time. Recent news/opinion on EOS Vaulta announced that its current total value locked (TVL) has reached $261 million. The blockchain also claimed that its ecosystem is under expansion, with its all-time high TVL recorded at $299 million.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April. In May, EOS is changing hands at $0.72.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-20 12:10:00

Collaterize ( COLLAT ) is up 37% in the past 24 hours, continuing its breakout rally that began two days ago on May 17, when the price decisively pushed through the $0.27 resistance level with a spike in trading volume. Since that breakout, COLLAT continued climbing, reaching an intraday high of $0.89 today. This marks an approximate 240% gain at its peak in just two days. However, the price has since retraced and is currently trading around $0.78. Source: TradingView The rally follows months of sideways movement within a tight range since late March. A steady upward leg began on May 6, after the price tested key support around the $0.08 – $0.10 level—its lowest level in recent months. From there, buyers stepped in, gradually driving the price higher and setting the stage for the current rally. With this ongoing rally, COLLAT price has also broken above a major resistance level at $0.040, which had marked its post-launch peak. With both resistances now cleared, the path to the upside is now clear. Adding to the bullish case, the project currently holds a modest market cap of just $70 million, suggesting multiple-X growth potential—provided that trading volume and bullish momentum continue to support price action. However, the RSI is currently above 90, indicating extreme overbought conditions. Therefore, a pullback or consolidation is likely before any sustained move higher.

This could be because of the overall crypto market slump after many investors chose to cash out on the recent surge. In this environment, smart money turns to one presale star – Unilabs (UNIL). The UNIL altcoin is now in the second round of its presale and has already raised over $600K while giving early buyers nearly a 30% return. Interest is high as it is the fuel behind the first AI-powered DeFi asset manager that changes the market forever. Due to all these factors, people think that UNIL is one of the altcoins to watch for fast returns this cycle. Unilabs (UNIL) Presale Momentum Picks Up Unilabs (UNIL) is gaining mass appeal while the Dogecoin price and the price of SHIB are bleeding on the charts. Its presale has been making headlines for a good reason as it recently surpassed $600K raised. Given that it is still in phase two, this number could reach millions by the time it ends. The interest in Unilabs is high since it redefines the DeFi market by becoming the first AI-driven DeFi asset management platform with over $30M AUM. Data-driven market research allows the Unilabs launchpad to find the assets that offer the richest reward. Also, can use an innovative meme coin identification tool that assesses a meme coin’s virality and listing potential. This will help traders make the best choice when looking at meme coins. People are interested in this presale as they can buy the UNIL altcoin for a discount. By holding this token, they will get up to 122% APY in staking rewards and VIP support on the Unilabs platform. Currently, one UNIL costs just $0.0051. However, this altcoin price will hit $0.0062 when phase three begins. Since it also has more utility than meme coins and taps into the AI market, UNIL could see faster growth than DOGE and SHIB. Expert Foresees a Rally for the Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin that has recently seen some red price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of SHIB dipped nearly 20% on the one-week chart. Its value fluctuated between $0.000017 and close to $0.000013 during that time. Market expert Henry thinks a rally will soon come for Shiba Inu (SHIB). In a recent X post, he said that with the Shibarium adoption growing and aggressive token burns, an uptrend is right around the corner for this meme coin. Henry predicts a potential surge to $0.000090 for the price of SHIB. Despite this bullish Shiba Inu price prediction, many traders are still cautiously optimistic. Given that its market cap sits at $8B, a lot of new money needs to roll in for the price of SHIB to skyrocket. Thus, traders are focusing on UNIL instead. CEO: The Dogecoin Price Looks Set To Surge Dogecoin (DOGE) is another meme coin that has faced some turbulence recently. Its value dipped from around $0.25 to nearly $0.20 in the past seven days. In other words, an almost 15% drop in the Dogecoin price in just a few days. Despite this movement, people are excited because of a bullish Dogecoin price prediction from the analyst CEO. According to his X post, the meme coin looks great on the charts as it follows a re-accumulation pattern. He foresees a potential jump to $46 for the Dogecoin price before 2026 ends. But, many traders are still sidestepping Dogecoin (DOGE) for UNIL. As the Dogecoin price has already increased over 40% on the YTD chart and has yet to reach $1, a valuation above $45 may be nearly impossible. What Makes Unilabs (UNIL) Stand Out From Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE)? While the price of SHIB and the Dogecoin price could move into the green territory again soon, all attention is on Unilabs (UNIL) at the moment. Since SHIB and DOGE are meme coins based on hype only, UNIL stands out as it has more practical use cases and a smaller market cap. In other words, its adoption could come more easily while less new money is needed for a big price surge. As a result, traders are rushing to get into the UNIL presale and buy this altcoin before its value skyrockets.

While a deeper short-term correction remains possible due to prevailing supply and overbought conditions, market structure and momentum suggest a potential bullish breakout in the mid-term. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart ETH’s recent bullish momentum has pushed the price toward the critical $2.5K resistance zone, which aligns with the 200-day moving average—a historically significant level of supply and market reaction. Upon testing this confluence of resistance, Ethereum has lost its upward momentum, entering a temporary consolidation phase. A decisive breakout above this psychological barrier and the 200-day MA would signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially marking the beginning of a broader bullish reversal. Such a move could propel the price toward the $3K threshold in the mid-term. However, the presence of a resting supply at this level, combined with the RSI indicator showing overbought conditions, increases the likelihood of a short-term corrective move. A continued consolidation within the $2.1K–$2.5K range remains plausible, offering the market time to reset before another breakout attempt. The 4-Hour Chart In the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum’s rally has visibly stalled at the $2.5K mark, with signs of distribution and selling pressure becoming apparent. This consolidation has formed a bullish continuation wedge—an often reliable pattern suggesting a temporary pause before a potential breakout. If the wedge’s lower boundary successfully holds, Ethereum could soon initiate a bullish breakout, reclaiming momentum and potentially breaching the $2.5K resistance zone. Conversely, a breakdown below this pattern would indicate a deeper correction, likely driving the price toward the key support level of $2.1K. In summary, ETH remains in a state of consolidation under a major resistance level. Traders should closely monitor the wedge structure and the $2.1K–$2.5K range for clues on the next significant move. Onchain Analysis The bubble chart below illustrates total trading volume across all exchanges, where bubble size reflects volume magnitude and colour indicates the rate of volume change, categorized as Cooling, Neutral, Overheating, and Highly Overheating. As shown, Ethereum’s approach to the critical $2.5K resistance level has led to an overheating state, characterized by a significant surge in trading volume. This spike is primarily driven by profit-taking activity and the presence of resting supply at this psychologically significant price zone. The overheated condition points to a likely short-term correction as the market cools down, paving the way for renewed accumulation. Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Bitcoin breaks past $105k, all eyes are turning to early-stage memecoins, and leading the charge is Pepeto, a low-cap contender stirring serious buzz. The crypto market is roaring once again as Bitcoin smashes through the $105,000 mark, reigniting investor interest across the entire digital asset landscape. But while BTC celebrates its new highs, savvy investors are shifting their focus to where the real upside lies, early-stage meme coins with momentum, narrative, and unmatched upside potential. And leading the charge? A project that’s quickly stealing the spotlight: Pepeto. With a presale price of just $0.000000129, Pepeto isn’t just another frog-themed memecoin, it’s a statement. Born from the untold chapters of Pepe’s history, Pepeto reclaims the original vision left behind. There’s even growing buzz in the crypto community that one of the original PEPE founders, allegedly pushed out before launch, is now behind Pepeto, finally delivering the roadmap, that was once abandoned. That story alone is fueling speculation and sparking community-driven momentum that’s impossible to ignore. But Pepeto’s appeal isn’t just tied to lore. It’s also deeply rooted in utility and strategy. The team has been steadily teasing a top-tier 1 exchange listing, expected to drop soon, a milestone that could massively boost visibility and credibility. Add to that the upcoming Pepeto Exchange, a memecoin-focused platform that offers zero listing fees and AI-powered fraud detection, and it’s clear that Pepeto isn’t just riding the meme wave, it’s shaping it. The project also integrates PepetoSwap, an advanced cross-chain bridge designed to make transfers between blockchains seamless, secure, and cost-effective. With a 420 trillion token supply, mirroring PEPE’s, and a rapidly growing community, Pepeto is positioning itself not just as a meme, but as a movement. While coins like Shiba and Pepe had their moments, Pepeto is giving the next generation of memecoin believers something fresh to rally behind.

According to Indian legal news outlet LawChakra , the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the growing use of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies while remaining largely unregulated. “This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins and is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction. Kant further highlighted that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space. “If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said. Related: Indian high court orders steps to block Proton Mail Government says review may follow The Additional Solicitor General of India — a senior legal officer representing the government of India — reportedly answered the request by saying that the government “will take instructions, my lord,” indicating that the government may consider reviewing the country’s current cryptocurrency regulation. The report follows a May 5 hearing by the Supreme Court of India during which Kant and lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani shared their views on cryptocurrency. Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.” Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registration While this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers. The lawyer also showed that he misunderstood the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, claiming that he was from Japan: “It was created by someone from Japan who used a fake name.” Concerns over misuse Kant also expressed concern over the misuse of cryptocurrencies during the hearing. He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.” Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.” India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators. The lack of regulation has drawn criticism from both the industry and policymakers amid the asset class’s continued growth.

The structure is tightening, signalling an imminent breakout. However, momentum has cooled, and the market is awaiting a catalyst. Technical Analysis The USDT Pair XRP/USDT continues to respect the boundaries of a large descending channel. The price recently failed to break above the $2.60–$2.80 resistance zone, which aligns with the upper trendline of the pattern. On the downside, the $2.10-$2.30 support area remains critical, especially with both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages holding below the price in this range. A confirmed breakdown of this level could open the door for a retest of the $1.90 zone, while a breakout above $2.60 may push the price toward the $3.20 region. Meanwhile, the RSI sits around 50%, indicating a neutral stance with a slight bearish bias. The BTC Pair XRP/BTC is compressing within a falling wedge, currently trading just above the 2100 SAT support area. The pair recently got rejected from the 2500 SAT resistance zone, which overlaps with the wedge’s upper trendline and the 100-day moving average. The 200-day MA near the 2300 SAT mark has also been broken to the downside, making further downside and breakdown of the 2100 region highly probable. The RSI also shows values around 40%, signaling that the bearish momentum is still in play. So, unless buyers step in soon, a breakdown from the wedge pattern could trigger further Ripple weakness against Bitcoin, which could also translate to a downtrend against the dollar.

Analysts forecast a major breakout, with Ali Martinez eyeing $1 under certain conditions. Others predict a climb to $3 before the end of the year. Major Rally in the Cards? Cardano’s native token might be down 9% in a week, but some essential metrics hint that the price may soon rebound and even head toward historic peaks. An example is the exchange netflow, which has been predominantly negative in the last several months. Data compiled from CoinGlass shows that investors have moved almost 980 million ADA tokens since the beginning of 2025. Calculated at current rates, the stash equals roughly $680 million. ADA Exchange Netflow, Source: CoinGlass Moreover, there has been only one week this year when the netflows were positive. A similar trend was observed between mid-May 2021 and the end of August the same year. At the start of the period, ADA’s valuation hovered at less than $1.80, while months later, it skyrocketed to an all-time high of over $3 (representing a nearly 75% increase). The cryptocurrency currently trades at around $0.72, meaning that a potential ascent of that type would push the price above $1.25. Even if the development doesn’t result in such a gigantic surge, it is generally considered a bullish factor. It suggests that investors have shifted from centralized exchanges toward self-custody methods, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. Price Forecasts Some popular market participants also assume that ADA could head north soon. Ali Martinez recently predicted that the price may reach $1 if it first rises above $0.81. Another analyst who chipped in is Henry, an X user with almost 120,000 followers. They characterized ADA as the ocean: “calm, deep, and misunderstood.” Nonetheless, Henry claimed that when the asset moves, it sends ripples throughout the entire market. “While the crowd chases fireworks, Cardano is shaping infrastructure. Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast, and ADA’s tide is turning,” the X user argued. The analyst concluded with a price forecast, envisioning a rise to as high as $3 sometime this year.
