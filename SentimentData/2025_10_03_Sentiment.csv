Rebound confirmed at $0.22 support and 100‑day EMA Futures Open Interest rose to $4.23 billion, showing strong speculative positioning. Liquidity clusters above $0.25 and historical trendline bounces make $0.30 a key near‑term target. Dogecoin price rebounds off $0.22 support, reclaims key EMAs and shows bullish on‑chain signs toward $0.30. Read full technical breakdown and trade signals now. What caused Dogecoin’s rebound? Dogecoin price bounced after hitting the $0.22 support level that coincided with the 100‑day EMA, prompting buyers to step in. Short‑term momentum improved as DOGE reclaimed the 20‑day EMA (~$0.24) and the 50‑day EMA (~$0.23), triggering a rapid 9% intraday recovery and renewed upside interest. How do on‑chain metrics support the bullish case? CoinGlass data showed DOGE Futures Open Interest surged to $4.23 billion, indicating more capital and speculative exposure. Liquidity heatmaps reveal clusters above $0.25, which can act as magnets for price if momentum persists. Rising OI with liquidity above current price typically amplifies directional moves. Dogecoin [DOGE] bounced from a key technical level this week, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The memecoin dipped to $0.22 before recovering sharply and retesting a rising trendline support. Bulls defended the $0.22 zone, sparking a 9% daily gain that preserved the broader uptrend. The zone aligned with the 100‑day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), reinforcing its strength as support. After the rebound, DOGE crossed above the 20‑day EMA at approximately $0.24 and the 50‑day EMA near $0.23. That technical shift boosted confidence in a potential move toward the $0.30 resistance level. Source: TradingView DOGE on‑chain metrics: what do they show? Futures Open Interest surged to $4.23 billion, signaling increased leverage and participation in DOGE futures markets. That level of OI typically reflects higher speculative conviction and can precede sharper intraday moves. CoinGlass’ liquidation heatmaps show multiple liquidity pockets above $0.25. If buyers sustain momentum, those clusters may attract price up to near‑term resistance bands. Source: CoinGlass Liquidity patterns also supported upside potential. CoinGlass’ DOGE/USDT liquidation heatmap highlights multiple resistance clusters above $0.25 that can act as price magnets if momentum continues. Source: CoinGlass History repeats at trendline support — what does the past tell us? Dogecoin has previously produced sharp rallies after similar trendline rebounds. Early July and earlier this month saw rebounds from comparable trendlines that led to 15–20% rallies within days. Those historical moves make $0.30 a logical near‑term target, but traders should watch funding rates and profit‑taking risk, which can quickly reverse sentiment.

Near‑term upside targeting centers on $0.30 if momentum holds. Immediate resistance sits at $0.24–$0.25; a sustained break above those levels increases the likelihood of testing $0.30 in the coming days. How risky is trading DOGE after this rebound? Trading risk is elevated due to higher futures open interest and concentrated liquidity. Use position sizing, clear stop levels (below $0.22 support), and monitor funding rates to manage fast reversals. Key Takeaways Support held at $0.22 : The 100‑day EMA and trendline acted as reliable support, initiating a sharp rebound. On‑chain confirmation : Futures OI reached roughly $4.23B and liquidity clusters above $0.25 suggest upside targets near $0.30. Risk management : Watch funding rates and set stops below $0.22; profit‑taking can quickly shift short‑term bias. Conclusion Dogecoin has displayed a technically constructive rebound from the $0.22 zone, with short‑term EMAs and on‑chain metrics aligning to support a push toward $0.30. Traders should combine chart structure, Futures Open Interest and liquidity heatmaps when sizing positions.

Goolsbee stated that the shutdown would most directly impact federal employees by not receiving their salaries on time. He argued that without the release of economic data, the Fed would be “virtually blind” in its decision-making process. “Even if official unemployment data isn't available,” he said, “we will make decisions based on other indicators we have.” Related News: On-chain Data May Indicate a Significant Dump Risk for This Altcoin Goolsbee stated that various indicators indicate the labor market maintains a certain degree of stability, noting that current data indicates the unemployment rate remains stable. However, he emphasized the importance of avoiding hasty interest rate cuts, saying, “We should avoid lowering interest rates too soon.” Finally, Goolsbee said he hopes the shutdown ends soon and doesn't impact the broader economy. As of this writing, a 25 basis point cut is widely expected for the Fed's interest rate decision on October 29, 2025. US President Donald Trump, however, is calling for a more aggressive cut. *This is not investment advice.

Institutional investors drove the rally with $676 million in net inflows on October 1, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust recording $405 million and Fidelity acquiring 1,570 BTC valued at $179 million in a single day. Bitcoin surpassed $120,500 today with trading volume exceeding $50 billion across all markets.

The potential reversal comes under the new CEO, Salim Ramji, who previously worked at BlackRock and has spoken about the promise of cryptocurrency. Vanguard finds itself in an awkward position as the largest owner of Strategy stock, primarily through funds tracking the Nasdaq 100, despite adopting a skeptical tone about Bitcoin. A Vanguard spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company “ continuously evaluates our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment ,” although they declined to confirm whether crypto ETFs are imminent. Even if just 1% of Vanguard’s 50 million customers decided to invest in Bitcoin ETFs, that would represent 500,000 new investors entering the market.

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the firm registered the name iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF as a “ 33 Act spot product ,” positioning it as a sequel to its $87 billion IBIT. The $12.5 trillion asset manager’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are generating more than $260 million in annual revenue , with $218 million from Bitcoin products and $42 million from Ethereum. Including smaller crypto holdings, BlackRock’s total digital asset custody now exceeds $101 billion. BlackRock’s Ethereum fund recorded $512 million in net capital inflows last week, according to Farside Investors. The firm disclosed $14.1 billion in digital asset inflows in its second-quarter earnings report, making the category one of its fastest-growing product lines despite representing only 1% of total assets under management. Technical Analysis Points to $128K Target With Consolidation Risk Bitcoin’s weekly chart displays systematic consolidation zones followed by impulsive advances throughout 2023-2025, with current positioning at $120,953 placing the crypto at the upper boundary of what analysts label “Price Discovery Uptrend 3.” Source: X/@rektcapital Each consolidation phase has lasted several weeks to months before resolving with breakouts. The pattern reveals consistent behavior where Bitcoin establishes base-building periods within horizontal ranges before breaking higher into new price discovery phases. However, diminishing percentage gains between each uptrend phase suggest potentially slowing momentum, with moves from $70,000 to $120,000 representing approximately 71% gains compared to 75% gains in the previous phase. The simplified price structure shows even a key break-and-retest pattern around the $110,000 level. Source: X/Coinvo Bitcoin appears to have broken above resistance, pulled back to retest this level as support, and is now positioned for potential continuation higher. Technical evidence supports a potential advancement toward $128,000-$135,000. However, the extended nature of the move suggests that this would likely occur with increased volatility and deeper pullbacks. The key support level for maintaining a bullish structure appears at $110,000-$112,000, where previous resistance is expected to provide support. Failure to hold this zone could trigger retracement toward $103,000-$105,000 channel support, while sustained breaks above $128,000 would open the path toward $135,000-$140,000 before testing upper channel resistance near $173,000.

ADA’s journey was always characterized by slow and careful advancement, prudent management, and research-driven innovation.l But slow and careful always have their shortcomings. It lays solid foundations while potentially lagging behind during seasons that privilege rapid progress and compelling narratives. Investors now wonder whether Cardano can reclaim its reputation of being a growth leader or remain forever shrouded by the shadow of ecosystems that progress faster. Right now, people are paying attention to new presales that do well because they are scarce, have community support, and are relevant. In retail areas on Telegram and X, excitement is growing for tokens that are not fully launched yet but are gaining attention. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to lead the discussion, making itself a strong candidate for presale with audits, fast growth, and a promise of high returns. The difference between Cardano’s slow decline and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s fast rise shows the two forces that are affecting the crypto market at this time. Cardano’s Slow Burn Cardano’s drop to $0.79 betrays some investor impatience. All its stress on peer-reviewed literature and academic rigor notwithstanding, its adoption timetable appears glacial compared with its rivals Solana and Ethereum. Its developers go on about its robust design, while its traders desire velocity and volume — its weakest points. The tension between ADA’s long-term promise and short-term patience simmers. The blockchain ecosystem keeps expanding through the form of governance upgrades and interoperability initiatives, but the market appears to be unsettled. The pullback reflects the broader volatility while also showing a sentiment that ADA failed to offer the breakout catalysts necessary to spark fresh rallies. The Emergence of Presale Narratives Whilst ADA consolidates, presales are getting all the attention. Early-stage token fans among retail investors will always be drawn to tokens that can send small allocations into overdrive. Presales provide one thing that majors don’t: the potential of exponential return that ground-floor access grants. Communities exist within this narrative. Speculation brews through Telegram channels, influencers shine a light on diverse initiatives, and money pours into tokens that will inevitably be “the next big thing.” Such vibrant energy separates itself from infrastructure projects, motivated not by thoughtful roadmaps but rather by an enduring outlook. MAGACOIN FINANCE As A Top Presale Contender Cardano’s slip under $0.80 highlights the difficulty of extracting large returns from established names. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining recognition as one of the top presale contenders, attracting both retail and whale discussions. Analysts suggest that early allocations could deliver 1,000%–1,400% ROI , given its structure and demand curve. The PATRIOT50X bonus code has added urgency for investors aiming to secure allocations before stages rise further. The contrast is sharp: ADA’s path to double requires billions in inflows, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s small cap base makes triple-digit ROI mathematically more accessible. This difference has fueled its momentum as the presale choice for those dissatisfied with Cardano’s pace. Whales And Retail Converge Whale tracking data indicates increased interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Big players are quietly positioning while retail groups offer ground-floor traction. Such alignment is uncommon — and potent. When whales and retails both get on board, tokens tend to explode dramatically. For traders managing their investments, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides something that ADA does not: quick results. While Cardano is a slow and steady investment, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors the excitement of possible big growth soon. Together, they show how investment portfolios can combine safety with risk. Changing Market Sentiment Cardano’s slow and steady approach is attractive to companies and individuals who plan long-term, but day traders want brighter horizons. The MAGACOIN FINANCE growth demonstrates how this desire appears. Investors don’t want to abandon good projects; they only want to invest in tokens that will rapidly multiply their funds. The outcome is a marketplace that caters to ADA for stability and research purposes and MAGACOIN FINANCE for future gains. The balance explains why MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the top choices during presales and why ADA is debated regarding its relevance during rapid adjustments. Conclusion Cardano’s drop to $0.79 reflects its struggle to maintain momentum in a market that rewards speed and excitement. Its academic foundation and careful governance remain valuable, but investors seeking rapid returns are rotating toward presales with viral growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its audits, scarcity-driven design, and strong community, has emerged as one of the top presale contenders of 2025. It represents the speculative spark that ADA currently lacks, offering retail and whales alike a chance to chase asymmetric upside. For portfolios, the lesson is clear: combine the long-term promise of projects like Cardano with the explosive potential of early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Solana has already seen added institutional action while it waits for prospective ETF approval, and regulatory go-ahead may trigger a robust leg higher and usher in billions of fresh inflows. But even considering SOL’s positioning, much of the market’s hype remains centered on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale project that’s sweeping the DeFi space off its feet. MUTM is now valued at a meager $0.035 in phase 6 of its presale. Mutuum Finance has already recorded over 16,700 holders and raised $16.7 million in pre-launch funds. With whales and retail traders both positioning for Q4, Mutuum Finance could be one of the best-upside altcoins heading into 2026. Can Solana (SOL) Reclaim $220 as Bulls Eye Key Technical Levels Solana (SOL) is flashing new strength after bouncing off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement near $193, a key technical level that has a tendency to be a launching pad for bull bounce-backs. Price action is currently heading towards a previously broken channel that will serve as near-term resistance, with investors carefully watching for potential short-term correction prior to the next decisive move. If momentum persists and market conditions remain favorable, reclaiming the $220 level seems quite within reach, pointing to a possible prolongation of SOL’s resurgence. As Solana gets back on its feet, investors also look for early-stage, high-potential coins that combine technical innovation with usability, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been a quick-emerging DeFi initiative attracting considerable buzz ahead of the next market cycle. Mutuum Finance Registers Robust Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still trendy in Phase 6 of presale, where it has seen more than 16,700 investors and more than $16.7 million. All this activity is evidence of the increasing faith in the long-term project vision and potential to build the future of decentralized finance. In their continuing commitment to security and transparency, Mutuum Finance partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Security engineers and developers are invited to find vulnerabilities in four levels of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low. This is just one part of Mutuum’s overall initiative to secure its infrastructure and gain the trust of its expanding community. Dynamic Interest Rates and Optimized Efficiency Mutuum Finance protocol is a real-time operating algorithmic floating interest rate system that dynamically reacts to liquidity levels. The borrow cost is lowered in times of high liquidity to incentivize lending and the inflow of new capital. The borrow cost increases when liquidity is low, thereby incentivizing new deposits and loan repayments. This self-regulating process discourages over-leveraging and promotes overall ecosystem equilibrium. Efficiency is augmented by collateral optimization, particularly for correlated assets. Well-collateralised positions have higher borrowing allowance and more favourable Loan-to-Value (LTV) margins, and reserve factors act as a buffer against market volatility. Volatile assets call for higher reserves to stem exposure to volatility, while less-volatile assets allow for higher borrowing with minimal liquidation risk. LTV margins and liquidation points are dynamically calibrated on the basis of each token’s own volatility profile, spreading the risk equitably across the platform. With its presale success, advanced risk management system, and unwavering commitment to security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming a stable and sustainable platform for long-term adoption, growth, and prosperity in decentralized finance. Pushing Ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to press forward, raising over $16.7 million from over 16,700 owners, with Phase 6 already over 55% sold at $0.035 per token. Whereas Solana (SOL) is poised to perhaps reach $220 in the wake of ETF rumors, MUTM rewards early birds with a high-potential DeFi trade through its dual lending protocol, variable interest rates, and robust security, including a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty program. Investors seeking exposure to a utility-driven, fast-growing altcoin should purchase MUTM tokens before presale is over.

Why XRP Is Still The Better Option,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-is-still-the-better-option/,"SWIFT’s decision to test a blockchain prototype with Consensys (Ethereum) has stirred debate in the crypto space, raising concerns about whether XRP’s role in global finance may be under threat. While Ethereum may offer experimentation, a crypto analyst argues that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) already delivers enterprise-grade performance, compliance features, and real-world adoption that institutions rely on. SWIFT’s Blockchain Partnership Challenges XRP Position On Tuesday, September 30, crypto market expert Pumpius shared a thread on X social media, unveiling the recent collaboration between SWIFT and Consensys that has triggered panic in the market. Although the partnership is presented as an innovative step, Pumpius argues that it exposes a fundamental weakness within SWIFT. According to the analyst, SWIFT has traditionally depended on legacy financial rails and is now attempting to modernize by leveraging Ethereum-based solutions. However, Pumpius points out that Ethereum continues to struggle with scalability, high transaction fees , and centralization concerns. He argues that while SWIFT is aware its legacy rails are deteriorating, adopting a “band-aid fix” is no replacement for core infrastructure. Ripple, on the other hand, has already moved beyond the experimental stage. Pumpius notes that the XRPL is designed to process transactions within three to five seconds, at minimal cost, making it far superior in terms of speed and accessibility. Unlike Ethereum prototypes, the analyst stated that Ripple’s solutions are actively in use across international payment corridors, supported by partnerships with over 100 banks, regulators, and major payment providers. Another major challenge that debates SWIFT’s Ethereum venture is compliance. Pumpius explained that global financial systems demand robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) frameworks—areas where blockchain options often face limitations. He highlighted that Ripple addresses these challenges head-on with the integration of the DNA Protocol, a system enabling verifiable digital identities, zero-knowledge proof verification , and on-chain compliance mechanisms that satisfy regulators while preserving user privacy. Why XRP Holds The Long-Term Advantage Upon further review of Pumpius’ analysis, he highlights that XRP’s position is strengthened by fundamentals that remain significantly relevant to institutions. He mentioned that Ripple has gained legal clarity in the US following the resolution of the SEC lawsuit and is also aligned with ISO 20022 , the global standard for financial messaging. The analyst further pointed to Ripple’s growing momentum, highlighted by the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin with SBI and its ongoing applications for banking licenses. Against this backdrop, he emphasized that institutions do not chase hype but rather adopt infrastructures that reduce costs, boost efficiency, and ensure compliance with regulations. In his view, RippleNet and the XRP Ledger already meet all three requirements, which explains their growing global integration. Concluding his report, Pumpius calls SWIFT’s blockchain move a “desperation play,” framing it less as a threat and more as a sign that change is inevitable. He also described the effort as experimental, contrasting it with Ripple’s rollout of solutions while Consensys pushes Ethereum through lobbying efforts. To XRP investors , he stressed that they are holding an asset with the potential to reprice immediately once new financial rails are fully activated.",XRP|AML|Anti-Money Laundering|ConsensYs|ISO 20022|know-your-customer|KYC|Pumpius|ripple|RLUSD|stablecoin|SWIFT|US SEC|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 22:00:09

Related Reading: Galaxy’s Digital Bitcoin Sales Continue: 1,190 Bitcoin Moves To Binance After bouncing from a September low near $0.205, HBAR has formed constructive patterns, an Elliott Wave advance, a double bottom, and a 10-week descending wedge, that together suggest a bullish turn. With a final decision on a proposed HBAR spot ETF expected in November, traders are wondering if a clear break above $0.23–$0.24 could lead to the $0.30 level. ETF Season Puts HBAR in the Spotlight Macro tailwinds are strengthening, with the SEC expected to make decisions on numerous crypto ETF applications in October–November. Analysts believe that current listing standards improve the chances of approval. Hedera, which has been under review for a spot ETF since 2024, could benefit from an increase in approvals that would expand U.S. investor access. Additionally, Hedera’s reputation in the enterprise sector, governed by reputable council members and involved in real-world finance initiatives like SWIFT panels and public-sector pilots, supports positive sentiment and keeps HBAR relevant as institutions seek scalable, low-cost settlement solutions. Elliott Wave & Wedge Patterns Flag Upside Continuation On the daily chart, HBAR completed a double bottom at approximately $0.205 (on September 5 and 26), with a neckline around $0.255. Price action has since contracted into a falling wedge lasting over 10 weeks, often a sign of upcoming breakouts, while analysts view the move as Wave 2 within an Elliott Wave cycle that started with a 140% surge from late June to late July. A shift into Wave 3, typically the longest and most impulsive phase, would bring the year-to-date high of about $0.3065 into focus, with potential to challenge last November’s peak of around $0.40 if momentum broadens. Market internals are also improving, with a rising Chaikin Money Flow indicating steady net inflows. A move above $0.242–$0.248 could trigger approximately $32 million in short liquidations, fueling any upside breakout. HBAR's price trends upside on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview Hedera Key Levels to Watch: $0.22 Support, $0.30 Resistance, and $0.40 Target The near-term structure remains tight. Traders need a clear close above $0.230–$0.242 to confirm a wedge breakout; reaching $0.248 could trigger forced short exits, boosting gains. Breaking above $0.30 would confirm the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and support the Elliott Wave projection toward $0.3065, then $0.35–$0.40 as market breadth improves. Related Reading: No Accident: The Powerful Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Late-September Rally On the downside, $0.205 serves as the main invalidation level.

Government Shutdown To Drag On, Polymarket Bettors Predict According to the poll titled “When Will The Government Shutdown End,” 43% of participating bettors believe that October 15 is the earliest date the U.S. government shutdown will end. Meanwhile, 35% of Polymarket bettors believe that the shutdown will come to a close between October 10 and October 14. October 6 through October 9 trails behind at 20% of the vote, followed by October 3 and October 5 with just 3% of the vote. Congressional Deadlock Continues With No End In Sight News of the Polymarket poll’s latest figures comes just one day after the U.S. government officially entered a shutdown after both Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on government spending bills. The congressional deadlock continued on Thursday following a failed vote on Wednesday that would have effectively ended the shutdown, leaving no end in sight to the political dysfunction. “…The president has directed his cabinet, and the Office of Management and Budget is working with agencies across the board to identify where cuts can be made, and we believe layoffs are imminent,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an October 1 statement. Meanwhile, key players in the crypto sector have urged U.S. lawmakers to work together in a bid to keep key policy initiatives from stalling. On Wednesday, leading crypto trade group the Blockchain Association took to social media to push members of Congress to find common ground and keep their “foot on the gas.” 1/ Bipartisan momentum is building in Washington around digital asset policy.

The meme coin has reclaimed a key 5-month breakout setup from near invalidation, rising over 7% since the start of the month and showing no signs of slowing down. Derivatives traders are leaning into the move. Coinglass data shows open interest up 10% to $200 million, a level last seen during September’s rally. Shiba Inu open interest surges.

Still, it remains widely sidelined from major market narratives like TradFi. Its open interest lags behind rival PEPE’s $600 million, underscoring the underdog position SHIB carries into the quarter. Shib Price Prediction: SHIB Could Be the Sleeper Pick This early-month rebound affirms the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle forming since May, now nearing its apex as momentum indicators flip bullish. SHIB / USDT 1-day chart, symmetrical triangle sets focus on breakout move. Source: TradingView. The RSI has reclaimed the neutral line, signaling buyers are driving the move. The MACD histogram shows a similar potential trend shift, closing in on a golden cross above the signal line that could mark the start of a lasting mid-term uptrend. The key threshold for a Shiba Inu price breakout sits at $0.0000145, a stubborn resistance level that has capped upside since July. A successful flip of this level into support would confirm the breakout, setting sights on $0.000025 for a potential 90% surge from current levels. But if Shiba Inu manages to claim a bigger share of the market narrative, particularly through new SEC listing standards qualifying it for spot ETPs, demand could expand dramatically. In that case, the rally could extend toward $0.00005, a milestone that would represent a 300% gain. It Took SHIB 5 Months to Get Here – Here’s a More Strategic Play Breakouts are rare for a large altcoin like Shiba Inu.

Bill targets high-usage miners with tiered excise rates to fund energy assistance. Tax ranges: 2¢/kWh (2.25–5M kWh) to 5¢/kWh (above 20M kWh); sustainable-energy miners exempt. Research cited estimates $79M added annually for individuals and $165M for small businesses in statewide electricity costs. New York Bitcoin miner tax proposed to fund energy aid; learn how the tiered excise works and who is exempt. Read the bill summary and implications now. What is the New York Bitcoin miner tax proposal? New York Bitcoin miner tax is a proposed excise on proof-of-work crypto mining under Senate Bill S8518 that charges miners 2¢–5¢ per kilowatt-hour based on consumption tiers and directs proceeds to Energy Affordability Programs to reduce bills for low- and moderate-income households. How would the excise rates and tiers work? Senate Bill S8518 sets tiered rates by annual consumption: miners using 2.25–5M kWh pay 2¢/kWh, 5–10M kWh pay 3¢/kWh, 10–20M kWh pay 4¢/kWh, and consumption above 20M kWh pays 5¢/kWh. Operations using verified sustainable energy are exempt , incentivizing cleaner power use while raising funds for utility relief. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/new-york-bitcoin-miner-tax"" }, ""headline"": ""New York Proposes Excise Tax on Bitcoin Miners to Fund Energy Assistance"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""New York lawmakers propose an excise tax on proof-of-work miners under Senate Bill S8518; funds go to state Energy Affordability Programs to offset higher utility costs.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How the proposed excise tax on Bitcoin miners would be applied"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step outline of how Senate Bill S8518 would assess and allocate the excise tax on proof-of-work mining operations."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Measure annual electricity consumption"", ""text"": ""Regulators calculate a miner's annual kWh usage to determine the applicable tax tier."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Apply tiered excise rate"", ""text"": ""Apply 2¢/kWh, 3¢/kWh, 4¢/kWh or 5¢/kWh based on the consumption bracket defined in the bill."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Verify sustainable energy status"", ""text"": ""Exclude operations that demonstrate use of verified sustainable energy from the excise tax."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Allocate revenue"", ""text"": ""Direct collected funds to New York's Energy Affordability Programs for low- and moderate-income households."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Who introduced the bill to tax Bitcoin miners in New York?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Democratic Senator Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Anna Kelles introduced Senate Bill S8518 to impose an excise tax on proof-of-work crypto miners in New York."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which miners would be exempt from the proposed tax?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Mining operations that demonstrate use of sustainable energy would be exempt from the excise tax under the proposed bill."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How will the tax revenue be used?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Revenue from the excise would be directed to New York's Energy Affordability Programs to provide assistance to low- and moderate-income households and reduce utility burden."" } } ]} Why are lawmakers proposing a tax on proof-of-work miners? Lawmakers say high-power crypto mining increases statewide electricity demand and can push up utility costs for residents and small businesses. The bill references research estimating an additional $79 million annually in costs for individuals and $165 million for small businesses tied to cryptomining-related rate impacts. What are the fiscal and policy implications? The excise would create a direct revenue stream for energy assistance while encouraging miners to switch to sustainable power to avoid taxation. State regulators would need to implement measurement and verification protocols for energy consumption and renewable sourcing. The proposal follows New York’s historically stringent regulatory stance on crypto operations. Frequently Asked Questions How much would the tax cost a typical large mining operation? Tax liability depends on annual kWh use. For example, a facility consuming 15 million kWh would face 4¢/kWh, resulting in $600,000 in excise payments annually under the proposed rates. Will this bill affect AI or other high-performance computing centers? The bill focuses on proof-of-work crypto mining and does not impose the excise directly on AI data centers. A bill release noted broader growth in high-power computing but did not include AI-specific levies in the current text. Key Takeaways Tiered excise: Senate Bill S8518 proposes 2¢–5¢/kWh based on annual consumption brackets. Exemptions: Verified sustainable-energy mining operations would be exempt to encourage cleaner power. Revenue use: Proceeds would fund New York’s Energy Affordability Programs to reduce utility costs for vulnerable households. Conclusion New York’s proposed Bitcoin miner tax aims to make high-energy proof-of-work operations contribute to utility relief funds while promoting sustainable energy adoption. Stakeholders — from mining firms to state regulators — will watch for implementation details, verification standards, and the bill’s legislative progress.

Yes. When megaphone formations are paired with rising volumes on breakouts and defended support levels, they can precede sustained rallies. Confirmation requires higher-than-average buying volume and macro stability. What indicators are most useful to track this setup? Volume, RSI, and moving averages are useful. Volume confirms breakouts, RSI gauges momentum (currently ~55), and moving averages help identify trend alignment and dynamic support. Key Takeaways Structure: Ascending megaphone with higher highs and lows supports a bullish view. Supports: $0.16 and $0.19 have been defended and validate the trendline. Actionable insight: Watch for volume-backed breakouts and RSI trends before committing to long positions. Conclusion This technical review of Dogecoin shows an ascending megaphone structure reinforced by defended supports and repeated accumulation cycles since 2023.

Morpho vaults on Cronos bring on-chain DeFi lending to Crypto.com users, with support for US users and vault launches expected this year. Crypto.com integrates Morpho on Cronos for stablecoin lending Users can deposit wrapped ETH/BTC (CDCETH/CDCBTC) and borrow stablecoins to earn yield via Morpho vaults. Morpho is the second-largest DeFi lending protocol with ~ $7.7B TVL (DeFiLlama); similar Coinbase integration reported yields up to 10.8%. Crypto.com Morpho lending on Cronos enables wrapped BTC/ETH deposits to borrow stablecoins and earn yield — learn how vaults work and what it means for stablecoin yields. Crypto.com is adding Morpho lending to Cronos, enabling wrapped BTC and ETH deposits as collateral to borrow stablecoins and capture DeFi yields via Morpho vaults. What is Crypto.com Morpho lending on Cronos? Crypto.com Morpho lending on Cronos is an integration that lets users deposit wrapped Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) tokens on the Cronos chain into Morpho-managed vaults to borrow stablecoins and earn yield. The feature embeds Morpho’s peer-to-peer lending overlays into Crypto.com’s platform for in-app DeFi access. How does Morpho’s stablecoin lending work on Cronos? Morpho matches lenders and borrowers on top of existing lending markets (e.g., Aave, Compound) and will open stablecoin lending markets on Cronos. Users deposit wrapped assets such as CDCETH and CDCBTC, then borrow stablecoins against them to earn yield from lending spreads and optimized routing. Industry data shows Morpho has grown rapidly, with a total value locked (TVL) of around $7.7 billion, per DeFiLlama. Coinbase’s similar integration cited potential yields up to 10.8% for on-chain USDC lending versus ~4.5% holding rewards on-platform. Total value locked on DeFi lending protocols. Source: DeFiLlama Why does wrapped crypto matter for Cronos lending? Wrapped tokens (CDCETH, CDCBTC) mirror value from their source chains and enable ETH/BTC liquidity to be used on Cronos without native chain transfers. This brings deeper collateral options to Cronos DeFi markets and expands on-chain lending capacity for Crypto.com users. Will US users have access to these vaults? Yes. Morpho’s co-founder confirmed the protocol will be accessible to US users. The Genius Act (July 2025) bans interest-bearing stablecoins but does not explicitly prevent exchanges or platforms from offering lending-derived yields, a distinction Morpho and Crypto.com cite to support access. Frequently Asked Questions Can I deposit wrapped ETH or BTC and earn yield on Crypto.com? Yes. Crypto.com’s Morpho integration will allow deposits of wrapped ETH and BTC (CDCETH/CDCBTC) into Morpho vaults on Cronos, enabling users to borrow stablecoins and capture lending yield while remaining on the platform. How much yield can users expect from Morpho vaults? Yields vary by market conditions. Industry integrations (Coinbase) reference potential on-chain lending yields up to 10.8% for USDC in some markets, while platform holding rewards can be lower (around 4.5%). Actual yields depend on supply/demand and onchain rates. Does the Genius Act prevent exchanges from offering these lending services? No. The Genius Act bans interest-bearing stablecoins but does not explicitly bar crypto platforms from offering lending services where users borrow or lend stablecoins. Legal interpretations may evolve, and platforms cite that lending is a distinct activity from stablecoin reserve yields. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/crypto-com-morpho-cronos"" }, ""headline"": ""Crypto.com Integrates Morpho Lending on Cronos to Enable Wrapped BTC/ETH Stablecoin Yields"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a664-5c45-7e93-a04d-e9c96d35cc82.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Crypto.com adds Morpho lending to Cronos, enabling wrapped BTC/ETH deposits to borrow stablecoins and earn yield through Morpho vaults accessible to US users.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can Crypto.com users lend wrapped assets via Morpho on Cronos?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Bitcoin, the $2 trillion giant of the crypto sector, is currently trading about 4% under its record peak of $124,128. It climbed 2% overnight, matching the 2% uptick in overall crypto market capitalization, which now sits at $4.19 trillion. October, often dubbed “Uptober,” has historically been among Bitcoin’s strongest months, boosting the odds that new all-time highs are on the horizon for multiple leading assets. Meanwhile, U.S. policymakers are providing additional momentum. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first federal statute to clearly regulate stablecoins, mandating full reserve backing. Soon after, the SEC rolled out Project Crypto , a sweeping update aimed at aligning securities regulation with digital assets. With clearer guardrails forming, analysts suggest this next altcoin rally could eclipse the 2021 cycle. Should Gemini’s outlook hold, XRP, Pi Network, and Shiba Inu may lead the charge. XRP (Ripple): Gemini AI Forecasts Significant Surge to $5 Gemini’s models predict Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb up to $5 by late 2025, a roughly 68% surge from its current price of $2.98. XRP has already shown notable strength this year. On July 18, it spiked to $3.65, surpassing its 2018 high of $3.40, before sliding nearly 18% amid global political and economic headwinds. Ripple continues expanding its international payments network, gaining institutional traction. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund recognized XRP as an affordable remittance option for emerging markets. Source: Google’s Gemini It also scored a huge legal victory: the SEC abandoned its lawsuit in early 2025, following a 2023 court ruling that retail XRP sales were not securities. Gemini’s outlook suggests that breaking decisively above July’s high could set XRP on course for $5 by year-end, although other LLMs like ChatGPT posit a more aggressive bull-case run, potentially lifting it into the $7–$20 range. Over the last 12 months, XRP has surged 404%, quadrupling Bitcoin’s 94% gain and Ethereum’s 79% climb. Technical signals are also supportive, with three bullish flag formations this year pointing to possible strength in Q4. While recent Fed rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF failed to spark a breakout. Upcoming XRP ETF rulings in the middle of the month, together with new US crypto legislation by Christmas, could serve as powerful catalysts. Pi Network ($PI): Gemini AI Expects Explosive 20x Growth From Mobile Mining Pi Network ($PI) pioneered the “tap-to-mine” model, allowing users to mine coins directly from their smartphones by simply logging in and tapping daily. Now trading near $0.266, Gemini outlines a scenario where Pi could rally to $5.20 before year-end, a 20× increase. With the team actively developing the ecosystem, several upcoming milestones could reinforce this bullish case. The network has been steadily rolling out updates, moving from version 19 to 23, with a possible mainnet launch ahead, developments that could act as strong price drivers. Since debuting in February 2025, Pi has been highly volatile, including a 171% surge in May. Its RSI has dropped to 30, suggesting undervaluation and room for a rebound, which means for believers, the best possible time to buy in is now. Retesting February’s $2.99 high is an ambitious but plausible target. Even if that doesn’t materialize, crypto’s historical October strength could still propel Pi toward the $1 mark by November, lining it up nicely for a festive bull run. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Gemini AI Predicts Up to 4× Upside in Bullish Conditions Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , launched in 2020, has positioned itself as Dogecoin’s fiercest rival, now boasting a $7.4 billion market cap. Trading around $0.00001242 after a 2% rise overnight, SHIB is moving broadly in line with the collective crypto space, although its high market cap limits it from enjoying the same success across the broader meme coin space, which rose 8.5% overnight to $81.7 billion in total value. Technically, SHIB has already broken out of both a falling wedge and a bullish flag this year. Clearing $0.000025 by November could set the stage for Gemini’s projection of $0.000032–$0.00005 by year-end, a 4× gain from current levels. SHIB’s RSI is currently at 51, reflecting a buy-in that is gathering pace as the rest of the crypto market lights green candles today. Beyond its meme coin roots, SHIB has expanded utility through Shibarium, its Layer-2 blockchain supporting fast, low-cost transactions, dApps, and added privacy, helping it stand apart from competing meme tokens. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Volatility Meme Coin Side Bet Beyond its main calls, Gemini has also flagged rising interest in Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a speculative meme coin positioning itself as Dogecoin’s “amped-up cousin.” It appeals to traders hunting high-risk, small-cap plays alongside community-driven hype. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap project, Maxi Doge embraces meme culture and volatility. Since its launch, it has already raised $2.6 million within weeks. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI emphasizes grassroots growth, leaning on Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading contests, and future partnerships. Out of its 150.24 billion total supply, 25% is dedicated to a “Maxi Fund” for marketing and collaborations. Staking is already live, offering up to 127% APY, though yields will taper as more users join. Currently, presale tokens are available at $0.00026, with prices rising incrementally in future rounds. Investors can purchase directly through the Maxi Doge website using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

At its current price of $119,000, Bitcoin is just 4% under its record high (ATH) of $124,128 from August. At the same time, its dominance is slipping as attention shifts to high-performing altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have set fresh ATHs over the past year. This renewed momentum stems from two major policy moves out of Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. legislation providing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Shortly afterward, the SEC introduced Project Crypto , a sweeping initiative to modernize securities rules for the digital age. With optimism surging, XRP, Solana, and Cardano are emerging as strong contenders for accumulation ahead of what could be the next major bull cycle. Ripple ($XRP): Global Payments Leader and 2025’s Top Altcoin XRP ($XRP) surged to an all-time high of $3.65 on July 18 following the GENIUS Act’s approval, surpassing its prior 2018 peak of $3.40. It has since cooled to around $2.98, marking an 18% pullback from its top. The token’s appeal lies in its efficiency as a fast, low-cost cross-border payments network, positioning it as a credible alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Its reputation has been strengthened by endorsements from organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and growing adoption among U.S. financial firms. Ripple’s influence on policy was underscored when CEO Brad Garlinghouse participated in a White House crypto strategy roundtable earlier this year. The introduction of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, shows its ambitions to capture part of the rapidly growing stablecoin market. Momentum was crucially boosted after a 2023 court ruling clarified that retail sales of XRP were not securities, marking a crucial win in its longstanding battle with the SEC and freeing its price to hit multi-year highs. Over the last 12 months, XRP has surged 404%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 94% advance. Following its summer rally, it consolidated near $3 before dipping seasonally in September. Currently, XRP’s RSI is trending upward from 45 yesterday to around 54 as of this writing, indicating investors are rapidly buying back in. Although rate cuts and the greenlight for the first spot XRP ETF failed to deliver an immediate breakout, likely because markets had already priced them in, the presence of multiple bullish flag formations and a wave of pending ETF rulings in mid-October could propel XRP toward $6 or beyond. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Chief Challenger and This Week’s Breakout Large-Cap Solana ($SOL) continues to shine as one of the most scalable and cost-efficient blockchains. Its market cap now exceeds $123 billion, with more than $12.27 billion in total value locked (TVL) per DeFiLlama, underscoring its strength in DeFi adoption. Investor buzz is building around potential U.S. approval of Solana spot ETFs next month, which could attract institutional money in the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have. After bottoming at $100 in April, SOL has rebounded strongly to $226.50. Technical analysts spotted cup-and-handle patterns throughout August and September, signaling bullish momentum. Its 12% rise in seven days makes Solana the fastest growing among the top fifteen projects this week. With regulatory clarity improving, Solana is well-positioned to benefit. Its RSI is at 55 and climbing, and the price has converged with its 30-day moving average after spending a few days trading beneath it, indicating strong consolidation. Support levels hold around $150, with major resistance near $250; breaking that could set up a fresh rally. Revisiting its previous ATH of $293.31, or even stretching toward $400, looks feasible before the close of 2025. Cardano ($ADA): The Eco-Friendly Smart Contract Platform Targeting 2026 Growth Cardano ($ADA) remains among the most resilient altcoins, with 2025 showing it still holds investor confidence. Over the past year, ADA has climbed 144%, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Solana. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano focuses on sustainability and scientific rigor, employing a Proof-of-Stake consensus model and peer-reviewed research. Its design even influenced Ethereum’s own roadmap. With a market cap of $31.1 billion, ADA would need to triple to catch up with Solana and seriously rival Ethereum’s dominance. Trading near $0.8533, ADA notched an 8.4% gain over the week. Supportive macroeconomic and political developments could send it toward $1.50 this fall and potentially back to its $3.09 ATH by year-end. However, even if US regulators don’t deliver, sustained growth at this pace would at least help it to hit $2. Technically, ADA formed a bullish falling wedge between December and April. This is typically a precursor to a substantial breakout, but it has yet to materialize for Cardano. Key resistance stands near $1.15, with a strong support base in the $0.85–$0.90 range. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Meme Flavoured Bitcoin Layer-2 and One of 2025’s Best Crypto Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the year’s standout presales, designed to pair Bitcoin’s security with Layer-2 scalability while tapping into meme culture and community-driven governance. The project’s goal is to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities by offering faster transactions, smart contract support, and decentralized governance. So far, its presale has raised over $19.8 million, with analysts predicting potential 10× or greater returns after launch. HYPER is built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), allowing ultra-low-cost smart contracts and a Canonical Bridge for instant Bitcoin transfers, dApps, meme tokens, and payments. A recent security audit by Coinsult found no vulnerabilities, further boosting trust among investors. The native HYPER token fuels the ecosystem through staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early buyers can currently earn up to 60% APY in staking rewards, while also gaining voting power once governance becomes active.

What is SB 2850 and why did Ted Cruz block it? SB 2850 is a Senate privacy bill intended to curb data brokers from selling sensitive personal information. Senator Ted Cruz objected, saying the bill as written could impede law enforcement access to critical data and needs refinement to protect public safety while limiting broad data exposure. How does SB 2851 differ from SB 2850?

Texas Senator Ted Cruz objected to Senate Bill 2850 , a bipartisan proposal by Senator Ron Wyden to restrict data brokers from selling sensitive personal information broadly to the public. Cruz said the bill needed refinement to preserve law enforcement tools used to locate convicted and suspected violent offenders. The vote drew attention because Cruz was the lone senator to formally object on Wednesday. He clarified he supports expanding privacy protections broadly where practicable, but said the current text risks unintended public-safety consequences. Wyden introduced SB 2850 to curb the sale of names, home addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive data that can be bought by “anyone with a credit card.” Wyden argued the data fuels stalking, targeted violence, and doxxing. Cruz also blocked a narrower follow-up, SB 2851 , intended to protect federal lawmakers, state officials and staff, and survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. He cited the same concerns and offered to work with Wyden to find language that balances privacy and investigatory needs. Source: Freedom of the Press Privacy debates intensified in the wake of several high-profile attacks. Recent calls to expand protections followed the fatal home attack on former Minnesota Representative Melissa Hortman in June. The FBI believes the alleged assailant located Hortman’s address through data broker records. Members of the crypto community have also been targeted. A public database managed by Bitcoiner Jameson Lopp lists over 50 attacks on people or families holding crypto in 2025, many involving perpetrators using online data to find victims’ homes. How could Congress refine these bills to protect privacy and safety? Lawmakers can refine privacy bills by including narrowly tailored law-enforcement exceptions, strict audit and warrant requirements, and defined categories of protected data. Senator Cruz signaled willingness to collaborate on language that preserves investigative access while reducing mass data exposure. Comparison: SB 2850 vs SB 2851 Feature SB 2850 (Broad) SB 2851 (Narrow) Scope All Americans’ data Lawmakers, officials, and certain survivors Primary aim Limit data broker sales to public Extend protections for specific high-risk groups Law enforcement carve-outs Not explicit enough per objection Also deemed insufficient by objector Frequently Asked Questions Why did Ted Cruz block SB 2850? Cruz blocked SB 2850 because he believes the bill, as drafted, may restrict law enforcement access to data used in locating violent offenders and protecting children. He called for clearer, practicable exceptions and offered to work on revisions. Will blocking SB 2850 stop privacy reform in Congress? Blocking the bill delays immediate enactment but does not end reform momentum.

Conclusion Senate debate over SB 2850 and SB 2851 highlights the challenge of protecting Americans from data-broker exposure while preserving investigative tools. COINOTAG will monitor negotiations as Senators pursue precise language to secure privacy without compromising public safety.

The banking network is now testing blockchain-based payments with over 30 major institutions across 16 countries. While this may seem like competition, it actually validates Ripple’s early lead in the space. Swift announces new blockchain-based ledger with 30+ banks. At Sibos, Javier Perez-Tasso, Swift CEO, revealed plans to build a blockchain-based shared ledger to enable instant, 24/7 cross-border payments.

With several spot XRP ETF applications approaching key deadlines between October 18 and 25, 2025 , bullish momentum continues to build for XRP. XRP Price Prediction: RSI Sends Buy Signal After $2.70 Support Bounce XRP has gone up by 6% in the past 7 days as the crypto market has started to recover from its latest pullback. Macroeconomic conditions support a bullish XRP price prediction , with the Federal Reserve widely expected to deliver a second rate cut this month. XRP has just bounced off key support at $2.70 , while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has flashed a fresh buy signal – crossing above both the mid-line and its 14-day moving average. If momentum continues building, XRP could quickly retest the $3.40 resistance. A confirmed breakout above that level may trigger a rally toward $5 , representing a 66% upside in the near term. While there may be uncertainty around XRP’s long-term outlook, early-stage presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are gaining traction. By combining Solana-level speed with Bitcoin’s security, it could be one of the cycle’s most promising plays. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Brings Solana-Level Transaction Speeds to Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces the first Bitcoin Layer 2, designed to fix BTC’s biggest flaws – slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability. While Bitcoin remains the world’s most recognized cryptocurrency, its network still handles only about 7 transactions per second. Solana, on the other hand, can process up to 65,000. The difference is massive. Bitcoin Hyper aims to close that gap by integrating Solana’s technology into a low-latency Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. This unlocks faster transactions, lower fees, and support for smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps—all secured by Bitcoin’s robust network. Early buyers have a chance to secure $HYPER at the lowest price before the next presale stage kicks in. To buy $HYPER, simply connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ) on the Bitcoin Hyper official website . You can either swap crypto (USDT, ETH, etc.) or use a bank card to invest. Buy $HYPER Here.

Bitcoin’s dominance has surged above 52% heading into October 2025, reinforcing its position as the anchor asset while capital rotation into altcoins slows. For many analysts, this “final rotation” phase historically precedes a new surge in altcoin activity once Bitcoin consolidates at elevated levels. Yet even as Bitcoin’s dominance rises, attention is shifting toward the meme coin sector, where Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue their high-stakes rivalry. Alongside these giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a fast-rising contender , backed by viral community momentum and early investor confidence that position it as a fresh challenger in the meme coin landscape. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin Holds Its Ground Dogecoin remains the dominant force in the meme coin market, trading near $0.24–$0.25 . Despite volatility across broader markets, DOGE has sustained one of the strongest community and liquidity bases in crypto. Large holders have been accumulating aggressively, with whale addresses adding over 680 million DOGE in September alone . DOGE Tradingview Technically, analysts highlight $0.25 as the key breakout level. A clean move above this zone could open the door toward $0.28 in the short term , with ETF speculation and network upgrade discussions adding fuel to the bullish thesis. With a market cap hovering around $30 billion , DOGE is still the most liquid meme coin, offering institutional players and retail investors alike the security of scale. Shiba Inu: Innovation Amid Volatility Shiba Inu, priced near $0.000012 , has faced choppier price action compared to Dogecoin. However, the SHIB ecosystem has been actively working to differentiate itself through governance upgrades and new features. The community has rolled out DAO election frameworks and announced plans for an AI-assisted stablecoin slated for 2026. SHIB TradingView Despite recent struggles with burn rate efficiency and technical support levels, whales continue to signal confidence, purchasing over $1.6 million worth of SHIB in the past month. Analysts argue this underlying demand, paired with long-term innovation, positions SHIB as a credible rival despite short-term volatility. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Meme Coin Disruptor While Bitcoin dominance crosses 52% and the meme coin rivalry between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu intensifies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing early buyers eager for exponential returns . Already over $15M in raised funds, its community-driven momentum is pushing it into the spotlight as the best new meme coin play for 2025. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE’S distinction comes from its viral community energy with scarcity-driven mechanics. Its model echoes Bitcoin’s ethos of limited supply while also imitating Ethereum’s programmability features. This combination drives traders searching for the next disruptive meme coin beyond DOGE and SHIB. Analysts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s positioning within the meme coin sector gives it a unique opportunity to capture retail excitement just as Bitcoin’s dominance begins to plateau. With whale activity already showing signs of accumulation and its global community expanding rapidly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the most-watched contender for 2025. Final Thoughts: A Market Poised for Rotation Bitcoin’s dominance above 52% sets the tone for October 2025, but it is the meme coin sector that is providing some of the most dynamic storylines. Dogecoin’s entrenched liquidity, Shiba Inu’s ongoing ecosystem innovations, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive rise combine to form a market narrative that could define the next stage of altcoin rotation. For investors, the lesson is clear: while Bitcoin continues to anchor portfolios, the battle for meme coin leadership — and the rise of new entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE — offers one of the most exciting opportunities heading into 2026.

52586431,596020,1759446021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52586431.jpeg,Analyst Shares ‘Realistic’ XRP Price Prediction For 2025 – It’s In The Double-Digits,https://bitcoinist.com/realistic-xrp-price-prediction/,"The crypto market is full of bold claims, but one analyst is sharing a view that he calls both realistic and possible for the XRP price. The popular crypto commentator’s focus is on XRP and what its price might look like in 2025. At the center of his outlook is the idea that the right mix of factors could send the XRP price to much higher levels than it has seen in years. Jake Claver Predicts XRP Price Could Reach $10–$13 By Year-End The respected voice in the crypto community recently gave his thoughts on where XRP might be heading. In a video shared on X, Claver explained that clear market signals unfolding in the months ahead could drive XRP to a price between $10 and $13 by the end of this year. Claver’s main reason for this prediction is the expected approval of XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). According to him, once these funds are approved, they could bring in fresh streams of money and open new demand, helping XRP finally move into double-digit prices. Claver stated that October will be a key month, as the SEC may decide on the ETFs during that time. Institutional demand would start flowing in, and this added momentum could give the XRP price the strong push it needs to reach this forecasted $10–$13 price range. ETFs And Other Catalysts May Push It Even Higher While Claver sees ETFs as the main driver, he does not stop there. He explained that other factors could help XRP climb beyond the $13 mark, with possible highs reaching $20 or even $25 if conditions turn out to be more favorable than expected. Claver says the future looks promising for the XRP price because blockchain technology continues to improve. As XRP becomes more useful in everyday life, it will naturally attract more attention and demand from everyday traders, as well as institutions such as banks and investment firms that are beginning to enter the market. If blockchain upgrades continue, adoption increases, and institutions stay active in the market, XRP could realistically hit the $10–$13 range. Claver also noted that XRP’s journey isn’t just about reaching the price range. Investors watching both retail trends and institutional moves may find new opportunities as the market evolves. According to Claver, these trends make XRP a token worth following closely in the coming months. With the broader market involvement, he believes XRP could create more momentum, and if the trend continues, the token may climb to higher price levels in the months ahead. If everything aligns, the ETFs, technological progress, and rising adoption, then the XRP price has a real chance of moving significantly higher. His outlook is that a price of $10 to $13 is a reasonable and realistic target, but he does not rule out even more ambitious levels.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 23:00:21

However, fresh data from Binance shows that BTC’s gains barely outweigh the risks posed by the digital asset’s volatility. Bitcoin Maintaining A Risk-Reward Balance According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, latest data from Binance – the world’s leading cryptocurrency trading platform in terms of liquidity – suggests that BTC is currently maintaining a risk-reward balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Dynamics Shift As Binance Premium Signals Aggressive Longs Specifically, the Sharpe-like ratio on Binance currently stands at 0.18, a figure very close to neutral territory. To explain, a Sharpe-like ratio measures how much return an investment generates relative to the risk it takes, similar to the Sharpe ratio but often using adjusted benchmarks or risk measures. When the Sharpe-like ratio is above 0.5, investing in Bitcoin becomes attractive since the potential returns outweigh the risks. On the contrary, a negative reading of the ratio discourages investors from taking risks, since volatility exceeds returns. During 2024, when the cryptocurrency market was largely weak and volatile, the Sharpe-like ratio spent most of the time in the negative territory. In contrast, the ratio reached elevated levels, signaling a strong uptrend, at the beginning of 2025. Currently, the Bitcoin market is trading between the two extremes – the market is neither dangerous nor in a powerful uptrend. Notably, the market appears to be in a phase of equilibrium and accumulation, as it trades close to $119,000. Arab Chain added: The latest figures show that the 30-day average return stands at just 0.26%, highlighting that the market is not delivering outsized gains; investors entering now are likely to see only modest profits relative to risk. Meanwhile, 30-day volatility is around 1.37%, which indicates a natural, moderate level of price fluctuation – not excessively calm but not alarmingly unstable either. BTC Needs A Catalyst For Next Leg Up The CryptoQuant analyst added that the BTC market is currently awaiting a bullish catalyst or strong inflows to extend its uptrend. However, if the Sharpe-like ratio falls below zero again, then a period of price correction may follow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Momentum Indicator: Why 600,000 Transactions Threshold Matters Most On the flipside, the ratio sustaining above 0.5 for several days – coupled with a price breakout above the $120,000 to $122,000 range on healthy volume – would suggest a fresh upward trend for the top cryptocurrency by market cap. Recent on-chain data hints toward a potential rally setup for BTC. Notably, the short-term holder (STH) spent output profit ratio (SOPR) recently recovered slightly to 0.995. That said, Bitcoin must defend the important $90,000 support level to avoid entering a new bear market. At press time, BTC trades at $118,788, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

The token has been trading in the $2.90-3.00 range in recent days, showing resilience after months of consolidation. With momentum building across the market, many analysts believe XRP could be preparing for another push higher. Investor optimism isn’t limited to XRP alone. The broader market rebound has renewed attention toward high-upside opportunities, particularly in presale tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has been attracting speculation of exponential returns as investors look for the next breakout star. ETF approval anticipation Much of the current excitement around XRP stems from ongoing discussions about crypto ETF approvals. While Bitcoin ETFs have already made headlines with strong inflows, attention has turned to whether regulators will extend the same access to other major cryptocurrencies. An XRP ETF would be a game-changer, opening the door for large-scale institutional inflows and significantly boosting liquidity. Analysts argue that the very anticipation of ETF approval could provide fuel for XRP’s price in the coming weeks. Even without a formal announcement, the speculation alone has helped drive demand. Historically, markets tend to price in expectations before events, meaning XRP could see another leg up simply on the buzz surrounding potential approvals. Technical outlook for XRP From a technical perspective, XRP has managed to hold key support above $2.9, which analysts view as a bullish foundation. Resistance sits around $3.05, and a clean breakout above this range could set the stage for a run toward $4 or higher. Market observers note that XRP’s price structure has been tightening, with reduced volatility signaling an impending breakout. If ETF speculation coincides with this technical setup, traders believe a significant upward move could materialize quickly. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the 22,000% speculation While XRP dominates headlines, many retail investors are chasing more speculative plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is being touted as one of the boldest presale stories of 2025. Analysts have floated projections of up to 22,000% ROI if momentum continues and the token achieves broad adoption after listings. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its asymmetric profile: low entry cost with massive upside potential. Unlike XRP, which already carries a multi-billion-dollar valuation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still at the earliest stage of its journey, leaving room for exponential growth. Its rapid fundraising, surging community numbers, and comparisons to early breakout tokens have fueled a wave of demand from investors seeking the next moonshot. Comparing risk and reward The contrast between XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights the spectrum of investor strategies in 2025. XRP is seen as a relatively safer large-cap play, benefiting from institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and the potential ETF narrative. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, represents high-risk, high-reward speculation, where even small allocations could lead to outsized returns if the project delivers. Many traders are choosing to hold a mix of both: anchoring their portfolios with XRP for stability while using MAGACOIN FINANCE as a speculative hedge capable of generating life-changing gains. Conclusion XRP’s outlook remains closely tied to the ETF approval narrative. As speculation builds, the token’s steady trading near $3 suggests that buyers are positioning ahead of potential catalysts. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention for its staggering 22,000% ROI projections, making it one of the most talked-about presale tokens of the year. For investors, the choice between XRP’s institutional upside and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s speculative promise reflects the dual nature of today’s crypto market – one eye on stability, the other on exponential growth.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.3801 Market Cap $611.57M Trading Volume $9.95M Circulating Supply 1.612B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.3822 24-hour Low $0.3684 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.67% 50-Day SMA $0.3898 14-Day RSI 47.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.3966 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Flow is testing $0.38 resistance with bullish momentum backing the move. The daily MACD is nearly turning positive, and volume supports the breakout. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the daily timeframe for October 2, Flow is trading at $0.379, sitting just under the mid-Bollinger resistance at $0.380. The recent rebound off the lower band at $0.325 shows strength, and the MACD has nearly reached the zero line, suggesting momentum is shifting bullish. Daily volume has also picked up, with $1.08M in activity backing this push. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView If price secures a daily close above $0.380, Flow could extend toward $0.435, which aligns with the upper Bollinger band. However, rejection here risks a retest of $0.360, with deeper support remaining at $0.325. Traders looking for entry can consider accumulation at $0.372–$0.375, while the main profit zones lie between $0.405 and $0.435. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, Flow recently surged from $0.355 to $0.383 before stalling just under resistance at $0.380. The Alligator lines are widening upward, confirming the short-term bullish structure. The RSI sits at 67, just below overbought, showing strong buying interest but hinting that a short-term cooldown may occur. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Immediate support lies at $0.373–$0.368, where the moving averages are stacking. Holding this zone keeps the momentum intact, while a break below could drag the price back toward $0.363. If Flow pushes through $0.383, upside targets shift to $0.395–$0.400, which would align with the daily breakout attempt. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3769 BUY SMA 5 $0.3633 BUY SMA 10 $0.3572 BUY SMA 21 $0.3807 SELL SMA 50 $0.3898 SELL SMA 100 $0.3812 SELL SMA 200 $0.3966 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3812 SELL EMA 5 $0.3895 SELL EMA 10 $0.3941 SELL EMA 21 $0.3926 SELL EMA 50 $0.3872 SELL EMA 100 $0.3892 SELL EMA 200 $0.4270 SELL What to expect from Flow? Flow has entered a bullish phase after bouncing from $0.325, but the $0.38–$0.40 zone remains the main resistance barrier. Breaking above it could drive a move toward $0.435, while rejection risks a pullback to $0.368–$0.360 before another attempt higher. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow Flow is seeing a big rise in activity after LayerZero integration, with transactions up over 600%. It continues to support major consumer apps like NBA Top Shot while improving its developer tools through Flow EVM and protocol upgrades. Flow Blockchain just posted one of its strongest quarters yet, blending consumer-scale adoption with surging DeFi momentum.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-reveals-xrp-net-flows-battleline-heres-the-implication/,"XRP community member and game designer Chad Steingraber has outlined what he considers the two most critical factors influencing XRP’s price: capital flows and the pace at which they occur. His comments arrive at a time when XRP is struggling to maintain upward momentum following a decline below $3. After falling under this psychological level, XRP managed to hold support around $2.60 before rebounding slightly. According to Steingraber, recent exchange data highlights $2.68 as a significant threshold, where outflows have continued to exceed inflows. Despite this, he argued that XRP’s ability to remain stable at this level suggests the market may be forming a sustainable price floor. So Chad as ETFs roll out, inflows will invariably outpace outflows. At least initially correct? — JohnnyPicks (@JohnPicksStocks) September 27, 2025 The Role of Net Flows and Velocity In a recent exchange with traders on social media, Steingraber stressed that net flows alone do not fully explain price action. While net flows indicate whether more capital is entering or leaving, the rate and intensity of these movements, what he terms velocity, are equally important. For example, he noted that a rapid inflow of $1 billion within a day would likely create substantial upward pressure on price. By contrast, the same amount spread across an extended period might generate little impact. This distinction underscores why some assets react strongly to sudden bursts of buying, while others show muted price changes despite consistent inflows. Steingraber emphasized that both the direction of flows and the speed at which they occur must be considered when analyzing potential price movements. In his view, the balance between outflows and inflows, combined with how quickly capital shifts occur, will be decisive for XRP in the coming months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Anticipation of XRP ETFs His analysis comes as the market awaits regulatory decisions on several proposed XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Firms including Grayscale, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have applications pending with U.S. regulators, with rulings expected this October. Franklin Templeton is scheduled for a decision the following month. Recent reporting from journalist Eleanor Terrett confirmed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked ETF issuers for XRP and other digital assets to withdraw earlier filings due to new listing standards. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas clarified that the revised framework was anticipated and makes previous filings redundant. Although the exact launch timeline remains uncertain, industry observers consider approvals highly likely under the updated process. Optimism surrounding these products centers on expectations that they will attract significant institutional capital. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg recently suggested that XRP ETFs could draw as much as $5 billion in inflows during their first month of trading. Should such projections hold, Steingraber’s focus on the velocity of capital movements could prove highly relevant in determining how XRP reacts to a surge in institutional participation.

Repeating correction cycles have historically preceded major Bitcoin rallies. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $675M inflows over three days, signaling growing institutional adoption. Exchange reserves are at their lowest since 2018, limiting tradable supply and supporting upward pressure. Bitcoin price nears $118,643 with ETF inflows and shrinking exchange reserves pointing to a potential rise to $180,000—read COINOTAG’s analysis and projections. What is driving Bitcoin price toward $180,000? Bitcoin price is being driven by a mix of repeating historical correction patterns, strong spot ETF inflows, and declining exchange reserves that reduce circulating supply. These combined technical and fundamental signals increase the probability of continued upside momentum toward the $180,000 target. How have historical corrections shaped previous Bitcoin rallies? Chart studies show three prior correction-to-rally sequences where retracements of roughly 23–33% preceded multi-hundred percent advances. Technical momentum indicators, such as MACD crossovers and rising histograms, historically confirmed entries for sustained rallies. Bitcoin nears $118,643 as historical correction cycles, ETF inflows, and shrinking exchange reserves project a potential rise toward $180,000. Bitcoin’s historical corrections repeatedly fueled rallies, with the current cycle projecting a path toward $180,000. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $675M inflows in three days, boosting institutional support for BTC’s rally. Exchange reserves hit lowest since 2018, showing reduced supply and supporting Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Bitcoin’s path to $180,000 is being traced through a repeating cycle of corrections followed by sharp rallies. Chart analysis shows past retracements have acted as launchpads for more substantial upward moves. At the time of writing, Bitcoin traded near $118,643 with upward momentum fueled by institutional and retail participation. Why do repeating patterns matter for Bitcoin’s outlook? Repeating patterns matter because they indicate market participants responding to similar liquidity and sentiment dynamics across cycles. When corrections compress supply and technical indicators align, subsequent rallies can accelerate as FOMO and institutional buy-ins amplify price moves. How do ETF inflows and corporate purchases influence market strength? Spot ETF inflows and large corporate purchases add durable demand. Data shows spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows exceeding $675 million across three days, which reduces float available to retail sellers and supports higher prices. Japan-based Metaplanet increased holdings by 5,268 BTC (roughly $615 million), bringing its total to 30,823 BTC valued at approximately $3.33 billion. Large corporate accumulation narrows supply on exchanges and can materially change market depth. What role do exchange reserves play in price dynamics? Exchange reserves at multi-year lows mean fewer BTC are available for immediate sale. Historically, low on-exchange supply correlates with upward price pressure as demand outpaces available liquidity. Bitcoin’s Path to $180,000 History shows a repeating pattern: -23% → +200% -33% → +120% -31% → +150% Every major correction has been the launchpad for the next explosive leg up. If the cycle continues, Bitcoin could be eyeing $180,000+ next. pic.twitter.com/VVBCx70FIx — CryptoELlTES (@CryptooELITES) October 1, 2025 This repeating cycle demonstrates a structure where declines create conditions for higher growth. The current trajectory places Bitcoin above $116,000 with projections suggesting a possible rise toward $180,000. Analysts note that, if the pattern continues, the next major leg up could mirror earlier expansions. Source: AshCrypto (X) Technical indicators cited by Ash Crypto show a MACD line crossing above the signal line and positive histogram bars, suggesting strengthening momentum. These signals, combined with decreasing exchange reserves and institutional flows, underpin the bullish thesis without relying on speculation. How should traders and investors interpret these signals? Use a risk-managed approach: recognize historical patterns but confirm with momentum indicators and liquidity metrics. Institutional inflows and low exchange reserves are supportive, but volatility remains high and position sizing is critical. Frequently Asked Questions Can Bitcoin realistically reach $180,000 in the current cycle? Yes. Historical correction-to-rally patterns, significant spot ETF inflows of $675M over three days, and exchange reserves at 2018 lows create conditions that have previously preceded similar price expansions. Market confirmation comes from sustained inflows and technical momentum. What indicators confirm a valid breakout toward $180,000? Confirmations include sustained ETF inflows, continued decline in on-exchange reserves, MACD bullish crossovers, and rising trading volumes during advances. Multiple signals together reduce the chance of a false breakout. Key Takeaways Historical patterns : Past correction cycles have preceded large rallies and remain relevant to current expectations. Institutional demand : Spot ETF inflows and corporate purchases are reducing available supply and supporting price discovery. Liquidity squeeze : Exchange reserves at multi-year lows create upward pressure when demand increases; manage risk accordingly. Conclusion COINOTAG analysis finds that Bitcoin’s short-term outlook is constructive as historical correction cycles, $675M in spot ETF inflows, and collapsing exchange reserves align to support further gains toward $180,000. Monitor inflows, on-exchange supply, and momentum indicators for confirmation and manage positions with disciplined risk controls. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-path-to-180k"" }, ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Nears $118,643 as ETF Inflows and Low Exchange Reserves Point to $180,000"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-26.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T10:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T10:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin nears $118,643 as historical correction cycles, ETF inflows, and shrinking exchange reserves project a potential rise toward $180,000.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can Bitcoin realistically reach $180,000 in the current cycle?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

These three alts have also posted impressive gains, yet they may have only started rallying, with a wave of crypto ETFs set to hit the market very soon. The launch of such ETFs will boost demand and volumes massively, with the likes of XRP, Pepe and Dogecoin set to rally hard as 2025 reaches its conclusion. We provide each of these coins with price predictions, unpacking their technicals while also using their fundamentals to provide a forecast of where they could go soon. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – 24-Hour Gains Market Beginning of End-of-Year Rally XRP has risen to $2.98 today, providing a 1.5% gain in 24 hours and a 5.5% increase in a week. The altcoin also happens to be one of the best-performing major tokens over the last 12 months, during which it has posted a 404% return. Yet things are likely to get even better for the third-biggest cryptocurrency, not least because numerous XRP ETFs are likely to launch by the end of the year. This will boost demand for the token massively, as we’ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs over the past year or so. Also bullish is the fact that Ripple is one of the fastest-growing firms in crypto, having signed new partnerships , made acquisitions and expanded into new territories this year. Source: TradingView This makes for a very positive crypto price prediction for XRP, which we can see from its chart is bouncing from an oversold position. With its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) having been at mostly negative levels since August, now may be the time for XRP to rebound and rally once again. Combined with the launch of ETFs, this could push the XRP price up to $3.50 by the end of October, while it could even top $5 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Pepe ($PEPE) – Whale Buys Signal Incoming Push for New Record Highs Pepe has jumped to $0.0000059996 today, which means that it’s up by 4% in 24 hours and by 6.5% in the past week. The meme token is up by only 4% in the past year, which may be disappointing in relation to other coins, but this arguably indicates that it’s due a big leap. It may not be waiting on ETFs like other major alts, but PEPE continues to be a meme token of choice for whales, who have continued to accumulate the token in recent weeks. For instance, one whale bought 1.5 trillion PEPE only a few weeks ago , while another is sitting on a long PEPE position worth $18.5 million . This popularity bodes well for the end-of-year bull rally the market may witness, with PEPE’s chart today also showing the coin rebounding from undervalued positions. Source: TradingView We also see that PEPE could break out of the pennant it has been trading within since mid-July, and if it can decisively break through the $0.000010 barrier then a full-blown rally may develop. Combined with market-wide bullishness that could follow a wave of ETF launches, the PEPE price could reach $0.0000150 in the next few weeks, before closing the year at around $0.000050. Crypto Price Prediction: Dogecoin ($DOGE) – ETFs and Institutions Will Push Meme Token to New Highs by December Dogecoin is another token that has performed very well today, with its climb to $0.2563 representing a healthy 5.5% increase in 24 hours, as well as a 10% increase in a week. DOGE is therefore carrying some promising momentum right now, which has been building over the past couple of weeks, after the launch of the REX-Osprey Doge ETF . And what’s bullish is that Grayscale, Bitwise and 21Shares are all close to launching their own DOGE ETFs, something which could boost institutional interest in the token even further. Looking at the token’s chart today, we see that now may be a very good time to buy the token, just as it starts a run towards higher levels. Source: TradingView Its primary technical indicators show that it has or is about to move out of an oversold position, while it also has plenty of space to rise before it risks any overbuying. Based on this, the crypto price prediction for DOGE is very positive, with the coin likely to pass $0.35 by the of October, before beating its ATH of $0.7316 in December. $1.5 Million and Counting: Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENDOE Creates Buzz During Presale Some traders looking to diversify their holdings may be interested in considering presale coins, which can rally strongly when they list for the first time. This is particularly the case if they’ve had a big sale and then gain some significant listings, with one of the most interesting presale coins right now being ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . Just as the legends predicted… A Virtual Mine-to-Earn platform in the palm of your hand. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/tOsvFJMgo4 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 1, 2025 PEPENODE has now raised over $1.5 million in its sale, which has been running for only a few weeks. This indicates its potential for growth in the future, and one of the main reasons why it looks promising is because it offers a novel use case. It bills itself as the market’s first mine-to-earn token, providing users with the chance to build their virtual mining rigs and earn rewards in popular meme coins (e.g. Pepe, Fartcoin). Holders can build their mining rigs by spending PEPENODE on additional virtual mining nodes, with more nodes equalling greater rewards. This should drive demand for PEPENODE, which holders can also stake for regular rewards. While the coin’s sale will end in the next few weeks, investors can still join by going to the PEPENODE website . The token is currently selling at $0.0010831, although this price will rise again tomorrow. Buy PEPENODE Here.

ETHZilla holds 102,000+ ETH and focuses on L2 yield strategies. ETHZilla converts treasury cash flows into additional Ether and L2 investments to amplify returns. Ethereum network shows $158 billion in stablecoin transactions (data source: DefiLlama, plain text). ETHZilla Ethereum treasury leads a corporate Ether pivot; learn how the firm deploys ETH to L2s for higher yield and long-term growth — read more now. What is ETHZilla Ethereum treasury? ETHZilla Ethereum treasury is a corporate treasury model where a formerly biotech public company holds significant Ether reserves and actively deploys capital into layer-2 protocols. The strategy prioritizes yield generation, infrastructure support, and long-term value capture driven by stablecoin activity and remittance flows. How does ETHZilla plan to generate higher yield than staking? ETHZilla reinvests cash flows from Ether holdings into a mix of L2 protocols and structured yield products. This includes liquidity provision, protocol partnerships, and staged investments designed to capture fees and incentive emissions while providing capital to emerging Layer-2 networks. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""ETHZilla shifts corporate treasury to Ether, targets L2 yields"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999d1c-68cc-71ec-94c7-21fdc2fa2a8a.webp""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""ETHZilla pivoted from biotech to an Ether-focused treasury, holding 102,000+ ETH and deploying capital to layer-2 protocols for higher yield and infrastructure growth.""} ETHZilla’s chief executive moved the public company into Ether reserves to capitalize on remittance flows and stablecoin activity, aiming to deploy assets into layer-2 protocols for higher returns than staking. ETHZilla CEO McAndrew Rudisill says the company pivoted to Ether after identifying opportunities in global remittances and stablecoin-led liquidity. The firm rebranded from Life Sciences Corp to ETHZilla Corporation and now ranks among the largest public Ethereum treasuries. Rudisill frames Ethereum as a primary conduit for global dollar-denominated value transmission, with layer-2 networks offering practical on-ramps for traditional finance applications. Since pivoting into Ether, ETHZilla Corporation has acquired over 102,000 tokens for its treasury. Source: StrategicEtherReserve Why is ETHZilla focused on layer-2 protocols? ETHZilla intends to scale value by deploying Ether into L2s that interface with traditional finance activities, such as structured credit and settlement rails. Layer-2s can offer higher APRs via incentives and transaction fee capture compared to passive staking. Rudisill emphasizes that investing in L2s simultaneously funds network growth and positions ETHZilla to earn protocol-level returns while expanding Ethereum’s utility for real-world assets. How large is ETHZilla’s Ether holding and how does it compare? ETHZilla holds over 102,000 ETH, placing it among the top public Ether treasuries. By comparison, the largest public treasury holds approximately 2.65 million ETH with a stated strategic target to control a meaningful share of supply. Source: ETHZilla The firm’s approach blends reserve accumulation with active deployment: selling a portion of ETH for operational capital, then reinvesting to buy more Ether and fund L2 initiatives — a compounding treasury model. When could ETHZilla’s strategy impact Ether price? Rudisill projects that Ether could rise substantially if stablecoin growth and L2 adoption tighten base-layer capacity. He notes price resistance levels and believes a breakout above intermediate thresholds could accelerate inflows and valuation expansion. Market context: Ether traded near $4,148 and has oscillated between $3,846 and $4,226 over the prior week, per CoinGecko (plain text mention). What broader market signals support ETHZilla’s thesis? Key on-chain indicators include high stablecoin transaction volume on Ethereum — reported at $158 billion by DefiLlama (plain text mention) — and growing corporate treasuries accumulating ETH. These signals suggest increasing utility and demand for settlement and liquidity on Ethereum. Frequently Asked Questions How does ETHZilla differ from a staking-only treasury? ETHZilla blends reserve holdings with active L2 deployments and business-building. Unlike staking-only treasuries, it pursues protocol partnerships and revenue-generating L2 products to achieve higher, diversified returns. Is ETHZilla’s pivot regulatory-dependent? Regulatory frameworks such as stablecoin legislation influence market adoption but ETHZilla’s strategy focuses on technology-led utility and treasury economics rather than short-term regulatory outcomes. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How does ETHZilla generate yield beyond staking?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""ETHZilla deploys Ether into layer-2 protocols, liquidity and incentive programs to capture fees and emissions, aiming for returns that exceed standard staking yields."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why is ETHZilla accumulating Ether?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The company views Ether as both a reserve asset and infrastructure stake, enabling deployments into L2s and real-world asset applications tied to global remittances and stablecoin use."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How ETHZilla deploys Ether to generate L2 yield"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step overview of ETHZilla’s approach to converting Ether reserves into L2 yield and infrastructure investments."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Accumulate Ether reserves"", ""text"": ""Acquire Ether to build a significant treasury base for deployment and to support network alignment."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Allocate capital to L2 protocols"", ""text"": ""Select L2 networks with credible teams and incentives; provide liquidity and structured funding."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Reinvest returns"", ""text"": ""Convert yield and operational cash flows back into Ether and additional L2 allocations to compound treasury growth."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Maintain treasury risk controls"", ""text"": ""Implement diversification, smart-contract audits, and governance oversight to manage counterparty and protocol risk."" } ]} Key Takeaways Strategic pivot : ETHZilla transitioned from biotech to an Ether-focused corporate treasury. L2-first deployment : The company targets layer-2 protocols to generate higher yields than staking. Market context : Stablecoin transaction volume and remittance flows are core demand drivers supporting ETHZilla’s thesis. Since its pivot into crypto, ETHZilla stock has registered a 44% gain year-to-date.

52588533,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-vs-stocks-which-is-the-better-investment-after-us-government-shutdown/,1759449480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52588533.jpeg,Crypto Vs. Stocks: Which Is The Better Investment After US Government Shutdown,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-vs-stocks-which-is-the-better-investment-after-us-government-shutdown/,"The U.S. government shutdown has cast a long shadow across financial markets, with delays in economic data and uncertainty in fiscal policy unnerving traditional investors. Stock markets have historically reacted negatively to such events, reflecting concerns about growth, spending, and debt sustainability. This time, however, crypto has emerged as a surprising safe haven for many. While equities waver, Bitcoin and leading altcoins have held firm, reinforcing the idea that digital assets can serve as an alternative hedge during institutional uncertainty. The difference between crypto and stocks is very important for regular investors who are deciding where to invest money after the shutdown. Stocks come with rules, dividends, and clear earnings, but they depend a lot on government stability and the overall economy. Crypto, however, gives people decentralization, worldwide access, and the chance for very high returns, but it also has more ups and downs. The discussion is no longer just about guessing versus traditional methods. It is about whether investors trust the old systems enough to depend on them when governments fail, or if they prefer the freedom of decentralized assets. This tension is now affecting how portfolios are built, with speculative projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE getting attention as investors look beyond the news. Stocks: Stability with Constraints The traditional investment has always incorporated stocks. They provide exposure to profit- and money-generating companies and they are protected by legislation and regulation. They are not as risky as crypto in normal economic times, offering regular income in the form of dividend payments. These characteristics continue to matter significantly for large investors. Yet they are by no means insulated against systemic risks. The shut down throws a spotlight on how much they rely on the functioning of government, fiscal policy, and global economic stability. Late releases in data hamper decision-making, political impasses can push uncertainty deep into equity prices, and for some, the attractiveness of equities rests on their predictability that falters when the institution that governs becomes a volatility source. Crypto: Independence And Asymmetry Crypto works outside these limits. Decentralized networks are not affected by government shutdowns, and money moves around the world at all hours. Bitcoin has become a safe choice against weakness in institutions, while altcoins offer chances to see new ideas and stories. For everyday investors, the outlook is in unequal opportunities: small amounts of money can earn much more than what stocks usually provide. Volatility is the trade-off. Sharp drops in crypto can unnerve investors who are unready, but big gains that are characteristic in this space can be a direct byproduct of such slumps. Under political instability, the self-governance of crypto becomes an asset, further bolstering an argument that it has a place in every modern investment portfolio. MAGACOIN FINANCE As The Speculative Edge The government shutdown has reignited debates about whether stocks or crypto offer stronger returns. Analysts point out that within crypto, presales often create the most dramatic wealth outcomes, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is the current name on everyone’s lips. It combines meme-driven branding with structured scarcity, echoing how DOGE and SHIB once turned small bets into fortunes. Analysts frame it as a generational wealth candidate , especially when balanced against traditional equities where gains are capped. While stocks may recover steadily, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being described as the kind of asymmetric bet that could change individual financial paths if momentum compounds. Portfolio Diversification Post-Shutdown The shutdown has shown how important it is to diversify. Depending only on stocks puts investors at risk from government actions, while putting everything into crypto can be very unstable. The strongest investment portfolios combine both types. Stocks provide steady income and regulation-backed confidence, while crypto provides independence and transformative upside. Adding speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE completes the mix, ensuring exposure across the risk spectrum. Analysts emphasize that such balance mirrors professional strategies. Institutions anchor in equities, expand into Bitcoin and Ethereum, and cautiously explore altcoins. Retail investors, however, often lean heavier into speculation. This divergence creates opportunities for those who manage to combine both approaches effectively. Conclusion The U.S. government shutdown has reignited the debate between crypto and stocks as investment vehicles. Stocks remain stable but tied to systemic risks, while crypto offers independence and asymmetric potential. For investors seeking both safety and growth, the best answer may not be one or the other, but both. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its audits, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and viral momentum, represents the speculative layer retail investors crave. As portfolios adapt to political dysfunction and market uncertainty, combining traditional equities, major cryptos, and presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE may prove to be the winning formula in the years ahead.

This growing enthusiasm stems from the perception of ETH as the epicenter of decentralized finance, tokenization and institutional adoption. As scaling solutions become available and interest from enterprises proliferates, Ethereum is viewed as critical infrastructure rather than a speculative investment. The projection is the result of both fundamental and technical analysis, anchored in developer, institutional, and investor fundamentals surrounding ETH and its potential. Even while Ethereum enjoys Institutional trust, retail traders are simply asking, Where can they find the exorbitant potential Ethereum no longer provides? Ethereum may still triple in value, but for retail investors used to tales of 25 or 50 times potential increases, this simply isn’t exhilarating. This discrepancy explains the hype surrounding speculative presales, as well as projects centered around memes. In Telegram channels and on X, one name overwhelmingly stands out, MAGACOIN FINANCE, regarded by retail communities as a cultural counterpart to Ethereum’s institutional seriousness. Why Analysts Target $5,000 For Ethereum There are many factors that will help Ethereum reach the $5,000 milestone. Ethereum is beginning to show its value beyond its native crypto uses, proof of which is the increase of tokenization pilots from large financial institutions. Scaling improvements across Layer 2 solutions are reducing transaction costs and expanding usability. And the steady inflow of developers ensures that Ethereum’s ecosystem remains the most vibrant in the industry. Chart watchers highlight that Ethereum’s resilience during recent volatility strengthens the bullish case. Every correction has been met with renewed accumulation, suggesting strong conviction among both retail and institutional investors. Combined with ETF demand, these factors create the foundation for a $5,000 target. Institutional Anchoring Vs. Retail Hunger Institutions are largely content with Ethereum’s steady trajectory. For them, 2× or 3× gains paired with credibility represent success. Retail investors, however, often crave exponential outcomes. They look for tokens capable of multiplying many times over in shorter periods. This difference in appetite fuels the divergence between where institutions allocate (Ethereum) and where retail speculates (presales, meme coins, and cultural tokens). Ethereum’s $5,000 target excites institutions, but retail traders often prefer to balance ETH exposure with bets on projects that feel more dynamic and culturally relevant. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Retail Buzz Ethereum’s $5,000 target has become a popular talking point, but retail investors are increasingly drawn to presales where returns can be far higher. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been generating buzz in forums and watchlists, with ROI models pointing to 1,500%–2,100% gains depending on how listings unfold. What makes it compelling is that it doesn’t compete with Ethereum but complements it, offering a high-reward play while ETH remains the infrastructure backbone. Traders are treating MAGACOIN FINANCE as the speculative echo to ETH’s institutional story. For those who see Ethereum as stable growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the opportunity to supercharge that thesis with pure ROI speculation. Retail Psychology And Cultural Momentum The buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE reflects a broader truth: retail investors thrive on cultural energy. Ethereum provides security, but meme-driven tokens provide excitement. Communities rally around tokens that feel alive, playful, and viral. That energy attracts capital, which then fuels the cycles of exponential growth retail investors seek. By combining legitimacy through audits with cultural stickiness, MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as one of the strongest retail narratives of 2025. The excitement isn’t just about price projections, it’s about belonging to a movement before it enters the mainstream. Balancing Portfolios In The Current Cycle The emergence of a $5,000 Ethereum prediction doesn’t diminish the importance of speculative plays. Smart investors structure portfolios to capture both sides: Ethereum as the stable institutional backbone, and projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as the speculative moonshots. This balance reduces downside risk while preserving access to transformative upside. Whales and retail alike are already blending such strategies. Capital anchored in Ethereum offers credibility, while smaller allocations into presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide optionality. In a cycle where narratives can change overnight, diversification across categories has become essential. Conclusion Ethereum’s $5,000 price target reflects confidence in its role as the backbone of digital finance. Its ecosystem growth, scaling solutions, and institutional adoption make it a clear long-term hold. Yet the retail conversation is broader. Investors want not only anchors like Ethereum but also speculative projects that can deliver exponential returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE , audited, scarcity-driven, and community-powered, fits that role. It embodies the retail buzz Ethereum cannot generate while providing the asymmetric potential institutions largely avoid. Together, Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE capture both sides of the current cycle, stability and speculation, credibility and culture.

After fueling the recent altcoin mini-season, the crucial ratio has stalled out completely, exhibiting 40 days of stagnation. With the main engine of the altcoin market now idling, the initial euphoria is fading, raising serious concerns about the stability and short-term future of nearly every asset outside of BTC. Is Ethereum Entering A Healthy Accumulation Phase? The powerful momentum behind altcoins has evaporated following the stagnation of the ETH/BTC ratio. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades has highlighted that after a monumental +150% run from its low against Bitcoin, ETH performance has completely stalled for the last 40 days. This pause immediately translates into palpable weakness across the board, with momentum-driven sentiment turning sour quickly as most altcoins start to retrace what they gained in the months prior. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Round 2? Analyst Forecasts Early October Rally Amid $4,200 Retest While altcoin traders prefer to see their tokens rally, the analyst views the current shift as a necessary and potentially healthy correction. He suggests that it’s beneficial that BTC is absorbing some of the bid and liquidity again as it works to pull the entire market out of its current slump consolidation. Daan Crypto Trades identifies the ETH/BTC ratio as being in “no man’s land” currently, adding that he would only regain interest in the pair if it moved back above the 0.041 level or a decisive retest of the 0.032 level. However, the expert concluded that whatever ETH does against BTC will remain the primary barometer for the overall health of the altcoin market and the BTC Dominance trend. Therefore, this key pair should be monitored closely. Reversal Signals Strengthen On The 4-Hour Chart Technical analyst GeoMetric is calling the end of the market slump, basing his bullish forecast on clear signals from his proprietary Gaussian Breakout screener. According to GeoMetric, BTC, ETH, and most Altcoins have all successfully broken out of their Gaussian channels on the 4H chart. The expert views this as a firm confirmation of a reversal, provided these assets can maintain their position above the mid-line of the channel. Related Reading: Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: ETH/BTC Ratio Climbs to Yearly Peak Amid Market Shift GeoMetric noted that BTC has flipped bullish on almost every major time frame except for the 3-day chart, which is the last holdout. Also, he has expressed his focus on the time frame for now. While considering this as a relief and great start to October overall, the market has finally turned the corner after a difficult week, characterized by liquidations, widespread capitulation, and generally terrible sentiment. He acknowledges the difficulty of maintaining a positive outlook when the market is collapsing. “As convinced as I was, it’s never easy bull posting amidst the FUD and asking everyone to hold the line, and it takes a lot out of me,” GeoMetric stated.

52586414,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85170,1759449607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Will Dethrone Bitcoin (BTC) By This Date Says Business Expert,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-will-dethrone-bitcoin-btc-by-this-date-says-business-expert/,"Cameron Scrubs, founder of Tradeship University, has added his voice to a growing group of market commentators making bold projections for XRP . In a recent post on X, Scrubs predicted that by the end of the decade, XRP will surpass both Bitcoin and Ethereum to become the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization. At present, XRP represents about 4.4% of the global crypto market, while Bitcoin dominates with nearly 60%. For XRP to achieve the scenario Scrubs describes, its share would need to expand dramatically, pushing it past the two largest digital assets within the next five years. Assessing the Feasibility The gap between XRP and Bitcoin remains substantial. Bitcoin currently holds a market capitalization exceeding $2.36 trillion, compared to XRP’s $177 billion. This $2.2 trillion difference highlights the steep climb XRP would face. Based on today’s figures, XRP would need to appreciate more than thirteen times its current value, trading at approximately $39, to reach parity with Bitcoin’s existing valuation. XRP Will Be #1 in terms of Market Cap by 2030 I’m leaving it all on the table. Bitcoin and Ethereum will be second to XRP. — Cameron Scrubs (@imcameronscrubs) October 1, 2025 However, this estimate assumes Bitcoin does not grow further, which many analysts believe is unrealistic. Several influential figures in the industry, including executives from Coinbase, Cardano, BitMEX, and Telegram, have suggested Bitcoin could approach $1 million by 2030. If those forecasts materialize, Bitcoin’s valuation could exceed $20 trillion. For XRP to match such a level, it would require a price above $335, a target that even many XRP supporters consider improbable within the decade. Scrubs’ optimism is not unique. XRP advocate Coach JV made a similar claim that XRP would eventually surpass Bitcoin. Still, other market voices urge caution. Influencer Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy, has argued that while XRP may see significant appreciation, Bitcoin’s dominance rests on its decentralized structure. In his view, XRP’s efficiency in transaction processing makes it an attractive asset, but Ripple’s large token holdings, estimated at more than 40% of supply, continue to raise centralization concerns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From Armstrong’s perspective, XRP could close the gap with Bitcoin but is unlikely to replace it at the top of the market. Instead, he sees XRP securing a stronger position by 2030 while Bitcoin maintains its lead. Possible Growth Drivers for XRP Despite skepticism, some industry watchers point to several factors that could drive XRP’s expansion in the coming years. Financial institutions and payment providers are already exploring XRP’s use in cross-border settlement, citing its transaction speeds of around seven seconds. Large-scale adoption in this area could provide meaningful demand for the asset. In addition, upcoming developments such as the anticipated Ripple initial public offering and the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by XRP are seen as potential catalysts for wider institutional interest. While Cameron Scrubs envisions XRP surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum by 2030, the data shows this outcome would be difficult. The enormous market cap gap, coupled with Bitcoin’s projected growth, makes such a shift unlikely within the next five years. However, developments such as institutional adoption, ETF approvals, and Ripple’s potential IPO could still elevate XRP’s role in the industry. Even if it does not become the number-one cryptocurrency, XRP has the potential to secure a far greater share of the market than it holds today.

52586434,595982,1759449641,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52586434.jpeg,$2B USDT Just Minted On Ethereum: Fresh Liquidity For Uptober?,https://bitcoinist.com/2b-usdt-minted-ethereum-fresh-liquidity-uptober/,"Ethereum continues to assert its dominance in the crypto market as another USDT mint bolsters its position as the leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. While Tron has long competed for stablecoin market share, Ethereum remains the chain with the highest USDT supply , now holding an impressive $78.5 billion worth of Tether onchain. This new mint underscores Ethereum’s critical role in the digital asset ecosystem. As the backbone for decentralized finance (DeFi), institutional flows, and exchange liquidity, the crypto giant consistently attracts stablecoin issuances that fuel both spot and derivatives markets. The growing supply also highlights its resilience as the network of choice for major issuers like Tether, despite higher transaction costs compared to other blockchains. The timing is especially important as the broader market transitions into a new phase. Bitcoin’s recent momentum has reignited optimism, and ETH appears to be following closely, supported by strong fundamentals. Analysts point out that stablecoin growth not only signals higher liquidity but also reinforces adoption across DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and tokenized assets. USDT Mint On Ethereum Sparks Uptober Hopes The market just received a major boost in liquidity after blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence reported that $2,000,000,000 USDT was minted on Ethereum. Large-scale mints of Tether are often interpreted as signals of incoming market activity, as they provide new liquidity that can flow into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Historically, similar events have preceded sharp price moves, as traders and institutions deploy stablecoin reserves into spot markets. Many analysts believe this fresh $2B injection could be the catalyst for the long-awaited “Uptober” rally. Uptober is a term widely used in the crypto community to describe Bitcoin and Ethereum’s strong seasonal performance in October. Data shows that October has historically delivered some of the best monthly returns for crypto, with multiple cycles marking the start of major bull runs during this period. Investors often anticipate this seasonal tailwind, creating a self-reinforcing momentum effect as capital enters the market. Ethereum’s role in this dynamic is crucial. As the primary chain for USDT issuance, Ethereum benefits directly from the increase in on-chain liquidity. Higher stablecoin balances on Ethereum often translate into greater activity across DeFi protocols, exchanges, and staking platforms, strengthening its position as the backbone of crypto adoption. If history repeats itself, this $2B USDT mint could mark the beginning of Uptober’s bullish phase—supporting not only Ethereum but the broader crypto market. Analysts will be watching closely to see how quickly this liquidity enters the system and whether it helps sustain upward momentum through October and beyond. Ethereum Pushes Toward $4,400 After Bounce Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $4,380 after staging a strong recovery from recent lows near $4,000. The daily chart shows ETH regaining momentum, with price breaking back above the 50-day moving average (blue) and testing the $4,400 resistance zone. This level is significant, as it marked repeated rejection points throughout September, and a decisive breakout could open the door to $4,600 and higher. The broader structure remains bullish. Ethereum continues to trade above the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) moving averages, which have acted as long-term support throughout 2024 and 2025. These moving averages reinforce the market’s upward bias, suggesting that the recent correction was more of a consolidation phase than the start of a broader reversal. Momentum indicators are also improving, with buyers stepping in aggressively after ETH briefly dipped below $4,100 last week. The sharp rebound suggests strong demand around that zone, and short-term traders will be watching whether $4,300 can now act as a support base.

Rome’s 2026 budget framework, signed off at an evening cabinet meeting, noted that the deficit would fall to 2.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) next year, maintaining the target set in April. “We are confirming the line of firm and prudent responsibility that takes into account the need to maintain public finance stability,” in compliance with European rules, Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said in a statement. The deficit is projected to further shrink to 2.6% in 2027, then to 2.3% in 2028, the government said on Thursday. Economic growth is expected to be modest, at 0.5% in 2025 and 0.7% in 2026, while public debt is forecasted to reach 136.4% of GDP by 2028. Exiting EU oversight could strengthen Meloni’s fiscal agenda Hitting the European Union’s 3% deficit ceiling this year could pave the way for Italy to exit the bloc’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), the EU’s monitoring system that flags countries with high deficits. Exiting the EDP would strengthen Premier Giorgia Meloni’s government’s fiscal position and give Italy room to increase defense spending, especially as it aims to meet NATO’s target of 5% of GDP for military outlays—a commitment underscored by US President Donald Trump. According to the finance ministry, the funds it has set aside for defense in the budget are conditional on leaving the EDP. Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti confirms that the new fiscal plan “confirms our firm and prudent approach.” The budget “takes into account the need to maintain public finances in compliance with the new European rules and the essential safeguards for the economic and social growth of workers and families,” he said in the statement. With cabinet approval secured, the focus now moves to parliament for ratification. Credit rating agencies may also respond, with S&P Global Ratings expected to provide an update next week and Moody’s Ratings in November. Fitch Ratings, meanwhile, issued its first upgrade for Italy since 2021 last month. The deficit figures form part of a broader 2026 budget plan aimed at delivering tax cuts for the middle class, supporting businesses that hire and invest, and assisting young families, all while maintaining a solid fiscal position. Since 2019, Italy hasn’t run a deficit at or below 3%. Hitting that level in 2025 — which nobody had predicted — contrasts markedly with France, where the deficit is set to remain above that limit for years to come amid ongoing political turmoil. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Italy had earlier criticized the EU’s fiscal rules, describing them as “old and outdated,” arguing they are unfair at a time when countries feel compelled to spend more on defense. Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, called the bloc’s current budget system “stupid and senseless” and noted it needed to be overhauled to give member states more leeway to boost military spending without fear of facing penalties. Investor confidence elevates Italy amid a fragile economic outlook Italy’s improved fiscal position is being pushed by considerably lower borrowing costs, partly fueled by investors’ enthusiasm for the unusual stability of her premiership and her government’s steady efforts at fiscal repair. Spreads between 10-year Italian bond yields and those of Germany stand near 80 basis points, less than a third of the level when Meloni assumed office in 2022. On the downside, the economy remains fragile, with the potential impact of US tariffs hard to calculate at this time. Italy is also hurt by the challenges experienced by the German economy, which is the country’s key trading partner. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Traders should watch $2,400 for buy-signal clusters and risk management opportunities. $4,700 is confirmed as a key resistance that halts Ethereum’s rallies. Sell signals cluster near $4,700 while buy signals appear at $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400 support zones. On-chain and chart-based indicators suggest a staged correction with potential rebounds at each support level. Ethereum resistance $4,700: watch for a pullback toward $3,300–$2,400; monitor signals at $2,400 for buys — read analysis and trade setup now. What is the $4,700 Ethereum resistance and why does it matter? Ethereum resistance at $4,700 is a repeated ceiling where upward momentum stalls, producing sell signals and shorter rallies. Traders treat this level as a decision point: a clean break could fuel continued gains, while sustained rejection raises the odds of a multi-step correction back to lower supports. How could Ethereum retrace toward $2,400 support? Price action shows staged downside targets. First support sits near $3,300, followed by $2,700, with $2,400 acting as a structural floor. Historical rebounds and current buy-signal clusters often emerge near these zones, suggesting a wave-like decline rather than a single collapse. Chart-based analysis and commentary from crypto analyst Ali Charts indicate this pathway as a plausible corrective scenario. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Ethereum Battles Tough $4,700 Resistance; Traders Eye Possible Pullback to $2,400"", ""description"": ""Ethereum resistance $4,700 may trigger a corrective move toward $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400.

Sell signals cluster near resistance while buy signals emerge at critical support levels. Ethereum could see a stepwise correction toward $3,300, $2,700, and eventually $2,400. Market snapshot: Ethereum is trading below the $4,700 ceiling at approximately $4,169. Mixed short-term momentum and recurring rejections place importance on lower support levels as potential stabilization points. Why has $4,700 held as a ceiling? Repeated attempts to clear $4,700 have failed, producing short-lived rallies followed by stronger selling. The level attracts liquidity and stop clusters, making it a focal point for both profit-taking and short entries. Technical signals near this band show increased selling pressure in recent sessions. What do key support levels tell traders? Support zones near $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400 have historically absorbed selling and produced rebound attempts. On-chain metrics and order flow typically concentrate buy orders around these bands. Traders can use these supports for staged entries and to measure the severity of any correction. How likely is a corrective phase and what could it look like? The current formation points to a corrective path rather than an immediate crash. Expect a wave-like descent with interim bounces around each support. A realistic path is a pullback to $3,300, a deeper move to $2,700, and a final test near $2,400 if selling momentum continues. Expert commentary and charting from market analysts (notably Ali Charts as a named analyst source) highlight the $2,400 scenario as plausible if the $4,700 ceiling persists. This view is data-driven and based on technical patterns and past support behavior. Is it crazy to think Ethereum $ETH could drop to $2,400? pic.twitter.com/nBpoDYwd4g — Ali (@ali_charts) September 30, 2025 Traders should prioritize risk controls: define stops, scale positions, and avoid assuming that a support test will automatically produce a full recovery. Use confirmations such as bullish reversal candlesticks, rising volume, or renewed on-chain accumulation before increasing exposure. Frequently Asked Questions Could Ethereum retest $2,400 within weeks? Short-term timing is uncertain, but the price path and resistance behavior make a retest plausible within a multi-week corrective phase if selling continues without a decisive breakout above $4,700. What indicators best confirm a bottom near $2,400? Confirmed bottoms typically show clustered buy volume, on-chain accumulation, diminishing sell pressure, and bullish reversal patterns on daily charts. Multiple indicators aligning increase confidence in a durable support. Key Takeaways $4,700 resistance : Acts as the current ceiling; failure to break increases correction odds. Staged supports : $3,300, $2,700, $2,400 are logical targets for pullbacks and potential entries. Trade management : Use confirmations and risk controls; watch signal clusters at support for buying opportunities. Conclusion Ethereum is confronting a decisive resistance at $4,700 that could trigger a stepwise correction toward $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400. Monitor technical and on-chain signals closely and employ disciplined risk management.

In 2025, three names dominate the conversation: BullZilla, the presale memetic engine rewriting tokenomics; Litecoin, the veteran altcoin that has weathered every cycle; and TRON, the decentralized infrastructure powering countless applications. Together, they represent three very different paths toward growth, speculation, stability, and scalability, yet all share a place in the hunt for extraordinary returns. The core tension lies in which route offers superior upside versus safety. At the heart of this analysis is the notion that BullZilla may be among the best presales with 100x potential 2025, a bold claim rooted in its tokenomics, incentives, and momentum. BullZilla: An Engine Built for Surprise BullZilla ($BZIL) commands attention by design. It is aggressively paced, marrying hype and mechanism. The presale is in Phase A of Stage 5 and has already raised over $760,000. The project boasts more than 2,400 token holders and 29 billion tokens sold. The current price in this stage is $0.00011241. Early participants enjoy an ROI of 1,854 percent already. If the listing target reaches $0.00527, the projected ROI from Stage 5A to listing surpasses 4,589 percent. That blend of metrics catapults BullZilla into most “best presales with 100x potential 2025” conversations. What truly reshapes incentives is the Mutation Mechanism. Whenever $100,000 is raised or 48 hours pass, the price increases. That structure forces participation, discourages waiting, and embeds upward momentum into the system. It is a central reason that many regard $BZIL among the best presales with 100x potential 2025. Every incremental investment matters, every delay risks missing a step. The Roarblood Vault further intensifies community engagement. It funnels referral rewards and loyalty bonuses through on‑chain logic, making every user a stakeholder in growth. That kind of design is why BullZilla is hailed among new crypto presale gems, early stage investments, and altcoins with hype. It’s not just virality for virality’s sake, it is engineered demand. Within presales this month or those curating an early presale watchlist, $BZIL stands out. A $1,000 position today converts into 8.8 million $BZIL tokens. With a forecasted 5.92 percent surge entering Stage 5B, time is pressing. That urgency, encoded by its mechanism, keeps BullZilla in lists of best presales with 100x potential 2025. For devs, analysts, and meme lovers alike, $BZIL is a living experiment in how tokenomics can warp behavior. No presale is risk‑free. Volatility, contract audits, liquidity challenges, or regulatory shifts could upend everything. Yet the structure here leans into possibility. In the narrative of 2025’s presale scene, BullZilla arguably belongs at the top of the best presales with 100x potential 2025 ladder. Litecoin: The Steady Baseline Litecoin trades today at $111.33, backed by its robust track record. It has survived countless cycles and continues to serve as a testing ground for payment infrastructure and technical experimentation. For those studying blockchain systems, LTC offers lessons in UTXO design, network upgrades, and durability. Litecoin rarely appears in lists of best presales with 100x potential 2025 because its profile is fundamentally different. It is not selling novelty or extreme upside. It offers relative stability in a high‑volatility domain. Analysts tend to view LTC as a control asset, a benchmark to test strategies against more speculative plays. From the perspective of those curating early stage portfolios or scouting next big altcoin candidates, Litecoin is not often the hero. Yet it remains a reference point for what “mature altcoin” means. Its role isn’t to compete with presales, but to provide contrast, stability, and long view continuity in markets swayed by hype. TRON: Ecosystem Power with Real Utility TRON’s price sits at $0.3412 today, supported by an active ecosystem of DApps, token protocols, and stablecoin activity. It is not a speculative gimmick; it is infrastructure. Developers build here because of scalable throughput, staking economics, and lower transaction costs. Users transact because of affordability. That makes TRON appealing to those following altcoins with strong demand. Though it doesn’t appear on presale rankings, TRON’s influence is felt across many projects that launch on it. In effect, TRON is a foundation layer for many memes, tokens, and protocols chasing high ROI outcomes. While TRON itself isn’t a presale, it underwrites many that aim to be among the best presales with 100x potential 2025. In comparisons of growth potential, TRON sits somewhere between stable maturity and speculative inflection. It is not chasing 100x in a month, but it creates pathways for tokens that aim to do just that. It also offers a measure of security, given its long presence and existing demand. Closing Reflection For Best Presales with 100x Potential 2025 In the race for 2025 dominance, Bull Zilla, Litecoin, and TRON offer three roads. The most hyped road leads to $BZIL, where mechanics and momentum weld together to create one of the most talked about projects in the best presales with 100x potential 2025 conversation. The steady road is Litecoin, proving that resilience and infrastructure still earn lanes. The infrastructural path belongs to TRON, powering many tokens behind the scenes and enabling the ecosystems that will host the next wave of innovations. Readers who watch, analyze, or build in crypto should track $BZIL closely. If it delivers on promises, it may validate many assumptions about how future presales are structured. But one must always balance zeal with caution. None of this is guaranteed. Knowledge, timing, and conviction matter more than dreams. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) FAQS for Best Presales with 100x Potential What drives BullZilla’s price jumps? The Mutation Mechanism triggers price increases when funding thresholds or time windows are met, forcing a stepwise price path upward. How safe is Litecoin as an asset? Litecoin enjoys longevity, broad exchange support, and a steady track record. Its risk is lower than many speculative tokens, though upside tends to be more moderate. Does TRON still attract new development? Yes. TRON’s scalability, staking model, and cost structure continue to draw projects seeking efficient deployment. Is it realistic for $BZIL to achieve 100x? If market conditions, listing price, and adoption align, the ROI math supports it. But that outcome depends on execution and timing. Glossary Mutation Mechanism: algorithm that escalates presale price by milestones or time windows Roarblood Vault: referral and loyalty rewards system embedded in BullZilla’s contract Token holders: individuals currently owning the presale token Presale stage: discrete phase in token sale with pricing rules Liquidity risk: possibility that token cannot be sold due to low demand or market constraints Vesting: release schedule for tokens held by team or investors Summary This article compares BullZilla, Litecoin, and TRON across risk, design, and upside. It emphasizes BullZilla’s tokenomic innovations like the Mutation Mechanism and Roarblood Vault, placing it firmly among the best presales with 100x potential 2025. Litecoin offers stability and historical continuity while TRON serves as an infrastructure and ecosystem host. By contrasting each, the reader gains insight into how speculative opportunity, durable assets, and platform support interplay in crypto’s evolving narrative.

Now, the same level of hype and investor attention is forming around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , except this time there is far more to the fervor than speculation. While SHIB’s runaway success was built on meme potential and community strength, Mutuum Finance is going down a different path as a utility-driven DeFi project with real-world use cases and the possibility of long-term growth. More than 55% of phase 6 of its presale has been sold out and the tokens are available for purchase at $0.035. The project has gained more than 16,700 holders and $16.7 million in presale commitments already. Mutuum Finance journey to SHIB’s early days is making it a serious coin for the next breakout story. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Sees Renewed Accumulation as Supply Drops Signal Potential Rally Shiba Inu (SHIB) is experiencing renewed investor interest as exchange reserves fall to 84.55 trillion tokens, $998M, the lowest since 2023, according to on-chain data. The trend indicates a shift towards self-custody and staking, which reduces available supply and traditionally sets the stage for accumulation waves. Analysts note that SHIB has now hit a key accumulation zone, and with price action trading near $0.000011, a breakthrough above its descending resistance trendline can spark an “Uptober” rally. While SHIB’s momentum is more rooted in community hype than anything fundamental, it highlights the kind of incredible investor interest that can be marshaled by early-stage crypto projects, a trend also unfolding in utility-driven altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which matches the same degree of excitement with genuine DeFi function and real-yield potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Numbers Point to Healthy Investor Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sees records shattered in its Stage 6 presale, and tokens are now priced at $0.035, a rise of 16.17% from the previous round. Investor demand remains robust, with over 16,700 users and over $16.7 million invested thus far, reflecting increased confidence in the project’s long-term outlook and vision. Mutuum Finance is offering a $100,000 giveaway to early adopters. There will be ten winners who will receive individual $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, and the project’s vision is thus to deliver long-term value and enable growth in the area of community building. Enhanced Security and Risk Management Security is Mutuum Finance’s top priority. To that end, the platform established a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to incentivize developers and security researchers to stress test and provide bug reports. Bugs are prioritized on a four-tier severity level: critical, major, minor, and low, to provide full assurance against potential threats. Mutuum Finance is a risk-weighted Loan-to-Value (LTV) protocol that assigns enough collateral to every asset according to its risk level, thereby a more stable and balanced lending process. During periods of market volatility, the protocol has a buffer reserve mechanism, with excess reserves on riskier assets as extra collateral. Dynamic liquidation ratios and real-time LTV are established dynamically to respond to prevailing market conditions in order to enable the protocol to successfully thwart volatility. Multipliers on reserves are graduated from 10% for less risky assets to 35% for more risky asset classes, adding another level of systemic insurance. Efficiency is also of paramount importance to Mutuum Finance. Collateral is optimized to create maximum borrowing capacity and correlated assets are utilized to render lending and borrowing efficiency ideal. These architectures provide low insolvency risks with a stable, sustainable DeFi protocol. Is Mutuum Finance the Next Shiba Inu? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a utility-driven DeFi alternative to early Shiba Inu (SHIB), with more than $16.7 million raised, 16,700+ holders, and over 55% of Phase 6 presale sold at $0.035. Combining dual lending, dynamic LTV control, and robust security with real-world DeFi use case utility ensures that MUTM offers early investors exposure to high-upside potential growth.

52588284,595967,1759453210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52588284.jpeg,Market Strategist: What You Should Expect For The XRP Next Leg,https://bitcoinist.com/what-to-expect-for-xrp-next-leg/,"XRP has been stuck under $3 for much of the past two weeks and is struggling to build the kind of momentum traders have been waiting for, alongside the rest of the crypto market. That picture has started to change in the past day, as the price began climbing back toward $3. This shift comes as market commentators are revealing different bullish technical setups, with one of the loudest voices being Altcoin Gordon, who believes the next move for XRP won’t just be higher, but it will be fast and aggressive. Next XRP Move Will Be Fast And Aggressive Altcoin Gordon, who has built a reputation for bold commentary on the crypto market, issued an important call for crypto traders on the social media platform X. The analyst didn’t hesitate with words on his post, noting that XRP’s next move is going to be fast and aggressive. According to him, the best course of action now is to be “either positioned BEFORE it happens, or begin for an entry once it does.” Gordon’s perspective is rooted in how the altcoin has been trading inside a descending triangle on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. This structure has become evident considering that the XRP price has bounced off the same support level about three times since early August. Particularly, the chart setup Gordon points to shows the asset holding a key support around $2.70 multiple times. The structure suggests pressure is building, and once the upper resistance trendline gives way, the breakout could come with speed. According to Gordon’s projection on the daily chart, the first stop is breaking above the resistance trendline currently around $3. However, the real acceleration would likely push XRP to $3.6 and above to new all-time highs. Longer-Term Signals Point Toward Bigger Gains Gordon’s focus is on the immediate breakout, but his outlook gains weight when combined with longer-term projections from other analysts. For instance, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto drew attention to XRP’s performance on the three-month candlestick chart, noting that the coin has flipped green for the first time since 2017. Such signal coincided with the start of the major uptrend in 2017 that pushed the token price to unprecedented price levels at the time. If history repeats itself, its price could be on the verge of something much larger than just a rally to $3 or $3.6. Mikybull’s analysis predicts that the XRP price could reach anywhere between $5 and $15 on the macro uptrend. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading at $2.98, having increased by about 4.8% in the past 24 hours. CoinCodex’s algorithm also predicts that XRP will reach above $4 within the next six months, specifically a $4.20 price target. This projection was shared by the official CoinCodex account in a direct response to Altcoin Gordon’s post on X.",XRP|Altcoin Gordon|CoinCodex|Mikybull Crypto|ripple|Upper Resistance Trendline|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 01:00:10

Bullish Patterns and Global Adoption Spark Fresh October Optimism,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/can-dogecoin-hit-1-bullish-patterns-and-global-adoption-spark-fresh-october-optimism/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has started October with renewed strength, riding a wave of bullish technical patterns and increasing global adoption that continue to boost optimism among traders and long-term holders alike. Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Top? Top Trader Warns Of Brutal $98,000 Liquidity Sweep As momentum grows, analysts are closely monitoring key resistance levels around $0.33 and higher as DOGE shows signs of consolidating for its next big move. The technical outlook is supported by on-chain signals and open interest inflows, indicating that market participants are gearing up for further upside. DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Golden Cross Formation and Technical Strength On multiple timeframes, Dogecoin is completing a Golden Cross pattern, a bullish signal that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term one. Historically, such setups have preceded major rallies in both DOGE and the wider altcoin market. Currently, DOGE trades near $0.258, after defending support at $0.25, where the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement aligns with the point of control. Analysts, including Cas Abbe and Trader Tardigrade, have highlighted rising momentum. The MACD histogram has turned green on the 12-hour chart, suggesting strengthening buying pressure. A breakout above the $0.33 resistance zone could open the door to $0.37, a potential 60% rally from current levels. Market structure also shows consistent higher lows, reinforcing demand even during short-term pullbacks. Adoption Expands Beyond Speculation Beyond technical indicators, Dogecoin’s adoption story is becoming a strong driver. Buenos Aires recently approved DOGE for tax payments, marking a step toward real-world use of cryptocurrencies. This follows earlier efforts by businesses and institutions exploring Dogecoin for payments, adding legitimacy beyond its meme roots. Meanwhile, futures market data shows bullish sentiment. Open interest in Dogecoin derivatives increased nearly 3% in the last 24 hours, with more than $3.9 billion in DOGE locked in. Exchanges like Gate, Binance, and Bybit lead with billions of dollars wagered, reflecting growing trader confidence. $1 Dogecoin (DOGE) Target Within Sight? Short-term targets for Dogecoin remain centered on $0.30 and $0.34, but analysts are also considering longer-term prospects. According to one projection, DOGE’s consolidation pattern on weekly charts could serve as the basis for a parabolic rally toward $1 by 2026. This scenario would mean over 330% gains from current levels, aligning with Dogecoin’s history of explosive, community-driven surges. For now, DOGE needs to stay above the $0.22 support and break through the $0.33 barrier.

Institutional momentum includes ETF requests from asset managers and increased ADA reserve listings by institutions. Coinbase cbADA reserves surge 462% to 9.56M ADA; learn what this means for Cardano holders and institutional interest—read the proof-of-reserve update now. Coinbase’s growing cbADA token reserves reflect increasing institutional interest in Cardano, signaling positive trends for ADA’s future. Coinbase’s cbADA reserve grew by 462% over the past four months, highlighting strong adoption and demand for Cardano-based DeFi tokens. Cardano’s expansion into DeFi, supported by Coinbase’s cbADA token, is driving significant institutional interest and exposure for ADA holders. Institutional confidence in Cardano is rising, with asset managers seeking Cardano-based ETFs and the token’s inclusion in reserve discussions. Coinbase recently updated its cbADA proof of reserve, showing a marked growth in its holdings of the Cardano-backed token. As of the latest report, Coinbase holds 9,563,462 ADA , valued at approximately $8.2 million . This reserve supports its 1:1 backing policy for the cbADA token, with the total supply at 9,530,418 . The updated figures represent a 462% increase in the cbADA reserve in four months, demonstrating notable momentum for Cardano on the exchange. What are Coinbase cbADA reserves and why do they matter? Coinbase cbADA reserves are ADA tokens held by Coinbase to back its cbADA wrapped token 1:1, ensuring redeemability and supporting DeFi access for ADA holders. The reserve size matters because larger, audited reserves increase confidence in the cbADA peg and broaden institutional exposure to Cardano. How did cbADA supply and holdings change since launch? The cbADA token launched in June with an initial supply of 1.7 million tokens. Coinbase’s updated proof shows supply and backing have converged, with holdings now at 9,563,462 ADA and supply at 9,530,418 cbADA. The reserve climb—462% over four months—reflects inflows and minting activity tied to demand for wrapped ADA in DeFi. Why is this surge important for Cardano institutional interest? Rising cbADA reserves are a direct signal of institutional and large-scale user activity. Asset managers publicizing interest in Cardano-based ETFs and formal reserve listings by institutional entities further strengthen ADA’s institutional narrative. These developments increase ADA liquidity and may encourage broader adoption by financial firms exploring alternative large-cap tokens. Which DeFi uses drive cbADA demand? cbADA enables ADA holders to access Ethereum-compatible DeFi services such as Aave, Uniswap, and Compound on Base and other EVM chains. Increased usage for lending, staking derivatives, and liquidity provisioning has coincided with Coinbase’s reserve growth, supporting practical demand beyond speculative holding. How to interpret Coinbase’s proof-of-reserve data? Read proof-of-reserve numbers as a transparency metric: verify the wallet totals against publicly reported supplies and exchange disclosures. Coinbase’s 1:1 backing claim is meaningful when audited reserve snapshots align with circulating cbADA. Persistent reserve increases suggest sustained inflows rather than short-term arbitrage.

Elon Musk has faced legal scrutiny from regulators in both the U.S. and the UK over the management of his companies. In the latest development, a U.S. judge has rejected his request to move an SEC lawsuit from Washington, D.C., to Texas. SEC’s case against Musk A federal judge has rejected Elon Musk’s attempt to transfer a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit to Texas, keeping the high-stakes case in Washington, D.C. U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan ruled Thursday that Musk failed to show sufficient grounds to move the case away from Washington. He also insisted that the billionaire maintains a broad presence across states and abroad, even though Musk spends much of his time in Texas, where Tesla and SpaceX have their headquarters. “The Court takes Mr. Musk’s convenience seriously, but it also notes that Mr. Musk has considerable means and spends at least forty percent of his time outside his chosen forum,” Sooknanan wrote. “Indeed, although Mr. Musk may have ‘rarely’ traveled to this District in recent months, Mr. Musk’s brief itself indicates that he has spent substantial time here this year.” The SEC lawsuit started in January 2025, more than two years after Musk acquired Twitter, now rebranded as X, for $44B. The regulator is looking to prove that the SpaceX founder violated disclosure rules when he quietly stacked more than 5% of Twitter’s stock in early 2022 before going public with his stake and subsequent takeover. Federal securities law requires investors to file a special disclosure within ten days of surpassing a 5% threshold in a publicly traded company. According to the SEC, Musk delayed filing the paperwork, which allowed him to buy additional shares at lower prices and deprived other investors of material information. The SEC claims that the timing of Musk’s stake disclosure in April 2022, after he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder , cost other shareholders over $150M. “Musk’s conduct undermined the transparency and fairness of the securities markets,” the SEC argued in its filings. “The violation is clear, and the consequences for shareholders were significant.” Musk’s legal team, however, has dismissed the suit as baseless and politically motivated. In August, they filed a motion to dismiss, calling the case “a waste of this court’s time and taxpayer resources.” The attorneys are insisting that Musk’s actions caused no meaningful harm and that the SEC is pursuing a personal vendetta against him. SEC refuses to concede home-field advantage In addition to challenging the lawsuit’s validity, Musk asked for the case to be relocated to Texas, where he has moved much of his business empire. His lawyers argued that forcing him to fight the SEC in Washington, the agency’s home turf, would be unfair. “Forcing Mr. Musk to litigate in this district would merely perpetuate and compound the harm from the SEC’s years-long campaign against him,” Musk’s attorneys wrote in their motion. The judge was not persuaded. Sooknanan emphasized that Musk’s wealth and global travel schedule demolish his claims of inconvenience. She also noted that Washington, D.C., is the logical venue since the SEC is headquartered there and much of the agency’s work on the case has been conducted in the capital. The ruling keeps the case in the same district where Musk has previously sparred with regulators and also ensures that the proceedings remain close to the SEC’s leadership and legal staff, who have clashed with Musk multiple times over the past decade. Keeping the case in Washington may provide a procedural advantage for the SEC and expedite a resolution.

If approved, this would expand its crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investors’ optimism is reflected in the LDO price rising above 7%. As per the official document, it is registered as a statutory trust, with the agent being the CSC Delaware Trust Company. The move is a significant step towards offering staked Ethereum products to all categories of investors. VanEck advances toward launching Ethereum staking ETF The initial step for most ETFs is typically a filing in the state of Delaware, followed by approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration does not guarantee approval . Still, it suggests that VanEck is interested in offering additional cryptocurrency products. The establishment of the first Ethereum staking ETF has already shown how demand for such products can accelerate investor interest in ETH. The company already oversees spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The two have attracted significant inflows since their launch, by linking the new offering to Lido’s staked Ethereum, VanEck targets to capitalize on the growing investor interest in yield-generating digital assets. VanEck brings liquid Ethereum staking to institutional investors Staked Ethereum refers to coins locked within the Ethereum network to validate transactions. Currently, the ideal platform for this is Lido, due to the liquidity it provides to users. Otherwise, they would have had their funds frozen. Investors may also earn staking rewards in Ethereum investing and trading. By incorporating this model into an ETF wrapper, large investors can capitalize on staking returns without needing to understand the inner workings of blockchain technology. Institutional adoption of crypto products accelerates following the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs. The filing is part of VanEck’s possible attempt to stay ahead of rivals such as BlackRock and Fidelity, which may also consider staking-related investment vehicles. Favourable trust laws have made Delaware the primary jurisdiction for registering new funds due to its favorable trust laws. Most statutory trusts begin here before advancing toward SEC evaluation. The regulatory watchdog recently approved the listing of Grayscale Ethereum ETFs, marking a significant milestone in the rapid evolution of the regulatory landscape for such products. The appointment of CSC Delaware Trust Company as the registered agent follows a standard structure used by major asset managers. The announcement also influenced the Lido DAO (LDO) token, which, according to TradingView, has risen 16.25% over the past week and 53.78% over the past six months.

The financial vehicle is designed to cement Europe’s position in one of the most competitive areas of deep tech. The fund, launched by Copenhagen-based 55 North, has already secured a first close of €134 million and aims to become the world’s largest dedicated vehicle for quantum investments. The initiative marks one of the most ambitious attempts yet by a European nation to bridge the gap between world-class research and commercial breakthroughs in quantum computing, sensing and communications. The Danish government and Novo have combined in funding tech 55 North’s target fund will invest across quantum computing , sensing, communications and enabling components. “When these technologies come to fruition, they could be transformative for some of the areas we care deeply about,” Soren Moller, managing partner for seed investments at Novo Holdings, said , reflecting the foundation’s interest in applications for life sciences and planetary health. The move follows earlier, related investments where the foundation and the government jointly committed to an Nvidia-powered AI supercomputer last year. Earlier this summer, they agreed to co-fund a Microsoft-powered quantum computer , named Magne, which will be made available to industry and researchers. The Magne machine , to be built with Microsoft and Atom Computing and operated by a new entity, QuNorth, is expected to begin work by early 2027. Lab breakthroughs turn into investable companies Europe has long led in quantum science, and over the years, it has seen research coming out of the continent become investable technology firms; however, this progress isn’t moving at the pace observed in places like the US and China. 55 North’s founding team has already placed early bets in areas such as quantum hardware and cryogenics. Novo Holdings, on the other hand, is known for its exploits in the pharmaceutical world. The foundation has pointed out that quantum-enabled simulation could materially accelerate drug discovery and complex molecular modelling. At the same time, Novo Nordisk has reason to invest and diversify as it faces mounting competitive pressures in the US obesity market and has announced substantial job reductions as it reorganizes under new leadership. Risks, geopolitics and the long game Quantum technology is still largely experimental and real-world applications are growing. However, the time it may take to yield major returns to investors may take years, if not decades. Denmark’s route of combining public backing with one of Europe’s most powerful foundations may be the way to go as funding deep technologies like this one are usually too risky for conventional venture capitalists. Analysts point out that quantum investment in the US is the highest, with companies such as IBM, Google and Amazon pouring billions into the field. China, meanwhile, has committed heavily to national programs. Europe’s challenge will include securing essential supply chains on top of scaling its startups and retaining talent. If successful, the fund could strengthen Europe’s role in quantum-enhanced pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and climate modeling. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

How did withdrawal of the 19b-4 affect the timeline? Canary withdrew the 19b-4 application on Sept. 25, 2025, after the SEC asked applicants to do so. That withdrawal may make the older 19b-4 clock irrelevant and refocus review on the S-1 registration statement. Industry analysts, including James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, note the change could alter established deadlines and approval expectations. Source: Eleanor Terrett The SEC’s silence raises two separate sources of delay: (1) a partial government shutdown that the agency says limits review capacity, and (2) implementation of new generic listing standards that could supersede 19b-4 timelines. Why could the government shutdown delay ETF approvals? The SEC posted an “Operation Plan” in August stating it would not review and approve registration applications during a shutdown. The agency has said it will continue limited operations and keep EDGAR online, but full review and acceleration of registration statements may be paused until staffing resumes. How large is the spot crypto ETF market and what’s at stake? Approvals for altcoin spot ETFs could broaden the US spot crypto ETF market, which investors value at roughly $75 billion. Since last year the US Bitcoin spot ETF has attracted $61.3 billion in inflows and Ether spot ETFs $13.4 billion, underscoring potential demand for additional products. Spot ETF inflows since launch Asset Inflows (USD) Bitcoin (BTC) $61.3 billion Ether (ETH) $13.4 billion When will applicants know if the new listing standards change timelines? The SEC’s new listing standards under Rule 6c-11 are intended to streamline approvals, but the agency has not publicly defined new effective dates for pending applications. Analysts argue the standards could reduce review times that previously ran up to 240 days, but exact timelines will depend on SEC guidance and staffing. What authoritative sources and commentary inform this update? Market commentary referenced includes Bloomberg ETF analysts and reporting by Eleanor Terrett. The SEC’s publicly posted “Operation Plan” and statements from SEC leadership provide the official framework for operations during a shutdown.

The SEC has said limited staffing will constrain reviews and approvals, but some critical systems like EDGAR remain operational. Full approval workflows for new registration statements may be delayed until staffing levels permit comprehensive review. How should investors respond to the Canary Litecoin ETF pause? Investors should monitor official issuer filings and SEC notices, diversify exposure appropriately, and treat timelines as fluid until the SEC provides definitive rulings or restores full review capacity. Key Takeaways SEC inaction : The SEC did not decide on the Canary Litecoin ETF by the original deadline, creating immediate uncertainty. Procedural shift : Withdrawal of 19b-4 filings moves emphasis to S-1 registration statements for approval. Operational risk : A government shutdown and limited SEC staff may delay approvals even as new listing standards aim to streamline future reviews. Conclusion The Canary Litecoin ETF decision remains pending after the SEC took no action by the original deadline, complicated by a requested 19b-4 withdrawal and a federal government shutdown. Market participants should monitor issuer S-1 filings, SEC guidance on Rule 6c-11, and official communications from COINOTAG for updates and next steps. pic.twitter.com/FmbMfWWaqe — Litecoin (@litecoin) October 2, 2025 Note: Bloomberg and analyst commentary, reporting by Eleanor Terrett, and SEC public filings inform this article.

Ethereum Makes Privacy A Priority In an October 1 post titled “Privacy Cluster Leadership Announcement,” EF said it is “organizing for scale and impact,” naming longtime ecosystem builder Igor Barinov as the coordinator of Privacy @ EF and Andy Guzman as the new coordinator of the PSE (Privacy & Scaling Explorations) team, succeeding Sam Richards. “Together, Igor and Andy will help ensure Ethereum’s privacy work is impactful, coherent, and accountable,” the Foundation wrote. The announcement reframes EF’s privacy mission as three concrete pillars—“Private Reads,” “Private Writes,” and “Private Proving”—that directly map to user and institutional needs. Private Reads targets surveillance-resistant querying, authentication, and browsing; Private Writes focuses on shielding actions such as payments, governance, and transfers; and Private Proving aims to make proofs “efficient, portable, and usable across contexts like identities, data portability, and client-side proving.” EF links these pillars to practical compliance and safety requirements, arguing they are “necessary for institutions to comply with data protection standards,” help individuals avoid metadata leaks, and “shield our private financial information.”The Foundation is explicit that privacy will no longer be treated as an abstract research track divorced from shipping software. “For Ethereum to become a foundation for civilizational infrastructure, privacy cannot be abstract research alone. It must be organized, resourced, and deployed at scale,” the post states—an unusually direct articulation of the program’s end goal and a signal that the cluster will be judged on delivery as much as on research output. The post closes with a blunt credo—“Privacy is normal, and Ethereum is for privacy”—and an open invitation for builders to connect with Barinov and Guzman and to explore a catalog of “700+ projects” in the on-chain privacy space. Barinov, best known for founding Blockscout, Gnosis Chain, and zkBob, brings a mix of infrastructure, open-source stewardship, and applied privacy product experience. Guzman, who has been with PSE/EF since 2022, moves from strategy and product leadership into the top operational role for PSE, which EF describes as spanning applied cryptography, research, and engineering. Substantively, the cluster model is designed to integrate ongoing work on privacy-preserving computation with Ethereum’s public verifiability guarantees. While the post does not enumerate specific deliverables or dates, its emphasis on “portable” and “usable” proving, institutional compliance, and metadata-minimizing reads implies a roadmap that extends beyond shielded transfers toward end-to-end private user journeys—identity, access, payments, and governance—compatible with L1/L2 designs and client-side proving patterns that have been maturing across the ecosystem.

Bitcoin Has Broken Past 0.5 SD MVRV Deviation Band In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where Bitcoin may be heading next based on the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands. This pricing model is based on the popular Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio, an indicator that compares the market cap of Bitcoin against its realized cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder RVT Nears Cycle Lows: A Healthy Reset? The former represents the value currently held by the BTC investors, while the latter is a measure of the value that they initially put in. As such, the MVRV Ratio basically represents the profit-loss balance of the overall network. When the value of the metric is greater than 1, it means the market cap is greater than the realized cap and the average investor is sitting on an unrealized gain. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the investors as a whole may be considered underwater. The MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands takes the mean of the MVRV Ratio and calculates standard deviations (SDs) from it. It then determines price levels that correspond to these standard deviations. Below is the chart for this Bitcoin pricing model shared by the analyst. As is visible in the graph, the mean of the MVRV Ratio is currently situated at $94,650 in the model. What this means is that if Bitcoin declines to this level, the MVRV Ratio would attain a value equal to its mean. During BTC’s recent decline, its price slipped below the +0.5 SD level of $116,700. With the latest recovery run, however, it has smashed past it. The next level on the model is the +1 SD, located at $138,800. Bitcoin has surged above this band twice in the current cycle so far, with a top following for the cryptocurrency shortly after each break. The explanation behind the trend could lie in the fact that investors become more likely to participate in profit-taking selloffs the higher their gains get. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Big Move? CryptoQuant Says These Alerts Are To Watch The MVRV Ratio being 1 SD above its mean corresponds to holder gains being notably higher than the norm. As such, it’s not surprising to see that BTC topped out shortly after crossing the threshold during both of the 2024 breakouts. It now remains to be seen whether this latest surge above the +0.5 SD level will lead Bitcoin to another retest of the +1 SD band, or if the run will fizzle out before it can happen. BTC Price Bitcoin has witnessed a recovery run of almost 7% over the last week that has taken its price to the $119,200 level.

Bullish Reversal For Ethereum Price Market expert Gert van Lagen took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his insights, suggesting that the Ethereum price is currently following a “textbook” expanding diagonal pattern on its biweekly chart. As seen in the expert’s chart below, this expanding diagonal pattern is characterized by a series of rising trend lines, indicating a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. Over the past month and a half, the Ethereum price has consolidated between $4,200 and $4,600, with a brief drop towards $3,800 on September 25th. This met significant demand, resulting in a swift recovery of the $4,000 support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Rally Towards All-Time Highs: Top Analysts Share Predictions By connecting the lower points of these downward movements—known as waves 2 and 4—with the upper points of waves 1, 3, and 5, a triangular or diagonal shape emerges. According to van Lagen’s analysis, this pattern signifies a shift in momentum for the Ethereum price from bearish to bullish, often leading to a significant upward breakout. Bitcoin (BTC) led the market recovery also approaching record levels above $120,000. Van Lagen noted that Ethereum’s Wave v is nearing completion, supported by a final corrective a-b-c wave. Specifically, Wave a has successfully broken above the crucial resistance level of $3,650, retested it for support in the b wave, and is now poised for the final impulse in wave c, aiming for an ambitious target range of $9,000 to $18,000. The Path Forward For ETH Adding to the optimistic sentiment, market analyst Mr. Wall Street has expressed a similarly bullish outlook, asserting that the Ethereum price is on track to reach its final price target for this cycle, estimated between $7,000 and $8,000. However, both analysts agree that Ethereum’s ability to surpass its previous record near the $5,000 mark will be pivotal as this level is expected to act as a significant resistance barrier should the current recovery continue. Related Reading: Rumble At The Core: How Tether Plans To Dominate The US Stablecoin Market Looking ahead, market analyst Michael van de Poppe has also weighed in, predicting that the coming weeks will see Bitcoin experience an upward bounce before undergoing a slight correction. Following this, he anticipates the Ethereum price will begin to gain momentum. “Given that the BTC pair is currently holding up well and has undergone a standard correction, I believe we will see Ethereum pick up steam in the near future,” van de Poppe stated.

Attendees and observers offered measured responses. Tory Green of io.net emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in coverage. Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin criticized deplatforming as a principle, while Cecilia Hsueh of MEXC noted that independent outlets often match crypto’s fast-moving culture better than traditional press. What are the main criticisms and safeguards to watch for? Critics warn projects tied to political figures may face conflicts of interest or promote personal advantages. Readers should look for audited smart contracts, clear governance, and published financial disclosures before engaging. Frequently Asked Questions Is World Liberty Financial regulated? Regulatory status was not detailed in public remarks at Token 2049. Prospective users should seek official disclosures and legal filings published by the project for clarity. Did deplatforming drive a broader crypto trend? Many in crypto view deplatforming and banking restrictions as catalysts for decentralized alternatives. The sector’s focus on self-custody and censorship resistance grew notably after high-profile platform removals in 2021. Key Takeaways Project purpose : World Liberty Financial is framed as an alternative media and finance vehicle responding to deplatforming and debanking. Industry view : Experts cited transparency and independent coverage as vital for credible crypto reporting. Due diligence : Investors should verify team credentials, contracts, audits, and disclosures before participation. Conclusion Donald Trump Jr.’s public remarks at Token 2049 positioned World Liberty Financial as a response to perceived mainstream media and banking exclusions, emphasizing alternate channels for communication and finance.

Fusaka upgrade: Ethereum scaling update that raises gas limits and enables lighter nodes; monitor Sepolia/Hoodi tests — read the deployment plan and market impact. What is the Fusaka upgrade? Fusaka upgrade is an Ethereum protocol enhancement designed to scale bandwidth and reduce costs by enabling lighter nodes to sample blob data and by increasing the protocol gas limit to roughly 150 million per block. It targets cheaper Layer‑2 transactions and greater throughput for tokenization use cases. How does Fusaka improve transaction throughput and node efficiency? Fusaka allows nodes to validate and sample data instead of storing full blob payloads, cutting storage requirements and bandwidth for node operators. The upgrade also raises gas limits to about 150M (from ~45M), which increases transactions per block and lets Layer‑2 networks push larger batches at lower per‑tx cost. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Fusaka upgrade: What’s next, how it scales Ethereum and market reaction"", ""description"": ""Fusaka upgrade: Ethereum scaling update that raises gas limits and enables lighter nodes; monitor Sepolia/Hoodi tests and market impact."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T10:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T14:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-141704.png"" ], ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/fusaka-upgrade-2025"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When will Fusaka reach mainnet?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Fusaka passed Holesky tests on October 1 and will move to Sepolia and Hoodi testnets; mainnet deployment is targeted for early December if testing finds no blocking issues."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How does Fusaka affect Layer‑2 transaction costs?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""By increasing gas limits and enabling lighter node data sampling, Fusaka allows Layer‑2 systems to submit larger, denser batches, lowering per‑transaction costs on L2 rollups and optimistic systems."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to follow Fusaka testing on Sepolia and Hoodi"", ""description"": ""Simple steps for node operators and developers to monitor Fusaka testnet progress and prepare for mainnet."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm repository and client builds"", ""text"": ""Pull the official client releases and build the supported clients locally or use CI artifacts to run testnet nodes."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Join Sepolia/Hoodi testnets"", ""text"": ""Launch nodes on Sepolia and Hoodi configurations, enable blob sampling features, and sync to the latest testnet tip to validate behavior."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Run transaction batches and measure gas"", ""text"": ""Submit L2‑style batch transactions to evaluate gas per batch, latency, and node resource usage; compare against pre‑Fusaka baselines."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Report issues and monitor updates"", ""text"": ""Log and report any consensus or resource regressions; follow official protocol team updates and iterate on client fixes."" } ]} Why did Ethereum prioritize Fusaka now? Ethereum is preparing for higher on‑chain activity tied to tokenization and internet capital markets narratives. Fusaka addresses bandwidth and cost constraints that limit Layer‑2 scaling, helping Ethereum remain competitive with faster chains in throughput-sensitive applications. On October 1, the Ethereum protocol team announced that Fusaka successfully passed the Holesky testnet validation suite. The next milestones are Sepolia and Hoodi testnets, with a conditional mainnet upgrade targeted for early December. How did markets react to Fusaka? ETH rallied roughly 5% after the Fusaka announcement window, driven in part by broader market moves. Short‑term futures metrics showed elevated speculative interest: ETH Open Interest rose ~4% in 24 hours compared with SOL +2% and BTC +3%. Source: TradingView (price chart) — Open Interest and intraday flows provided by public market data providers and exchange reports. What are the implementation risks and monitoring points? Key risks include client implementation bugs, consensus regressions, and unforeseen resource spikes for light nodes. Teams will monitor block propagation, reorg frequency, and memory/disk profiles on Sepolia/Hoodi. Any critical issues would delay mainnet rollout. Frequently Asked Questions Will Fusaka change ETH gas fees for everyday users? Fusaka should lower per‑tx costs for Layer‑2 users by enabling larger and more efficient rollup batches, but direct L1 gas fee volatility will still depend on demand and base fee dynamics. Can node operators run lighter nodes after Fusaka? Yes. Fusaka enables lighter node modes that sample blob data rather than storing full payloads, reducing storage and bandwidth requirements for node operators while maintaining strong validation guarantees. Key Takeaways Fusaka raises bandwidth : Enables data sampling and raises gas limits to ~150M to increase throughput. Testnet progression : Passed Holesky; next stops are Sepolia and Hoodi before a possible early December mainnet upgrade. Market impact : ETH saw short‑term speculative interest; futures Open Interest rose ~4% versus SOL +2% and BTC +3%. Conclusion Fusaka upgrade is a targeted scaling step for Ethereum that combines node efficiency and higher block gas capacity to reduce Layer‑2 costs and support tokenization growth.

This update was made public after an announcement on Thursday, October 2, revealing that Morpho intends to establish stablecoin lending markets on the Cronos blockchain, with the launch of the first vaults anticipated later this year. With this combination, users can deposit wrapped Ether or Bitcoin into Morpho vaults and utilize them as collateral to borrow stablecoins and earn yield. The Morpho lending protocol acts as a game-changer in blockchain technology Wrapped assets are tokens on one blockchain, such as Ethereum, that represent an asset from a different blockchain, like Bitcoin, at a 1:1 value. On Cronos, wrapped tokens like CDCETH and CDCBTC reflect ETH and BTC, enabling users to add value to the network and access DeFi lending markets without leaving the chain. Following these updates , Morpho’s co-founder and integration team lead, Merlin Egalite, said that they aim to provide a trusted user experience in the front, with DeFi infrastructure in the back. He further explained that the protocol will be directly combined into Crypto.com’s platforms, offering its lending features to all users. Morpho connects lenders and borrowers using platforms such as Aave and Compound. With its increased adoption, the protocol has been positioned as the second-largest DeFi lending protocol, with a total value locked of around $7.7 billion, according to reports from DefiLlama. For the accessibility of this protocol, Egalite mentioned that users based in the US will have the chance to access the protocol. He acknowledged that the Genesis Act hinders stablecoin issuers from directly paying reserve yields to holders. However, he stated that lending a stablecoin and earning yield is a different activity that does not depend on the issuer, so the restrictions do not affect it. In the meantime, the partnership between Morphos and Crypto.com was established just a few weeks after the DeFi lending protocol teamed up with the US crypto exchange Coinbase. Regarding its partnership with Morpho, Coinbase stated that it had integrated the Morpho lending protocol directly into its app, with the DeFi advisory firm Steakhouse Financial overseeing the vaults. Similar to the Crypto.com feature, users can lend USDC without leaving the platform to access other DeFi services or wallets. Banks raise concerns about stablecoin issuers’ plan to eliminate traditional banks Just days after the partnership announcements, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong revealed plans to build a full-fledged crypto “super app” designed to replace the need for traditional banks. Banks raised concerns about the plan and resisted this change. In August, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) and several US financial institutions penned a letter to Congress requesting that they close stablecoin loopholes. They contend these loopholes give stablecoin issuers a way to compete with banks without the appropriate oversight. The letter warns that if these concerns go unaddressed, as much as $6.6 trillion in deposits could flee the US banking system. On September 16, Coinbase responded to the banks’ claims in a blog post, calling them false and stating there is no proof that the growth of stablecoins has led to any deposit losses at local banks. The post mentioned, “The institutions now claiming ‘systemic risk’ are the same ones making tens of billions from card processing fees, which stablecoins could completely avoid.” Responding to the accusations, Coinbase issued a blog post on September 16, saying they were all false and that there is no evidence of any deposit loss at local banks due to stablecoin growth. The post noted that the organizations raising concerns about ‘systemic risk’ are the same ones that acquire tens of billions from card processing fees, which stablecoins could potentially eliminate.

These offerings typically range from basic $20 spells to advanced $73 “millionaire” rituals and include disclaimers that outcomes are for entertainment and not guaranteed. Sellers market rituals, oracle cards, and bespoke crypto spells on Etsy. Pricing often ranges from about $20 to $73 for premium “millionaire” spells. Many listings include entertainment-only disclaimers and vary widely in sales and reviews. Etsy crypto spells: understand claims, pricing, and safety—read COINOTAG’s concise guide now. What are Etsy crypto spells and how do sellers describe them? Etsy crypto spells are product listings where sellers advertise rituals, personalized manifestations, or oracle-card readings intended to influence financial luck in cryptocurrency markets. Listings commonly describe spiritual alignment, candle rituals, and customized intentions tied to a buyer’s crypto holdings while including disclaimers that results cannot be guaranteed. How common are these listings and who’s buying them? These offerings have proliferated on Etsy and social platforms this year. Some shops show modest sales, while long-standing sellers report thousands of transactions. One account advertising similar services reports more than 120,000 sales at roughly $18 per item, illustrating demand for metaphysical goods linked to finance and lifestyle. New trend: sellers on Etsy list spells, oracle cards and rituals that claim to boost cryptocurrency fortunes, promising alignment with market “prosperity” or bespoke crypto-focused manifestations. Listings vary in scope and price. A typical structure includes a basic ritual for about $20, an upgraded performance at $42, and a high-tier package dubbed a “millionaire spell” for roughly $73. Descriptions emphasize spiritual intent and personal energy alignment with market success, but many include explicit disclaimers framing the service as entertainment. Promotional image from the crypto spell listing. Source: Etsy Beyond spells, sellers advertise novel formats like “Bitcoin Oracle Cards” and coin-specific rituals—examples include a “Dogecoin wealth ritual” that pairs candles, crystals, and downloadable affirmations. Sellers often provide short videos or images to illustrate ritual components and the intended client experience. Social channels and forums note buyer reactions ranging from curiosity to satire. A Reddit post recounted a user paying for a ritual aimed at driving Bitcoin to a specific price target. Public reaction has been mixed, with some users mocking claims and others treating listings as playful or therapeutic alternatives to conventional financial advice. Bitcoin Oracle cards. Source: Etsy Why do these listings matter to buyers and regulators? They highlight the intersection of commerce, belief, and speculative finance. For consumers, the core issues are transparency, consumer protection, and financial literacy. For platforms, the question is enforcement of content rules that prohibit certain metaphysical services but still allow a wide range of spiritual goods. Buyers should note that many sellers include entertainment disclaimers and avoid specific time-bound promises. Reported metrics—sales volume and review averages—offer signals about a shop’s longevity but are not proof of efficacy for financial outcomes. Etsy Bitcoin price spell post on r/Bitcoin. Source: Reddit What should potential buyers consider before purchasing? Read listings thoroughly, check seller history and reviews, and treat claims about guaranteed market outcomes skeptically. Verify refund policies and be wary of any service that equates ritual work with financial returns. Approach such purchases as consumer-grade entertainment rather than investment advice.

Yes, selling spiritual or metaphysical goods is generally legal, but platforms may set policies restricting certain services. Listings that avoid explicit fraudulent promises typically remain available as consumer products. Can a ritual influence cryptocurrency markets? There is no empirical evidence that ritual work can change market prices. Market movements depend on economic, technological, and regulatory factors reported by established financial sources. Key Takeaways Claim vs. evidence : Ritual listings often claim financial benefits but lack verifiable proof. Consumer caution : Check reviews, seller history, and disclaimers before buying. Entertainment framing : Treat crypto spells as metaphysical or entertainment purchases, not investment advice. Conclusion Listings advertising Etsy crypto spells blend spiritual services with financial language to attract buyers. While some shops show high sales volume, claims of guaranteed crypto gains are unsupported and usually labeled as entertainment. Consumers should prioritize transparency and view these products as non-financial services.

What is XRP’s current technical outlook? XRP is holding a firm support zone around $2.70–$2.75 while consolidating near $2.90, positioning the market for a potential breakout above $3.00. Price action, volume, and a developing inverse head-and-shoulders pattern point to $3.00–$3.15 as the near-term target if buyers sustain momentum. How are technical levels defining XRP’s next targets? Support at $2.70 has been tested multiple times and has held, preventing a retest of the broader low near $2.62. Resistance is concentrated between $3.00 and $3.15, where repeated attempts have been rejected. An inverse head-and-shoulders pattern — with a neckline around $2.95 — projects $3.15 as an initial breakout target, then $3.30–$3.70 if momentum continues.

These metrics confirm steady market activity as buyers defend key levels. Source: KamranAsghar (X) Why does institutional activity matter for XRP price action? Institutional demand can provide sustained liquidity and large bid interest that amplifies technical breakouts. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has described altcoin ETF approvals as increasingly likely; seven XRP ETF applications are under SEC review with decision windows into mid-October 2025. Approval or constructive guidance could trigger sizeable inflows and push prices above immediate resistance. Separately, Japan’s SBI announced an institutional lending program for XRP aimed at supporting payment solutions at scale. Following the announcement, reported token lending and trading activity surged, with a 24-hour token volume spike to about 164.5 million tokens — more than double average levels — indicating increased on‑chain and OTC demand. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-support-consolidation"" }, ""headline"": ""XRP Holds $2.70 Support, Consolidates Near $2.90 as Analysts Eye $3.00–$3.15 Breakout"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-23.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""XRP is consolidating near $2.90 while holding $2.70 support; institutional demand and technical setups increase the odds of a breakout to $3.00–$3.15.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to Monitor XRP for a Breakout"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step guide to tracking technical signals, volume, and institutional catalysts that indicate an XRP breakout."", ""totalTime"": ""PT1H"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-support-consolidation#step1"", ""name"": ""Confirm support"", ""text"": ""Track $2.70–$2.75 support with repeated closes above the zone on four-hour and daily charts."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-support-consolidation#step2"", ""name"": ""Watch the neckline"", ""text"": ""Monitor the neckline near $2.95; a sustained close above $3.00 with volume confirms a higher-probability breakout."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-support-consolidation#step3"", ""name"": ""Measure volume and institutional flows"", ""text"": ""Look for rising daily volume and institutional announcements (ETF updates, lending programs) to validate breakout strength."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is XRP likely to break above $3.00 soon?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""XRP is positioned to test $3.00–$3.15 if support at $2.70 holds and volume increases.

Approvals typically lead to increased institutional flows and liquidity, which can produce rapid price appreciation. Market reaction depends on size and speed of inflows and prevailing macro conditions. How should traders use volume with XRP technicals? Use volume as confirmation: rising daily and intraday volume on a break above $3.00 validates buyer conviction. Low volume breakouts carry a higher risk of failure. Key Takeaways Support holds : $2.70–$2.75 is the critical support zone to defend the bullish outlook. Near-term target : $3.00–$3.15 is the immediate resistance to watch, with $3.30–$3.70 as secondary objectives. Institutional catalysts : ETF reviews and institutional lending (e.g., SBI’s program) are key liquidity drivers to monitor. Conclusion In summary, XRP is consolidating above a defined $2.70 support and eyeing a breakout near $3.00–$3.15. Technical patterns, volume, and institutional developments combine to create a favorable setup; traders should monitor price action and ETF review updates closely for confirmation and next steps.",Guides|News|AUCTION|XRP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-03 02:55:30

The cryptocurrency gained 4% in 24 hours, breaking through resistance at $117,500 and pressing against the symbolic $120,000 mark. At this level, Bitcoin’s market capitalization rose to $2.37 trillion, surpassing Amazon’s value, while the broader crypto market swelled to $4.16 trillion. The rally spilled into altcoins, with Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin climbing 5–6% in sympathy. Analysts point to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts as a key driver. Softer U.S. labor data has fueled speculation that policymakers may ease monetary conditions later this month, boosting Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainty.

CME Plans 24/7 Futures by 2026 Adding to the optimism, the CME Group announced plans to launch 24/7 trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and options by early 2026, pending regulatory approval. Currently, CME halts crypto futures trading over weekends, a mismatch with global markets that operate 24/7. The shift is designed to meet growing institutional demand for continuous risk management. Tim McCourt, CME’s global head of equities and alternative products, said the move should enhance market efficiency, reduce arbitrage gaps, and strengthen liquidity.

Institutional adoption has long been a catalyst for Bitcoin price growth. By aligning with the 24/7 nature of digital assets, CME could accelerate that trend and provide fresh liquidity for both spot and derivatives markets. Sweden Weighs Bitcoin Reserve, Bearish Pattern Emerges Meanwhile, Sweden is considering joining the ranks of nations exploring Bitcoin reserves. Lawmakers Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez have proposed a national reserve built from seized Bitcoin, arguing it would protect the country from inflation and geopolitical risks. The idea aligns with broader international discussions, with the U.S. also examining Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset. A national Bitcoin reserve in Sweden could set a precedent across Europe, reinforcing the asset’s credibility and potentially sparking new institutional inflows. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview From a technical perspective , however, caution remains warranted. Bitcoin’s current rally is forming a Bearish Butterfly pattern, with the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) projected between $128,000 and $130,000. While momentum remains bullish in the short term, this harmonic structure warns of potential selling pressure at higher levels. Support levels : $117,000, $113,500, $106,900 Resistance targets : $124,600, $128,000–$130,000 (PRZ) A clean breakout above $124,600 could pave the way toward the PRZ, but overbought RSI conditions suggest the risk of a pullback increases the closer Bitcoin gets to $130,000. A failure to hold $117,000 could expose deeper supports at $113,500 and $106,900. Bitcoin is forming a Bearish Butterfly pattern. Resistance: $124.6K, PRZ $128K–$130K Support: $117K / $113.5K / $106.9K Momentum looks bullish short term, but caution: risk of reversal grows as price nears the PRZ. #BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/C4r5rWUm5B — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 3, 2025 For traders, the outlook is clear: Uptober momentum is strong, institutional demand is rising, and global policy shifts are supportive.

Blockchain sleuths flagged the movement, and on-chain traces show funds leaving addresses that start with “0x40d7” and “bc1qx0a2k.” The assets included Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. As of this report, the money has not been recovered. Suspected Lazarus Group Connections According to blockchain analysts, the transfers followed a clear path: the stolen coins moved through five instant exchanges before being sent into Tornado Cash, the crypto mixer that US authorities sanctioned in 2022. Based on reports , the same set of tactics — wallet fingerprints, timing, and routing — match other intrusions linked to the Lazarus Group, the state-linked cyber unit from the DPRK. A US court’s decision earlier this year to lift some restrictions around mixers has raised fresh concerns that these tools can be reused to hide large thefts. Infiltration Schemes And Fake Profiles Investigations have shown the threat is not only technical but social. Reports have disclosed that operatives created dozens of fake identities, bought Social Security numbers, and posed as blockchain developers on platforms such as Upwork and LinkedIn. Evidence posted on August 13 linked one such fake-developer wallet to a $680,000 exploit of the project Favrr in June 2025. The methods range from phishing and fake job offers to bribery and contractor infiltration, giving attackers ways to penetrate projects from the inside. A Growing Trail Of Stolen Crypto Based on compiled forensics data, North Korean-linked groups stole more than $1.3 billion across 47 incidents in 2024. That figure jumped higher in 2025, with estimates putting thefts at about $2.2 billion in the first half of the year alone. Malware campaigns have also been used. In June, Cisco Talos documented “PylangGhost,” a campaign that used bogus coding tests and interview sites to deliver malware. That malware targeted over 80 browser extensions and popular wallets like MetaMask and Phantom. Law enforcement has made some moves: US agents seized $7.7 million tied to covert networks, and the FBI dismantled front companies such as Blocknovas LLC and Softglide LLC. The $21 million breach underscores how exposed even major firms remain to state-backed hacking campaigns. For now, the case stands as another warning: Japanese crypto firm SBI lost $21 million in suspected North Korean cyberattack.

The event has rattled traditional markets, with traders bracing for delays in economic data releases and broader uncertainty about fiscal stability. For cryptocurrencies, however, the shutdown is proving to be a unique catalyst. Investors are increasingly drawn to digital assets as a hedge against dysfunction in traditional governance, where monetary policy and budgetary battles continue to dominate headlines. Bitcoin, the market’s benchmark, has held steady during the initial wave of uncertainty, reinforcing its role as a safe-haven digital asset. Yet the real conversation among traders is about altcoins, which historically outperform during periods of disruption. With U.S. economic data delayed and institutional investors seeking diversification, altcoins are attracting renewed interest. Analysts argue that the shutdown creates a window for fresh capital to flow into projects with strong narratives and active ecosystems. Among them, three tokens stand out right now: Ethereum for institutional adoption, Solana for high-beta growth, and MAGACOIN FINANCE for speculative momentum that resonates with retail communities. Ethereum As The Institutional Anchor Ethereum remains the most obvious choice for investors navigating uncertainty. As the backbone of decentralized finance and tokenization pilots, ETH is gaining traction among institutions searching for digital asset exposure beyond Bitcoin. Even as traditional markets wobble, Ethereum’s credibility provides confidence that its long-term trajectory remains intact. Analysts highlight that ETH staking and ETF demand are creating structural support, ensuring steady inflows during periods of volatility. The shutdown may even enhance Ethereum’s appeal, as delays in traditional financial reporting push more institutions toward on-chain data sources, where Ethereum dominates. This credibility makes ETH the first altcoin to watch in the current environment. Solana As The High-Beta Growth Play For investors willing to embrace volatility, Solana offers the opposite profile. Known for its speed, low fees, and cultural relevance through NFTs and meme tokens, Solana thrives in high-beta environments. The token often outperforms during bullish phases, and analysts argue that its developer momentum continues to support long-term growth. Solana’s pullbacks can be sharp, but they also create entry points for traders seeking higher multiples. During a government shutdown, when risk appetite shifts and investors look for assets with rapid upside, Solana is often one of the first beneficiaries. Its strong community ensures that momentum can return quickly once sentiment flips. The U.S. government shutdown has shifted investor attention toward hedge-like assets, but traders chasing outperformance are also adding presales to their lists. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being ranked among the top altcoins to watch now, with multiplier estimates reaching 63x in optimistic projections . Unlike mid-caps that depend on broader macro recovery, presales are fueled by urgency and narrative traction, both of which MAGACOIN FINANCE commands. Its branding has carved out a niche that resonates during periods of uncertainty, a reminder that speculative plays often thrive when traditional confidence falters. For those looking to diversify while Washington deadlocks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being cited as one of the speculative top three worth considering now. Retail Psychology During Market Disruptions The shutdown highlights a recurring theme in crypto markets: retail investors thrive in environments where traditional systems falter. For many, government dysfunction reinforces the case for decentralized alternatives. Retail portfolios often rotate toward presales and meme coins during such events, seeking opportunities that feel disconnected from institutional fragility. This psychology explains the buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Ethereum and Solana anchor strategies, retail communities are looking for tokens that can transform small allocations into extraordinary multiples. Presales capture this spirit, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the flagship name in the current wave of speculation. Diversifying For The Next Phase For investors balancing safety and upside, combining Ethereum, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE creates a diversified approach. Ethereum provides credibility, Solana delivers growth, and MAGACOIN FINANCE offers speculative firepower. Together, they represent three categories of opportunity, institutional anchor, high-beta layer 1, and retail-driven presale. Analysts stress that this kind of balance is essential during uncertain times. While no one can predict the exact impact of the shutdown, history shows that crypto markets thrive when traditional systems falter. Positioning now ensures exposure when momentum returns. Conclusion The U.S. government shutdown has added another layer of uncertainty to global markets, but for crypto investors, it has opened a window of opportunity. Ethereum, with its institutional adoption, remains the anchor altcoin. Solana, with its high-beta growth potential, offers rapid upside. And MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its audits, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and viral community, provides the speculative excitement retail investors seek. Together, these three tokens embody the strategies investors can use to navigate disruption: stability, growth, and speculation. As the shutdown drags on, attention will likely intensify on assets that can thrive independently of traditional systems, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as one of the most compelling speculative contenders of this cycle.

Related Reading: Fast And Furious: XRP’s Next Rally Predicted To Shock Markets According to Coinglass data, BTC rose about 2.50% in the last 24 hours, and is up 8% over the last seven days. Trading activity and inflows are being watched closely as traders size up the next move. Institutional Flows Drive Momentum Data shows the top crypto asset registered a second straight day of strong inflows, putting $430 million into Bitcoin spot ETFs. That kind of demand helps explain why Bitcoin’s market value has jumped from $870 billion to $2.34 trillion this year. Analysts say that steady institutional buying has been a key engine behind the rally, and continued flows could keep momentum alive. $BTC/usdt DAILY$BTC breaking out of LTF consolidation @ $115k within the HTF ascending channel we’ve been in all of 2025 $130k is the ultimate breakout point and could lead to the cycle blow off top 🎯 pic.twitter.com/1J9rSc7BJO — Satoshi Flipper (@SatoshiFlipper) October 1, 2025 Price Levels And Targets In Focus Resistance zones are being tested. Near-term hurdles sit at $118,500 and $119,800, with a close target at $120k if buyers stay in control. Analyst Satoshi Flipper pointed out that BTC appears to have built a base above the $115,000 area and is holding a higher time frame structure, adding that a long-term breakout aim sits near $130,000. Buyers extended the climb past $118k, and that move is being cited as a sign that demand remains present above current levels. On-Chain Signals And Volatility According to Coinglass, trading volume rose 12% to nearly $95 billion for the day, while Open Interest increased 4.46% to $84 billion. The OI weighted funding rate came in at 0.0050%. Liquidations show the market can still move quickly: $157.08 million in positions were wiped in the past day, with shorts accounting for $136 million and longs $20 million. A bullish MACD crossover has been confirmed on some timeframes, and the RSI sits at 58% — levels that suggest more room to climb but not runaway overheated conditions. Seasonal Patterns Add To The Optimism Based on reports and past data, October has a history of strong performance — “Uptober” shows an average gain of 20%. September registered a 5% rise, and the third quarter closed with 6% according to Coinglass. The fourth quarter’s average return has historically been large, at 78%, which is why some market participants are optimistic heading into the final months of the year. Buyers remain active, but the path up may not be smooth. A clear push above $120,000 would be a useful signal that new highs might follow, while a stumble into the liquidity clusters could force a quick pullback.

The new case adds to a long list of Meta’s regulatory and legal challenges in Europe after a court in the Netherlands ordered the company to overhaul its algorithm system. Meta Platforms has been ordered by a Dutch court to change how Facebook and Instagram present content to users, ruling that the company’s reliance on profiling and its design practices violate European Union digital regulations. Meta has just two weeks to comply with the judgment. Dutch court instructs Meta to overhaul its algorithm The District Court in Amsterdam found that both Facebook and Instagram fail to provide Dutch users with simple, direct options to access a timeline free from algorithmic profiling. Under the current design, users who select a chronological or non-profiled feed get their preference reset to a default “recommended” timeline whenever they close the app or website. The Amsterdam court concluded that it found a prohibited “dark pattern” amounting to a manipulative design tactic that nudges users toward less privacy-protective choices. According to the ruling, such practices undermine the right to freedom of information guaranteed under European law. “People in the Netherlands are not sufficiently able to make free and autonomous choices about the use of profiled recommendation systems,” the court stated , directing attention to the upcoming Dutch general election on October 29 and hammering on the importance of preserving genuine user choice. Meta must now provide a “direct and simple” mechanism for users to opt out of a personalized timeline and ensure that those preferences remain in place across sessions. If the company fails to comply within two weeks, it could face further legal and regulatory penalties. Meta plans to contest Meta has said it will continue to argue that it has already made substantial adjustments to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA). The Zuckerberg-led tech giant highlighted changes that allow users to access a chronological feed and claimed it had properly informed users in the Netherlands about those tools. A Meta spokesperson warned that the ruling risks undermining the EU’s unified digital regulatory framework. “The issue is a matter for the European Commission and regulators at the European level, not for courts in individual countries,” the spokesperson said. “Proceedings like this threaten the digital single market and the harmonized regulatory regime that should underpin it.” Meta also stressed that it had been proactive in aligning its platforms with the DSA, which came into force earlier this year. The law requires large platforms to provide transparency on how algorithms work, give users alternatives to profiling-based feeds, and avoid manipulative interface designs. The case was brought forward by Bits of Freedom, a Dutch digital rights organization. The group has long campaigned against algorithm-driven platforms that it argues erode users’ ability to control what they see online. “This ruling makes it clear that Meta must respect user preferences,” Maartje Knaap, the spokesperson for the group, said. “It is unacceptable that a few American tech billionaires can determine how we view the world.” The organization said that the judgment is a crucial step in reinforcing the goals of the DSA, particularly its focus on protecting citizens from coercive design practices. The Netherlands is preparing for a general election later this month, and regulators and courts across Europe are acutely aware of the role social media platforms play in shaping political debate. By requiring a persistent chronological feed option, the court aims to reduce algorithmic influence on voter exposure to political content. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

LDO broke out of a long-term descending channel, confirming trend reversal. Trading volume spiked into late September, validating the breakout and buyer interest. Market cap rose from ~$925M to ~$1.075B, the first move above $1B since mid‑2023. Lido DAO breakout: LDO rallies toward $2 with rising volume and >$1B market cap — technical analysis, key levels, and trading insights to guide your next move. Lido DAO breaks free from years of decline, sparking a fresh rally—could $2 be just around the corner? LDO breaks out of a long-term descending channel, hinting at the end of a prolonged bearish cycle. Bullish flag formation confirms buyer momentum, with trading volume rising sharply into September’s close. Market cap surges from $925M to $1.075B, signaling renewed investor confidence and strong inflows. Lido DAO is making a solid comeback after a long downtrend. With rising volume and steady price gains, LDO now looks ready to target the $2 level in the near-term trading sessions. What is the Lido DAO breakout and can LDO reach $2? Lido DAO breakout refers to LDO moving above a descending channel that contained the token for over two years. The breakout, backed by rising volume and a market cap reclaim above $1 billion, sets a technical path for a potential test of $2 if momentum and market conditions persist. How did LDO break out of its descending channel? LDO escaped a descending channel that ran from early 2023 through mid-2025 after price pushed above the upper trendline in mid‑2025. The move was validated by a surge in trading volume and a subsequent bullish flag breakout in late September. Short-term pullbacks were shallow, and the market-cap jump from ~$925M to ~$1.075B confirms renewed inflows. $Ldo #Ldo Getting Ready For Massive Rally pic.twitter.com/6c2l7FrpxZ — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) September 30, 2025 In mid-2025 the price finally surged above the upper trendline, signaling a breakout many traders expected. What made this move notable was the strong volume backing it, a typical sign that momentum was shifting from sellers to buyers. LDO formed a downward-sloping flag after the downtrend, which is a classic bullish continuation pattern. Late September’s break above this flag confirmed buyers controlled short-term price action. Source: CoinGecko Why does volume confirmation matter for this breakout? Volume shows the conviction behind price moves. LDO’s late-September volume spike coincided with price gains, indicating institutional or large retail participation rather than a thin-market pump. Volume sustained through the breakout day, which reduces the likelihood of a false breakout. Between September 24 and 26, LDO briefly dipped from $1.13 to just below $1.05. From September 27, the token recovered steadily, rising above $1.10 by the 29th and gaining near 10% on September 30 to about $1.20. At the same time, LDO’s market cap rose from approximately $925 million on September 26 to roughly $1.075 billion by September 30. This was the first time since mid‑2023 that market capitalization surpassed $1 billion, a psychological and technical marker that can attract renewed investor interest. Frequently Asked Questions What technical levels should traders watch for LDO? Watch the $1.20–$1.30 range as near-term support after the breakout. Immediate resistance sits near $1.50, with a larger target at $2 if momentum holds. Use rising volume and market breadth as confirmation signals. How soon could LDO test $2? If buyers maintain volume and the broader crypto market remains constructive, LDO could test $2 within several sessions to a few weeks. Persistent weakness in the market or volume drying up would make a $2 test less likely in the short term. Key Takeaways Breakout confirmed : LDO cleared a long-term descending channel with volume validation. Market-cap recovery : Market cap surpassed $1B, reflecting renewed investor confidence. Watch volume : Sustained volume is the key driver for a successful push toward $2. Conclusion Lido DAO’s recent breakout marks a clear change in market structure for LDO . The move above a two‑year descending channel, supported by rising volume and a market-cap rebound, sets up a plausible run toward $2 if macro conditions remain favorable. Monitor volume and market breadth closely and review official data sources such as CoinGecko for live metrics.

The move followed a quick rebound earlier in the week. After an intraday dip to $114,000 on Oct. 1, Bitcoin recovered to trade near $118,700 to $118,900 by Oct. 2, with highs reaching $119,500. The market leaned into seasonality, with Bitcoin posting average October gains of 14.4% since 2013. Broader crypto joined the advance. Ether rose 3.2% to $4,536. XRP added 1.8% to $3.04, while Solana gained 4.2% to $233.80. The total market value climbed about 2% to $4.2 trillion.

Even the US government shutdown that began at the start of the month, the first since 2018-2019, which furloughed over 90% of SEC staff and left the CFTC operating with skeleton crews of 5-6%, hasn’t derailed momentum, showing how resilient Bitcoin has become of late.” “Far from being a speculative outlier, Bitcoin continues to show its ability to defy the odds and assert itself as a digital asset with staying power. For long-term investors, the trend is clear, Bitcoin’s strength is structural, not seasonal.” Market veterans describe Uptober as a self-reinforcing mix of calendar flows and risk appetite. As funds rotate for year-end, liquidity improves and volatility often skews higher, which has historically favored upside in Bitcoin. BTC is looking amazing- but is this rally sustainable? With BTC reaching historical highs and massively overextended on this week's incredible Uptober rally, are there signs and signals pointing to a correction- or a gravity-defying continuation to $124k and beyond… pic.twitter.com/ro6WYJ0knu — Aaron Dishner (@MooninPapa) October 3, 2025 Derivatives Activity Builds As Uptober Momentum Extends Derivatives desks pointed to brisk activity around key round numbers, while spot volumes improved into the close. The tone echoed prior Octobers when momentum, once established, tended to persist for days. Regulatory uncertainty still looms, yet the immediate market read signalled resilience. Traders tracked headlines and monitored the pace of approvals and guidance, even as staffing at US agencies thinned during the shutdown. Przemysław Kral, CEO of zondacrypto, said: “The US government shutdown, now a reality, can damage the crypto industry by disrupting the SEC and CFTC, which are vital to global digital asset markets.” He warned that reduced staffing could slow innovation and dent investor confidence, with delays to guidance, approvals and enforcement. Work on items such as the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act may slip, and open questions around the Anti-CBDC Act could linger, weakening trust. Federal payment hiccups could nudge users toward stablecoins, and an underpowered SEC may also slow crypto ETF decisions. All of this could “offer industry leaders a chance to lobby for clearer, faster rules in post-shutdown budget talks,” he said. For now, momentum sets the tone. If Uptober follows its usual script, traders will watch whether $120,000 holds as support, while fund flows and macro cues steer the next leg.

Near Protocol’s AI delegates evolve from advisory chatbots to individual “digital twins” that cast votes aligned with member values. AI delegates learn user behavior to automate DAO voting Rollout is staged: advisory chatbots → group delegates → one delegate per member Participation averages 15–25% in many DAOs; delegates aim to improve representation AI delegates Near Protocol DAO: learn preferences, vote on behalf of members, reduce voter apathy — read how to prepare your account for delegate options. What are AI delegates for Near Protocol DAO? AI delegates are software agents developed for the Near Protocol DAO to represent member preferences in governance votes. They analyze user inputs and historical behavior to recommend or cast votes, aiming to improve low participation and make governance decisions faster and more consistent. When the AI delegates rollout, it will be done in stages, with early models similar to chatbots, then representing large groups, and finally, each DAO member. The Near Foundation is developing artificial intelligence-powered delegates to address low voter participation in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The goal is to turn routine governance decisions into near-instant computations by using agents that know member preferences. Lane Rettig, a researcher at the Near Foundation specializing in AI and governance, told plain text press that the AI-powered governance overhaul is still in development. The Near Foundation oversees the layer-1 Near Protocol. Lane Rettig explained the AI-powered governance overhaul in development for Near Protocol’s DAO. Source: Cointelegraph (plain text) How will AI delegates be trained on user behavior? Delegates are trained by combining explicit user inputs, voting history, and public messages on community channels. This includes interview-style onboarding, past vote records, and contextual signals from social platforms to model political and funding preferences. Near intends to use a verifiable training approach that provides cryptographic proof of training cycles and inputs to maintain alignment and transparency. Industry data shows adoption of AI agents in crypto has accelerated: investment manager VanEck estimated over 10,000 agents by end-2024 and forecasted significant growth into 2025. Why will a human remain in the loop? Near’s researchers emphasize a hybrid approach: AI can handle routine proposals, but humans will retain final authority on critical decisions like fund allocations or major strategy shifts. This preserves accountability and reduces the risk of catastrophic errors from autonomous agents. Rettig stated that delegates can nudge users and recommend votes, but certain categories of proposals require human judgment to “pull the trigger.” This hybrid model aims to balance efficiency with responsibility. When will the rollout happen and what stages are planned? Rollout is planned in stages: early agents will function like chatbots providing context and draft votes, then agents will represent groups with shared preferences, and finally one agent per individual member may be offered. Each stage prioritizes safety, transparency, and verifiable training records. Near’s main DAO already uses a sentiment and summarization tool called Pulse to surface important content and community trends. Early delegate models will have limited agency and focus on improving information flow and voter engagement before broader autonomy is allowed. What risks and safeguards are being discussed? Key risks include misaligned agent behavior, security vulnerabilities, and concentration of influence. Safeguards proposed include verifiable training logs, human-in-the-loop gating for critical votes, and phased deployment with monitoring. Experts recommend auditability and cryptographic proofs of training data to preserve trust. Platforms and researchers such as OpenAI and industry asset managers have highlighted both the potential and the security challenges of AI agents in decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions How do AI delegates improve DAO participation? AI delegates automate routine voting by representing member preferences and nudging informed participation, helping convert low-engagement members into represented votes and increasing effective turnout. Can delegates vote without user approval? Near’s stated approach favors human oversight; early phases emphasize advisory roles and explicit consent for automated voting, especially on high-impact proposals. Are delegate training methods auditable? The Near team plans verifiable training records that provide cryptographic proof of model inputs and training cycles to maintain alignment and enable audits. Key Takeaways AI delegates : Automate representation by learning member preferences and recommending or casting votes. Phased rollout : Starts with advisory tools, proceeds to group delegates, then individual digital twins. Human oversight : Critical decisions remain human-controlled; verifiable training and audits are planned. Conclusion The Near Foundation’s AI delegate initiative aims to reduce voter apathy and streamline DAO governance by using trained agents that reflect member preferences. With phased deployment, verifiable training, and human oversight, the project balances automation with accountability. Watch for staged releases and governance updates as the system matures. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/near-ai-delegates-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Near Protocol develops AI delegates to boost DAO participation"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199a819-89fd-7125-93a2-0fe8517a7d57""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""AI delegates for Near Protocol DAO learn member preferences to automate or recommend votes, aiming to reduce voter apathy and speed governance decisions.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How will AI delegates be trained?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Delegates are trained using user interviews, voting histories, and public community signals; Near plans verifiable training records to ensure alignment and transparency."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will humans remain in control of important votes?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

This brought strong advantages in terms of NAV anchoring and liquidity (bid/ask spread) compared to the past. But it still remains far too uncompetitive in terms of TER, even compared to Grayscale’s own solutions, such as ETH. September was negative, but I remain positive regarding “Uptober,” especially with the shutdown event. However, participating in a bullish market with the break of a 2.5% TER will fuel the performance price gap versus peers. Do you know Grayscale’s reason for 'Why ETHE ?' “First to trade, long operating history, expert sponsor.” Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? And I have to admit that, even if it’s a marketing catchphrase, I do recognize Grayscale as the first entity that really tried to connect traditional finance with the crypto market (for better or worse). It did it with Bitcoin, through GBTC, and then with Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE). But if you are now asking me: ""are we really sure that to participate in ETH-USD, at this stage, ETHE is still the best solution?"" My opinion is no. And now I’ll explain why. But what is ETHE? ETHE is really, for many, a “historical relic” and personally, it brings back “good” memories for me. Calling them “good” is, of course, a bit of an exaggeration, especially considering that it used to be traded OTC and had no creation or redemption program. ETHE - Fund profile (Seeking Alpha) Then, from July 23, 2024, a continuous creation/redemption program became active, and the shares are now tradable at NAV through Authorized Participants. Today it is no longer inefficient : now there's a very small premium (also a sign of demand support), and a negligible bid/ask spread of 0.03% (30 day median). Clearly, this is a sign of excellent liquidity after the uplisting. ETHE - Liquidity Grade (Seeking Alpha) But caution First of all, the ETF label is (in my opinion) a bit misleading, since in reality ETHE does not enjoy the typical protections of a ’40 Act ETF (it does not have the same safeguards as traditional ETFs). In fact, the update, while bringing operational efficiency, left aside some aspects that, in my view, make it less competitive compared to the new solutions on the market: and the first one worth considering is without a doubt the TER, equal to 2.50%. ETHE - Expense Grade (Seeking Alpha) Starting from the premise that both before and after the update, ETHE presented itself as a solution to replicate the spot price of Ethereum net of expenses, one more reflection is needed: if, to cover expenses, the Trust periodically sells ETH, each share progressively represents less Ether over time, this will feed the price gap compared to newly issued ETFs (in a marked way). Competition With the “green light” from the SEC, new ETFs have come, and while ETHE AUM remains all-time high (4.43B), I cannot help but note that Grayscale “houses in-house” another ((REAL)) ETF, which is much more convenient: ETH (which I’ve rated already here ). ETHE - ETH: profile (Seeking Alpha) Well, a solution still from Grayscale, but with a distinctive trait that in the long term will bring an advantage in terms of performance and replicability of the underlying: lower fees, since ETH has an expense ratio of 0.15%. And I emphasize this discrepancy, also pointing out how, despite this clear difference, ETHE’s AUM is still greater than that of ETH. The switch October 2025 marks a trend reversal compared to September. In my opinion, this inversion finds its explanation in the U.S. government shutdown. Why? Well, because, from a certain point of view, while the government stops and there are fears that the Fed may have to move blindly, the blockchain, without a central authority, keeps working; this, in my view, communicates a very strong message, a difference we often forget: blockchain is decentralization. And this reinforces the bullish sentiment in the market. BTC-USD; ETH-USD-Chart (Seeking Alpha) Now, the question is this: could this be a good time for the switch? I won’t take a position on this choice, because I am not a tax advisor. But I know that running into taxation for a simple switch could act as a handbrake on the strong compounding that had been built up on ETHE after these rallies. But in my honest opinion, the same would also be true of remaining exposed to ETHE with a 2.5% fee. Risk Those who are not familiar with the underlying (ETH-USD) must know that ETH is more fragile than BTC: the reaction to sentiment shocks and institutional outflows is typically more violent. And this is a fact that always concerns me a lot, especially after a strong wave of rallies. It must be said that ETH has clearly outperformed BTC in 2025, and I have listed the reasons here. But these volume swings also make ETHE’s price action potentially less solid, amplifying the extent of any negative contraction in case of a sudden sentiment reversal. In this sense, technical study helps me. Here's what I notice: A signal of strength would come from the breakout of the 200-day MA on the 1D timeframe, where the price is currently sitting. A support signal has already occurred when the ETH-USD price reacted positively to the 30-point threshold on the 14-period RSI (1D). ETH-USD: Chart (Seeking Alpha) Conclusion To conclude, I remain bullish on ETHE’s underlying, but I think the market offers much more competitive solutions, and you don’t have to look far to find them: ETH itself, within Grayscale, provides the advantage of a more competitive TER, which in the long term will likely translate into outperformance. The decision to switch is personal, and I cannot replace anyone in this choice. Simply, I am a financial analyst, not a tax advisor. That said, I still keep an eye on key technical support levels, considering ETH’s perhaps “too strong” rise in 2025.",ETH|ETHE,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-03 03:59:43

It has jumped by over 60% from its lowest level in September, giving it a market capitalization of over $3.14 billion. Aster price jumps amid network growth Aster, a perpetual decentralized exchange backed by Changpeng Zhao, has come into the spotlight recently amid its ecosystem growth. This growth has pushed it to overtake Hyperliquid, a company that has long dominated the perpetual futures industry. One of its key numbers is that the total value locked in Aster’s network has gone parabolic this year. It recently jumped to a record high of $2.30 billion, up from a low of $370 million in September. Most importantly, the volume handled on Aster has been in a strong uptrend, and to some extent, looks unreal. The network handled a volume of under $10 billion in August. This number then jumped to $420 billion in September. It has now handled over $237 billion this month so far, and we are just three days in. The surge in volume has also led to a parabolic jump in network fees. Aster made over $136 million in fees in September, a big increase from the $2.37 million it handled in August. It has already made nearly $40 million in fees this month. If these numbers are accurate, then it means that Aster is the fastest-growing player in the crypto industry of all time. It also means that more Aster tokens will be burned as the team has committed to incinerating part of its fees. Meanwhile, more data shows that the Aster network’s futures open interest has jumped in the past few days. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the open interest soared to over $1.35 billion on Friday, up from $626 million on September 26. The rising futures open interest is a sign of its robust demand among traders. Traders in the futures market are also highly bullish on the Aster token as the weighted funding rate has remained in the green since its token-generation event. The other potential catalyst for the Aster price is the potential exchange listings. It is now listed on exchanges like Bybit, MEXC, KuCoin, and BingX. There are signs that it will soon be listed on Binance, the biggest exchange in the industry. Besides, CZ, its founder, is one of its advisors. It may also be listed by other popular exchanges like Coinbase and Upbit, which will boost its price substantially. Aster coin price technical analysis Aster token chart | Source: TradingView The four-hour chart shows that the Aster price bottomed at $1.5098 on October 1 and then bounced back as the Uptober rally started. It has now moved above the upper side of the descending channel. Aster token is also approaching the psychological level at $2. It has also moved above the 25-period exponential moving average. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising in the coming days as the Uptober rally continues.

Many analysts initially predicted that the market’s leading cryptocurrency would achieve a milestone of $200,000 this year. However, as time progresses, these forecasts are being adjusted, with some traders on crypto prediction platforms lowering their price targets. Despite this, the potential for new all-time highs (ATHs) still lingers for the remainder of the year. Historical Data Points To New Records In Q4 Recently, the Bitcoin price once again surged past the significant $120,000 threshold, a level that has acted as a major resistance barrier over the past months. However, a sustained weekly close above this mark could set the stage for Bitcoin to reach new heights. This price movement follows the release of softer private payrolls data, which has bolstered expectations for potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Related Reading: Here’s Why Analysts Are Predicting A Massive Shiba Inu Price Rally In October According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders now estimate a 99% probability of a quarter-point reduction on October 29, a noticeable increase from 86% just a week earlier. As such, analysts from the Motley Fool remain optimistic, suggesting that the Bitcoin price could still achieve a price target of $140,000 by early 2026. Historical data supports this optimism, as Bitcoin has consistently shown strong performance in the fourth quarter (Q4). Over the years from 2013 to 2024, the average Q4 return for Bitcoin has been an impressive 85%. Notably, in 2020, Bitcoin saw an increase of 168% in the final quarter, while in 2017, it skyrocketed by 215%. Even further back to 2013, Bitcoin posted an extraordinary return of 480%. Key Months For The Bitcoin Price Looking at the data, October and November have historically marked significant turning points for the Bitcoin price. November stands out as the most lucrative, with an average return of 46%, followed closely by October at 22%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Calm Is Over — ‘Every Time This Happened, Price Went Vertical,’ Says Analyst Current predictions from prediction markets suggest that traders are granting Bitcoin a 63% chance of reclaiming its previous all-time high of $125,000 by the year’s end. The likelihood of Bitcoin reaching $130,000 by early 2026 stands at 47%, while the chance of hitting $140,000 has been estimated at 32%. However, the window for achieving higher price levels is quickly closing, as evidenced by a mere 22% chance of reaching $150,000 this year and only a 5% chance of hitting $200,000. Despite the optimism, Motley Fool analysts have noted that market sentiment has soured since August.

52593906,596114,1759464034,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum Breaks Key Resistance: Will ETF Inflows Help ETH Sustain Above $4,300?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-breaks-key-resistance-etf-inflows-help-eth/,"Currently trading near $4,380, Ethereum (ETH) recently broke above the $4,400 resistance level, a move that has fueled renewed optimism among investors despite a minor pullback. The boost occurred as crypto ETF inflows increased, institutional interest grew, and market sentiment suggested a potential prolonged bullish trend. However, questions remain about whether ETH can maintain momentum above $4,300 without facing short-term corrections. ETF Inflows and Institutional Demand Fuel Ethereum’s Rally The recent surge coincides with a wave of capital flowing into Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds. According to SoSoValue , ETH spot ETFs saw over $80 million in net inflows, continuing their winning streak for three consecutive days. This momentum shows Ethereum’s increasing appeal as the second-largest cryptocurrency and a key layer for decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenization. In the U.S., October is being called “ETF Month,” with regulators expected to decide on several crypto ETFs, including those linked to Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. Meanwhile, regulators in Asian countries like Thailand are working on frameworks to grow the altcoin ETF market. As a result, Ethereum is widely regarded as one of the leading beneficiaries of these institutional products beyond Bitcoin. Technical Outlook: Bullish But Overbought Ethereum’s break above $4,300 also indicates a technical breakout, backed by a sharp increase in trading volumes. Spot volume surged to $7.17 billion, while futures trading jumped to $97.3 billion, with open interest rising nearly 2% to $59 billion. This suggests that both retail and institutional traders are actively buying ETH at current levels. On the charts, ETH’s price has moved away from its 30-day moving average around $4,380, strengthening the bullish outlook. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stays near 52, signaling ETH is in a bullish zone. Historically, this often leads to periods of consolidation or mild pullbacks as traders take profits. Immediate resistance is at $4,450–$4,500, with strong support near $4,330–$4,350. Can Ethereum Sustain Uptober Momentum? The rally shows a 9.1% weekly rise in ETH’s price, boosting its market cap to $531 billion. However, not all signs are consistently positive. Analysts warn that staking growth has stabilized at 36 million ETH, ETF inflows slowed earlier this year before this rebound, and stablecoin liquidity on exchanges has decreased. These risks highlight the potential for volatility even as optimism grows. Still, as long as ETH stays above $4,300, the trend favors the bulls. If ETF inflows continue and risk appetite remains stable, Ethereum could soon challenge higher resistance levels near $4,600, with the $5,000 milestone back in reach. For now, Ethereum’s break above $4,400 signals that institutions and traders are willing to make significant bets on Uptober’s rally.

Unity vulnerability permits in-process code injection into Android Unity games, risking mobile crypto wallets. Unity has privately distributed patches and a standalone tool to selected partners; wider guidance is pending public release. Affected projects date back to 2017; users should update apps, avoid sideloading, and segregate wallets to reduce exposure. Unity vulnerability risks mobile crypto wallets. Update Unity-based apps now, avoid sideloading, and isolate wallets—learn how to protect yourself. By COINOTAG • Published: 2025-10-03 • Updated: 2025-10-03 What is the Unity vulnerability affecting mobile crypto wallets? The Unity vulnerability is an in-process code injection flaw that lets third-party code execute inside Unity-built apps on Android, potentially enabling overlays, input capture, or screen scraping that can target mobile crypto wallets . Developers should apply Unity’s private patch immediately and roll out app updates. How widespread is the issue and which platforms are affected? Sources indicate the flaw affects Unity projects going back to 2017. While Android is primarily impacted, Windows, macOS and Linux also show varying exposure. Unity Technologies is distributing fixes privately to partners; public patch guidance is expected shortly. Harold Halibut: one of the latest games made with the Unity engine. Source: Unity Why can this vulnerability threaten mobile crypto wallets? Sources describe the exploit as enabling “in-process code injection.” Even without full device takeover, injected code can perform overlays, capture input, or scrape screens to harvest credentials or wallet seed phrases. That behavior can directly target wallet apps or any sensitive text displayed while games run, increasing the risk to keys and recovery phrases. How can users and developers protect against the Unity flaw? Follow these prioritized steps to reduce risk: Developers: apply Unity’s patch or standalone tool immediately and push updated builds to app stores. Users: update Unity-based games as patches are released; do not install apps from third-party stores or APK websites (avoid sideloading). Users: disable unnecessary overlays and accessibility services while gaming to limit input-capture vectors. Security practice: segregate crypto wallets on a separate device or account strictly for key storage and transactions. What did major platform providers say? Google (as reported to news sources) has acknowledged the issue, advising developers to update and stating Google Play will help expedite patched app releases. Unity has provided private fixes to partners and plans public guidance soon. These statements were reported by news sources and are presented here as plain-text references. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can injected code in Unity games steal crypto wallet seed phrases?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Main event and alleged policy shift lack independent verification. Allegation: removal of a 15% CAMT on unrealized Bitcoin gains could alter institutional treasury strategies. Verification absent as of publication; Bitcoin showed a 9.79% seven‑day surge while trading volume fell ~15% (CoinMarketCap). US Treasury Bitcoin tax claims remain unverified; no official removal of the 15% CAMT on unrealized gains reported. Read the verification update and analysis now. What is the alleged US Treasury Bitcoin tax change? US Treasury Bitcoin tax claims refer to an alleged adjustment removing a proposed 15% CAMT on unrealized Bitcoin gains. As of October 3, 2025, no official US Treasury release or government filing confirms such a policy change; reports originate from unverified statements and secondary accounts. How would removing a CAMT on unrealized Bitcoin gains affect institutions? Removing a 15% CAMT on unrealized gains would lower the immediate tax burden on firms holding large Bitcoin treasuries and could incentivize larger institutional allocations to crypto assets. That said, absent formal guidance from the US Treasury or confirmed company filings, any market repositioning is speculative. What are the current market signals and data cited? Latest market snapshot (CoinMarketCap, cited as plain text): Bitcoin $120,383.08, market cap $2.40 trillion, circulating supply 19,928,203 / 21,000,000, seven‑day +9.79%, 24‑hour volume -15.07%.

No. As of the update timestamp (2025-10-03T03:59:43Z), there is no official U.S. Department of the Treasury release or government filing confirming removal of the 15% CAMT on unrealized Bitcoin gains. Why do markets react before official confirmation? Markets price expectations and unverified reports rapidly. Short‑term volatility often follows rumors or influential figures’ comments; without official confirmation, reactions can reverse when facts are established. Key Takeaways Verification matters : No official Treasury confirmation of a CAMT removal exists as of October 3, 2025. Market impact is speculative : Bitcoin’s recent price rise coincided with the claim but is not proof of policy change. How to proceed : Wait for official Treasury releases and company filings before making material portfolio changes. Conclusion Reports of a US Treasury Bitcoin tax adjustment for unrealized gains remain unverified. Front‑loaded facts show no confirmed removal of a 15% CAMT; investors and institutions should rely on official Treasury statements, company filings, and authoritative market data before adjusting strategies.

Perp DEX market in flux Perpetual futures — or perps — are crypto derivatives that allow traders to speculate on prices without an expiry date. The decentralized platforms that host them, known as perp DEXes, have surged in popularity as traders move activity away from centralized exchanges (CEXes) such as Binance. Scott noted that perp DEXes have expanded from less than 2% of CEX perpetual trading volume in 2022 to more than 20% last month. Hyperliquid, which issues the HYPE token, has been a key driver of that growth. Still, recent shifts have raised questions. Hyperliquid’s share of perp DEX volume fell from 45% to just 8% in recent weeks, while Binance-affiliated rival Aster ballooned to more than $270 billion in weekly trades. Other upstarts such as Lighter and edgeX also posted triple-digit percentage gains in activity. Why Hyperliquid still stands out Scott argued that Hyperliquid’s fundamentals set it apart. The exchange continues to generate strong revenue, trading at what he described as a reasonable multiple compared to peers, with user stickiness reflected in open interest. “Unlike volume and revenue, which measure activity, open interest measures liquidity. It’s much stickier,” he wrote, noting Hyperliquid still commands about 62% of the perp DEX open interest market. Beyond trading, Scott highlighted expansion plans including the HyperEVM network, already hosting over 100 protocols and $2 billion in total value locked and USDH, a stablecoin backed by reserves held with BlackRock and Superstate. Another initiative, HIP-3, would allow builders to launch new perps markets by staking large amounts of HYPE, creating what Scott described as a “supply sink” for the token. Scott cautioned that his thesis would be invalidated if Hyperliquid’s open interest or revenue dropped materially, or if USDH failed to gain liquidity over the next year. But for now, he maintains Hyperliquid is better positioned than competitors running heavy incentive programs.",Markets|Hyperliquid|DeFi|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-03 04:20:33

Sustained growth in demand has historically served as one of the backdrops for price rallies to occur, Much of that expansion is being driven by whales and ETFs. Large-holder balances are rising at an annualized pace of 331,000 BTC, a stronger trend than the 255,000 BTC recorded in Q4 2024, the 238,000 BTC at the start of Q4 2020, and a sharp contrast to the 197,000 BTC contraction that marked the weaker market in 2021. ETFs could add another layer as the products bought 213,000 BTC in Q4 2024, a 71% jump in holdings, and may be positioned to increase allocations into year-end. For that demand to translate into another breakout, momentum on the price side is still critical. On-chain valuation puts the key threshold at the Trader’s Realized Price of $116,000. A decisive move above that level would mark the transition back into the “BULL” phase of the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator and could open up a valuation band of $160,000 to $200,000 for Q4. The indicator compares bitcoin’s current market price with several realized price metrics — the average cost basis of different groups of investors recorded on-chain. When spot price climbs above those levels, the model interprets it as a shift into the “bull” phase, reflecting rising momentum and profits across the holder base. When spot price falls below, it flags the “bear” phase, signaling stress and unrealized losses. Market conditions entering October look strikingly similar to last year. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index has held between 40 and 50 in recent days, levels that historically mark the edge of bullish conditions. In 2024, the index broke above 50 at the start of Q4, just before bitcoin surged from around $70,000 to $100,000.

Japan’s SBI lending rollout and a pending U.S. ETF decision cycle framed the move, with resistance capping at $3.10 after heavy prints. News Background XRP climbed 3% between Oct. 2, 04:00 and Oct. 3, 03:00, rising from $2.98 to $3.03. The rally followed SBI Holdings’ expansion of institutional XRP lending services, signaling Japan’s deepening crypto push. Meanwhile, Ripple CTO David Schwartz announced his departure after 13 years, and seven XRP ETF applications remain under SEC review, with the first decisions expected Oct. 18. Prediction markets now price approval odds above 99%, reinforcing speculative inflows. Price Action Summary XRP traded a $0.15 corridor (4.9% range) between $2.95 and $3.10. At 16:00, price spiked from $3.00 to $3.06 on 212.6M tokens — more than double the daily average. Resistance hardened at $3.10, where 129M in turnover capped upside. XRP consolidated between $3.00–$3.05, signaling accumulation above the $3.00 line. In the final hour, XRP dipped from $3.03 to $3.02 amid profit-taking, with a 2.35M spike at 03:55 showing institutional rebalancing. Technical Analysis Support is confirmed near $2.99–$3.00, with multiple defenses holding the level. Resistance remains defined at $3.10, where institutional sellers concentrated. The session carved a consolidation band above $3.00, suggesting professional accumulation. Volume-led breakout attempts validate institutional participation, though conviction remains tethered to a sustained close above $3.10 to unlock the next leg toward $3.20. What Traders Are Watching?

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Net Position Change Is Now Neutral In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about how the behavior of the Bitcoin long-term holders has changed recently. The “ long-term holders ” (LTHs) refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. Statistically, the longer a holder keeps their coins dormant on the blockchain, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the LTHs with their relatively long holding time are considered to be the diamond hands of the network. This can make the behavior of this cohort worth keeping an eye on, as shifts in it can have consequences for the cryptocurrency as a whole, considering their standing. There are many ways to keep track of LTH behavior, with one method being through the Net Position Change metric. This indicator measures, as its name implies, the monthly net change in the Bitcoin supply held by the LTHs as a whole. Below is the chart for the metric shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in its value over the past year. From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin LTH Net Position Change was positive during the first half of 2025, but a shift occurred in July as the indicator flipped into the negative. This implies supply started exiting the cohort. Something to keep in mind is that while selling from the group can instantly register on the chart, the same isn’t true for buying. When LTH supply rises, it doesn’t mean accumulation is happening in the present, but rather that some buying occurred 155 days ago and those coins have now been held for long enough to become a part of the group. The LTH distribution continued through August and September, but with the start of October, the Net Position Change has returned back to a neutral value, indicating coins being sold by the group are now being balanced out by tokens maturing past the 155-day cutoff. In other words, their net profit-taking has calmed down. As the report explains: This cooling supply pressure suggests that the recent phase of long-term holder profit-taking may be easing, potentially leaving ETFs and new inflows as more decisive drivers of market direction. The spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also seen a shift recently, as another chart cited by Glassnode shows. As displayed in the graph, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs switched to outflows in late September, but the netflow has once again turned green for these investment vehicles. The analytics firm notes: Should this renewed demand align with reduced LTH selling, ETFs could provide a stabilizing force, offering a more constructive foundation for price resilience and supporting the conditions needed for a sustainable advance. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $119,700, up almost 8% over the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|Bitcoin HODLers|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 05:00:28
52595790,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=831771,1759467628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52595790.jpeg,"Analyst Forecast Ethereum (ETH) Breakout To $6,900 As Price Retests Crucial Resistance",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-breakout-to-6900-price-retests-resistance/,"As the crypto market kicks off October with a remarkable recovery, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to turn the $4,500 level into support after nearly two weeks. Some analysts forecast that a breakout from this crucial area could set the stage for a massive 50% rally in Q4. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ‘Uptober’ Begins With $220 Retest – Is It Ready For Second ‘Expansion Wave’? Ethereum Retests Next Major Resistance Ethereum has bounced 17% from last week’s lows and is retesting the next crucial level to reclaim. The cryptocurrency started this week by recovering from the recent market correction, which sent its price to a multi-week low of $3,815. Since then, the King of Altcoins has reclaimed the mid-zone of its macro range and broken past a major sell wall located around the $4,200-$4,300 levels. Amid this performance, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted that the next two major resistance levels to reclaim before a new all-time high (ATH) are $4,500 and $4,750. Similarly, Ali Martinez detailed that the $4,505 area is “one of the most important resistance levels to watch for Ethereum,” according to the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric. A rejection from this major level could lead to a retest of the $4,250 support, and potentially risk a new price drop if ETH breaks below it. Previously, some analysts cautioned that losing this area could open the gates for a fresh breakdown toward the macro range lows. On the contrary, reclaiming the $4,500 resistance would set the base for a challenge of the macro range highs, around the $4,800 level, in the coming weeks. Market watcher Lluciano pointed out that ETH appears to be forming a triangle formation since early August. He suggested that breaking out of this pattern could kick off a rally toward a new high above the $5,000 barrier, affirming, “Q4 is here, ETH new wave is imminent.” Meanwhile, Titan of Crypto highlighted a weekly bull flag pattern forming on ETH’s chart. According to the analyst, a breakout from the formation’s upper boundary, around the $4,500 area, could send the price into a 50% rally toward the $6,900 mark. ETH’s Weekly Close Could ‘Turn It All Around’ After closing September above the $4,100 area, analyst Rekt Capital affirmed that Ethereum is potentially developing a Monthly Bull Flag within this macro range. He explained that the cryptocurrency must reclaim the $4,200 in the higher timeframes to continue building on the formation’s base. Notably, closing the month below this level technically means ETH’s price is positioning for a bearish retest despite the current bounce, the analyst detailed, as it represents the mid-zone of the macro range. Nonetheless, Rekt Capital considers that “even though the Monthly Close wasn’t very appealing, price just needs to Weekly Close above the $4.2k mid-range to turn it all around.” He noted that the cryptocurrency displayed a similar performance in late 2021 and this past July, weekly closing above this level and post-breakout retesting it as support. This technical sequence enabled the price to reclaim the $4,600 area and position itself for new highs.

As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,502, a 4.1% increase in the daily timeframe.

LINK > $20 support; a break above $29 targets $46.59. LINK is above its 7‑day SMA; reclaiming $22 could accelerate gains to $24–$25. UBS and Swift pilots using Chainlink’s CCIP may drive institutional tokenized fund flows. Chainlink price eyes a breakout to $47 as technicals and UBS/Swift pilots boost adoption — read key levels, risk points, and actionable trade steps. What is Chainlink’s breakout outlook and key price targets? Chainlink price is showing a bullish setup if it sustains above the critical $20 zone and overcomes resistance near $28–$30. Analysts track a near‑term target of ~$29.11 and a longer extension to ~$46.59 using Fibonacci extensions and an ascending channel projection. How do technical indicators support a potential LINK breakout? On multiple timeframes, LINK has defended the $20 support, which aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement (~$20.12). The 3‑day chart shows price within an ascending parallel channel; a bounce from the lower band points to a move into the channel mid/upper range. Key technical levels: 7‑day SMA reclaimed (bullish), resistance cluster at $28–$30, 1.272 Fib extension near $46.59. If LINK drops below $20.12, downside targets include $15 and $12 as risk scenarios. When could Chainlink reach $29 and $46.59 according to structure? Price momentum toward $29 depends on sustained buying above $22 and clearing the $28–$30 resistance. The $46.59 projection is a longer‑term target derived from the 1.272 Fibonacci extension and the channel top; timing depends on market breadth and institutional inflows from tokenized fund pilots. Chainlink eyes breakout to $47, fueled by supportive chart structure and pilot integrations with UBS and Swift that could accelerate tokenized fund flows and real‑world usage. LINK holds above $20; breaking $29 could target $46.59 per Fib/channel analysis. LINK is above its 7‑day SMA; reclaiming $22 may spark a run to $24–$25. Chainlink joins UBS and Swift pilots to enable tokenized fund operations, adding real‑world adoption catalysts. Chainlink (LINK) is trading near $21.41 and is carving a recovery after recent correction. Strong technical setups and pilot integrations with major financial players support a scenario where LINK could break resistance and attempt a multi‑week rally toward higher Fibonacci targets. Why does the $20 zone matter for LINK? The $20 region aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement at $20.12 and prior breakout support. Holding this zone keeps the bullish invalidation level intact. Traders often use this area as a stop/invalid point—loss below it increases risk of a deeper decline. What does the 3‑day chart reveal about momentum? On the 3‑day timeframe, LINK trades inside an ascending parallel channel. The most recent bounce from the lower band and move toward the mid‑channel shows buyers stepping in. A close above the channel midline and the $28–$30 resistance would strengthen the case for the 1.272 extension target. Source: Ali Charts Via X How significant are UBS and Swift pilots for Chainlink’s fundamentals? Fundamental catalysts now include Chainlink’s Cross‑Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) pilots with UBS and Swift to enable tokenized fund transactions on‑chain. These pilots are part of Singapore’s Project Guardian and aim to connect ISO 20022 Swift infrastructure with on‑chain settlement triggers. Institutional adoption could materially expand addressable demand given the global fund industry’s scale. Sources mentioned in reporting include CoinDesk and official pilot announcements from participating banks and consortia (plain text references). Frequently Asked Questions What are the immediate support and resistance levels for LINK? Immediate support sits around $20–$20.12 (0.786 Fib); resistance appears near $22 (trendline) and $28–$30 (channel/top). A clear break above $29 increases the probability of extension to ~$46.59. How can traders interpret the UBS/Swift integration for price action? UBS and Swift pilots introduce a structural adoption narrative: tokenized fund workflows triggered on‑chain can increase utility and institutional demand for oracle services like Chainlink’s CCIP. This fundamental shift can support medium‑term price appreciation if pilot volumes scale. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are Chainlink's key support and resistance levels?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key support: $20–$20.12 (0.786 Fib).

IRS guidance defers tax on unrealized crypto gains until disposal Strategy can maintain its BTC treasury without triggering Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax on uPnL Strategy holds 674,143 BTC (~$76.5B); unrealized gains exceed $25B, avoiding an estimated ~$3.75B CAMT bill for now Strategy Bitcoin tax clarity: IRS guidance defers tax on unrealized gains, enabling continued BTC treasury strategy — read the implications and next steps for firms. What is the IRS guidance on unrealized crypto gains? The IRS guidance states unrealized gains on crypto are not currently taxed until the asset is sold. This temporary directive lets firms report tax liabilities only when crypto holdings are disposed, creating breathing room for corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies and reducing forced sell pressure. Key Takeaways How does the latest tax guidance benefit Strategy? It allows Strategy to continue with its BTC holding plan without selling assets to cover taxes, preserving long-term treasury positioning. What’s next for crypto tax clarity in the U.S? The directive is temporary while Congress considers digital-asset tax rules; eventual codification could change the landscape for corporate holders. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) confirmed the IRS clarification provides immediate operational certainty for its corporate Bitcoin strategy. The firm’s treasury now faces no obligation to convert holdings to fiat solely for tax payment on unrealized gains under this temporary instruction. The company welcomed the guidance, noting that tax on realized gains remains unchanged while unrealized gains are not treated as current tax events under the directive. This reduces the near-term risk of large-scale sell-offs by firms with significant BTC positions. Source: X How does this change the CAMT treatment for corporate crypto? The temporary IRS directive removes unrealized profit inclusion for CAMT purposes until a sale occurs. Previously, the CAMT framework would have required firms to include unrealized gains and losses on crypto assets in taxable calculations, potentially generating sizable tax liabilities without cash realization. Under the guidance, tax obligations are triggered by disposals rather than mark-to-market accounting for crypto. If CAMT as previously interpreted had applied, Strategy’s unrealized profit—reported at more than $25 billion—could have created an estimated CAMT liability near $3.75 billion (roughly 15% of uPnL). Source: CryptoQuant What do market participants say? Community analysts suggested the guidance reduces near-term selling pressure and may encourage other U.S. firms to accumulate Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets. Commentators noted Strategy’s shares (MSTR) rallied roughly 16% following the guidance, reinforcing its historical relationship as leveraged exposure to BTC, which rose ~8.6% over the same recent trading period. At the same time, the policy is temporary and subject to legislative action. Congressional debates on crypto taxation continue, with proposals ranging from transactional exemptions to expanded reporting rules. Some lawmakers warned that broad exemptions could reduce federal revenue materially. Frequently Asked Questions Will Strategy owe taxes if it holds Bitcoin and does not sell? No. Under the temporary IRS guidance, unrealized gains on Bitcoin held by corporations are not treated as taxable events until the assets are sold. Could Congress change this guidance? Yes. The directive is temporary while Congress examines digital-asset taxation; any legislative change could alter tax treatment and require firms to reassess treasury strategies. Key Takeaways Immediate relief : IRS temporary guidance defers tax on unrealized crypto gains until disposal. Corporate impact : Strategy can avoid forced liquidation to pay CAMT on uPnL, preserving BTC treasury strategy. Watch Congress : Legislative action could codify or overturn temporary IRS treatment; firms should monitor developments and maintain tax-compliant records. Conclusion The IRS’s temporary clarification provides meaningful operational certainty for Strategy and similar corporate Bitcoin holders. Strategy Bitcoin tax clarity reduces short-term liquidation risk and supports continued accumulation, but stakeholders should track Congressional activity and official guidance for potential long-term changes. COINOTAG will monitor updates and report legislative developments. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""IRS Guidance Lets Strategy Hold Bitcoin Without Tax on Unrealized Gains"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-155741.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T15:57:41Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T15:57:41Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/strategy-bitcoin-tax-guidance"" }, ""articleBody"": ""The IRS issued temporary guidance stating unrealized gains on crypto assets are not taxed until the asset is sold, allowing Strategy to continue its corporate Bitcoin holding plan without liquidating to cover taxes.

The conversation was shared by JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), who highlighted the remarks for the cryptocurrency community, as Schwartz’s comments opened up discussion about alternatives to the U.S. dollar’s long-standing position. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! David Schwartz indirectly says that #XRP will become the world’s reserve currency! pic.twitter.com/WRpnqa0RJO — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 1, 2025 Shifting Views on the Dollar During the conversation, Schwartz said he believes it is “quite realistic that a lot of the world is just done with the dollar as the reserve currency.” He noted that while the U.S. has benefited from this role, other countries may not see it as sustainable in the long term. In his view, several large nations might attempt to put forward their own currencies , but most countries would not want to see their geopolitical rivals in control of such a system. Schwartz compared the situation to his earlier experiences with banks. He explained that while major institutions like Deutsche Bank or JPMorgan Chase could build systems for the industry, thousands of smaller banks resisted using them due to competitive disadvantages. He suggested that nations may follow similar logic and avoid adopting a system controlled by their strongest competitors. Considering Digital Assets Schwartz outlined what he described as a potential success scenario for digital assets. He argued that if the U.S. dollar loses its position, many countries may hesitate to back a national currency from a rival power. He said, “Maybe they could settle on a currency that nobody could control rather than one controlled by their most powerful geopolitical rival.” In this view, a neutral digital asset could present itself as an option. Schwartz emphasized that no single country would want to see its rival’s currency replace the dollar, and therefore, a shared alternative might gain support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP as the Best Candidate Schwartz explained that countries may ultimately seek a neutral asset rather than accepting another rival’s currency, describing it as avoiding “the old boss with a new boss.” Among digital assets, XRP stands out as the most practical choice. It is already designed to handle global liquidity , with proven speed, low transaction costs, and the ability to scale for institutional use. Unlike Bitcoin or other tokens, XRP has positioned itself directly for financial settlement and cross-border utility, aligning with what nations would require in a reserve asset. The clip shared by JackTheRippler has strengthened the belief among many that XRP’s neutrality, functionality, and established adoption make it the strongest candidate to replace the U.S. dollar’s dominance and become the global reserve currency .

52596609,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=826213,1759468395,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52596609.jpeg,New York lawmakers propose taxing crypto miners based on their electricity usage,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/new-york-eyes-crypto-mining-tax/,"Senator Liz Krueger of New York and Assemblymember Anna Kelles have introduced legislation that would impose additional taxes on cryptocurrency miners for the power they consume in their operations. At its core, the Senate Bill S8518 is framed around two key goals: tackling climate change and making energy more affordable. It suggests that the crypto miners’ taxes will be funneled to the state’s Energy Affordability programs that cut energy costs for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. Senator Kruger confirmed, “The bill ensures that the companies driving up New Yorkers’ electricity rates pay their fair share, while providing direct relief to families struggling with rising utility costs.” This development follows New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ decision to end his reelection campaign Sunday evening, closing a term defined by controversy and his reputation as one of the nation’s most outspoken crypto-friendly leaders. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan throughout his tenure, the self-proclaimed “Bitcoin Mayor” made digital assets central to his brand—taking part of his salary in Bitcoin, pushing to scrap the city’s BitLicense rules, and championing New York as the “crypto capital” of the world. He also backed efforts to integrate blockchain into city functions, from education to record-keeping. Miners using 100% clean energy will be exempt from the new taxes if approved Kruger noted that cryptocurrency mining has pushed up electricity costs across New York by approximately $79 million per year for households and $165 million for small businesses, necessitating the bill. The draft proposes a tiered excise tax, exempting companies that use 2.25 million kWh or less annually, while charging 2 cents per kWh for those using between 2.26 million and 5 million kWh. Additionally, mining operations using 5 to 10 million kWh annually would be taxed at 3 cents per kWh, those consuming up to 20 million kWh at 4 cents, and facilities exceeding 20 million kWh at 5 cents per kWh. Nonetheless, the bill carves out an exemption for facilities using 100% renewable power. However, only crypto miners are singled out in the bill, even though AI and other advanced computing already surpass Bitcoin mining in energy consumption. While the legislation doesn’t cover AI facilities, a press release acknowledged that the industry is growing rapidly and consuming increasing amounts of power. Unfortunately for the cryptocurrency mining industry, which already operates on thin margins, an added energy tax could squeeze profits further, forcing grid-dependent miners to relocate to states or countries with lower energy costs. Though Senator Kruger defended the bill, saying, “Cryptocurrency miners provide very little benefit to New York State or to the communities where they are located, but create significant costs and burdens on ratepayers, the electric grid, the local environment, and our shared climate. This bill will ensure that the costs of those negative impacts will no longer be foisted on everyone else.” New York still has crypto businesses applying for a BitLicense The bill’s introduction follows the lapse of the state’s two-year moratorium on fossil fuel–driven proof-of-work mining, which was enacted in 2022 by a 36–27 Senate vote and expired roughly a year ago. The moratorium had blocked new applications or permits for power plants that burn carbon-based fuels to supply behind-the-meter electricity for proof-of-work crypto mining. It marked the first attempt of a U.S. state to restrict the rights of private businesses to choose what they are allowed to dedicate computational resources towards. New York still requires any virtual currency business in the state to hold a BitLicense. While it may sound like a routine business permit, the process can take months or even years and cost more than $100,000, making it a significant barrier for startups and even established firms.

This expiry event is back to normal following last week’s epic end of third quarter event, so there is unlikely to be any impact on spot markets, which have gained this week. US labor market data remains weak, which puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve to reduce rates again this month, a bonus for risk-on assets such as crypto. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.1, meaning that there are slightly more short contracts expiring than longs, as the bulls regain composure. Max pain is around $115,000, according to Coinglass. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $120,000, which has reached $2.2 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There is also around $1.9 billion OI at $140,000, but $100,000 is a popular strike price for short sellers with $1.6 billion in OI. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is around $49 billion, which has fallen over the past week. Additionally, total Bitcoin futures OI currently stands at $86.5 billion, which is still close to record highs, according to Coinglass. Meanwhile, ETF expert Eric Balchunas observed that BlackRock’s IBIT has surpassed Coinbase’s Derbit platform as the largest venue for Bitcoin options. $IBIT has surpassed Coinbase’s Derbit platform as the largest venue for bitcoin options with $38b in open interest. I told y’all ETFs are no joke.. Fat crypto margins in trouble. Nice find by @sidharth_shukla pic.twitter.com/LUcnpW5g4I — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 2, 2025 Earlier this week, crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the group was “experiencing frustration with the current market conditions, describing it as extreme choppy price action that’s difficult to trade profitably.” However, this was before the current rally. In addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options, around 216,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $987 million, maximum pain at $4,200, and a put/call ratio of 0.93. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $13.5 billion, reports Coinglass. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $4.3 billion. Spot Market Outlook Crypto markets are ending the week in the green with total capitalization up 1.4% to near record highs of $4.23 trillion. Markets have had a solid week, gaining more than 10% since the same time last Friday. Bitcoin was still leading the charge, topping $121,000 very briefly in late trading on Thursday before retreating to $120,000 during Friday morning trading in Asia. The asset has made a solid 10% gain over the past week. Ethereum was also making progress , notching an intraday high just over $4,500 during Asian trading. ETH is now up 14% since the same time last week. Meanwhile, BNB was at an all-time high of just below $1,100 at the time of writing.

This integration aims to reduce costs and friction while supporting trials with major global banks. SWIFT will use Linea (Ethereum layer 2) for its blockchain payments ledger Linea is a zk‑EVM rollup with low fees and ~1.5 tx/sec per reported metrics Linea has $2.27B TVL and major banks including Bank of America and JPMorgan are in trials SWIFT Linea: SWIFT is building its blockchain payments ledger on Ethereum Layer 2 Linea—learn how 24/7 real-time settlements will cut costs and which banks are testing the rail. Consensys boss Joe Lubin confirmed SWIFT will leverage the Ethereum layer 2 Linea blockchain to build its crypto payments ledger, signaling deeper TradFi and DeFi integration. What is SWIFT building on Linea? SWIFT is building a blockchain payments settlement platform on the Ethereum layer 2 Linea blockchain. The platform is designed for real‑time, 24/7 bank settlement using Linea’s zk‑EVM rollup to lower fees and speed finality for interbank transfers. How will Linea enable SWIFT’s crypto payments? Linea leverages zk‑EVM rollup technology to batch transactions and settle on Ethereum’s base layer. It processes roughly 1.5 transactions per second with fees reported at about one‑fifteenth of mainnet Ethereum costs. Linea currently shows $2.27 billion in total value locked, per L2BEAT data. Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson with Joe Lubin and Neal Stephenson. Source: Cointelegraph (plain text) Consensys CEO Joe Lubin confirmed Linea’s selection during a TOKEN2049 conference fireside chat. SWIFT’s announcement invited more than 30 TradFi institutions to participate in building and trialing a 24/7 crypto payments rail. Which banks are participating in trials? Major global banks taking part in trials include Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Toronto‑Dominion Bank. SWIFT handles roughly $150 trillion in global payments annually via traditional rails, indicating broad potential scale if blockchain rails are adopted. Why does this matter to TradFi and DeFi? Linea’s model reduces counterparty risk and settlement delay by enabling near‑instant finality without legacy intermediaries. For banks, this means lower operational costs and fewer reconciliation errors. For DeFi and community builders, Linea opens pathways for user‑generated applications built on Ethereum’s trust layer. How will this compare to existing blockchain payment systems? Linea’s zk‑EVM approach competes with other bank‑oriented rails like the XRP Ledger by focusing on Ethereum compatibility, stronger smart contract tooling, and a growing developer ecosystem. Linea ranks fourth in TVL among Ethereum layer 2s behind Arbitrum One, Base Chain and OP Mainnet per L2BEAT. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is SWIFT building on the Linea blockchain?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Not immediately. Trials with major banks will determine performance and scalability. SWIFT’s annual payment footprint is around $150 trillion, so adoption would be phased and subject to regulatory and operational validation. How secure is Linea for bank settlements? Linea inherits Ethereum’s settlement security while using zk proofs to compress transaction data. Security depends on rollup design, validator economics, and ongoing audits. Independent security reviews and institutional testing are underway. Key Takeaways Linea selection: SWIFT will build its blockchain payments ledger on Ethereum layer 2 Linea, confirmed by Consensys CEO Joe Lubin. Performance & cost: Linea uses zk‑EVM rollups, with reported ~1.5 tx/sec and fees at roughly one‑fifteenth of Ethereum mainnet costs.

At the same time, US Senator Ted Cruz blocked a sweeping privacy bill that wanted to restrict data brokers from selling Americans’ personal information. He did this due to law enforcement concerns but left the door open to revisions. The privacy debate gained a lot of urgency in the crypto industry as well, after several high-profile attacks linked to leaked data. Energy Tax Puts Pressure on Crypto Mining New York State Senator Liz Krueger introduced new legislation that could reshape the crypto mining landscape in the Empire State. The proposed bill seeks to impose excise taxes on the energy that is consumed by crypto mining operations. The move was made amid rising concerns over the industry’s environmental impact and its reliance on high levels of electricity. The tax structure is tiered, starting with an exemption for miners using 2.25 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) or less annually. Those consuming between 2.26 million and 5 million kWh would face a tax of 2 cents per kWh, while consumption between 5 million and 10 million kWh would be taxed at 3 cents per kWh. Larger operators consuming up to 20 million kWh would see a 4-cent tax, and those exceeding 20 million kWh annually will be taxed at 5 cents per kWh. The proposed crypto mining tax legislation (Source: New York Senate ) Operations that rely on 100% renewable energy are exempt from the proposed levy, which will help with the state’s effort to incentivize clean energy use after the two-year moratorium on fossil fuel-powered mining, which expired in 2024. The bill also comes at a time when crypto mining is already grappling with razor-thin profit margins, rising costs, and increasing network difficulty. Electricity has always been the single most critical input for miners, and the proposed tax could push operators relying on grid power further into unprofitability. Some may be forced to relocate to more favorable jurisdictions without any added costs. Companies with the means to secure land and build facilities around renewable energy sources stand to gain a massive competitive edge, as they can bypass retail grid pricing and avoid the excise tax altogether. This widens the gap between well-capitalized mining giants and smaller operators who do not have access to cheap, sustainable energy. The economic pressures are already visible. In the first quarter of 2025, energy prices in New York averaged about $0.08 per kWh, which was a sharp rise that squeezed profit margins. TeraWulf, with a facility in upstate New York, reported that the doubling of energy costs relative to revenue contributed to a $61.4 million loss during the period. Median cost of mining 1 Bitcoin (Source: TheMinerMag ) At the same time, the median cost of mining a single Bitcoin surpassed $70,000 in the first quarter of 2025. This is according to data from TheMinerMag . Ted Cruz Blocks US Privacy Protections Push In another legislative move, US Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blocked a major privacy bill aimed at protecting Americans from the practices of data brokers. He argued that law enforcement still needs access to certain information and that the legislation requires further refinement. The bill, Senate Bill 2850 , was introduced by Democrat Senator Ron Wyden and seeks to restrict brokers from selling sensitive personal data, which can include addresses, financial information, and phone numbers, to virtually anyone willing to pay. Wyden argued that these practices enabled violence, stalking, and other crimes, and insisted that stronger protections are urgently needed. Bill 2850 Cruz is a longtime critic of government surveillance and central bank digital currencies, and was the only senator to oppose the measure, specifically due to concerns that restricting access to data could interfere with monitoring convicted sex offenders. He also blocked a narrower privacy bill that was introduced immediately after, which would have extended protections specifically to lawmakers, government staff, and survivors of sexual assault or domestic violence. However, Cruz said he was open to working with Wyden to improve the proposals, as Congress must avoid “doing nothing” while privacy concerns mount. The debate comes at a time when privacy and data security are hot-button issues both in Washington and in the cryptocurrency community. Limiting what data brokers can sell could also reduce the risk of data breaches, which still threaten individuals and institutions in the United States and abroad. The push for stronger protections gained some momentum after the June assassination of former Minnesota Representative Melissa Hortman , whose attacker is believed by the FBI to have obtained her home address through a data broker. The incident shed some light on the dangers of data exposure. The crypto community has also seen a surge in targeted attacks, with over 50 incidents of kidnappings and killings linked to leaked home addresses in 2025 alone. This is according to data compiled by Bitcoiner Jameson Lopp . Adding another layer to the discussion, Wyden confirmed on Wednesday that he is investigating Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital, over allegations of improper tax practices. Wyden claims Morehead misrepresented his residency status and used Puerto Rico’s tax system to avoid more than $100 million in US taxes, despite earning the bulk of his capital gains while based in California.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-03 05:30:00

The ChatGPT maker released a statement with emails, X posts, court filings, and opinionated articles to shun Elon Musk’s legal charges against it. According to the firm, the xAI head has no grounds to accuse OpenAI of trade secret theft, and this is one case among several attempts to slow down the company’s progress in the AI industry. “We will protect our employees and won’t be intimidated by his attempts to bully them,” the OpenAI newsroom wrote. OpenAI fights against Musk’s lawsuits OpenAI has rejected allegations that it had stolen employees or confidential information from Musk’s AI startup, xAI. The AI company also argued that the business structure change lawsuit, which has paused its plan to change from a non-profit to a for-profit organization, was just Elon’s way to generate headlines and not his legitimate grievances. “Elon’s nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit,” the company said. “He’s been spreading false information about us. We’re building the best-equipped nonprofit the world has ever seen; we’re not converting it away.” The firm accused Musk of abandoning OpenAI’s mission years ago, noting that he had once sought to merge the project with Tesla to give himself control over its direction. Elon’s never been about the mission. He’s always had his own agenda. He tried to seize control of OpenAI and merge it with Tesla as a for-profit – his own emails prove it. When he didn’t get his way, he stormed off. Elon is undoubtedly one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our… — OpenAI Newsroom (@OpenAINewsroom) April 9, 2025 According to OpenAI, when the company considered transitioning to a for-profit model in 2017, Tesla’s CEO reportedly demanded majority ownership, control of the board, and the chief executive role. When OpenAI resisted, citing the need to avoid any single person holding absolute control, Musk allegedly withheld funding he had promised to issue. Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, stepped in to cover employee salaries and keep the operation running. In early 2018, Musk forwarded emails suggesting Tesla could serve as OpenAI’s financial engine as the “only path” to compete with Google’s DeepMind. The emails showed Musk believed even Tesla’s resources gave it only a small chance of counterbalancing Google. “Even raising several hundred million won’t be enough. This needs billions per year immediately, or forget it,” one of the emails read . Motion to dismiss illegal hiring practices claims OpenAI has also filed a motion to dismiss Musk’s lawsuit on its hiring practices, propounding that it lawfully recruits top researchers, engineers, and developers from every part of the industry. “Unable to match OpenAI’s innovation, xAI has filed this groundless trade secret lawsuit,” the defense filing stated. “To be clear: OpenAI does not need or want anyone’s, much less xAI’s, trade secrets to achieve OpenAI’s mission.” The company accused Musk of attempting to intimidate staff and discourage those who would want to defect from his AI venture by turning legal action into a public relations weapon. Lawyers for OpenAI coined the complaint “lawfare” meant to overwhelm the company with lawsuits. In addition to trade secret claims, xAI has raised concerns over OpenAI’s collaboration with Apple, insisting that integrating ChatGPT into certain iPhone features constitutes anticompetitive conduct. OpenAI’s attorneys dismissed the argument, saying xAI had not shown any measurable harm that would require antitrust laws to step in. “xAI has not alleged any non-speculative harm rising directly out of ChatGPT’s integration as an option for certain features on certain iPhones. And certainly not the kind of unlawful harm targeted by antitrust law,” the attorneys noted. OpenAI surpasses SpaceX in valuation The legal battle comes at a time when OpenAI’s market value has reportedly crossed SpaceX, the rocket company Musk has spent two decades building. According to The New York Times, OpenAI completed a deal that allows current and former employees to sell shares at a $500 billion valuation. Roughly $6.6 billion worth of stock changed hands in the transaction, sources familiar with the matter said. Investors included Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price.

This concentration now equals about 3.2% of circulating Bitcoin supply and drives significant market influence. Strategy holds 640,031 BTC valued at $77.4 billion. That represents 3.2% of circulating Bitcoin and roughly 48% of corporate BTC treasuries. Strategy added 11,085 BTC in seven weeks; its most recent purchase was 196 BTC. Strategy Bitcoin treasury hits $77.4B with 640,031 BTC — analysis, comparisons, and expert context. Read key takeaways and implications now. What is Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury and how large is it? Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury is the firm’s corporate holding of BTC, currently totaling 640,031 BTC and valued at approximately $77.4 billion as of publication. This vault equals about 3.2% of circulating Bitcoin and surpasses the market cap of several major banks by headline comparison. How did Strategy build its Bitcoin holdings? Strategy accumulated BTC over years through recurring purchases and long-term holding policies. Michael Saylor noted the company started with a $0.25 billion position and absorbed early unrealized losses before reaching today’s valuation. Recent activity shows 11,085 BTC purchased in the last seven weeks, with a latest buy of 196 BTC. Source: Michael Saylor Why does Strategy’s treasury matter to markets and comparisons? Front-loaded holdings at this scale affect liquidity and public perception. A single entity holding 3.2% of circulating BTC concentrates supply, which can amplify price moves during sustained buying or selling. Strategy’s treasury now exceeds the market capitalization of multiple major banks and rivals the GDP of several small countries. A stash bigger than an entire nation’s GDP Strategy’s 640,031 BTC is roughly 48% of public and private corporate BTC treasuries. At current prices, the $77.4 billion valuation can be compared to national GDPs and major asset benchmarks for perspective. Comparative snapshot: Strategy vs peers and nations Entity BTC Held Approx. Value Strategy 640,031 BTC $77.4 billion MARA Holdings 52,477 BTC ~$6.3 billion El Salvador (nation-state) 6,338 BTC ~$762.5 million With $77.4 billion you could theoretically buy about 2,566,667 cars at $30,000 each or roughly 385,000 houses at $200,000 each. The holding is comparable to the annual GDPs of countries such as Uruguay, Sri Lanka, and Slovenia (national GDPs cited as public economic data). How does Strategy compare to nation-state and corporate treasuries? Public and private companies together hold about 1.32 million BTC, equal to 6.6% of total supply and an estimated $159 billion market value at current prices (BitcoinTreasuries.NET aggregated figures). Strategy alone accounts for nearly half of that corporate total. What does this concentration imply for corporate treasury risk? Large concentration raises both strategic advantages and risk exposure. Advantages include a long-term inflation hedge and balance-sheet diversification. Risks include market liquidity constraints, regulatory scrutiny, and concentrated counterparty perception. Expert commentary emphasizes prudent disclosure and robust treasury governance. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many bitcoins does Strategy hold?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Strategy holds 640,031 BTC, valued at about $77.4 billion at current market prices."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does Strategy hold more Bitcoin than some countries' GDP?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Is Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury publicly disclosed? Yes. Strategy has publicly reported its BTC holdings and periodic purchases. Michael Saylor has publicly commented on the company’s initial position and subsequent valuation growth. Key Takeaways Scale: Strategy holds 640,031 BTC, worth about $77.4B, representing a major corporate concentration of Bitcoin. Market impact: That stake equals ~3.2% of circulating supply and ~48% of corporate BTC treasuries, amplifying liquidity considerations. Comparative context: Strategy’s vault is comparable to the GDPs of several small nations and exceeds the market caps of multiple major banks. Conclusion Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury marks a defining moment in corporate crypto allocation. The $77.4 billion holding underscores how a single corporate treasury can shift comparative value metrics against banks and nations. Market participants should monitor liquidity implications, regulatory developments, and corporate disclosure for ongoing impact.

Analysts point to strong on-chain fundamentals, institutional accumulation, and ETF inflows. CryptoGoos called the current chart “the most bullish” they’ve seen, while other market commentators note reclaimed supports and defined upside targets at $4,500 and $4,750. Historical performance after similar accumulation events tends to show accelerated rallies, though past performance is not guaranteed. What role do ETF flows play in ETH price movement? ETF inflows increase demand from institutional and retail investors using regulated vehicles. Ethereum spot funds recorded $80.79 million in inflows, which complements direct accumulation by companies like BitMine and can support price discovery by adding persistent buying pressure into the market. Frequently Asked Questions How many ETH did BitMine buy and what are their total holdings? BitMine purchased 234,846 ETH (~$1 billion), increasing its total holdings to approximately 2.65 million ETH, valued at roughly $11 billion at recent prices. Did BitMine’s purchase affect BMNR stock? Yes. BMNR stock rose about 3.46% in pre-market trading to $54.10 following the announcement, reflecting investor interest in BitMine’s growing crypto treasury. Are ETF inflows significant for Ethereum’s price? Yes. U.S. spot Ethereum funds recorded $80.79 million in inflows, adding regulated demand that can support price momentum alongside direct institutional purchases. Key Takeaways Institutional accumulation matters : BitMine’s $1B buy materially reduced available ETH supply. Market reaction : ETH rose 5.39%, surpassing Bitcoin’s gains and lifting BMNR shares. Watch levels : $4,250 reclaimed support and analyst targets at $4,500–$4,750 guide short-term monitoring. Conclusion Ethereum price momentum reflects a mix of large-scale corporate accumulation, ETF inflows, and positive technicals. BitMine’s purchase and continued fund inflows improve demand-side fundamentals, while analysts set higher targets. Investors should monitor treasury disclosures, ETF flows, and support/resistance levels for signs of sustained trends. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Ethereum price rises 5.39% after BitMine's $1B purchase, boosting BMNR stock"", ""description"": ""Ethereum price surge after BitMine's $1B ETH purchase lifted ETH 5.39% to $4,389; BMNR stock rose and analysts set higher targets.

Kazuo, however, warned that global uncertainties may discourage firms from raising wages, leaving the timing of the central bank’s next rate hike unclear. Kazuo met with local business leaders in Osaka today to reiterate the BOJ’s commitment to keep raising interest rates if the economy and prices move in line with its forecasts. However, he refrained from offering any clear signal on whether the board would act at its next policy meeting later this month. The Yen weakens following Ueda’s remarks in Osaka Governor Kazuo Ueda revealed today that policymakers will monitor developments in the global economy, wage and price trends, and the impact of U.S. tariffs on Japan’s corporate profits before making their next decision. “If the baseline scenario for economic activity and prices outlined so far is realized, the bank, in accordance with improvement in economic activity and prices, will continue to raise the policy interest rate.” – Ueda Kazuo , BOJ Governor The Bank of Japan Governor emphasized risks surrounding Japan’s outlook, citing signs of weakness in the U.S. labor market and the potential pullback from higher American tariffs. According to Ueda, if uncertainty regarding overseas economies and trade policies remains high, firms may place stronger emphasis on cost-cutting and may weaken their efforts to reflect wage increases. He revealed that the future course of the U.S. economy and the conduct of monetary policy could significantly impact Japan’s economy and prices, prompting them to monitor the situation closely. Following Ueda’s remarks, the yen weakened by 0.35% to around 147.67 against the dollar at the time of publication. Akira Moroga, Chief Market Strategist at Aozora Bank, said that the governor’s dovish comments prompted the sell-off. Bloomberg report revealed that traders in the overnight swaps market see a 60% chance of a move at the October 29–30 meeting, up from about 22% in early September. However, some economists expect that a decision to change the rates could come later, in December, depending on incoming data. Shotaro Mori, senior economist at SBI Shinsei Bank, revealed that if the tariff impact intensifies, hard data on Japan’s third-quarter economic growth and corporate profits would be more decisive than Governor Ueda’s latest speech. Ueda says inflation is likely to increase, keeping the market guessing The Osaka address followed the release of the BOJ’s Tankan survey earlier this week. Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida stated that the survey indicates business sentiment remains at favorable levels, suggesting the economy is developing in line with the central bank’s projections. That is an essential condition for further tightening, though Ueda stopped short of signaling a clear path. At the September meeting, two members, Naoki Tamura and Hajime Takata, voted in favor of a rate hike, marking the first time under Ueda’s tenure that more than one member dissented. A dovish policymaker has also recently called for considering a shift sooner, reinforcing speculation that the bank is edging closer to its subsequent adjustment. Ueda addressed inflation issues directly, saying the underlying inflation, which excludes temporary or one-off factors, is likely to increase alongside actual price increases. His remarks marked a shift from the BOJ’s policy statement in September, which suggested underlying inflation would remain sluggish before gradually increasing. The governor also warned that prolonged rises in food prices could weigh on consumption and dampen broader inflationary momentum. Japan’s inflation has maintained above the BOJ’s 2% target for more than three years, but the central bank’s policies have been cautious. The BOJ ended its decade-long stimulus program last year and raised interest rates to 0.5% in January, marking its first hike in years. Ueda has since emphasized the importance of ensuring that price gains are backed by wage growth and robust domestic demand before tightening further.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-expert-to-xrp-holders-youre-being-tricked-heres-why/,"Levi Rietveld, the creator of Crypto Crusaders and an advocate for XRP, has issued a strong message to investors reacting to the latest U.S. government shutdown. Addressing cryptocurrency holders, he argued that selling XRP out of fear would be a costly mistake. According to Rietveld, the market’s behavior during prior shutdowns demonstrates resilience. He cited historical patterns showing that “with an 86% accuracy, 12 months later, the stock market and the crypto market actually closed higher.” In his view, the fear-driven decisions some investors consider today ignore established trends and the conditions currently shaping the financial landscape. XRP HOLDERS YOU’RE BEING TRICKED!! #XRP pic.twitter.com/kdIXz1aw2I — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 1, 2025 Historical Trends and Market Performance In the past, Government shutdowns have created short-term volatility, but the data often show a recovery over the following year. Rietveld emphasized that these shutdowns have rarely translated into lasting downturns for equities or digital assets. His remarks point to market history as a guide for interpreting present conditions, suggesting that panic selling would cut investors off from potential long-term gains. Alongside shutdown concerns, monetary policy remains another major factor. Rietveld referenced the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts . He expects multiple rate cuts before the end of the year. He views them as a critical driver for asset values, having recently set a $20 target for XRP , with multiple rate cuts playing a significant role in reaching that level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP and Market Recovery Patterns Rietveld’s focus on XRP reflects his continued advocacy for the asset, which has maintained a vocal community of supporters despite periods of market turbulence. He stressed that downturns tied to external events should not outweigh evidence of recovery patterns. He also pointed to tariffs as an example of how disruptive policies may initially weigh on prices but often lead to recoveries. Referring to that past environment, he described a V-shaped recovery that followed once markets found a bottom. His comparison suggests he sees similarities between those conditions and the pressures emerging from the current shutdown situation. For investors holding XRP or other cryptocurrencies, Rietveld’s comments serve as a call to remain patient. While short-term declines remain possible, his stance is that longer-term outcomes are shaped by established market behaviors and supportive financial policy shifts. He concluded that selling assets under present conditions risks missing an eventual rebound, and investors who panic can quickly lose out on significant profits .

Solana consolidates at $200–$220 with buyers defending key support. DeFi TVL on Solana is $12.264B and stablecoin liquidity is $14.371B, improving on-chain depth. Institutional staking plans for $500M in SOL and concentrated liquidations near $213–$219 could drive volatility. Solana price consolidates at $200–$220 after a $234 peak; see TVL, staking news, and short-term outlook — read the full update now. Solana consolidates between $200–$220 after peaking at $234, with rising DeFi TVL, $500M institutional staking, and projections toward $425. Solana (SOL) recently showed a strong bullish rally with a peak near $234 before facing heavy rejection and pulling back. The price is now consolidating between $200 and $220, with buyers attempting to defend key support as traders monitor the next market move. What is driving Solana’s current price consolidation? Solana price consolidation is driven by profit-taking after a $234 high, lower trading volume and growing on-chain fundamentals such as rising DeFi TVL and institutional staking plans. Short-term resistance sits near $220; a sustained move above that level could resume the prior uptrend. How significant is DeFi TVL and stablecoin liquidity for Solana’s outlook? On-chain metrics show Solana’s Total Value Locked at approximately $12.264 billion, with stablecoin liquidity near $14.371 billion. These figures indicate improving capital depth on the network, which can support larger on-chain activity and reduce short-term volatility during consolidation periods. Source mentions: DeFiLlama (TVL data), market on-chain analysts. $SOL recently showed a strong bullish rally with a peak near $234 before facing heavy rejection and pulling back. Now, the price is consolidating between $200–$220, where buyers are attempting to defend support — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru), October 1, 2025 The 4-hour chart shows smaller gains before a stronger bullish phase in early September that pushed prices above $240, followed by a rapid reversal in mid-September. Prices subsequently settled into the $200–$205 range and have traded between $200 and $220 since, with repeated rejections near $220. Lower volume suggests reduced volatility for now. How does institutional staking affect Solana’s market structure? Institutional interest is rising: VisionSys announced plans to acquire and stake $500 million in SOL using Marinade Finance as a partner. Marinade’s institutional lead, Scott Gralnick, highlighted security and liquidity for treasury staking programs. Institutional staking removes supply from exchanges, which can tighten available liquidity and support higher prices over time. Source: NekoZ(X) Derivatives positioning shows concentrated liquidation clusters between $213–$219, indicating a potential short squeeze if momentum returns. Chart analysts such as NekoZ note a strong move off recent lows with near-term resistance around $299 and extended upside scenarios toward $425 if bullish momentum persists into 2026. Derivatives mention: CoinGlass (liquidation data). Frequently Asked Questions Is Solana likely to break above $220 soon? Short-term probability favors consolidation; a breakout above $220 on increasing volume would raise the odds of a move toward $299, while a drop below $200 could deepen the correction. Watch volume and derivatives clusters for confirmation. How does institutional staking change SOL supply dynamics? Large-scale staking (e.g., a planned $500M stake) reduces liquid supply and can support higher prices over time if staking is locked long-term. Institutional treasury staking also signals confidence from large investors. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Solana likely to break above $220 soon?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A breakout above $220 requires increased volume; if confirmed, targets near $299 are possible.

On-chain strength : DeFi TVL ~ $12.264B and stablecoin liquidity ~ $14.371B support ecosystem growth. Institutional flows : A planned $500M institutional stake could reduce liquid supply and bolster long-term outlook. Conclusion Solana price remains range-bound at $200–$220, balanced between short-term technical resistances and improving on-chain fundamentals such as rising TVL and institutional staking interest. Traders should watch $220 and $200 for breakout or breakdown confirmation.

Laser, based in Switzerland, is in pre-consultation talks with Japan’s Financial Services Agency, according to Chief Executive Officer Jez Mohideen. Mohideen told Bloomberg that the application reflects the group’s confidence in the country’s digital asset ecosystem. Transaction Value Doubles As Investors Embrace Digital Assets In Japan Japan’s crypto trading market has expanded rapidly this year. Data from the Japan Virtual and Crypto assets Exchange Association showed that the value of transactions doubled to ¥33.7 trillion, or about $230b, in the first seven months alone. Nomura Holdings plans to expand in Japan’s digital-asset market through a subsidiary, as crypto trading in the country heats up https://t.co/vV6z8i9JTZ — Bloomberg (@business) October 3, 2025 Supportive policies abroad, particularly in the US, and anticipated changes at home such as tax cuts and new rules for crypto-focused funds have fueled the momentum. The move by Nomura comes as cryptocurrencies push further into mainstream financial services in Japan. Daiwa Securities, the country’s second-largest brokerage, announced this week that clients at its 181 retail branches can now use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral to borrow yen. Government Reforms On Tax And Rules Boost Market Participation In Japan Nomura unveiled Laser in 2022 to offer services ranging from asset management to venture capital. The unit secured a full crypto business license in Dubai in 2023 and set up a Japanese subsidiary the same year. If granted approval, Laser plans to provide broker-dealer services for both traditional financial institutions and crypto firms, including digital-asset exchanges operating in Japan. Industry observers say that younger investors and institutional players are increasingly turning to digital assets as part of their portfolios, particularly as the government moves to ease tax burdens and refine rules. Japan’s market has also drawn global attention for its pace of growth. In the 12 months to June 2025, the country recorded a 120% increase in on-chain value received , outpacing South Korea, India and Vietnam. The growth has been helped by reforms treating more tokens as investment instruments and the licensing of the first yen-backed stablecoin issuer. Global Institutions Eye Japan’s Fast Evolving Crypto Market Landscape Still, Laser’s performance has not been without challenges. Nomura reported a quarterly loss in Europe earlier this year, partly linked to what CFO Hiroyuki Moriuchi described as the unit’s “not very good” results. Mohideen had initially expected Laser to turn a profit within two years of its launch, though he later cautioned that breaking even might take longer. Even with those setbacks, the planned expansion into Japan signals Nomura’s intent to solidify its role in a market that is evolving quickly and attracting global financial institutions. For regulators, the arrival of new players such as Laser highlights the balancing act of fostering innovation while maintaining strict oversight.

Breakout above $112 triggered a rapid 10% gain in 24 hours. Sharpe Ratio rose to ~2.3, indicating improved risk-adjusted returns. Futures Open Interest climbed by about $100M to $703M, pointing to more leveraged positions. Litecoin price surge: LTC broke $112 and rallied 10% in 24h; Sharpe ratio 2.3 and OI +$100M. Read trade-ready analysis and next technical targets. What triggered Litecoin’s recent price surge? Litecoin price surge began after LTC cleared a persistent flag resistance near $112, producing a swift 10% advance in 24 hours. The breakout aligned with rising derivatives activity and an improving Sharpe Ratio, suggesting momentum driven by both spot buyers and leveraged futures positions. How significant is the Sharpe Ratio rise for Litecoin? Messari data shows LTC’s 30-day Sharpe Ratio climbed to about 2.3 at the time of reporting. A Sharpe Ratio above 2.0 historically signals strong returns relative to volatility. This improvement indicates that recent gains are producing better risk-adjusted performance, which can attract institutional and risk-aware traders. Key Takeaways Immediate catalyst : Breakout above $112 flag pushed LTC up ~10% in 24 hours. Risk-adjusted performance : Sharpe Ratio at ~2.3, suggesting stronger returns vs volatility. Derivatives activity : Open Interest surged by roughly $100M to $703M, showing increased leveraged exposure. Is this a repeat of Litecoin’s familiar cycle? Litecoin has a history of consolidating in flag-shaped ranges before staging decisive upside breaks. The current move follows that pattern, with technical momentum targeting the next resistance zone near $135. Traders should watch volume and on-chain metrics for confirmation rather than assuming automatic continuation. The market’s technical picture and on-chain signals align: breakout -> momentum -> elevated open interest. That sequence has repeated in prior LTC rallies. Source: TradingView How do Sharpe Ratio and Open Interest change the outlook? The rising Sharpe Ratio suggests more efficient returns, which can draw capital seeking favorable risk/return profiles. Concurrently, the $100M jump in futures Open Interest to $703M (Messari) shows fresh positions are being added. Higher open interest can amplify moves — positive if bulls hold, but it raises liquidation risk in sharp reversals. Source: Messari What does the Open Interest surge mean for traders? Open Interest rising by ~$100M to roughly $703M indicates traders are increasing exposure to LTC futures. That often precedes extended trends but also increases system-wide leverage. Risk management is essential: traders should monitor funding rates, position sizes, and key support levels. Source: Messari Rally or pause ahead? Technically, the breakout has shifted sentiment toward bulls, with a near-term target at about $135. However, short-term profit-taking or volatility-driven retracements are plausible given higher leverage in futures markets. Conservative traders should wait for retest confirmation of the $112 level or follow trend with defined stops. Frequently Asked Questions How much did Litecoin rally after breaking $112? Litecoin rallied roughly 10% in the 24 hours following the breakout above $112, driven by spot buy-side momentum and increased futures positioning. Is the Sharpe Ratio change meaningful for long-term investors? A Sharpe Ratio near 2.3 indicates improved short-term risk-adjusted returns. Long-term investors should combine this metric with on-chain trends and macro conditions before adjusting allocations. Does higher Open Interest guarantee continued upside? No. Higher Open Interest signals stronger participation and conviction but also more leverage. It can fuel trends but increases the potential for sharp moves if sentiment reverses. How to trade the current Litecoin setup? Confirm breakout: wait for a clear daily close above $112 with volume confirmation. Manage risk: set stop-loss near validated support and size positions relative to account risk. Monitor OI & funding: reduce exposure if Open Interest spikes without fundamental support. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much did Litecoin rally after breaking $112?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Litecoin rallied roughly 10% in the 24 hours following the breakout above $112, driven by spot momentum and increased futures positioning."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the Sharpe Ratio change meaningful for long-term investors?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A Sharpe Ratio near 2.3 shows improved short-term risk-adjusted returns; long-term investors should combine this with on-chain and macro analysis before reallocating."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does higher Open Interest guarantee continued upside?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Higher Open Interest reflects increased participation and leverage; it can support trends but also amplifies reversals if sentiment shifts."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Litecoin price surge: breakout above $112 lifts LTC — Sharpe ratio 2.3, OI +$100M"", ""description"": ""Litecoin broke a $112 flag, rallying 10% in 24 hours.

BNB Chain validators adopted a new minimum gas price of 0.05 gwei to lower transaction costs and speed confirmations. The BNB team has signaled further changes to block gas limits and architecture upgrades to support high throughput. Roadmap plans include increasing the BSC block gas limit from 100 million to 1 billion and, by 2026, pursuing an architecture capable of ~20,000 transactions per second with sub‑150 millisecond confirmations. Planned feature work includes native privacy functions, upgradable virtual machines and improved developer tools. Source: BNB Chain Which major upgrades already went live in 2025? Two major upgrades completed earlier in 2025: the Lorentz Hard Fork in April reduced block times and improved validator networking, and the Maxwell upgrade in June optimized block production and validator coordination. Both upgrades aimed to improve latency and network throughput.

Professional forecasts vary; Standard Chartered projected a peak around $1,275 for 2025 based on correlations with BTC and ETH. Market dynamics, macro factors and on‑chain demand will influence any further upside. Are token burns affecting BNB supply? Yes. Regular token burns reduce circulating supply over time, which can enhance scarcity. Combined with treasury accumulation and demand growth, burns can contribute to upward price pressure. What should users watch in BNB Chain metrics? Monitor TLV, active addresses, transaction volumes, and gas price adoption. Sudden changes in these metrics can signal shifts in demand, network congestion or improved utility after upgrades. Key Takeaways BNB price reached a new ATH : $1,111.90 after solid weekly gains and rising demand. On‑chain activity is expanding : TLV, active addresses and volume all show notable increases. Upgrades support growth : Recent Maxwell and Lorentz upgrades plus planned changes aim to boost throughput and lower costs. Conclusion BNB price strength reflects both demand dynamics—treasury buying and token burns—and rising BNB Chain activity. Network upgrades in 2025 improve capacity and user experience, potentially supporting further price resilience. Continue monitoring TLV, active addresses and upgrade adoption for forward signals.

The market is balanced and awaiting catalysts for a clear breakout above $120K–$122K.

Bitcoin trades near $119K with Binance data showing a neutral risk-reward balance, as markets await catalysts for the next rally. Binance data places Bitcoin’s Sharpe-like ratio at 0.18, reflecting neutral risk-reward conditions with neither strong rallies nor excessive dangers. The 30-day reference to Bitcoin is 0.26%, with volatility being 1.37, which reflects an equal (balanced) and moderately active market. A longer-run ratio of more than 0.5 and a price movement of over $120K-122K would indicate a new positive trend with increased trading volumes. Bitcoin maintains stability near $119,000 on Binance, with market data reflecting a balanced phase between risk and potential gains. What is Bitcoin’s current risk-reward balance? Bitcoin risk-reward balance is currently neutral, supported by a Binance-derived Sharpe-like ratio of 0.18. This reading indicates that recent returns only modestly compensate for volatility, while 30-day measures (0.26% return, 1.37 volatility) point to subdued momentum rather than clear directional pressure. How does the Sharpe-like ratio indicate market conditions? The Sharpe-like ratio compares returns to volatility to show if gains justify risk. Readings above 0.5 historically signal attractive risk-adjusted returns and potential momentum. A ratio near 0 or negative implies volatility outpacing returns and increases the likelihood of corrective phases. Binance and on-chain analytics providers (plain text mention: CryptoQuant) show the current 0.18 reading as evidence of equilibrium. Market participants often wait for a sustained rise in this ratio before increasing leverage or initiating larger accumulations. Source: CryptoQuant Why do 30-day returns and volatility matter? Front-loaded data shows the 30-day average return of 0.26% is modest, while volatility at 1.37 suggests measured price swings. Together, these metrics indicate an orderly market conducive to accumulation but lacking the conviction needed for a strong breakout. Investors use these short-term indicators to calibrate position size and risk. Low returns with moderate volatility often precede directional moves when new macro or on-chain catalysts arrive. When would a renewed rally be confirmed? A renewed rally would be signaled by a combination of sustained improvements: the Sharpe-like ratio rising above 0.5, 30-day returns increasing meaningfully, and Bitcoin pushing past $120,000–$122,000 with elevated trading volume. Those conditions historically mark the transition to bullish risk-adjusted environments. How to interpret these metrics in trading decisions? Traders should treat current readings as a watch-and-wait environment. Use these rules: Confirm ratio trend: look for multi-week rise toward 0.3–0.5. Monitor returns and volatility: rising returns with contained volatility are constructive. Validate with price and volume: breakout above $120K–$122K with healthy volume confirms trend. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the current Sharpe-like ratio for Bitcoin?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The current Binance-derived Sharpe-like ratio for Bitcoin is 0.18, indicating a neutral risk-reward environment where returns modestly compensate for volatility."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does Bitcoin need to pass $120K to confirm a rally?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A sustained move above $120,000–$122,000 combined with a Sharpe-like ratio above 0.5 and rising volume would be a strong confirmation of a renewed rally."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How reliable is the Sharpe-like ratio for Bitcoin? The Sharpe-like ratio is a widely used risk-adjusted performance measure. For Bitcoin, it provides a quick gauge of whether recent returns justify volatility; however, it should be used alongside volume, on-chain metrics, and macro signals for robust decisions. What should traders watch next? Traders should watch the trend in the Sharpe-like ratio, 30-day returns, volatility, and price action around $120K–$122K. A synchronized improvement across these metrics would increase confidence in a sustainable rally. Key Takeaways Neutral risk profile : Bitcoin’s Sharpe-like ratio at 0.18 signals equilibrium between risk and reward. Modest short-term returns : 30-day return is 0.26% with volatility at 1.37, favoring orderly accumulation. Rally confirmation criteria : A ratio >0.5, higher returns, and a breakout above $120K–$122K with volume would confirm a new upward phase. Conclusion Bitcoin remains in a balanced state near $119,000, with Binance-derived metrics pointing to neutral risk-reward conditions. Market participants should prioritize risk-adjusted indicators and volume to identify a genuine breakout.

Key Takeaways: The SEC missed its deadline on Canary’s spot Litecoin ETF, leaving the application in limbo. The agency is phasing out 19b-4 filings in favor of S-1s, adding confusion to ETF approval timelines. A possible government shutdown and shifting rules are delaying decisions on several altcoin ETF applications. The silence has added confusion to an already murky situation, as the crypto industry grapples with shifting ETF application procedures and the looming impact of a federal government shutdown. SEC Shifts Crypto ETF Filings Toward S-1, Phases Out 19b-4 Process Earlier this year, the SEC urged firms to withdraw their 19b-4 filings, the documents used for exchange rule changes, in favor of relying solely on S-1 registration statements. Canary complied, pulling its 19b-4 on September 25. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart and FOX reporter Eleanor Terrett noted that the traditional deadline tied to 19b-4 filings may now be irrelevant under the SEC’s evolving framework. But the regulatory uncertainty doesn’t end there. A shutdown of the federal government is complicating matters further. Although the SEC said it will continue limited operations during the shutdown, a contingency plan published in August stated it would halt the review and approval of new financial products. That includes registration statements and ETF filings. As I understand it, the shutdown could affect the $LTC ETF approval because the @SECGov still needs to sign off on the S-1 and the agency is operating on a skeleton crew. It’s unclear what remaining staff is working/what their priorities are at the moment. Since the generic… https://t.co/uD1uO9udtO — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) October 2, 2025 Whether the agency’s silence on Canary’s Litecoin ETF stems from the withdrawn filing or the shutdown remains unclear. The SEC has not provided public comment on the delay. Canary’s stalled application joins a growing list of altcoin-based ETF proposals seeking to expand the U.S. crypto ETF market. Alongside Litecoin, other filings include products based on Solana, XRP, Avalanche, Cardano, Chainlink, and Dogecoin. These would join the already launched Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which have collectively drawn over $74 billion in inflows. Despite the standstill, analysts remain optimistic. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas said this week that the SEC’s adoption of new listing standards under Rule 6c-11 may accelerate approvals. SEC Chair Paul Atkins added that these changes will streamline the process and lower barriers for investors. Solana ETF Filings Signal Institutional Momentum Last week, several top asset managers, including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise, have submitted updated S-1 filings for spot Solana ETFs, some with staking features. ETF analyst Nate Geraci expects the US SEC could approve them by mid-October , calling it a pivotal month for digital asset products. The filings follow the recent launch of the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange, which drew $12 million in first-day inflows. Analysts say Solana is quickly becoming the next altcoin favored by institutions, with strong inflows also reported in Europe-based Solana ETPs. Geraci and others believe the inclusion of staking language in these filings could pave the way for long-awaited spot Ethereum ETFs with staking capabilities. Meanwhile, Bitcoin exchange-traded products now hold over 1.47 million BTC , representing around 7% of the total supply, with U.S.-based ETFs dominating the landscape. BlackRock’s IBIT leads with 746,810 BTC, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at nearly 199,500 BTC, according to data from HODL15Capital.

52599068,https://cryptonews.com/?p=432538,1759473860,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52599068.jpeg,NY Senator Introduces Bill to Tax High-Consumption Crypto Miners in New York,https://cryptonews.com/news/ny-senator-introduces-bill-to-tax-high-consumption-crypto-miners-in-new-york/,"New York State Senator Liz Krueger has introduced a bill targeting crypto mining operations that consume large amounts of electricity, proposing a tiered excise tax based on annual energy usage. Key Takeaways: New York’s proposed bill would tax crypto miners up to 5 cents per kWh based on energy usage tiers. Mining operations using 100% renewable energy would be exempt from the tax. Rising energy costs and tighter margins may push miners to leave New York or shift to cleaner power sources. The bill, unveiled Wednesday , seeks to charge miners up to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) depending on their consumption levels. New York Bill Proposes Tiered Energy Tax on Crypto Miners Based on Usage Under the proposal, mining firms using less than 2.25 million kWh per year would be exempt. Those consuming between 2.26 and 5 million kWh would pay 2 cents per kWh, with higher tiers facing steeper charges: 3 cents up to 10 million kWh, 4 cents up to 20 million, and 5 cents for those exceeding that threshold. Miners powered entirely by renewable energy would be exempt. This echoes New York’s two-year moratorium on non-renewable-powered mining, which ended in 2024 and allowed clean-energy-based operations to continue. Krueger’s bill arrives at a time when mining costs are surging. The median cost to mine one Bitcoin topped $70,000 in Q2 2025, driven by increased network hashrate and difficulty, according to TheMinerMag. Energy costs in Q1 2025 averaged around $0.08 per kWh, double the revenue-to-cost ratio for firms like TeraWulf, which reported a $61.4 million loss for the period at its upstate New York facility. JUST IN: New York introduces anti-bitcoin mining bill that would tax proof-of-work mining pic.twitter.com/CWTjghW8EU — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) October 2, 2025 The tax could squeeze profit margins even further for miners relying on retail-priced grid electricity. Large operators with access to renewable infrastructure may be able to absorb the blow or sidestep the tax entirely, reinforcing their edge over smaller competitors. Electricity remains the single most critical cost in Bitcoin mining. With margins already thin, the proposed tax may accelerate an exodus of mining firms from New York to lower-cost jurisdictions, unless they transition to clean energy. The bill underscores New York’s ongoing scrutiny of crypto mining’s environmental footprint as lawmakers weigh economic incentives against sustainability goals. US Lawmaker Calls for National Security Probe Into China-Linked Bitcoin Mining Firms In September, Congressman Zachary Nunn asked the US Treasury to launch a national security review of Chinese firms Bitmain and Cango, citing concerns over their expanding presence in the US crypto mining sector. In a letter sent to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Nunn pointed to opaque ownership structures, potential state ties, and risks to national infrastructure as grounds for a Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) investigation. Bitmain, which dominates over 80% of the global Bitcoin mining hardware market, and Nasdaq-listed Cango have both denied any merger plans. Still, Nunn raised alarms over their growth strategies in the US, complex financing arrangements, and possible involvement in US energy infrastructure. His concerns follow a $300 million equipment deal between Bitmain’s US arm and a Trump-linked mining firm. Both companies have stated they comply with US laws and have no ties to foreign governments. However, Nunn argues that the scale of their influence and the sensitivity of energy and crypto markets demand closer scrutiny, warning that unchecked expansion could undermine US digital asset sovereignty.

After a year of alternating corrections and rebounds, traders are now positioning for the next major uptrend. Bitcoin’s dominance has provided a stable foundation, but the true excitement lies in the altcoin market, where higher multiples and stronger narratives often emerge during bull runs. Analysts argue that this cycle may be one of the most dynamic yet, as institutional adoption coincides with retail enthusiasm in ways not seen before. In this environment, altcoins with strong ecosystems, cultural momentum, or speculative potential are drawing attention. Investors are increasingly blending strategies: anchoring with established projects while also allocating to high-upside tokens capable of delivering exponential returns. The goal is not just to participate in the rally but to maximize exposure to the most promising stories. From Ethereum and Solana to emerging presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE , six altcoins are standing out as the ones to watch as markets prepare to ride the next bullish wave. Ethereum: The Institutional Standard Ethereum remains the most important altcoin for institutional adoption. Its dominance in decentralized finance, NFTs, and tokenization ensures steady inflows, while scaling solutions through Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism reduce congestion and costs. Ethereum’s recent role in tokenization pilots by major financial firms shows that it is increasingly treated not just as a cryptocurrency, but as digital infrastructure. Analysts highlight that ETF inflows have created a structural demand floor, which complements its strong developer base. For long-term investors, ETH provides reliability that meme tokens cannot. While it may not be the coin to deliver 50× gains, it anchors portfolios by ensuring exposure to the digital economy’s backbone. In every bullish phase, Ethereum has historically grown alongside Bitcoin, often outperforming in percentage terms once capital rotates into altcoins. Its blend of credibility and innovation secures its position as the first altcoin to watch in this mega bullish wave. Solana: The High-Beta Performer Solana continues to cement its reputation as one of the fastest and most culturally relevant blockchains. Its network supports high throughput at low cost, making it a favorite for NFT projects, DeFi protocols, and meme tokens. The ecosystem’s resilience has grown stronger after past outages, and recent developer activity shows Solana remains committed to scaling without sacrificing usability. For traders, its high-beta nature means Solana often amplifies the broader market trend, surging faster during rallies and correcting more sharply during pullbacks. The chain has also become a hub for retail-driven experiments, with meme coins like BONK demonstrating how cultural momentum can drive adoption. Solana’s combination of speed, affordability, and community-driven growth makes it one of the altcoins most likely to deliver 10× or greater returns in a bullish wave. Analysts believe that if institutional players expand exposure beyond Ethereum, Solana will be one of the first networks to benefit. XRP: The Regulatory Play XRP has long been defined by its regulatory battles, but with much of the uncertainty easing, its utility-driven narrative is returning to the forefront. As a token designed for cross-border payments and settlements, XRP occupies a unique niche in the crypto ecosystem. Partnerships with banks and payment providers have underscored its relevance, and with speculation about ETF products in play, investor confidence is growing. In the last week, XRP has consolidated near $2.80–$2.94, showing strength while many altcoins corrected. Analysts argue that this reflects whale accumulation and institutional optimism. The $3 level is a psychological barrier, and a clean breakout could push XRP into its strongest rally in years. For long-term investors, XRP is not just about speculation but also adoption — the possibility that its technology powers global payment rails. In a mega bullish wave, that dual narrative of utility and growth makes it a must-watch altcoin. Avalanche: The Scaling Contender Avalanche has positioned itself as one of the strongest scaling solutions in the market. Its subnet architecture allows enterprises and developers to create custom blockchains with unique rules, enabling experimentation without compromising performance. This flexibility has attracted partnerships in gaming, DeFi, and enterprise applications. Avalanche has also focused on sustainability, marketing itself as an environmentally conscious blockchain. For investors, AVAX offers exposure to real-world use cases that expand beyond speculation. Its ability to scale efficiently makes it attractive for developers seeking performance at lower costs than Ethereum’s mainnet. Analysts suggest that as blockchain adoption broadens, Avalanche could capture a significant share of institutional and enterprise flows. In previous cycles, AVAX has delivered strong rallies, and many believe it is poised to repeat this performance. With scalability as one of the biggest themes of the next decade, Avalanche’s role as a contender for mass adoption is clear. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Speculative Spark Analysts compiling lists of altcoins for the next bullish wave are including not just majors but presales with compelling ROI math. MAGACOIN FINANCE is consistently ranked in those lists, with return models suggesting 1,600%–2,200% ROI depending on exchange adoption. Its design rewards urgency, as each stage increases cost for new buyers, magnifying early participants’ upside. While ETH and SOL dominate institutional narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers retail traders a high-risk, high-reward way to amplify cycle participation. For those watching altcoin watchlists closely, it is being positioned not as a side note but as one of the standout names worth tracking. Cardano: The Patient Builder Cardano represents the long game in blockchain. Its peer-reviewed, academically rigorous approach means development has been slower, but it also ensures a secure and scalable foundation. Recent governance updates and interoperability efforts have positioned Cardano for renewed growth, particularly as decentralized applications continue to expand on its platform. Investors often see ADA as a counterbalance to high-beta tokens. While it may not capture the fastest rallies, its long-term approach provides stability. Analysts note that ADA often lags behind in early bull runs, only to rally strongly later when its ecosystem developments are recognized. For patient holders, Cardano offers a blend of sustainability, security, and eventual upside. In the context of a mega bullish wave, it is the altcoin for investors who want exposure to growth without the extreme volatility of more speculative projects. Conclusion As the crypto market prepares to ride a mega bullish wave, six altcoins stand out for different reasons. Ethereum offers institutional credibility, Solana delivers cultural and high-beta growth, XRP represents regulatory-driven adoption, Avalanche provides scalable enterprise solutions, Cardano ensures stability through governance, and MAGACOIN FINANCE injects speculative firepower with its viral community and scarcity-driven design. Together, these six altcoins create a balanced watchlist, offering investors exposure across the spectrum of stability, growth, and speculation. For portfolios seeking to maximize returns in the next major rally, blending anchors like Ethereum with speculative gems like MAGACOIN may prove to be the winning strategy.

52599930,596576,1759474851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52599930.jpeg,"US Senator Blasts Crypto’s Environmental Impact, Warns Of Impending Reckoning",https://bitcoinist.com/us-senator-blasts-crypto-environmental-impact/,"During a recent congressional hearing on climate change, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, member of the Democratic Party, delivered a message regarding the alleged environmental impact of crypto mining . He asserted that the industry is exacerbating climate issues and cautioned that a reckoning is on the horizon. Calls For Accountability In Crypto And AI In April, Senator Whitehouse, alongside fellow Democrat John Fetterman, introduced the Cloud Act, legislation aimed at establishing emissions standards for artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency mining facilities. The goal is to utilize the resulting revenues to help consumers lower their utility bills while investing in clean energy. Eleanor Terret reported on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that Whitehouse urged industry leaders to consider the implications of their actions on everyday electricity consumers. “Think about what you’re doing to regular consumers of electricity nearby,” he stated. Whitehouse also stressed on the importance of reflecting on the potential consequences of their choices, warning that they risk pushing society further down a troubling climate path. Senator Ron Wyden, the panel’s ranking member, expressed his gratitude to Whitehouse for his remarks, while Senator Marsha Blackburn dismissed Whitehouse’s statements as irrelevant. Attention Shifts To Clarity Act Whitehouse has been vocal about the alleged strain that energy-intensive data centers and crypto mining operations place on the power grid. He noted that these facilities contribute to rising electricity costs for consumers, hinder access to power for homes and businesses, and increase fossil fuel emissions. “The good news is that we don’t have to choose between leading the world on AI and leading the world on climate safety,” he remarked. He believes that technology and AI companies have the financial resources to invest in clean energy alternatives, thereby preventing further strain on local grids. The Clean Cloud Act aims to direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set emissions performance standards for data centers and crypto mining facilities with an installed IT power capacity exceeding 100 kilowatts. These standards would be based on regional grid emissions intensities and would decrease annually by 11%. The legislation also proposes penalties for emissions that exceed the set standards, starting at $20 per ton of CO2 equivalent, with annual adjustments for inflation. Despite the urgency expressed by Senator Whitehouse, progress on the Clean Cloud Act remains stalled as Congress shifts its focus to the Clarity Act. This market structure bill intends to clarify the regulatory landscape for digital assets by defining the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), categorizing digital assets, and establishing new protections for developers in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

Here's the Latest Giant Company to Overtake,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-rises-to-7th-place-in-global-asset-rankings-heres-the-latest-giant-company-to-overtake/,"Bitcoin has achieved another remarkable feat, with the cryptocurrency giant surpassing the $120,000 mark and pushing its market capitalization above $2.4 trillion, according to MarketCap data. Bitcoin Surpasses Amazon, Rising to 7th Place in Global Asset Rankings With this development, Bitcoin surpassed Amazon, which has a market value of $2.371 trillion, and rose to 7th place in the global asset rankings. Bitcoin, which gained 1.84% in the last 24 hours, is once again competing with traditional market giants. Silver is ahead of Bitcoin in the new rankings. This table reveals that Bitcoin's place in the financial system is gradually strengthening and the “digital gold” metaphor is gaining concrete basis for investors. According to experts, this rise is driven by increasing uncertainty in the global economy, interest rate cut signals from central banks, and demand for cryptocurrencies seeking protection from risk. It is also emphasized that the interest of institutional investors through ETFs has created a permanent momentum in Bitcoin's market value. Bitcoin's surpassing of a major tech company like Amazon has once again highlighted the competitiveness of crypto assets in traditional financial markets. Analysts predict that Bitcoin could surpass silver in the coming period, entering the top six assets. *This is not investment advice.

At the Circle Forum in Singapore, Yam Ki Chan, Circle’s Asia-Pacific Vice President, revealed that on-chain stablecoin activity reached $2.4 trillion in the 12 months to June 2025. The data highlights how quickly stablecoins are moving beyond niche crypto use and into mainstream financial and commercial systems. Circle @circle · Follow Asia has the highest adoption rate of stablecoins worldwide.At Circle Forum Singapore, we explored how APAC is embracing onchain finance, with $2.4 trillion of activity from June 2024 to June 2025.Yam Ki Chan, VP for APAC and Managing Director for Circle Singapore, expands on Watch on Twitter View replies 12:28 AM · Oct 3, 2025 199 Reply Copy link Read 21 replies Monthly transactions have soared, businesses across industries are integrating them, and regulators in Asia, the US, and even China are shaping policies that could redefine global money flows. Singapore and Hong Kong drive stablecoin activity Singapore and Hong Kong have become the second and third-largest stablecoin markets worldwide, behind only the US. The Singapore-China route has also grown into the busiest corridor for cross-border digital currency transactions, underscoring Singapore’s importance in regional flows. Circle strengthened its Asia presence with the opening of a Singapore office in May 2025. At the launch, Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, noted the rising demand for new forms of money, including privately issued stablecoins. Data shows the scale of this rise. Monthly corporate transactions jumped from less than $100 million in early 2023 to more than $3 billion by early 2025. Sectors like travel and luxury retail are already incorporating stablecoins into daily operations. Singapore’s Wetrip travel agency, Capella Hotels, and luxury reseller Ginza Xiaoma, known for Birkin bags, now accept payments in stablecoins, reflecting consumer adoption alongside institutional use. Retail payments and regulation boost growth Stablecoins are digital assets designed to mirror the value of fiat currencies or commodities like gold, reducing volatility compared with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Their ability to settle cross-border payments quickly and at lower costs has made them attractive for trade, retail, and financial services. Singapore’s consumer-facing use cases are a visible sign of this shift, with stablecoins now being used for booking travel, paying for accommodation, and purchasing high-end goods. Policymakers have responded with frameworks aimed at managing risk while supporting innovation. In August 2025, Hong Kong introduced a dedicated regulatory framework for stablecoins. In June, the US passed the GENIUS Act, establishing rules for issuance and oversight. Meanwhile, China, long restrictive on crypto trading, has taken small steps toward blockchain exploration. Shanghai launched a task force in July 2025 to examine how blockchain could aid international trade, signalling gradual policy flexibility. Global supply rises as integration deepens The global supply of circulating stablecoins reached an average of $225 billion by May 2025, marking a 63% increase compared to the year before. Monthly transaction volumes climbed to $625 billion, showing how deeply these digital assets are being integrated into finance. This expansion is tied not only to retail and institutional demand but also to clearer regulations across jurisdictions. The combination of large trading volumes and growing acceptance by businesses demonstrates that stablecoins are no longer confined to crypto exchanges or speculative trading. Instead, they are increasingly embedded in mainstream commercial activity. Asia-Pacific at the centre of digital money For Circle, Asia-Pacific is more than a growth market. The company views the region as a testing ground for the global transition to digital financial systems. Regulatory clarity and adoption in countries like Singapore and Hong Kong have created fertile ground for expansion. With $2.4 trillion in transactions, rising retail payments, and major policy developments across Asia, the region is now seen as a bellwether for the future of money. Stablecoins are being positioned not only as tools for crypto users but also as infrastructure for global finance, trade, and commerce.

At the same time, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as one of the most exciting new tokens, targeting $7 from just $0.11. With major listings, wallet beta testing, and a $250,000 Giveaway, Remittix is quickly winning over early believers. Ethereum Price Gains As Whales Build Positions Ethereum price is remaining stable following a tremendous breakout that has rejuvenated the market. ETH price today is $4,304, up 3.46% in the past 24 hours, with trading volume climbing 6.51% to $43.48 billion. This consistent increase supports the optimistic mood and gives momentum to the recent ETH price forecast that is set to reach highs in the long run. Over the past week, Ethereum price has risen 2.7%. This is a consistent climb that analysts see as a base for future gains. According to Ethereum news from top analysts, ETH successfully flipped the $4,000 resistance into support. Marzell Crypto noted that Ethereum’s breakout above $4,300 builds a stronger case for higher levels, while analyst BitBull suggested Ethereum could surge to $8,000–$10,000 if momentum holds. The key support remains at $4,261, and as long as ETH price stays above this zone, the bullish structure is intact. On-chain Ethereum news shows open interest up 2.88% to $57.02 billion, alongside a 13.86% jump in trading volume, reflecting surging investor confidence. With whales accumulating, Ethereum price prediction models continue to eye $10,000 in the next cycle, setting ETH up as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch heading into 2026. Ethereum Price Holds Strong But Remittix Sets The Stage For Next Wave Ethereum price continues to show long-term strength with analysts projecting ETH could climb as high as $10,000 by 2026. But while Ethereum remains a dominant force, investors are starting to notice Remittix (RTX) as the project is being tipped to mirror Ripple’s payments success and bring crypto into everyday use. Remittix is being branded “XRP 2.0” for its direct focus on bridging crypto with traditional banking, offering smooth cross-border transfers at low costs. Unlike Ethereum or Ripple, RTX is positioning itself directly for consumers, freelancers, and travelers fed up with hidden fees. Already raising more than $26.9 million, Remittix has crossed major milestones including a confirmed BitMart listing at $20M and an upcoming LBank listing at $22M. With CertiK verification and the Remittix Wallet beta now live, confidence in the project continues to build. $26.9M+ raised with strong investor backing BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing, with LBank next CertiK verification achieved, ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens 15% Referral Program launched with instant USDT rewards Add in the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway and a new referral program paying 15% in USDT daily, and the project is stacking momentum quickly.

His remarks, shared in a recent shareholder letter and explained by Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, have reignited debate over Ripple’s dominance in the cross-border payments space. Claver Highlights Garlinghouse’s Perspective In a video shared by Abs, host of Good Morning Crypto podcast, Jake Claver broke down Garlinghouse’s reaction for the XRP community. Claver explained that the Ripple chief views SWIFT’s prototype as more of a marketing strategy, particularly timed to generate buzz ahead of the Sibos conference. “While SWIFT is still talking about prototypes, Ripple has already built and deployed real digital asset infrastructure,” Claver noted, emphasizing the contrast between Ripple’s delivery and SWIFT’s experiments. His analysis echoed Garlinghouse’s confidence that Ripple’s head start positions it well ahead of legacy competitors.

He noted that while SWIFT was once a major competitor to Ripple , the industry has undergone significant changes since then. “It’s true in the early days we did view SWIFT as a major competitor, but the reality is in the time it’s taken for them to announce a prototype, we’ve been building robust digital asset infrastructure, expanding on our payments product to custody, stablecoins, and development on the XRPL and more with recent acquisitions.” Garlinghouse added that Ripple’s review of SWIFT’s announcement confirmed his view that it was “more like a marketing play in the lead-up to their annual conference, Sibos, rather than an actual meaningful product announcement.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple vs. SWIFT: Competing Paths The sharp difference in approach between Ripple and SWIFT is becoming increasingly evident. While SWIFT is still rolling out conceptual prototypes, Ripple has spent the last 13 years building and refining real-world blockchain solutions. Its progress includes the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, as well as ongoing development of the XRP Ledger ecosystem. This divergence highlights why Ripple is seen as an emerging leader in digital finance, offering tested solutions that financial institutions can already use. Meanwhile, SWIFT seems to have signaled its intentions rather than delivering practical tools. Community Reaction and Ripple’s Long-Term Vision The XRP community has rallied behind Garlinghouse’s candid response, viewing it as further evidence that Ripple is ahead of the curve. For many, the fact that SWIFT is only now experimenting with blockchain validates Ripple’s early strategy. Looking forward, Garlinghouse has made it clear that Ripple’s ambitions go far beyond payments . By expanding into custody, stablecoins, and XRPL-powered applications, Ripple is building a comprehensive digital finance infrastructure. With its long track record, established partnerships, and proven technology, Ripple is positioning itself not only to compete with SWIFT but to redefine the future of global finance.

Ether could now rally to a new all-time high amid growing whale demand for the cryptocurrency. Ether whales continue to accumulate ETH tokens Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is trading above $4,400 per coin after adding 2.5% to its value in the last 24 hours. The coin briefly reached the $4,500 mark a few hours ago but has since declined slightly to trade at $4,484. The positive performance comes as whales have increased their buying pressure in recent weeks, following Ether’s dip in price. Data obtained from CryptoQuant revealed that since September 18, whales (investors with a balance of 10K-100K ETH) have increased their collective holdings by 840k ETH. The whales continue to buy even during the dip, boosting confidence in Ether’s price discovery over the last two weeks. Additionally, accumulation addresses (wallets with no selling activity) added a record 5.6 million ETH to their balances in September. This implies that accumulation addresses have set a new monthly buying record for the third consecutive month despite Ether’s poor performance in recent weeks. Finally, institutional demand for Ether has returned following weeks of outflow. From Monday to Wednesday, US spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded net inflows of about $755.2 million. On the derivatives side, Ether’s Open Interest (OI) remains poor despite the price improvement over the past seven days. However, traders are becoming more active in the market, with a 280K ETH jump in the metric recorded on Thursday. Ether eyes a new all-time high after breaking the $4,500 resistance The ETH/USD 4-hour chart has switched bullish after Ether added 13% to its value over the last seven days. The coin recorded $129.9 million in futures liquidations over the past 24 hours, with short traders experiencing heavy losses. The short liquidations were a result of Ether crossing above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). By breaking above the $4,500 resistance level, Ether is setting up for further gains and could rally towards an all-time high. However, Ether must overcome the $4,835 resistance level before it can top the $5k psychological mark for the first time in its history. The MACD lines are above the neutral zone, suggesting a bullish run. The RSI of 74 also shows that ETH could enter the overbought region if the bullish trend continues. Ether’s momentum indicators need to remain bullish to allow it to rally to a new all-time high above $4,900. However, failure to top the $4,835 resistance level in the near term could see Ether retest the support and TLQ level created at $4,117. This support level will likely hold in the near term, unless the broader market switches bearish.

The initiative is part of Bitget’s partnership with UNICEF’s Game Changers Coalition and reflects CEO Gracy Chen’s ongoing commitment to using blockchain as a force for education, empowerment, and opportunity. For Gracy, who has become one of the most visible female leaders in the crypto industry, recently being nominated as one of the Top 50 Women in Web3 & AI , the hackathon is not just a platform for creativity but also a gateway for young people, especially girls in emerging economies, to gain access to Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) skills. In her view, blockchain and Web3 can become tools to break cycles of poverty by equipping youth with pathways into entrepreneurship, innovation, and financial independence. “Introducing children to digital skills at an early age is important to accelerate the growth of emerging tech and finance. Too often, access to tech education starts too late and excludes those with the most potential. Emerging technologies such as blockchain offer the tools needed for youth to become entrepreneurs, builders, and innovators on a global scale. We plan to tap into this potential and make the digital space more inclusive and empowering for the next generation of women leaders,” said Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget. As a strategic partner of the UNICEF Game Changers Coalition led by UNICEF Office of Innovation, Bitget Academy, the educational arm of Bitget, will help develop UNICEF’s first interactive, online and in-person blockchain training module based on video game creation skills development. Support from Bitget will help reach 300,000 people – including adolescent girls, parents, mentors, and teachers with blockchain skills across eight countries. This new chapter extends beyond education. Bitget has debuted its Lady Forward campaign, expanding into university partnerships, new internship programs, and the launch of a Female Leaders Program to connect women across the blockchain ecosystem, from developers and investors to entrepreneurs and policymakers. Gracy’s advocacy is reinforced through her role as a guest professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). There, she teaches a blockchain course designed for finance and mathematics students, blending academic rigor with case studies, real-world applications, and guest insights from top industry leaders. The classroom, blending the case method from Harvard Business School, pitching sessions, and guests’ discussions, becomes a platform for equipping the next generation with the skills to lead in a digital-first economy. As Blockchain4Her enters its “Lady Forward” era, Bitget is putting inclusion into practice through its collaboration with UNICEF. The collaboration with UNICEF builds on Bitget’s broader commitment to connect blockchain and Web3 technologies with initiatives that drive meaningful change that expands digital access, encourages creative learning, and equips young people in developing regions with the tools to thrive in the future global economy.

Analysts are tracking the asset closely, with current price movement signaling a potential breakout. Attention is on the $3.13 to $3.15 zone, which is viewed as a key area for a shift in momentum. Meanwhile, trading volume remains high, sitting at just under $7 billion. This supports growing market interest as XRP approaches a critical point. Chart Shows Breakout Zone Nearing Technical analyst Ali Martinez shared a 12-hour chart of XRP showing a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern is typically linked to consolidation before a strong move. XRP is now pushing toward the triangle’s upper boundary. $XRP looks set to break out of a triangle, with $3.60 as the target. pic.twitter.com/ldP7rMCCn4 — Ali (@ali_charts) October 2, 2025 Fibonacci levels were drawn from a recent high to low, placing the 0.618 level at $3.13. This aligns with trendline resistance and is being watched as a breakout confirmation level. If the asset holds above that zone, projected moves target $3.25, $3.40, and $3.6. Notably, the chart also outlines a possible pullback-and-retest structure before reaching higher levels. However, if the move fails, support sits lower around $2.85 and $2.71. A drop below that range would challenge the bullish case. Long-Term Setup Targets $4.804 Javon Marks shared a broader chart showing an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which has already broken above its neckline and has since retested it as support. XRP has moved higher from that area, signaling a possible continuation. The chart points to a target at $4.8, based on the height of the pattern projected from the breakout level. According to the post, “Prices could be early in a major run to meet it.” The structure remains active as long as the asset holds above the neckline. Source: Javon Marks/X Weekly Signals Show Strength Building Another chart from Dark Defender highlights XRP’s move above a long-term trendline and a breakout on the weekly RSI. The pattern shared suggests the start of a new wave, following what appears to be a completed correction. Targets are listed at $4.17, $6, and $10. These are based on Fibonacci extension levels.

52600689,https://invezz.com/?p=2909568,1759475484,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Solana price prediction: here’s why SOL is set to soar soon,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/03/solana-price-prediction-heres-why-sol-is-set-to-soar-soon/,"Solana price has been in a strong bull run this year and is now hovering near its highest level in 2025. SOL was trading at $230, down slightly from $253, which it hit in September. This article explores the top reasons why the Solana coin has more upside in the coming months. Solana price to benefit from SOL ETF approvals The first main catalyst is that Solana price will benefit from the potential approval of spot SOL ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This approval will likely happen as soon as next week, when the earliest window opens. The deadline of the Grayscale conversion is on October 11, while the others will be on the following week. Polymarket data shows that the odds that the agency will approve these ETFs have jumped to over 90%. The question now is whether spot Solana ETFs will have robust demand from investors. JPMorgan analysts predict that the approval will lead to over $6 billion in inflows in the first year. One measure on whether the funds will have demand is to consider the performance of the REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) , which has accumulated over $382 million in assets in the past few months. This ETF is even better than the funds that will be approved later this month because it offers a monthly staking return. Data compiled by StakingRewards shows that Solana has a staking return of about 7%. As such, this return will offset the 0.75% expense ratio. Solana Alpenglow upgrade is coming The other important catalyst that will boost the SOL price is that the developers will launch the Alpenglow upgrade testnet later this year ahead of the mainnet launch in 2025. The Alpenglow upgrade introduces new important features to the network. One of the most important ones is the boost in throughput, which will make it much faster than other comparable chains. For example, a recent testing showed that Solana was able to handle 107,000 transactions per second (TPS), up from the current 65,000. That speed will be much faster than other companies like Visa and Nasdaq. Solana will also replace the current Tower BFT consensus with the Votor consensus, which will have about 100 milliseconds finality. It is common for cryptocurrencies to jump ahead of a major network upgrade. SOL treasury strategy The other notable catalyst for the Solana price is that more companies are announcing their accumulation strategy. Data shows that there are now over 8.91 million SOL tokens held by these companies. Some of the biggest Solana holders are companies like Sharps Technology, DeFi Development Corp, Upexi, and Sol Strategies . These companies are seeking to replicate the strategy that MicroStrategy applied in its Bitcoin accumulation. The main benefit of their approach is that, unlike Bitcoin, these companies now earn a 7% return annually through the staking yield. SOL price technical analysis Solana price chart | Source: TradingView The daily timeframe chart shows that the Solana price has rebounded in the past few months, moving from a low of $94.95 to a $230. It has formed a broadening wedge pattern, which often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Solana remains above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It has moved above the strong pivot reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where it continues rising, with the next level to watch being the extreme overshoot level of the Murrey Math Lines at $275.

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon introduced the Protecting Americans from Doxing and Political Violence Act (Senate Bill 2850). Cruz, a known Bitcoin advocate, was the only U.S. senator to object to this bill. The recent block follows a recent proposal from Cruz aimed at establishing guidelines for artificial intelligence, especially regarding how businesses develop and launch new products. The bill would mandate the establishment of a federally managed AI testing environment, to which firms would apply for entry through the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Several lawmakers, including Cruz, are worried that excessive regulation may cause the U.S. to fall behind China in AI innovation. The proposed sandbox would enable firms to highlight burdensome rules and request exceptions. Cruz blocks privacy bills and raises concerns about police work Data brokers collect details like a person’s home address, contacts, and bank account information to sell them to the highest bidder or anyone willing to pay. The information can also become personal, including details about their children, such as the school they attend or the daily routes they take. Members of the crypto community have also been targeted for abductions. According to a database managed by Bitcoiner Jameson Lopp, there have been over 50 attacks on people or families holding crypto in 2025 alone. Those who support the bill in the Senate said this information is too dangerous to be sold because criminals, stalkers, or violent individuals could find and harm the target person. However, Cruz raised strong objections. According to him, the bill could also pose serious problems for law enforcement officers who need to access a wide range of information in the course of their duties. He said children and families could be in more danger if the bill were to become law in its current state because it could prevent police from tracking down convicted criminals. Cruz told other senators that they should not see his stance as an opposition to privacy because he is “interested in expanding the protection to as wide a universe as is feasible, as is practicable.” However, he feels that the bill’s current version is not yet ready and requires further refinement to strike a balance between protecting people from illegal data sales and providing law enforcement with the necessary tools to keep communities safe. Cruz also stopped a second and smaller bill that Wyden introduced immediately afterward. The Senate Bill 2851 was written to stop data brokers from selling the personal information of lawmakers, their families, their staff, and also survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. Wyden said these groups deserved protection immediately because they faced higher risks of harassment and violent attacks, but Cruz still rejected the bill. According to him, it still failed to address the larger problem of balancing privacy and the needs of law enforcement. Wyden pushes for stronger rules to protect Americans from data brokers Senator Ron Wyden spoke at length about why his bill is so important and used the killing of former Minnesota Representative Melissa Hortman as an example. Investigators believe her attacker purchased information from a data broker and used it to locate her home. Wyden said the Senate has a responsibility to stop this event from happening again. Wyden also pointed to the 50+ kidnappings and home invasions against individuals connected to crypto in 2025 alone. Most of the attackers found their victims by purchasing their personal information from data brokers. He said that criminals not only target wealthy businesspeople or politicians, but also ordinary citizens whose information has been sold. Privacy experts argue that criminals will always be able to buy what they need without strong laws to prevent them. The Protecting Americans from Doxing and Political Violence Act states that data brokers would no longer be allowed to sell or publish personal information. It also gives people the power to demand that their information be removed from websites or businesses within 72 hours and take legal action against any company that fails to comply.

Validators and builders have officially adopted a new minimum gas price of 0.05 Gwei. That means users can now process transactions at just $0.005 each. This shift positions BNB Smart Chain (BSC) as one of the most cost-efficient blockchains in crypto today. It is not just a technical tweak, it’s a fundamental change that will impact users, builders, and the entire ecosystem. Why the Gas Fee Cut Matters At 0.05 Gwei, BNB Chain unlocks cheaper and faster activity across its network. Users benefit immediately. Everyday transfers and trading on BNB Chain now cost next to nothing. That opens the door for more frequent transactions without worrying about fees eating into profits. Builders gain new freedom. Developers launching decentralized apps can scale without the cost barrier. From gaming to DeFi, the fee slash makes experimentation and growth far more accessible. The network grows stronger. Lower costs make BNB Chain more competitive against rivals like Ethereum and Solana. It reinforces its position as a leading blockchain ecosystem. The next step is clear: wallets, centralized exchanges (CEXs), and trading platforms must adopt the 0.05 Gwei standard to align with the network. Doing so ensures smooth onboarding and keeps BNB Chain the most attractive home for on-chain activity. BNB Chain confirms the update Today, all BNB Smart Chain (BSC) validators and builders have adopted the new minimum gas price of 0.05 Gwei and BSC is fully ready to accept transactions at this rate. That’s ~$0.005 per transaction, making BSC one of the most cost-efficient blockchains in crypto. What this… https://t.co/qEAHIUHVRI pic.twitter.com/56g86yHgWN — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 1, 2025 Binance Scale Powers the Ecosystem Behind the fee slash is a network supported by Binance’s massive scale. In Q3 alone, Binance recorded $14.8B in net inflows. To put that in perspective, the next 10 biggest exchanges combined brought in only $94M. That’s 158x smaller, a clear sign of where new capital is choosing to flow. Today, Binance supports over 290M users worldwide. Since launch, traders have exchanged more than $125T in assets on the platform, more than the total global GDP in 2025. Liquidity is another edge. With $31B in USDT and USDC reserves, Binance represents 59% of all stablecoin reserves on centralized exchanges. For builders and users, that means deep markets and fast settlement. Compliance and Security at the Core Leadership also comes from compliance. Binance holds 22 regulatory approvals, more than any other exchange. Over 1,280 professionals, 22% of its workforce, are dedicated to compliance. Add in strict STP rules, continuous monitoring, and globally recognized certifications like SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001, and it’s clear why both retail and institutions trust the platform. Security matches that standard. The exchange maintains a $1B+ SAFU fund to protect users. Real-time monitoring has stopped more than $10B in attempted fraud losses. Since inception, more than 7.5M users have been protected, and $230M in stolen assets have been frozen or recovered in collaboration with law enforcement. Innovation and Growth Programs Binance’s innovation engine continues to drive growth. Its Alpha program has listed 152 early-stage projects. Nearly half advanced to futures listings, while 15% made it to spot markets. Since March, Alpha averages $3.8B in daily trading volume with 1.2M unique users. Beyond listings, Binance has distributed $6.7B across 100+ airdrops, fueling community engagement. Wallet adoption is also expanding. More than 20M wallet users now enjoy integrated DeFi access directly from Binance. Crypto voices are already praising the move In Q3 alone, @binance recorded $14.8B in net inflows, while the next 10 biggest exchanges combined managed just $94M. That is about 158x smaller and highlights how strongly new capital continues to choose Binance. Scale is one of the biggest drivers. Today more than 290M users… pic.twitter.com/cBdIcw6KEI — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) October 2, 2025 Liquidity, Access, and User Rewards Binance supports 500+ coins and 1,500 trading pairs, all backed by one of the fastest engines in crypto. Its system can process 1.4M orders per second, ensuring smooth execution even in volatile markets. For users, that translates to real rewards. Binance Earn has paid out $5B in passive income. Binance Pay has processed $230B across 300M transactions, becoming a go-to payment gateway for crypto. And for $BNB holders, the perks keep stacking. From January 2024 to September 2025, simply holding 1 $BNB earned over $200 in rewards. These came through Launchpool, HODLer Airdrops, MegaDrop, and staking. That’s tangible value in addition to the broader growth of the BNB ecosystem. The 0.05 Gwei gas price cut is more than a technical update, it’s a statement. Users now enjoy faster and cheaper trading. Builders have room to innovate at scale. Binance and BNB Chain strengthen their position as the global benchmark for what an exchange and blockchain can deliver. The numbers confirm it. Binance leads in inflows, adoption, liquidity, compliance, security, and innovation. With gas fees now slashed, BNB Chain adds another reason for users and builders to stay. BNB is not just participating in the blockchain race, it’s setting the pace. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

But the market is also alive with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hype, whose Phase 6 presale has already surpassed 55% sold out, marking enormous demand before the forthcoming phase, which includes a cost increase. Compared to meme coins, Mutuum Finance has real utility through its twin lending ecosystem and is therefore a high-conviction option between retail and whale investors. With over 16,710 owners and $16.7 million raised in funds, the rapid sell-out is creating some desperation since early access before Phase 7 may mean some of the quickest-growing DeFi exposure in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Struggles with Key Support While Bulls Set Sights on Critical Resistance Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades at $0.00001182, right above a solid support point of an uptrend line at $0.00001180 and with bearish resistance nearby $0.00001360. For the bullish momentum to gain traction, SHIB needs to reclaim the 50-day and 100-day EMAs ($0.00001264–$0.00001286); breaking here could pave the way for $0.00001472. On the downside, a decline below $0.00001180 risks a test of lower levels in the region of $0.00001100. While the Parabolic SAR is currently showing a bear bias, a break through the EMA cluster could shortly turn sentiment bullish once again. Amidst such technicals, most investors are also seeking future projects with high utility and early-stage growth potential, where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining much interest. Dogecoin Catches Important Support In The Midst Of ETF Flows Dogecoin (DOGE) fell back recently with the rest of the market, testing an important support level on its daily chart that also aligns with the 100-day EMA and a historically significant Murrey Math Lines level. This area has already triggered double-digit bounces before, including June’s 100% bounce and September’s 50% rally, signaling that the bulls’ configuration still remains in play. More than $20 million of inflows have entered the Rex-Osprey DOJE ETF since inception, now signified by analysts as a key catalyst, with mainstream DOGE ETFs arriving in October potentially driving even stronger momentum. Technical charting, like a potential cup-and-handle development, indicates the goal at $1, a 338% increase, if DOGE can maintain above its trendline. Though the outlook for DOGE is alluring, others are more eager to go after ventures with more asymmetric positive aspects, looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as it rapidly gains pace and sells out its presale cycles ahead of schedule. Mutuum Finance Presale Smashes Records Mutuum Finance leads the way in decentralized finance with its presale, having gained over 16,710 investors and raised over $16.7 million to date. Already 55% subscribed at Phase 6, MUTM tokens cost $0.035 apiece. As an appreciation to early supporters, the team has dropped a $100,000 giveaway hoping to reward 10 winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens per winner. Committed to extending the frontiers of DeFi, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles to ensure secure settlement, exchange, and lending of USD-backed tokens against actively traded assets like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The company employs robust and accurate price data using fallback oracle safeguards, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages to ensure precision in all instances even in the instance of extraordinary market volatility. Committed to creating a safe and privacy-focused financial world, Mutuum Finance is introducing a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that depeg during bear markets, the new token is non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and designed to maintain price stability even during volatile markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Soars as Best DeFi Choice Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the limelight in early October 2025. Phase 6 presale is 55% sold out at $0.035 with 16,710+ holders and $16.7M raised. Its dual lending DeFi platform, stablecoin plans, and $100K giveaway position it as a high-upside alternative to SHIB and DOGE.

Dogecoin Coils For Crucial Breakout,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/last-call-before-lift-off-dogecoin-breakout/,"Dogecoin’s daily chart is coiling into a technically clean inflection, according to trader IncomeSharks, who posted a rising channel and an on-balance volume (OBV) wedge that together map a straightforward route to higher levels. “DOGE – Not a bad setup. Obvious channel and clear OBV wedge. Ideally OBV will break out before price,” the analyst wrote, sharing the chart that frames the current advance. Dogecoin Breakout Watch: $0.33 Trigger On Deck Price has been respecting a well-defined ascending channel that has governed trade since early summer. Multiple touches on both boundaries validate the structure: higher lows along the lower trendline from July through early October, and lower-high rejections against the upper rail through mid-July, late August, and late September. After a fresh rebound off the rising support area at the start of October, DOGE has pushed back into the channel’s mid-range, where it typically pauses before the next impulse. IncomeSharks’ path sketch envisions a brief consolidation or shallow pullback inside the channel, followed by a drive toward the ceiling. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Hit $1? Bullish Patterns and Global Adoption Spark Fresh October The destination is explicit on the chart. The upper boundary currently intersects in the low-to-mid $0.30s, and the drawing marks a breakout attempt between roughly $0.32 and $0.33. That zone represents confluence: it’s where the rising channel’s resistance comes into play and where late-September supply capped the prior thrust. A decisive daily close through that band would confirm a bullish channel breakout and leave the door open for a run towards the early December 2024 high at $0.4843. Volume dynamics are the tell to watch. The lower panel plots OBV, a cumulative measure of buy/sell pressure, compressed into a symmetrical wedge: a gently rising base since mid-July and a descending lid drawn off the July and September OBV peaks. This kind of narrowing range in OBV often precedes a directional expansion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Could Happen ‘In A Hurry,’ Analyst Warns IncomeSharks’ comment underscores that sequencing: an OBV breakout ahead of price would signal fresh accumulation and improve the odds that price follows with a push to the channel’s top. Conversely, failure of OBV at its wedge support would warn that the rebound lacks sponsorship, increasing the risk of another test of the lower channel line. Structurally, the setup is straightforward. As long as DOGE continues to hold the rising support that has defined the trend since July, the path of least resistance remains up within the channel. A clean OBV break of its wedge would strengthen that view. If bulls can then clear overhead supply and convert the $0.32–$0.33 band into support, the chart would confirm the breakout roadmap IncomeSharks outlined. If instead price loses the ascending base, the channel thesis would be invalidated and the market would likely revisit prior higher-low areas along the lower rail before attempting another trend leg. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.2559.

The surge follows an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls that adds to a growing list of signals that the Fed may begin easing monetary policy sooner than expected. Official jobs data paused on Thursday due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Traders have leaned heavily on the weak ADP report, which showed a 32,000 job decline in September against expectations for a 50,000 gain. As the government shutdown halts official labor data, it leads to increased bets on rate cuts. The CME FedWatch tool shows there’s a 97.8% chance the Fed may cut interest rates by another 25 bps at the October 29 Fed meeting. The central bank also expects another rate cut before year-end during the December 10 Fed meeting. “Markets appear to have responded with relative stability in the first 24 hours following the U.S. government shutdown. It’s worth noting that during the last major shutdown in 2018-2019, which lasted 35 days, markets remained largely resilient, and we may see similar dynamics this time.” -Philipp Zentner, CEO and Founder of LIFI Protocol As the shutdown drags on and economic signals decline, investors appear to be turning to alternative assets, such as gold and cryptocurrencies like BNB. XYO co-founder Markus Levin argued that the market is entering one of Bitcoin’s historically most dynamic months and that traders should be prepared for volatility. BNB Chain reduces its gas fees Today, all BNB Smart Chain (BSC) validators and builders have adopted the new minimum gas price of 0.05 Gwei and BSC is fully ready to accept transactions at this rate. That’s ~$0.005 per transaction, making BSC one of the most cost-efficient blockchains in crypto. What this… https://t.co/qEAHIUHVRI pic.twitter.com/56g86yHgWN — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 1, 2025 BNB’s outperformance of the wider market was also fueled by token-specific catalysts. The asset reduced its minimum gas fees earlier this week from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei, making the network one of the cheapest among other blockchains. The proposal follows previous decisions in April 2024 to reduce the gas price from 3 Gwei to 1 Gwei, and again in May 2025 to lower it to 0.1 Gwei. Validators on the proposal also reduced block intervals from 750 milliseconds to 450 milliseconds. The validators are now proposing that gas fees should be reduced to ~$0.005 per transaction to make the virtual asset more competitive with chains like Solana and Base. BNB Chain validators also stated that APY remained stable above 0.5%, supported by higher trading activity and the digital asset’s price growth. They noted that trading is currently the dominant activity on BNB Chain – and gas fees matter most for traders. Validators proposed that the asset strive to have the lowest gas fees possible, as long as the staking APY remains above 0.5%. They stated that the initiative strikes a balance between network growth and validator rewards, ensuring long-term sustainability. The validators revealed that their goal is for gas fees to drop to $0.001 per transaction, representing a more than 90% reduction from past levels and aligning with the most competitive chains. The digital asset’s activity is dominated by trading-related transactions, surging from 20% at the start of 2025 to 67% by June. Kazakhstan’s state-backed Alem Crypto Fund also named BNB as its first investment asset. Kazakhstan’s government website revealed that it established the crypto reserve in partnership with Binance. The country did not specify the amount of BNB purchased to seed the fund and didn’t provide further details about potential other digital asset investments. The Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development established the Alem Crypto Fund, while the Qazaqstan Venture Group, under the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), manages the reserve.

BNB Surpasses $1,100, Hits All-Time High The token gained 7.27% in the last 24 hours to trade at $1,108.17. This rise is attributed to BNB's strong use cases within the ecosystem and growing investor interest. This market volatility also impacted futures. According to Coinglass data, a total of $396 million worth of positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Of this, $268 million came from short positions and $127 million from long positions. This suggests that investors who leveraged their positions to counter sudden price fluctuations in the market experienced significant losses. BNB is used in a variety of ways within the Binance ecosystem, from trading fee discounts to staking and Launchpad participation. This new high for the token has bolstered optimism for the overall market, while also prompting calls among crypto investors to be wary of volatility. Experts say this rise in BNB is linked to signals of a general market recovery. However, high liquidation volumes suggest that sharp price fluctuations may continue. *This is not investment advice.

This is slightly lower than today's Wall Street and analyst consensus of strong buy. Future upside could come from macro demand for digital payment solutions and the increasing role of stablecoin. The company has proven itself so far to grow cash flow and generate profits while reducing long-term debt to $0. Though it is not a dividend payer, the company does reinvest into share buybacks. The risk of recession and its impact on payment volumes has been discussed. The Stock: A Global Name in Fintech And Payments On the heels of having gone to an AI-related conference recently, and planning to attend an innovation summit featuring fintech startups and topics in a few weeks, I think a sector to talk about today is fintech, and for this article I picked Payoneer ( PAYO ), a NYC-based fintech firm offering a ""payment infrastructure platform."" In my last coverage of this stock last December, I had a neutral view, and afterwards the share price did see a gain for a while, before diving downward again, as you can see in the chart below: PAYO - price since last rating (Seeking Alpha) What I initially liked about the firm was positive macro forecasts for payment gateway providers, as well as the company's lack of long-term debt at the time. Payoneer had some news this summer, as reported in PRnewswire , announcing a ""strategic partnership with programmable financial services company Stripe. The collaboration marks an expansion of Payoneer's Online Checkout offering for cross-border merchants looking to sell direct-to-consumer."" Although Payoneer has a portfolio of various solutions, one of them to use as an example is a way for freelance professionals to get paid by clients digitally: PAYO - freelance payment solutions (company website) My goal with today's article was to take a closer look at the fintech and payments sector, and the company's own metrics, as well as some peers, to determine whether my prior hold rating should be modified. The Thesis: Not Too Late To Bet On The Digital Payments Revolution Based on my research today, I'm calling this stock a buy, which is actually an upgrade from my prior hold rating, and this worksheet below summarizes what factors drove that score: PAYO - rating worksheet (author) My shortened thesis today is that this stock is uniquely positioned to serve macro-level demand for digital payment options expected to grow, with top-line growth indicators and an attractive balance sheet profile and strong upside forecasts. However, what kept it from being a strong buy is that its profit margins have been trailing some key peers, it is not a dividend payer, and we should consider competition from large payment names like PayPal. The Sector: Macro Trends Like AI, Digital, And Stablecoin Are Already Familiar to Payoneer Payoneer is an interesting case because it forges two sectors that I have quite some experience in, technology and financial, and the niche it falls into is transaction and payment processing services. In fact, some years before I began writing for Seeking Alpha, I was actually an IT analyst/contractor at financial firm Charles Schwab ( SCHW ), and since then I increasingly have been following both financials and tech. Some key peer comparables in this space I selected include: Block ( XYZ ) which is the parent behind Square and CashApp, PayPal ( PYPL ), and Western Union ( WU ), all of which deal in various payment transaction solutions. I'll use these comparables in a few sections of this article. The reality that this sector has had to adapt to is increasing trends towards digital and mobile payments. Data site Statista has said in July, for example, that: In a survey conducted between April 2024 and March 2025, some 17 percent of respondents in the United States stated that they had paid with their smartphone for everyday purchases in the past 12 months. Further, there is the increasing role played by Bitcoin and stablecoin payments in this industry. Speaking personally to fintech industry expert Roy Sheinfeld, the founder of Breez Technology , whose SDK (software development kit) allows developers to integrate self-custodial Lightning Network payments into their apps and services, here is some commentary he shared with me: In payments, the near-term shift is toward stablecoins, which already make cross-border commerce faster and cheaper on dollar-denominated rails. Longer term, Bitcoin could be even more disruptive, but that vision will take time. For companies like Payoneer, supporting stablecoin flows today while keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s trajectory is key to staying competitive. I think the few points I raised above point to a sector that could increasingly have to adapt to not just digital payments but also non-traditional currency, such as stablecoin or Bitcoin, so from an investor perspective, I think it could drive upside for those fintech brands who have already gotten ahead of that trend. For instance, fintech giant PayPal seems to have jumped on this new reality. Back in April, CNBC reported that ""PayPal launched PYUSD in 2023, making it the first major financial institution to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin,"" adding that they are also trying to entice customers as ""customers will earn an annual rewards rate of 3.7% beginning this summer. It will be paid in the PayPal USD stablecoin (PYUSD-USD) on their holdings of the same token."" Well, I went and tested it out, symbolically buying my first $1 in PayPal stablecoin, and sure enough, they do send those rewards regularly, and while this article is not meant to promote that as a payment method, it is a sign that the big players in this space are increasingly offering additional options and payment methods. The good news, for now at least, is that Payoneer is also looking to jump on this stablecoin bandwagon, and the fact that they are at least exploring it should add some upside potential to this stock. For instance, industry site Payments Dive reported last June that Payoneer CFO Bea Ordonez had some remarks on this topic: The company sees stablecoins as 'complementary' to its core business at the moment, Ordonez said, with some interest from its customers, but there are still some challenges left to solve in the space, particularly regarding the infrastructure necessary to utilize such assets as a payment rail at scale. In addition to payment trends, the fintech space could see upside from the increased role of artificial intelligence/AI. In its Top Fintech Trends For H2 2025, global consultancy KPMG said the following: There is expected to be significant growth in interest as it relates to the development and use of AI agents — particularly in areas like financial crime and fraud, operational processing, frontline enablement and regtech. Notable on that front is that Payoneer has already recognized that macro trend and is part of it, saying on its official company website: Payoneer is already using AI across a range of functions, including forecasting and modelling to identify new business areas for development. We also use AI to combat fraud, making every transaction more secure for our users, while at the same time improving our customer service to enhance the user experience. So, I think there is cause to be bullish on this sector as it seems to be one with the times and not just adapting but also leading the way towards how many people globally could be paying for goods and services in the future. Revenue Growth: Impressive Q2 Results Along With Positive Guidance For 2025 Now that we have some sense of trends in this sector, let's talk about what company-specific factors could impact top-line growth at Payoneer. After Q2 results announced in early August showed strong momentum and a +16% YoY revenue growth, the company had a positive forward view, saying, ""with a strong market position, differentiated assets, and a clear focus, we are confident in our strategy and are reinstating our 2025 guidance."" That should add some upside confidence to investors concerned about where the firm may be going. In addition, investors could see continued support of the share price, with the firm saying in Q2 commentary (pg 2) that ""we’re confident in our long-term opportunity and are announcing an increase to our share repurchase authorization to $300 million."" Besides potential for future revenue growth, I am also looking for a proven model of past revenue growth and, preferably, a diversification across global regions since this company is in the same sector as major peers like PayPal, which has long been global. We can see from Payoneer's Q2 presentation (p. 13) , that that is just the case with this company, a proven 3 year revenue CAGR across multiple regions of the world, but particularly notable has been Latin America (+31% CAGR). PAYO - rev growth by region (company presentation) Further, in this peer comparison below, Payoneer has an expected forward revenue growth of +10.5%, the best in this group, even beating PayPal: PAYO - rev growth v peers (Seeking Alpha) On a more granular level, a segment where Payoneer has proven itself as a strong revenue grower has been B2B (business to business), as we see in the table from the investor presentation (p. 24) , with the company boasting of +37% YoY growth in the B2B segment, or businesses paying each other: PAYO - b2b growth (investor presentation) I believe the multiple factors above are complementary to the macro factors discussed earlier, and the trend towards digital payments, so for these reasons I am bullish when it comes to revenue growth potential as well. Profit margins: Key Peers Beat On Margins, As OpEx Points To Rising Business Expenses Looking past top-line revenue, let's consider the topic of profit margins, especially since earnings numbers can influence investor decisions so much. This is where the rosy revenue story in the prior section becomes slightly less rosy. For instance, using a metric like the EBITDA margin to get a sense of the core business without use of depreciation, it is at only +15% yet the sector avg. is nearly +22%. Further, the net income margin is a mere +9.8%, while the sector avg is above +23%. On a more granular level, comparable data shows several peers are beating Payoneer on profit margins, causing some downside risk to this stock I think: PAYO - margins vs peers (Seeking Alpha) In addition, although the company has proven it can be profitable, its adjusted EBITDA margin has generally been on a downward trend, as the i nvestor presentation (p 23) shows: PAYO - adj ebitda margin trend (investor presentation) Although the company did not mention any specific drivers impacting this margin trend, what we can see from the income statement data on Seeking Alpha is that operating expenses (other, total) have been continually climbing from Dec. 2019 through the year ending Dec. 2024, pointing to a trend of a business that is increasingly costly to run: PAYO - opex trend (Seeking Alpha) For the reasons covered above, I am inclined to be in the neutral/hold range when it comes to this category, as I think margins can certainly impact earnings growth in comparison to similar peers. Cash Flow Trends: A Proven Cash Flow Grower, Reinvesting In Shares Rather Than Dividends We've talked about profits and margins, but another fundamental business metric is cash flow, so here we touch on some cashflow trends. For one thing, unlike many of the stocks I cover, this is not a dividend payer so that is one less cash obligation that the firm has to dish out, but also is not a great stock for those building a dividend income portfolio. So, if you are still reading, I assume you care about this stock for potential capital gains and not dividends, so along those lines I mentioned earlier that stock repurchases by the company can help support the share price. In fact, the company reported in Q2 commentary (pg 2) that they ""accelerated share repurchases to $33 million at a weighted average price of $6.80, nearly double the amount repurchased in the prior quarter."" An indicator of the cash flow from core business operations, the operating cash flow , has shown signs of growth so far, with data showing +22% YoY growth vs the sector avg at just +12%. I think this shows signs that Payoneer is a proven cash flow grower, which could help support further share repurchases and reinvestment in the company and growth via its innovation pipeline, rather than dividend payments. In fact, the company investor presentation (p 18) shows this trend nicely over the last few years: PAYO - operating cashflow growth (investor presentation) So, while the firm loses some points for not being a dividend payer, it is only fair to acknowledge the positive cash flow trends, commitment to share repurchases, and reinvestment in its business. For these reasons, I am in the low buy range when it comes to the category of cashflow trends. Balance Sheet: No Long Term Debt Adds Strength To the Risk Profile We have talked a lot about elements of the income and cash flow statements, but another fundamental area is the balance sheet and some risk elements to consider. On a positive note, when comparing debt-to-equity vs similar peers I selected in this sector, Payoneer has a D/E of just 0.05, the lowest in this peer group, and painting a picture of a low debt risk in relation to equity: Data by YCharts While that adds some strength to the upside story, as the firm heads towards 2026 in a much better debt position that some companies in this sector. We can see how this looks in its balance sheet , which has not had any long-term debt for a while: PAYO - LT Debt (Seeking Alpha) I did not find any major credit rating agencies covering this stock recently, so that would have been a nice added perspective to mention. I think it is worth being highly bullish in this category as it is a company with no long-term debt yet has a proven positive cash flow growth, so this means less cash will be spent on paying back debt and more can go towards future share buybacks and reinvestment into the company, or future acquisitions that drive company growth. Some readers may take an opposing view, however, saying that lack of corporate debt may be missing opportunities to finance growth. However, I think that makes more sense in environments with much lower interest rates than we've seen in the last few years, thereby waiting for cost of capital to come down. Valuation: A Case of High Fwd P/E and Cheap Share Price At the Same Time Let's take a moment to consider a valuation metric that is relevant to forward-looking investors. The fwd P/E (GAAP-based) is 25.69, which is around 82% higher than the sector average. The non-GAAP P/E is not too much different. At the same time, the fwd P/B is at 2.70, vs the sector average of 1.70. At first glance, this points to significant overvaluation on this stock, which could indicate a highly optimistic market view on Payoneer's future earnings. Interestingly, however, despite those metrics showing overvaluation, the price chart I pulled below shows the stock trading significantly below its 200-day SMA for a while now: Data by YCharts In addition, consensus estimates call for a -24% YoY EPS decline this year, but followed by a recovery in FY26 of +17.6%, and further growth of +23% in FY27. Because the fwd P/E can rise significantly if the earnings estimate falls (which causes a lower denominator in that ratio) then it seems that could be the case here, with the consensus having a negative EPS growth projection for this year. If one were to take the long-term view, though, this is an opportunity to buy a stock trading well below its average, which will see significant EPS growth in FY26 and FY27, if those forecasts come true. Because of declining EBITDA margins, and profit margins trailing some key peers, which I showed earlier, I am leaning in the neutral camp in this case. Future Price Target: A Future +31% Upside Expected Further To determine a future price target, and potential upside to the share price, I created the following table: PAYO - price targets (author) In this worksheet above, I determined my future price target is $6.17 (fwd P/E x consensus EPS estimate) which I then averaged with the Wall St consensus target of $9.81, to get an avg. price target of $7.99. This forecasts an upside of +31% vs Wednesday afternoon's share price. If you are curious why I use both my own and the Wall St consensus price targets, it is to present a more fair and balanced picture of price targets. Nevertheless, a forecast calling for 31% upside is certainly worth adding points to the bullish column. Because forecasts do not always come true, though, I want to reiterate that this is only one component of my holistic approach to rating this stock. Challenge To My Rating: Global Recessions Impacting Spending A potential challenge to my bullish call, not mentioned so far, could be something that could impact the volume of payments flowing through payment processors like Payoneer, a business that depends on high volumes of payments, and I think that could be a global recession that impacts both business and consumer spending volume in general. Because forecasts can vary, and could be ever-changing, I would point to some of the most recent forecasts from established sources. The last trading day of September proved to be quite a bullish one, and on the heels of that Reuters published some US recession probabilities from major financial institutions, indicating at most a 40% chance: US recession forecasts (Reuters) It is also worth considering what Deutsche Bank (DB) said a few days ago in a paper, suggesting that ""2025 will not be a year of rapid GDP growth: U.S. growth is forecast at a modest 2.0%, with the Eurozone lagging some way behind (0.9%) and Chinese growth (4.2%) well below recent historical averages."" So, what could mitigate recession risk for Payoneer is that it is indeed a global business, and as we see above, not every region might experience the same economic growth or slowdown. Conclusion: An Innovate, Future-Driven Business Fall is all about learning new things but also about change, and in the wake of learning much lately about AI and fintech, from the point of view of a future-minded analyst, it seems Payoneer is one of those stocks that is worth considering for a portfolio, in particular as the role of stablecoin and bitcoin becomes increasingly commonplace globally, on top of the existing momentum in standard digital payments tied to traditional currencies. As a business, it has proven it can grow cash flow, grow its top line in several global regions, and continue innovating with its recent partnership with Stripe. In conclusion, the case is strong to go long on Payoneer.",PAYO,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-03 07:51:36

Thai SEC To Widen ETF Lineup With New Rules On Wednesday, Thailand’s SEC Secretary-General, Pornanong Budsaratragoon, revealed that the regulatory agency is working to expand its crypto ETF plans beyond Bitcoin and include other digital assets in the coming months. In an interview with Bloomberg, the regulator stated that the SEC and other agencies are drafting new rules to allow local mutual funds and institutions to offer digital asset-based ETFs for the first time, with the rollout expected for early 2026. It’s worth noting that Thai investors can currently gain exposure to these products by investing in funds managed by licensed asset management companies that invest in overseas crypto ETFs. In June 2024, Thailand’s SEC officially approved One Asset Management to launch a fund-to-fund Bitcoin ETF, which allows institutional investors to gain exposure to BTC-based investment products listed overseas. In January, the Secretary-General unveiled that the regulatory agency was evaluating the listing of local spot Bitcoin ETFs to strengthen the country’s digital assets market, affirming the regulator’s intention to permit both individuals and institutions to invest in locally listed Bitcoin ETFs. “We have to adapt and ensure that our investors have more options in crypto assets with proper protection,” she explained at the time. The new rules would go beyond the current limitations and expand the potential ETF lineup to a broader basket of crypto assets. “Our possibility now is to broaden the criteria for the crypto such as a basket of cryptocurrencies,” Pornanong told Bloomberg. “We want to have broader supply of those crypto assets in the ETFs.” Thailand Continues Crypto Hub Efforts The Secretary-General also highlighted investors’ desire to diversify their portfolios and adopt digital assets as part of their investment strategies, especially among young people, noting that the agency’s main task is to “facilitate” that demand under a legal framework. Thai regulators have been accelerating their efforts to become a regional crypto hub, the report stated, developing multiple policies aimed at making tokenized products mainstream investment choices. Earlier this year, the SEC, alongside the Bank of Thailand (BOT), introduced a crypto sandbox in tourist areas to enhance the country’s appeal as a tech-savvy destination, promote innovation, and the use of digital assets to boost the economy and tourism industry. As reported by Bitcoinist, the TouristDigiPay sandbox, launched in August, aims to facilitate the conversion of digital assets into Thai Baht for the spending purposes of foreign visitors, allowing Bitcoin and digital assets as payment methods in tourist areas to drive adoption. Moreover, the regulatory agency has also proposed rule changes to provide crypto exchanges with flexibility while enhancing investor protection and oversight, allowing digital asset platforms to list their utility tokens or tokens issued by affiliated entities. Meanwhile, Thailand’s Deputy Finance Minister, Julapun Amornvivat, shared a plan to drop capital gains tax on digital assets for five years. The minister announced that, starting January 1, 2025, until December 31, 2029, investors who sell their assets through licensed crypto service providers won’t have to pay taxes on the profits.",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto ETF|crypto investment products|Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)|spot crypto ETFs|Thailand Cryptocurrency Regulation|Thailand SEC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 08:00:45

They recently unveiled a new algorithm called mevjrv12. Its key feature is a faster mempool scanning mechanism and more precise transaction processing within the network. Whereas the bot previously reacted to signals with a fraction of a second delay, mevjrv12 cuts this interval by almost half. With the release of the new algorithm, the Mevolaxy system has undergone a series of technical improvements. The bots now find profitable transactions faster and with less competition from other MEV bots. Additionally, an adaptive analysis module was introduced: mevjrv12 uses machine learning models to predict the network’s busiest periods and automatically adjusts the frequency of its operations. These updates have already impacted user earnings. For instance, the average yield for some pools has increased by 0.09–1% compared to the previous month. It is also important to note that the Mevolaxy team announced the launch of mevjrv12 at the TOKEN2049 conference in Singapore, where the project received significant attention from industry representatives and investors.

Prominent crypto analyst Dark Defender has weighed in on the asset’s movements, sharing a chart that shows the asset moving within a defined wave pattern. With the fourth wave now complete and the fifth wave currently underway, this projection suggests the possibility of significant continuation if the outlined structure holds. #XRP in the weekly time frame closed a weekly candle yesterday.

I know everybody is bearish. I… pic.twitter.com/sfPN5Moj54 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) September 30, 2025 XRP Price Targets and Support Levels The analysis establishes clear levels for both potential gains and areas where support might hold. Dark Defender highlighted $3.33 and $3.66 as the next targets for XRP, with the second target sitting just above its all-time high . These figures represent levels where the price may encounter resistance as the wave continues. Should XRP extend beyond these points, the chart also leaves open the possibility of further growth. On the support side, the chart emphasizes $2.7 and $2.64 as zones of interest. The digital asset’s current wave is a corrective one, and the analysis suggests it could drop to $2.645, which aligns with the Fibonacci 50% retracement. Sitting below this level is the 23.6% level of $2.228, providing further reference points in the event of a pullback. However, investors have no reason to panic if the asset’s price falls, as these levels could serve as critical areas where buyers may step in and resume the broader bullish trend.

While XRP sits within a corrective final wave, the chart shows a larger Elliott Wave pattern , with XRP about to begin the third and most powerful wave of the entire cycle. If the asset experiences an explosive move to match this wave, the targets on the chart are $4.17 and $5.85, both aligning with the 261.8% Fibonacci level on different scales. The analysis also stated, “This wave can still extend into double digits,” showing that while shorter-term levels are mapped out, there remains an openness to larger potential moves depending on momentum. Acknowledging the current market climate, the analyst addressed the prevailing sentiment, saying, “I know everybody is bearish. I know the US Government can shut down tomorrow. I know.” Despite this, it’s factual that the technical picture suggests continuation, and he anticipates a bullish move for XRP in the short term.

Traders watch the 58% level for a technical trigger that may spark selective altcoin strength rather than a full-scale altseason. Bitcoin dominance at 58% is a make-or-break technical level that may precede an altcoin rotation. Analysts point to an ascending broadening wedge pattern; repeated support tests increase the probability of a downside resolution. Fundamentals and industry commentary (Token2049, Bitget COO) suggest any altcoin gains may be narrow and narrative-driven, not uniform across the market. Bitcoin dominance 58% testing support — monitor wedge breakdown for altcoin opportunities. Read analysis and next-step trade ideas. (COINOTAG) Bitcoin dominance tests 58 percent support as technical patterns and mixed fundamentals create debate over whether selective altcoins will benefit from a potential breakdown. Bitcoin dominance holds at a fragile 58 percent as chart structure and volume dynamics hint at a possible breakdown that could reallocate market share. While price patterns echo previous altseasons, executives at industry events argue that weak fundamentals limit broad-based rallies. Analyst Moustache highlights an ascending broadening wedge; Token2049 commentary and on-chain metrics show divergent signals. Bitcoin dominance now sits at a critical turning point that could determine whether capital rotates into altcoins. Technical analysis shared by analyst Moustache shows an ascending broadening wedge formed from early 2024 through late 2025, with dominance testing lower support near 58%. That pattern follows a run to nearly 65% dominance before a rounded top and subsequent selling pressure. Traders monitoring BTC dominance note that repeated tests of the lower boundary increase the chance of a downside resolution and a reallocation of market share to select altcoins. Source: Moustache “This ascending broadening wedge pattern ($BTC Dominance) is just waiting to crash to the downside,” Moustache wrote, noting the structure’s resemblance to setups that preceded altcoin strength in 2017 and 2021. A confirmed break below support would project a measured move lower and open windows for altcoin market share gains. What is Bitcoin dominance and why does 58% matter? Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market capitalization. When dominance sits near 58%, it signals a contested market balance where a technical breakdown can rapidly shift capital into altcoins, changing market narratives and risk profiles within days to weeks. How could a wedge breakdown trigger selective altcoin strength? The ascending broadening wedge shows progressively higher peaks and higher troughs, but multiple tests of the lower boundary reduce support reliability. If dominance breaks below 58%, capital historically flows into high-beta assets—primarily altcoins with clear narratives or strong on-chain activity—rather than evenly across the sector. The Wedge Breakdown Risk The wedge spans many months of price action, and the inset diagram used by the analyst mirrors classic technical resolutions where support ultimately gives way. Volume confirmation and decisive daily closes below support would strengthen the breakdown case. If dominance collapses beneath the wedge, technical measured targets suggest a sizable retracement in Bitcoin’s market share. That outcome typically benefits altcoins with robust narratives, liquidity, and recent development milestones rather than those lacking fundamentals. Diverging Market Views Notable industry voices at Token2049, including Bitget COO Vugar Usi Zade, caution that broad altseasons may be unlikely without substantive technological progress. He argued that market rotations are currently more narrative-driven and concentrated in specific sectors. Consequently, while technical patterns point to potential altcoin opportunities, on-chain metrics, developer activity, and adoption data remain critical filters to separate likely winners from weaker projects. Frequently Asked Questions Could a breakdown in Bitcoin dominance cause a full altseason? A confirmed breakdown increases the odds of altcoin strength, but a full altseason requires broad fundamental catalysts. Expect selective, narrative-led rallies instead of uniform gains across all altcoins. What indicators should traders watch around 58% dominance? Watch daily closes, volume spikes, on-chain flows, and stablecoin inflows. Combine technical signals with fundamentals like network activity and developer momentum to identify probable altcoin beneficiaries. Key Takeaways Critical level : Bitcoin dominance at ~58% is a decisive technical threshold. Pattern risk : An ascending broadening wedge increases the likelihood of a downside resolution if support fails. Selective opportunity : Any altcoin gains will likely be narrative-driven and concentrated, not uniformly distributed. Conclusion The market now tests a pivotal Bitcoin dominance level that could reallocate capital into altcoins if the wedge breaks. Traders should combine technical confirmation with fundamental filters to identify the most promising altcoin opportunities. Stay alert to volume, on-chain metrics, and real-world adoption signals as the next moves unfold. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Dominance Tests 58% Support — Wedge Breakdown Could Fuel Select Altcoin Strength"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-80-1.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin dominance tests 58% support; an ascending broadening wedge could break and shift market share to selective altcoins.

Since SOL’s growth rate has slowed, many people are now looking at DeFi platforms that offer organized returns and new ways to make money. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become a strong competitor thanks to its strong pre-sale success and unique lending framework. As investors try to figure out why crypto is down today, they are looking for alternatives that offer security, usefulness, and high upside potential. This makes MUTM a good choice for an instant crypto investment. SOL growth outlook Solana (SOL)’s growth rate is slowing down after a recent burst of optimism, which points to a more careful period ahead. In the past 48 hours, SOL has lost almost 12% of its value, which has caused more than $112 million in leveraged long bets to be closed. This is a strong sign that bulls are losing the upper hand. Networking measures are also getting worse: the number of active addresses and network activity have gone down, and newer platforms are making SOL less dominant. Technically, SOL has had a hard time reclaiming support in the $250 area since it fell below $220, showing that it hasn’t been able to move up very quickly. If buyers don’t come back or stronger catalysts show up, SOL might not make a clear breakout in its next move. Instead, it might go sideways or try lower support levels again. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): DeFi mechanics and risk protections powering growth The price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens in Phase 6 of the presale is currently $0.035, and over 16,750 holders have already bought tokens. The presale has raised roughly $16.73 million. 55% of the 170 million phase supply has already been taken, so getting MUTM at this lower price is very important. Phase 7 will start at $0.040, which is a 15% rise. This is a rare chance for early participants to make money before the next price step. There are 4 billion MUTM in circulation, so now is a very important time for new buyers who want to get in before the value goes up even faster. To serve both conservative and high-risk users, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs dual lending methods. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system lets stable assets like the US dollar make steady returns. For example, a deposit of $12,000 USDC is equal to the same amount of mtUSDC. This earns an expected 14% APY, which is $1,680 a year. At a 70% Loan-to-Value (LTV), borrowers can use SOL as collateral to get $1,400 in cash while keeping the protocol safe. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, on the other hand, separates riskier assets like DOGE or PEPE into their own pools. This makes structured lending possible without putting core liquidity at risk of instability. Collateral and liquidation The collateral and liquidation steps are meant to keep the system and users safe. Overcollateralization is needed for all loans, and a Stability Factor makes sure that the borrowed amount stays safe compared to the collateral. If there isn’t enough collateral, the debt is bought by liquidators at a discount, which keeps the procedure healthy. Lower-volatility assets, such as stablecoins, can handle up to 75% LTV with an 80% liquidation threshold. Volatile tokens, on the other hand, can only handle 35–55% LTV with a A key part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is liquidity control. Enough on-chain liquidity makes sure that liquidations can happen quickly and efficiently, which keeps price loss to a minimum. Dynamic caps and incentive structures allow for a controlled reaction to volatility, keeping the platform solvent while encouraging steady activity. Investors can keep an eye on performance with a sophisticated dashboard that shows holdings and ROI. The Top 50 leaderboard gives bonus MUTM tokens to the top 50 users, which encourages participation and loyalty. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also prioritized security and trust. The platform underwent a comprehensive CertiK audit, achieving a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. To further incentivize safety, a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program is active, with tiered rewards ranging from $200 to $2,000 for vulnerabilities. In parallel, the ongoing $100,000 giveaway selects ten winners to receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens each, enhancing community participation and engagement. Mutuum maintains strong social visibility with over 12K Twitter followers, amplifying investor confidence. Road to $1 Early users of MUTM have already seen huge gains. People who traded BTC, SOL, and ETH for MUTM in Phase 1 when it was worth $0.01 now have tokens worth $0.035, which is 3.5 times their original value. The anticipated exchange listings on Coinbase and MEXC will increase user access, boost trading activity, and improve price discovery. MUTM is expected to hit $0.06 after listing. Users will be able to interact directly with the lending and borrowing protocol and experience DeFi features firsthand when the beta launch comes around. This is expected to increase demand and raise the value of tokens even more. Integrating with Layer-2 solutions will speed up transactions and lower fees, which will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more appealing than its Layer-1 competitors. Since SOL is losing steam, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great option for investors who want to make organized crypto investments that can be measured in terms of their usefulness. Demand for MUTM will continue to rise thanks to its dual lending mechanics, strict risk management, presale supply, and active plan. With more than half of Phase 6 already sold and Phase 7 about to see a 15% price increase, people who want to get MUTM before the price changes need to act quickly. Adding money to crypto ETFs and changes in the market mood are two more reasons why crypto investors are looking at DeFi platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could give them a way to get to $1 in the next six months.

At the same time, Bitcoin regained momentum above $120,000, sparking predictions of even more gains. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards expects a rapid breakout to $150,000, while Bitwise analysts argue that new US retirement fund allocations could drive the price beyond $200,000. Strategy Bitcoin Stash Hits $77 Billion Michael Saylor’s digital asset treasury firm, Strategy, reached a huge milestone. Its Bitcoin holdings hit an all-time high valuation of $77.4 billion . This figure not only surpasses the market cap of several major global banks but also rivals the annual economic output of entire nations. The firm’s rise is thanks to its aggressive accumulation strategy and the broader resurgence of Bitcoin, which recently returned to the $120,000 mark after briefly peaking in mid-August. Saylor pointed out the firm’s humble beginnings, and recalled how Strategy’s journey into Bitcoin started with just $250 million — and even included an immediate $40 million unrealized loss. Fast forward to today, and the company’s holdings of 640,031 BTC represent about 3.2% of the total circulating supply. To put its scale into perspective, its closest corporate competitor , MARA Holdings, holds only 52,477 BTC, which is valued at about $6.3 billion. Strategy alone now accounts for almost half of all Bitcoin held by public and private companies combined. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Over the past seven weeks, Strategy’s treasury grew even further with the addition of 11,085 BTC, including a relatively modest 196 BTC purchase earlier this week. These strategic acquisitions, coupled with Bitcoin’s rebound, pushed the firm’s total valuation close to double what it was in 2024. At its current worth, Strategy’s Bitcoin stash could theoretically purchase 2.57 million cars at $30,000 each or nearly 385,000 homes valued at $200,000 apiece. The sheer scale of Strategy’s holdings prove just how concentrated Bitcoin treasuries have become. Public and private companies collectively hold 1.32 million BTC, which is equal to 6.6% of the total supply, valued around $159 billion. Strategy’s 48% share makes it the dominant force in the sector by a wide margin. Nation-states, by comparison, still lag far behind. El Salvador is one of the most well known governments to embrace Bitcoin, and currently holds 6,338 BTC valued at roughly $762.5 million. While impressive for a small nation, the total barely scratches the surface compared to Strategy’s war chest. On the other hand, the Central American country’s strategy of buying one BTC per day fueled debate over its pace of accumulation, especially as its holdings hover just below their own all-time high. Bitcoin Poised for Quick Breakout? Bitcoin may be on the verge of setting a new all-time high, and some analysts project a surge to $150,000 before the end of 2025 as investor demand for safe-haven assets intensifies. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards believes the recent recovery above the $120,000 level could trigger a rapid breakout, which could push the cryptocurrency toward the milestone in a short span of time. At Token2049 in Singapore, Edwards explained that Bitcoin regained strong momentum after climbing more than 6% in the past week, with its latest move above $118,500 being its highest level since mid-August. BTC price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) While Edwards’ target of $150,000 is bullish, it is still more cautious compared to some other market forecasts. Analysts at Bitwise Asset Management, for example, see the possibility of Bitcoin climbing above $200,000 in the current cycle, fueled by structural changes in the investment landscape. André Dragosch , Bitwise’s head of European research, pointed out that the inclusion of crypto in US 401(k) retirement plans could be transformative. Even a 1% allocation from retirement managers would represent $122 billion in new capital, which could potentially lift Bitcoin well past the $200,000 mark. Edwards also placed emphasis on the influence of Bitcoin’s four-year cycle, which historically aligned with major price surges. He assigned just over a 50% chance that the final three months of 2025 will deliver positive gains, in part due to cyclical market behavior and seasonal investor sentiment. Bitcoin monthly return history (Source: CoinGlass ) Historically, Bitcoin averaged 20% returns in October, 46% in November and modest but positive gains of around 4% in December. Edwards did mention, however, that institutional demand is still the most important driver of the market’s trajectory. This means that a downturn in buying activity could completely shift the outlook. Other analysts are also pointing out certain technical factors that support the bullish case, like an emerging golden cross pattern, often seen as a strong signal for upward momentum. With both institutional flows and chart structures aligning, expectations are building for Bitcoin to potentially reach $150,000 by year-end.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-03 09:00:00

If successful, the deal would rank among the most significant technology infrastructure acquisitions of 2025 amid the rising interest in data centers and artificial intelligence. The negotiations are still ongoing, with a potential agreement to be announced soon. According to Bloomberg, the deal is not guaranteed, as terms could still change or the talks could fall apart. BlackRock expands its AI footprint through GIP Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) has steadily built a strong presence in the data center and AI sector. In 2021, GIP acquired Dallas-based CyrusOne in partnership with KKR & Co. in a $15 billion deal to take CyrusOne private. Acquiring Aligned, at nearly triple its valuation, would expand GIP’s holdings in digital infrastructure and reinforce BlackRock’s position in the growing AI ecosystem. BlackRock, owner of GIP, has been increasing its exposure to U.S. stocks and AI investments. Cryptopolitan covered a story highlighting its $185 billion model-portfolio platform, shifting allocations away from international developed markets. The asset manager rebalanced its entire suite last month, leaving portfolios 2% overweight equities. Key exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded high net inflows in September. The iShares S&P 100 ETF (OEF) recorded $3.4 billion in inflows, its largest in a single-day, while the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) gained $2.3 billion. The iShares U.S. Equity Factor Rotation Active ETF (DYNF) added nearly $2 billion. At the same time, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) experienced a $2.7 billion outflow, with almost $1.4 billion redirected into BlackRock’s AI-focused fund, the iShares AI Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI). BlackRock’s investment shows how U.S. markets offer higher earnings compared to other markets. American companies have delivered 11% growth since late 2024, compared to 2% abroad. BlackRock portfolio managers cited consistent sales growth and momentum in AI as key drivers. Mubadala Investment Co., Abu Dhabi’s wealth fund, is also involved in the negotiations through its newly established AI-focused investment company MGX. Mubadala has previously invested in Aligned and has a strategic partnership with BlackRock. According to the report , MGX would make an independent commitment as part of the transaction. U.S. faces worker shortage crisis in a $6.7 trillion AI data center boom Aligned owns 78 data centers across 50 campuses in the United States and South America, which are designed to deliver scalable and energy-efficient computing performance. Macquarie and other institutional investors have supported its rapid growth. Aligned has also engaged in discussions with policymakers on expanding data center infrastructure to ensure that AI development is supported by sustainable and reliable digital capacity. In January, Aligned raised more than $12 billion in equity and debt commitments from investors, including Macquarie Asset Management. These commitments helped advance its operations amid increased demand for AI-related capacity. Consulting firm McKinsey estimates that investments in AI-related infrastructure could reach $6.7 trillion by 2030, reflecting the scale of capital needed to meet future computing power requirements. However, challenges of labor shortage have been highlighted recently, posing a risk of delaying projects. According to Cryptopolitan’s recent post , big technology companies, including OpenAI, Meta, and Alphabet, face mounting challenges in building billion-dollar AI data centers, as labor shortages threaten to delay projects across the U.S. The National Association of Manufacturers said that the U.S. construction industry will require nearly 500,000 additional workers in 2025, while manufacturing is projected to face a 1.9 million-worker gap by 2033. The Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) said its members already face an 8.5-month backlog on data center projects, with unemployment in the construction sector falling to historic lows.

Avalanche Treasury Firm To Buy $1 Billion Worth Of AVAX According to an official announcement made earlier today, Avalanche Treasury Corp. is set to merge with Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The deal is estimated to be worth over $675 million. The newly created merged firm is expected to get listed on Nasdaq in Q1 2026, under the ticker symbol “AVAT.” After it goes public, the company is expected to buy more than $1 billion worth of AVAX tokens. The business transaction between the two entities includes $460 million worth of treasury assets. Notably, the deal is primarily geared toward establishing a leading public vehicle for exposure to the AVAX token. It is worth highlighting that AVAT will launch with an initial AVAX token purchase at a discount to market price. Additionally, it will have an 18-month priority on Avalanche Foundation sales to US digital asset treasury firms. Specifically, AVAT will offer an attractive entry point of 0.77x multiple of net asset value (mNAV) for investors, a significant discount of 23% compared to purchasing AVAX directly or via passive exchange-traded fund (ETF) alternatives. Commenting on the development, Bart Smith, CEO of AVAT, said: Many institutions have difficulty accessing digital assets or are limited to holding native tokens without yield or ecosystem integration. We created Avalanche Treasury Co. to offer something we believe will be more valuable than passive exposure. This is a public company launching as an active, strategic partner within the Avalanche network, offering a level of integration and alignment that investors have been demanding. Importantly, Emin Gün Sirer, the founder and CEO of Ava Labs, the entity responsible for the development of the Avalanche blockchain, will join AVAT as an advisor. The newly created firm is just the second AVAX-focused treasury firm. The announcement adds that AVAT will work toward deploying capital directly into the Avalanche ecosystem through three strategic pillars – targeted protocol investments, partnerships with enterprises building on-chain rails, and direct support for institutional L1 launches. AVAX Surges Following The Announcement The smart contract network’s native token AVAX witnessed a sharp increase following the announcement. The token reached a high of $31.32 on Binance, before it lost some of its gains. This year has seen a significant increase in the launch of digital treasury firms. While digital treasury firms focused on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been around for a few years, more firms are now shifting focus to other altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and AVAX. For instance, Nasdaq-listed VisionSys AI recently unveiled plans to launch a $2 billion SOL-based digital treasury program. At press time, AVAX trades at $30.17, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours.",Avalanche|Altcoin|avalanche|Avalanche treasury company|avax|blockchain|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|digital asset treasury|Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|AVAX|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 09:00:48

According to market data, the XRP/KRW pair recorded over $184 million in activity, giving it a higher share of daily trading than Bitcoin and Ethereum. This surge highlights the growing influence of XRP in one of the most active cryptocurrency markets. X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a well-followed crypto commentator, posted the update with an image of the ranking. The post emphasized that XRP had overtaken Bitcoin in daily activity, with X Finance Bull stating, “liquidity is flooding in,” pointing to strong demand across Asian markets. JUST IN $XRP just flipped Bitcoin in trading volume on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit. Let that sink in! Liquidity is flooding in. Asia’s demand for XRP is not slowing! Every Ripple move adds fuel. Are you paying attention yet? pic.twitter.com/IUjMDrVVqA — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) October 1, 2025 Growing Liquidity and Market Share The data shows XRP at $2.91 with 9.01% of volume on Upbit, while Bitcoin holds 7.46% and Ethereum 5.70%. With a liquidity score of 696, XRP has maintained a strong position supported by a deep order book. XRP has surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume on Upbit multiple times, and this fear is notable because trading activity on South Korean exchanges often reflects wider investor sentiment in Asia, where high-volume trading pairs linked to the Korean won provide significant insight into adoption trends. In comparison, Bitcoin recorded just over $152 million in trading, giving XRP a clear lead in the rankings. USDT and other tokens also saw substantial activity, but none matched the scale of XRP’s performance during this period. Adoption Outpaces Rivals The achievement highlights the appeal XRP holds in Asian markets , particularly South Korea. The country has long been an active hub for digital assets, with retail investors frequently driving liquidity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s ability to attract such consistent volume demonstrates its growing role as a preferred asset in the region, not only for speculative trading but also for its utility in payments and remittances. Ripple’s payment infrastructure has supported this trend, with its network processing billions in transactions and providing coverage across foreign exchange corridors. The presence of XRP as a central part of that system strengthens its appeal to institutional participants and retail investors. The high volume on Upbit suggests that this adoption may be accelerating as more investors position themselves in anticipation of increased global usage. Potential Global Impact While the surge in South Korea is significant on its own, it also raises questions about how these trends may extend to other regions. XRP has shown strength against Bitcoin in 2025, and if the asset continues to dominate trading activity in Asian markets, the momentum could spread worldwide, particularly as liquidity deepens.

Analysts are highlighting altcoins that can generate repeatable token demand rather than relying on speculative hype. One token that has emerged as the top buy this cycle is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , praised for its combination of lending, borrowing, and staking mechanisms, alongside a structured roadmap designed to scale value efficiently. Investors looking for the next high-upside opportunity are being urged to consider MUTM as BTC and SOL consolidate near current levels. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 at $0.035, with approximately $16.73 million raised in this phase. Roughly 55% of the 170M token allocation has already been sold, and the project has over 16,750 holders, with a total supply of 4 billion MUTM. The team recently announced the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a key foundation for future platform activity. The next phase is expected to raise the price to $0.040, a 15% step, signaling that early participants have a limited window to secure MUTM at a discounted presale price. BTC The price of Bitcoin has stopped rising around the $108,000–$118,000 area, and new factors aren’t helping to keep the pace going. Its progress is being slowed down by rising ETF inflows and miner sell-pressure, which make bullish confidence weaken. Large-scale uncertainty, especially the impending US government shutdown, is making people even less willing to buy, which has put markets in a “risk-off” state and taken the confidence out of momentum trades. Technical analysis backs up the congestion: Bitcoin (BTC) has stayed in a range near $114,000, failing to break decisively higher despite several efforts. Bitcoin could stay in this area until something new happens, like institutional inflows, more information about rate cuts, or a governmental breakthrough. If support levels fail, there is a chance that the price will go down. SOL Solana (SOL) is showing clear signs of stalling after its recent rally, with its recovery attempts running into resistance between $215 and $220. While bulls managed to push SOL above $200–$202, momentum has cooled and the upside remains capped unless volume surges. The technical structure suggests the $215 zone is acting as a ceiling — failure to break and sustain above it may lead to a pullback toward support levels in the $200–$204 range. On-chain data also shows that despite recent institutional accumulation, SOL must clear this resistance to confirm further upside. In short: SOL’s advance is stalling at key levels, and unless bulls overpower the resistance band, the next move could be sideways or down. The 900% upside thesis With a dual lending structure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will run. A lot of stablecoins and “blue chip” assets will be handled by peer-to-contract (P2C) pools, which will separate risk and keep liquidity stable. Tokens with bigger risks will be able to trade on peer-to-peer (P2P) markets, which will give traders more options without affecting core liquidity. With this split, the protocol can find a balance between safe deposits and riskier yield schemes, allowing for growth on a large scale without putting the whole system at risk. Price increases of about 900%, from $0.035 to about $0.35, are possible thanks to three processes that work together to support the road ahead. First, building up reserve factors will create an on-chain insurance and treasury. This will protect the value of the system over time and boost investor trust. The utilization-driven interest rate plan will change the cost of borrowing money based on how much of the pool is being used. More deposits will be made when utilization goes up, which will quickly increase total value locked (TVL) and help generate more fees. Third, the buyback and staking distribution system will use some of the platform’s income to buy MUTM on the open market and give prizes to stakers. This will create rising demand that will only get stronger as fees go up. As more people join, TVL will go up even more, and the desire for revenue-driven tokens will grow. This will make sure that price discovery keeps up with the growing activity. Security and incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a CertiK audit, achieving a Token Scan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. The audit timeline was initially requested on 2/25/2025 and revised on 5/20/2025. A 50,000 USDT bug bounty is active, with tiered rewards for Critical, Major, Medium, and Low severity issues. Additionally, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway will reward ten winners with $10,000 in MUTM each. The platform’s dashboard and Top 50 leaderboard will allow investors to track ROI and rankings in real time, adding transparency and gamified incentives to the presale experience. If an investor moved $8,000 from SOL and ETH to Phase 1 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.01, they would have bought 800,000 MUTM. It’s now valued at $28,000, or 3.5X more than it was at the Phase 6 price of $0.035. This holding will grow to $280,000 if the 900% upside goal is met, which is about $0.35 per token. This shows how early allocation can grow along with Layer-2 adoption, beta launch, and eventual Tier-1 listings. This order of action to demand makes sure that the 900% goal is based on structural mechanics and not guesswork. FOMO and closing Phase 6 is already 55% sold, and the upcoming price rise to $0.040 in Phase 7 makes potential investors feel like they need to act quickly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a structured way to trade in cryptocurrencies. It has features like lending and borrowing, stablecoin integration, staking-buyback mechanics, and a strong roadmap with Layer-2 adoption. The dashboard and Top 50 leaderboard will let players keep an eye on their ROI and rankings. This makes MUTM a great alternative as BTC and SOL reach their limits and traders look for altcoins with high upside and useful features.

Now, traders and fans are looking for the next altcoin with a lot of upside that can match or beat those gains. It looks like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going to be a great choice. The presale for MUTM is now in Phase 6, and the price is $0.035. It has raised about $16.73 million, and 55% of the 170 million tokens that were available have already been sold. There are a total of 4 billion tokens available for the project, which has more than 16,750 users. Phase 7 will raise the price by 15%, to $0.040, giving people one last chance to get in at a lower price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team announced the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , adding a powerful utility layer to the token and positioning it for exponential growth, particularly for investors considering investing in crypto during periods of market uncertainty or those questioning whether crypto is a good investment amid volatility or a potential crypto crash. Dual lending + stable interest rates The dual lending models in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be made for different risk profiles. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will deal with stablecoins and “blue chip” tokens, offering steady returns and lots of cash. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets will focus on assets that are more volatile, like meme tokens. These markets will offer high-yield chances while keeping risk out of the main pools. A model for stable interest rates will also be built into the protocol. Early borrowers get an initial rate lock and slightly higher starting rates to be safe. When supply goes below 90% of the all-variable rate, automatic rebalancing takes place. For example, a person who deposits $22,000 USDC into the mtUSDC pool at a 1:1 ratio will earn 15% APY, which is $3,300 per year. Borrowers will always be able to get money; putting up $1,200 in ETH as collateral lets them borrow up to $900 at 75% LTV. This structure makes sure that both lenders and borrowers can plan with confidence. The platform’s mtToken staking and open-market buyback features will recycle revenue into MUTM purchases, rewarding users and keeping demand high for the token. Demand drivers for $2 target MUTM is expected to rise from $0.035 to $2 by 2026, which is supported by a number of important factors. This shows why analysts are confident in its ability to beat past altcoin ROI benchmarks. First, the buy-and-distribute model will turn platform income into MUTM tokens bought on the open market, which will then be given to people who have staked mtTokens. This creates a demand feedback loop that is directly linked to action on the platform. Second, building up reserve factors will create an on-chain safety buffer that will be paid for by borrower interest. This will keep things stable and encourage bigger deposits, which will boost the protocol’s trustworthiness and liquidity. Third, the planned beta launch and Layer-2 integration will lower transaction costs and speed up execution, which will make it easier for more people to use it. Total value locked (TVL) and fee generation will go up if transactions are faster and fees are lower. This will have an effect on staking awards and buybacks. Fourth, planned listings on Tier-1 platforms will make the coins more visible, liquid, and easy to get. This will turn demand from presale sales into price discovery on the open market. As an example of possible returns, an investor who bought MUTM in Phase 1 at $0.01 now has a 3.5x value position at $0.035, and scaling toward the $2 goal is supported by staking rewards, buyback mechanisms, Layer-2 adoption, and upcoming expected exchange listings. Security is still very important. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently passed a CertiK check that included both a manual review and a static analysis, with a Token Scan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. The project also has a 50,000 USDT bug bounty, a $100,000 giveaway with ten prizes of $10,000 in MUTMs each, and dashboard and leaderboard tools to make participation fun and encourage big investments.

Being one of the well-known proof-of-stake networks, Cardano has never ceased to attract the attention of retail traders and institutional investors as well. With Cardano’s growth, other upcoming blockchain projects such as Remittix (RTX) are part of the story as investors seek the next big altcoin 2025. With proven brands and new challenger presales, the world of cryptocurrency is transforming very fast, providing unique opportunities for early-stage investment in crypto. Cardano Price Suggests Growing Adoption Cardano is now trading at $0.8544, up 3.87% on the last day. Its market cap is now at $30.68 billion, while its daily trades at $1.42 billion is an indication of better liquidity on the network. These statistics illustrate high demand for ADA as developers keep on developing within its ecosystem. The interest in Cardano price prediction is driven by its status as a Layer 2 Ethereum substitute, with reduced transaction fees and scalable technology. Traders view ADA as among the best crypto under $1 that balances security, decentralization, and innovation — a crypto to invest in 2025. Why Investors Are Eyeing Remittix While Cardano remains a powerhouse, early-stage projects like Remittix (RTX) are taking the headlines. And at just $0.1130 per token , Remittix already raised $26.9 million+ in its presale and sold over 673.8 million tokens. Constructed as a cross-chain DeFi project, it allows for direct cryptocurrency to be sent into bank accounts in over 30 countries, fighting real-world problems in the $19 trillion payments industry. Remittix also revealed upcoming listings on BitMart and LBank, opening the door to astronomical liquidity after the presale. Potential investors who look for the best crypto presale 2025 are already interested in RTX, with its deflationary tokenomics and solid roadmap. Why Remittix Is Tidal News Over $26.9Million raised in presale with strong community support Global payments utility: immediate crypto-to-bank transfers in minutes CertiK fully audited team and ranked #1 pre-launch token Upcoming listings on BitMart and LBank bring legitimacy Growing Ecosystem and Real Utility In addition to listing on exchanges, Remittix has also gone into beta testing for its Remittix wallet, allowing community members to test real-time transactions. Its referral program rewards 15% in USDT to new presale buyers, as well as other adoption. The project further announced it would conduct a $250,000 Remittix Giveaway, incentivizing early adoption and exposure. With its focus on low gas fee crypto, cross-world remittance, and real-world use cases, Remittix is among the leading DeFi projects 2025. For individuals who desire to diversify out of ADA, Remittix represents a strong opportunity as the next major crypto drop with sustainable utility.

52603478,596881,1759482792,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52603478.jpeg,Michael Saylor’s Big Bet: The Strategy Behind Strategy’s Bitcoin Accumulation & Bitcoin Hyper’s Opportunity,https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylors-big-bitcoin-bet-next-crypto-to-explode-is-bitcoin-hyper/,"Michael Saylor plays 4D chess. Not only did Saylor begin as a Bitcoin critic and change to a Bitcoin booster, but he also took a tech company and turned it into the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury. Along the way, he invented the whole idea of crypto treasury. And along the way, he inspired a host of imitators, including: Countries – The United States and El Salvador have established Bitcoin reserves. Companies – Rivals like Metaplanet are playing catch-up to amass as much BTC as possible Blockchains – Look around now, and you’ll find Ethereum treasuries , Solana treasuries , and even Dogecoin treasuries As of 2025, the company holds approximately 640,031 $BTC, acquired at an average cost in the tens of thousands per coin – far below the current price of $120K. How did Saylor’s Strategy get here? And what does it all mean for retail investors – and for Bitcoin Layer 2 projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ? Time to dive in. How Strategy Keeps Accumulating Bitcoin Why Strategy is accumulating $BTC is obvious, with Bitcoin’s price so high. The real question is – how is Strategy able to keep buying Bitcoin even as the token price increases? Well, several reasons! Multi-Pronged Financing Strategy doesn’t rely on operating cash to fund its Bitcoin acquisitions. Its legacy software business (when it was known as MicroStrategy) yields minimal free cash. Instead, the company uses a toolkit of capital-market instruments: Convertible senior notes : often zero- or low-coupon debt that investors can later convert into equity Preferred stock issuances (‘Stretch’ offerings), marketed explicitly to raise capital for $BTC purchases Equity issuance via at-the-market (ATM) offerings, which leverages investor demand and Strategy’s stock premium over NAV By funneling proceeds from these sources directly into Bitcoin purchases, Strategy manages to keep buying $BTC dip or ATH. Since the value of the above – especially stock and equity issuances – relies heavily on the underlying value Strategy’s $BTC holdings, Saylor has essentially created a capital-raising flywheel built around Bitcoin itself. Accumulation Philosophy: As Much $BTC as Possible Saylor’s approach treats Bitcoin not as a speculative hold but as a core reserve asset. In other words, he likely wouldn’t consider it a ‘bet’ in the gambling sense. Instead, Saylor embraces Bitcoin’s inherent volatility; any dips become buying opportunities, and he holds the long view through turbulence. He argues that Bitcoin’s fixed 21M supply, resistance to debasement, and network effects make it a superior treasury asset compared to cash or even gold. Saylor goes a step further, predicting a truly breathtaking upside scenario: if institutional investors allocate even 10% of their capital toward Bitcoin, the resulting demand could push the price toward $1M per $BTC. The assumption is based on a number of factors, including an even tighter supply than the 21M $BTC, since a significant number – potentially 3.7M $BTC – is considered permanently lost. Working in Saylor’s favor: the more Bitcoin treasuries there are, the more Bitcoin is being held (and not traded), and the tighter the liquid supply gets – further driving up Bitcoin’s price. Currently, the top 100 Bitcoin treasuries hold over 1M Bitcoin between them – nearly 5% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. Risks and Criticisms: Yes, There Are Some Saylor’s plan isn’t without risks. Here are a few of the more pressing ones: Shareholder pressure : The company’s reliance on equity issuance means dilution is a constant risk. The entire plan relies on Strategy’s stock trading at a premium over the Bitcoin NAV per share. If that premium collapses, any new equity issuance becomes costly to shareholders; each new share would claim a smaller slice of the Bitcoin pie. Accounting and impairments : Because of standard accounting rules, Strategy must book impairment losses when Bitcoin’s market price drops below the cost basis. That applies even if the decline is temporary and later reversed. Liquidity and funding : With limited operational cash flow, Strategy depends on fresh capital markets. If investor sentiment sours or credit conditions tighten, raising new funds could become difficult. Market and external risks : The success of Saylor’s thesis hinges on continued institutional adoption of Bitcoin. If that demand falters, the upside may not materialize. In extreme scenarios, the company might be forced to sell Bitcoin, potentially derailing the entire flywheel. But what if there’s a way to add another layer to Bitcoin’s utility and deepen both retail and institutional interest? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could strengthen Bitcoin’s economy even further with a powerful, scalable Layer 2 . And along the way, the $HYPER token could just be the next crypto to explode . Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Faster, Cheaper Transactions and DeFi-Ready Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets Bitcoin’s weaknesses carefully. To overcome Bitcoin’s low average TPS, Bitcoin Hyper uses a Canonical Bridge to wrap $BTC and deploy it on the Layer 2. There, powered by the Solana Virtual Machine, the wrapped $BTC can be transacted at Solana’s native TPS – potentially thousands of transactions per second. The result is a hybrid solution combining the flexibility and scalability of the SVM and wrapped $BTC with the reliability of Bitcoin’s native Layer 1. All transactions settle, in the end, on Bitcoin’s original layer for all that hardcore security. The potential for a fully scalable solution that doesn’t compromise Bitcoin’s reliability is already drawing strong interest. Yesterday,, the $HYPER presale has rocketed past $20M, powered recently by a wave of whale buys in the past 24 hours: $196.6K $145K $56.9K $29.8K $11.8K $10.4K That’s over $450K in the past day; previous whale buys have poured close to $1M into the project this week. The momentum is growing as investors learn exactly what Bitcoin Hyper is ; increasingly, they like what they see. See why our own Bitcoin Hyper price prediction shows the token price could skyrocket from $0.013035 to $0.32 for gains of 2,355% by the end of the year. Don’t overlook the potential of Bitcoin Hyper – check out the presale page today. Michael Saylor’s pivot of Strategy into a Bitcoin-first entity is among the most aggressive and public corporate crypto bets. It has so far paid off handsomely; Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings have appreciated 61% over the course of his purchases for over $29B in unrealized gains. Ultimately, Strategy’s fate will likely rest on how well the pieces of this high-stakes puzzle continue to align. That’s precisely where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in, with the ability to provide more Bitcoin utility and further support Saylor’s strategic flywheel.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the agency tasked with producing the monthly jobs report, has been forced to suspend operations amid the ongoing government shutdown. The shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Wednesday after lawmakers failed to agree on a funding package, Cryptopolitan reported . No resolution means no BLS data, which leaves the US federal reserve in confusion two weeks after it cut borrowing rates as a “precautionary” measure. The jobs report, scheduled for release Friday, was meant to be the last employment snapshot before the Federal Reserve’s next policy meeting in 26 days. Without it, officials will have to make interest rate decisions without the full picture of labor market conditions. BLS hands tied during federal government shutdown The Bureau of Labor Statistics, like dozens of other federal agencies, cannot operate without government funding. Its staff have been sent home until a deal is reached, so the agency is arguably unable to track the jobs of more than 170 million Americans and release its monthly economic reports. BLS conducts two main surveys to calculate monthly changes, with the first one based on households, measuring employment, unemployment, and participation rates among different demographic groups. The second, known as the “establishment survey,” looks at job gains and losses in several industries, wages and working hours. Both surveys are conducted in the middle of each month, but responses arrive days or even weeks later. Analysts then adjust the data before publishing the report on the first Friday of the following month. Sometimes, according to former BLS employees, the work continues until late on Thursday afternoon, just hours before release. Assuming the September report followed the same timeline, the BLS was still in the middle of assembling data when the shutdown began early Wednesday. Still, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren has pressed the administration to move ahead with publishing the September jobs numbers despite the shutdown. A Senate Banking Committee aide told CNN that former BLS staffers informed Warren’s office that the data had already been collected and could be released. “The jobs data scheduled to come out this Friday has undoubtedly been collected, and the President must release it,” Warren said in a statement. “Without it, the Federal Reserve will not have the full picture it needs to make decisions this month about interest rates that will impact every family across the country.” No word from the White House has indicated it would consider releasing the numbers, contrary to expectations that it would not be released today. Economists expected weak but improving figures Economists had anticipated a modest rebound in hiring of between 50,000 and 80,000 jobs in September. That would be an improvement from the average of 29,000 jobs added each month this year, but still falls short of the roughly 100,000 jobs required to keep the unemployment rate steady. According to payroll data released by ADP Research, private-sector employment fell by 32,000 in September following a revised 3,000 drop in August. Fed rate cut decision without data impossible The Federal Reserve will be meeting again on October 28 to decide whether it should make another interest rate cut, as inflation jumped up 0.2% in August. According to some economists, the absence of official labor market data could negatively affect the decision-making process. “While federal government shutdowns, by their nature, are counterproductive, this one would be especially ill-timed given the current high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economy,” Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, wrote in an analysis on Tuesday. The shutdown could also delay the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report slated for October 15, just two weeks after the shutdown began. Even if lawmakers reach a funding deal before then, it is unclear if the agency will be able to gather and process the necessary data in time. Get seen where it counts.

Is Bitcoin about to retrace to the top of the descending channel before a definitive surge that takes out the $124,000 all-time high? A reversal back to the top of the ascending channel? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows that the price is currently being rejected from the bottom of a narrow ascending channel that had contained the price previously. While there is the possibility that the price could just bounce from the $119,450 support level and then keep rising, the $BTC price is very overbought in the short-term time frames, and even out to the daily time frame. It would make sense for the bears to turn the rejection into a reversal. This downward impulse would then likely take the price back to the top of the big descending channel in order to test and confirm the breakout - a perfectly normal and healthy thing to do. Once the confirmation is made, and the price does not get sucked back into the channel, the real upside surge could begin, as illustrated by the possible trajectory of the green arrow. At the bottom of the chart, the 4-hour Stochastic RSI indicator has started its journey back to the bottom. The 8-hour and 12-hour indicators should start to follow. The 0.382 Fibonacci level - good zone for a bounce? Source: TradingView The daily time frame viewed with the Fibonacci extension lines illustrates likely levels for a bounce. The $BTC price is coming back down to the most shallow of these levels now, which is the 0.236. A healthier retrace would be to the 0.382, which would be likely to coincide with the top of the descending channel. That said, a bounce from the 0.382 Fibonacci level would be very bullish. A fuller retracement to the 0.618 is not as likely, given that this would mean the price going back into the channel, and a possible lower low being set. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator can be seen to be coming back to the descending trendline. If it does so, and bounces from there, this would likely match the price action above. Entire bull market to date holds parabolic curve Source: TradingView The 2-week chart shows that the $BTC price has already got above the previous 2-weekly candle body tops. It also reveals that the whole of this Bitcoin bull market is holding nicely above a parabolic curve. Only once did the price dip below, and this was at the extreme bottom of the March 2025 31% reversal. Towards the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators very much look as though they will confirm a cross-up at the end of this week, which would be a hugely bullish event. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator is once more pushing up against the downtrend line. If it breaks through, this could coincide with a surge in the price action. Just one note of concern - bearish divergence has been building since February 2024. In order to annul this, the Stochastic RSI indicators need to hit the top of their range, and the RSI indicator needs to get to the 88.00 level, surpassing the previous high.

Whales flock to best crypto for 18x gains before Q4,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/03/altcoin-season-2025-whales-flock-to-best-crypto-for-18x-gains-before-q4/,"As altcoin season begins to re-accelerate in 2025, crypto investors and whales are redeploying capital from stagnant assets into scalable DeFi protocols with yield-driven mechanics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top choice for those seeking both short-term upside and long-term adoption. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035, with approximately $16.73 million raised so far. More than 55% of the 170M token allocation has already been claimed, and over 16,750 holders have joined the growing ecosystem. The total supply of MUTM is 4B tokens, and Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, representing a 15% step up, highlighting the urgency for early entry. Recently, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team announced the ongoing development of its lending and borrowing protocol , which will provide structured liquidity, overcollateralized lending, and scalable adoption across retail and institutional participants. Core mechanics — P2C, P2P and stablecoin innovation With a decentralized stablecoin model and dual loan mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives users a safe and high-yield space. P2C pools will accept stablecoins and top-tier assets like ETH. This lets lenders make steady returns while still having access to their base assets. For instance, a person who puts $25,000 worth of ETH into the mtETH pool will get the same amount of mtETH back. With an average annual percentage yield (APY) of 14%, this deposit will earn $3,500 in interest every year, showing that it has clear return potential. Borrowers can use overcollateralization to their advantage. For example, they could post $2,000 in SOL at 70% LTV to get access to $1,400 in cash. This would make instant capital efficiency possible without selling off their main assets. P2P lending pools will be made for riskier or less liquid tokens, like PEPE and FLOKI. This will keep core liquidity safe and protect volatility while letting players directly negotiate higher returns. The protocol’s autonomous $1 peg stablecoin will be created with collateral and burned when the collateral is repaid or the protocol is liquidated. Issuers will be limited by caps, and borrowing rates will be managed by governance to keep the peg. This system keeps prices stable and makes sure that both borrowers and lenders have the same goals. Why 18x by Q4 — oracles, ECE, and capital efficiency The price is expected to rise 18 times, from $0.035 to $0.63. This is due to a number of important factors that will increase usage, demand, and liquidity. First, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will set up a strong oracle plan that includes DEX TWAPs, Chainlink, fallback oracles, and aggregated feeds. This will lower the price-feed risk, which will allow major investors to take on bigger positions while keeping the liquidation processes safe. Trusted pricing will lead to bigger deposits and integrations, which will increase TVL and activity generally. Second, Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) will make it easier for assets that are linked to each other, like stablecoin pairs, to borrow more money. By making it easier for members to use capital more efficiently, P2C pools will be used more, which will bring in more fee money. Some of these fees will be used to buy back MUTM on the open market. This will keep the number of tokens high and help the price rise. Third, limits on how much you can put and borrow, along with modes that limit collateral, will boost trust between parties. Getting deposits from large institutions raises TVL and creates steady lines of income that are used to pay out stake rewards and fund more buybacks. As TVL rises through big deposits and beta platform adoption, fees from interest and borrowing will pay for regular buybacks, as shown in a scenario that shows how these mechanics work. As an example, turning 30% of protocol fees into open-market MUTM buying while getting ready for listings on Tier-1 exchanges will push prices up, supporting the story of 18x growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also add Layer-2 solutions to lower friction and allow more daily active users to engage during the beta launch. This will lead to more borrowing and more fee income. The project’s security framework includes a CertiK audit with Manual Review and Static Analysis, Token Scan score of 90.00, Skynet score of 79.00, a $50,000 USDT bug bounty, and an ongoing $100,000 giveaway distributed to ten winners of $10,000 in MUTMs each. Investors will have access to a dashboard and a Top 50 leaderboard to monitor protocol activity and positions. More than half of the tokens in Phase 6 have already been sold, and the price will go up again soon for Phase 7. This means that whales and early users are getting ready to buy tokens at lower prices. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a strong choice for 2025 because it offers dual loans, stablecoin innovation, oracles, Enhanced Collateral Efficiency, staking buybacks, and is soon to be listed on exchanges. There won’t be many chances to get into an altcoin that has utility-driven adoption, high-yield mechanics, and measured upside before Phase 7 drives further price appreciation. People who keep an eye on the crypto fear and greed index and crypto predictions think that early strategic involvement in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will determine who wins the next wave of crypto market rotations.

Three trader-driven catalysts behind MUTM Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently priced at $0.035, with approximately $16.73 million raised and 55% of the 170 million tokens in this phase already sold to over 16,750 holders. The total supply of MUTM is 4 billion tokens. Phase 7 is scheduled to launch at $0.040, representing a 15% price increase. With the team announcing the development of its lending and borrowing protocol, traders will have early access to real DeFi functionalities. Those entering before Phase 7 will secure discounted tokens while gaining exposure to a platform expected to generate high trader engagement and volume. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured around dual lending mechanics whose development was announced recently, providing both security and opportunity for traders. The P2C system allows deposits of stablecoins and bluechip assets into smart contracts. A $20,000 USDT deposit will generate mtUSDT at a 1:1 ratio, earning 15% APY and producing $3,000 in annual passive income. Borrowers can use assets like ETH as collateral; for instance, $1,500 ETH enables borrowing $1,125 at a 75% LTV. For higher-risk tokens such as SHIB or PEPE, the P2P lending system offers isolated pools where traders can access greater returns without impacting the stability of core liquidity pools. This dual model caters to both conservative and aggressive strategies, providing traders with flexibility while maintaining overall protocol health. Price discovery and stablecoin mechanics Price discovery and liquidity are two more things that traders like about MUTM. To make sure that valuations are correct and up to date, the protocol will include Chainlink main feeds, fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and TWAPs from decentralized exchanges. Borrowing costs change depending on how much of the pool is being used. When the pool isn’t being used, interest rates go up to encourage deposits, and when it is being used a lot, rates go down to encourage borrowing. With this changing structure, liquidity stays even, which cuts down on slippage and lets traders work well even when the market is stressed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives buyers the confidence to take positions with known outcomes by making asset prices clear and dependable. Stablecoin mechanics and mtToken rewards make traders even more interested. The autonomous stablecoin will only be created with assets that are overcollateralized and will be burned when loans are paid back. To keep the $1 peg, interest rates will be controlled by the government. Arbitrage chances will keep things stable, and mtToken staking contracts will let users get MUTM rewards. A part of the platform’s revenue will also be used for open-market buybacks. This will keep people wanting tokens, which will help the price rise. These features will make traders more likely to hold on to and stake their tokens, which will increase protocol involvement and make the market deeper. Roadmap Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will continue to execute its roadmap in phases. Early phases, including presale and marketing campaigns, are ongoing, while future phases will roll out core smart contracts, beta testing, and front-end infrastructure. The dashboard will allow traders to monitor their holdings and calculate ROI, while the Top 50 leaderboard will reward the largest investors with bonus MUTM tokens. Security and credibility will remain key, with a CertiK audit (Manual Review + Static Analysis, Token Scan 90.00, Skynet 79.00), a $50,000 USDT bug bounty, a $100,000 giveaway , and a growing community of over 12,000 Twitter followers. Investors in Phase 1 show that they can make money quickly. When an investor put BTC and ETH into MUTM at $0.01, they now have tokens worth $0.035, which is 3.5× returns. Layer-2 integration will lower transaction costs, and future listings on Tier-1 exchanges like Coinbase will increase adoption and liquidity. This will support a Phase 7 price of $0.040 and more price growth. By using the beta start, traders will be able to see how the lending, borrowing, and staking features work for themselves. This will increase demand and speed up price growth. Traders should get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) before the price goes up since 55% of Phase 6 has already been sold. MUTM is a great choice for strategic crypto investment because it has two loan models, strong protections for collateral, dynamic liquidity management, and rewards for staking. As more people use the protocol and more people accept it, traders will set themselves up for long-term gains, making MUTM the new cryptocurrency to buy while the rest of the market watches why crypto is going up.

Amidst this environment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a top contender for investors seeking a combination of utility and growth. Currently, Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is priced at $0.035, with approximately $16.73 million raised and 55% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. The project boasts over 16,750 holders and a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens. Phase 7 will increase the price to $0.040, representing a 15% rise and marking the last discounted window for new participants. Recently, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team announced the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , highlighting the upcoming utility that will drive demand and adoption. For investors weighing whether to invest in crypto or navigating a crypto crash, MUTM presents a clear path toward high utility-driven gains, making it a compelling choice for those assessing whether crypto is a good investment in the current market. Dual lending mechanics & stable interest rate model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has two types of loan systems to meet the needs of low-risk and high-risk markets. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools let people put stablecoins and other high-quality assets. They offer steady returns and help the platform get cash. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loans are best for crypto coins like SHIB and TRUMP that are riskier or less liquid. By keeping these risky assets separate from the main liquidity pools, the protocol makes sure that all users are safe and stable while still giving risk-tolerant players high-reward opportunities. A stable interest rate plan with three main parts will be built into the platform. A higher starting rate attracts deposits at launch, an initial rate lock gives lenders peace of mind, and a rebalancing condition kicks in when the current supply goes below 90% of the hypothetical all-variable supply rate. This keeps borrowers and lenders in balance. For example, a person who deposits $18,000 USDC into the mtUSDC pool at a 1:1 ratio will earn 15% APY per year, which is $2,700. People who want to borrow money using MUTM can effectively use security; posting $1,000 ADA lets them borrow up to 75%, giving them $750 in stablecoin liquidity while keeping their original holdings. This organized method makes sure that everyone gets the same benefits and can join without taking too much risk, all while keeping the protocol’s liquidity high. Demand drivers & why $3 by 2026 is feasible Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to hit $3 by 2026, which is more than 85 times higher than early Phase 1 prices. This is due to a number of important demand drivers. With Layer-2 integration and the planned beta launch, transactions will be faster and costs will go down, which will lead to more users and daily activity. The platform will use the extra money it makes from more borrowing and loans to buy back MUTM on the open market, which will keep pushing the price up. The buy-and-distribute method will make even more people want tokens. Some of the platform’s income will be used to buy back MUTM and give it to people who have staked mtTokens. This will connect protocol action directly to price support. Listings on Tier-1 exchanges on platforms like Binance will increase exposure and liquidity, which will lead to a lot of retail and institutional interest in the presale. A dashboard and Top 50 ranking will turn participation into a game, which will encourage big holders to stay and increase retention, which will increase buy pressure over time. To give you an idea of what this means for investors, someone who bought MUTM in Phase 1 at $0.01 already has a 3.5× value gain at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. With the protocol’s roadmap, Layer-2 benefits, staking rewards, and buyback flywheel, this position is expected to grow toward the $3 goal. This shows that early adopters have a chance to make a lot of money. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also places a strong emphasis on security and transparency. The platform underwent a CertiK audit, including Manual Review and Static Analysis, achieving a Token Scan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. A $50,000 USDT bug bounty incentivizes white-hat security research, with rewards ranging from $200 to $2,000 depending on severity. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway will reward ten winners with $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Phase 6 is already 55% sold, and the price will go up again soon for Phase 7. This means that strategic buyers only have a short time to buy at a discount. In the post-BTC delivery market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides an appealing, utility-driven road for investors looking for asymmetric returns by combining dual lending mechanics, a stable interest framework, staking with buybacks, Layer-2 scalability, and expected Tier-1 exchange listings. MUTM is a high-utility, high-growth alternative that has a clear path to big upside for people who are thinking about investing in crypto during times of market volatility or who are worried about a crypto crash.

This success was achieved after the app secured the third position on Apple’s App Store, despite users requiring an invitation code to access it. Additionally, it has led to the rise of deepfake videos, including a well-known clip of CEO Sam Altman allegedly stealing GPUs. Meanwhile, this launch has sparked an ongoing discussion regarding finding the right balance between safety and expressing creativity within the tech company. Following this, an insider familiar with OpenAI’s strategy, who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the situation, pointed out that the firm’s leadership believes imposing stringent rules is essential, but also fears that these rules could restrict creativity or come across as too controlling. To date, this issue has not yet been addressed. OpenAI adopts speed to maintain its competitive edge OpenAI has long emphasized speed, frequently rolling out new tools before competitors and allowing the public to adapt in real-time. A former employee, speaking anonymously, confirmed that leadership consistently pushed for rapid launches. This strategy became particularly evident after DeepSeek from China introduced a strong model late last year that was cheaper and quicker to develop than anything coming out of Silicon Valley. Respondingly, OpenAI swiftly launched two new models within weeks, which several analysts viewed as an approach to maintain its competitive edge. Notably, its escalating institutional strength is a significant booster to the tech giant’s strategy. Initially, it began as a small research lab in San Francisco’s Mission District. It has become a more organized company, enabling it to form cross-functional teams quickly and accelerate the development and release process for products like Sora. Concerning Sora, OpenAI highlighted that the product features several layers of protection designed to prevent the creation of unsafe content. The company added that it uses prompt filtering and output moderation for video frames and audio transcripts. The tech giant also pointed out that the app prohibits explicit content, terrorist propaganda, and content that promotes self-harm. Moreover, Sora utilizes watermarks and does not permit impersonation of likenesses. However, some users have already discovered ways to bypass these safe measures. OpenAI’s content faces criticism over safety concerns Regarding OpenAI’s video app, reliable sources have noted that several famous videos feature Altman after he granted permission for his likeness to be used on the platform. In contrast, others feature popular cartoon characters such as Pikachu and SpongeBob SquarePants in sexually explicit situations. This content has provoked criticism that OpenAI is rushing ahead without adequate protections. Additionally, their use of copyrighted material, unless rights holders choose to exclude themselves, is consistent with the company’s current policy, although it continues to face legal challenges. Altman has brushed off such concerns; in a post to X, he stated that Sora aims to demonstrate the technology’s capabilities and generate commercial interest for OpenAI’s broader goals related to artificial general intelligence (AGI). The launch comes at a time of intensifying competition. Last week, Meta launched Vibes , a new short-form AI video feed in its Meta AI app. Google is also developing Veo 3, and ByteDance and Alibaba have introduced competing systems. Meanwhile, OpenAI has just announced another $850 billion in investment to double down on infrastructure and invest in the next generation of models. Experts say the transition to video is about attracting more users with another engaging consumer app. Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Tech|Apple|DeepSeek|Google|Meta|OpenAI|Sora,EN,0,0,ASIA|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|RESEARCH|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-03 09:25:20

Together, they have expanded access to digital assets and increased investor confidence. At the same time, crypto presales remain a central pathway for new projects, giving communities the chance to support early innovation. The search for the best crypto presale to buy has led many toward emerging ecosystems like Coinbase’s Base network. Among them, Based Eggman ($GGs) is making waves as a presale crypto that blends meme culture with gaming and social platforms, while larger institutions continue to focus on ETFs. Based Eggman and the Rise of the Best Presale Crypto 2025 Based Eggman ($GGs) is not just another meme coin. Built on Coinbase’s Layer 2, Base, it combines gaming infrastructure with a vibrant social layer. Players can earn tokens through on-chain games, while also participating in meme-driven culture that keeps communities engaged and active. This blend of gaming and culture transforms what a presale coin can represent. The project has already raised $215,000 in its presale, showing a strong level of early support. By integrating social platforms with gaming, Based Eggman positions itself as more than a cryptocurrency presale. It creates a space where entertainment and finance work together in real time. Every game played, every meme shared, and every $GGs earned contributes to the wider ecosystem. This approach makes it stand out on any crypto presale list for 2025, since it focuses on user experience while still operating within the larger Base framework. For those seeking the best presale crypto opportunities, Based Eggman demonstrates how community-driven tokens can still offer structure, features, and long-term relevance. ETFs, Bitcoin Growth, and the Expanding Market While new crypto presale projects bring innovation, the broader financial industry is being shaped by ETFs. The SEC currently holds decisions on several applications for spot altcoin ETFs, including Solana, as regulators navigate one of the busiest periods of crypto filings in history. More than 90 applications are under review, ranging from single-asset funds to diversified digital asset strategies. The rise of ETFs has already changed the landscape. Eleven Bitcoin funds now manage nearly $150 billion in assets, according to CoinGlass, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leading the way. Ethereum ETFs have also grown quickly, surpassing $22 billion in assets under management. These products signal a growing appetite for regulated exposure to cryptocurrency, appealing to both retail and institutional investors. This regulatory shift provides a stark contrast to cryptocurrency presales, where innovation emerges from smaller communities. Together, ETFs and presales show the two sides of the crypto market: institutional maturity and grassroots creativity. How to Buy $GGs in the Current Crypto Presale Buying Based Eggman ($GGs) during its presale is straightforward. Interested participants can visit the official project website, connect a compatible wallet such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet, and use ETH or USDC to make their purchase. Once confirmed, the presale tokens are stored securely in the buyer’s wallet until the public launch. For those looking into presale crypto opportunities, accessibility is one of the biggest benefits. The process avoids complex steps often found on exchanges and provides an early entry into a growing community. It is also an example of how cryptocurrency presales allow direct participation in a project’s growth, while still giving the transparency of blockchain verification. As $GGs continues to develop its ecosystem, the presale gives early supporters the chance to become part of its journey from the start. In a market where presale crypto 2025 projects are being carefully watched, Based Eggman stands out for combining humor, gaming, and community in a clear and practical way. Conclusion: Best Crypto Presale 2025 and the Road Ahead The cryptocurrency market in 2025 reflects both innovation and structure. On one side, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs bring regulated products that strengthen mainstream adoption. On the other, new projects like Based Eggman $GGs highlight how presale crypto continues to reshape culture on networks such as Base. For those exploring cryptocurrency presales, the lesson is clear: due diligence and awareness are essential. Still, projects like Based Eggman prove that presale coins can push boundaries while offering community-driven ecosystems. If you are looking into the best crypto presale to buy in 2025, now is the time to research and participate before opportunities move further into the spotlight.

The next event on October 10 is also closely watched for potential volatility. Options markets may turn into a short-term pressure factor for the price of BTC. On October 3, a total of $3.3B in BTC options expired on Deribit, putting pressure on the recent crypto market recovery. The event was smaller compared to the $22B expiry at the end of September, but traders still attempted to push prices closer to maximum pain levels. The influence of Deribit options is also diminishing, as more of the activity is shifting to BlackRock’s IBIT platform. The venue surpassed Deribit with over $38B in open interest and a disparity in its price range, suggesting a more bullish stance on BTC. Deribit options markets still hold peak open interest The weekly options expiry has maximum pain at $115,000 for BTC and $4,200 for ETH. The two leading assets are trading above the maximum pain price. BTC held above $120,000 ahead of the expiry, while ETH recovered above $4,500. Shortly after the expiry, BTC dipped under $120,000, while ETH was just under the $4,500 range. The market now looks at the upcoming options expiry event, with maximum pain at $115,000 based on CoinGlass data . Attempts to push BTC back to this price range may lead to more volatility in the coming week. In total, $3.3B of BTC options expired, with just $900M for ETH. The smaller weekly events are still rebuilding liquidity as October trading promised to shift market sentiment. One of the expectations for the Deribit weekly options expiry was for the market to go higher, as traders are no longer attempting to push the price down to maximum pain levels. Deribit options now have $28B in open interest, expected to rise by the end of the month as traders reposition. Open interest is higher right now, compared to $16B for October 2024. Can crypto markets retain their gains? Following a week with a dramatic recovery, the crypto fear and greed index remained neutral, but moved up to 57 points, closer to greed territory. For crypto native traders, the available BTC liquidity may signal the price direction. BTC shifted to a higher range, with long liquidity accumulating at $118,000. Short positions increased at around $121,000 per coin. BTC is positioned in the middle of the range, with the potential to shift in either direction. ETH has thinner liquidity from short positions, with longs in the $4,300 range. Those positions may invite attempts to lower the price and cause liquidations. Despite the short-term fluctuations, the crypto market is still positioning for a year-end rally. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

While this shutdown wasn't expected to last long, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins surged despite the uncertainty surrounding the shutdown. Weeks later, BTC surpassed $120,000, while Ethereum surpassed $4,500. This upward trend is expected to continue into October, the month known as Uptober, and today, as every Friday, the expiration date for options contracts in the crypto market has arrived. According to the first weekly data for October, $3.32 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $963 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on October 3 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 1.15, the maximum loss point is $115,000 and the notional value is $3.32 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.93, a maximum loss point of $4,200, and a notional value of $963 million. When we look at the put/call ratio, we see that it's 1.15 for BTC and 0.93 for ETH. These ratios indicate that sell orders for Bitcoin are greater than buy orders, and options traders are bearish. In contrast, the put/call ratio for ETH is 0.93, reflecting a more neutral investor sentiment than Bitcoin. This suggests that options traders are taking positions in anticipation of continued sideways movement in the Ethereum price, according to analysts. The maximum pain point is the level at which the cryptocurrency price settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, traders typically pay attention to the highest pain level, which can exert a significant pull on price movement toward expiration. Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently trading well above their maximum loss levels, but market makers and options sellers may attempt to push BTC and ETH to the $115,000 pain point and $4,200 pain point, respectively, to offset their positions. As of writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading at $119,900 and $4,455 respectively. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum's Crucial Friday Arrives!

The “hacker” wallets executed several transactions in DAI and swapped them for Ethereum at an average price of $4,401 per coin. Lookonchain’s onchain records screenshots show the trades were routed through decentralized exchanges using CoW Protocol and Convex Protocol, platforms that facilitate large swaps fast with reduced slippage and fees. Hackers make coordinated swaps through CoW and Convex protocols According to records from Arkham Intelligence, the hackers did not convert all their DAI holdings in one move, but exchanged stablecoins for ETH in increments of up to $12 million. Analysts believe they were trying to reduce slippage and avoid raising suspicion on-chain while repositioning illicit funds. Hackers are buying $ETH ! 3 wallets (likely belonging to hackers) spent 38M $DAI to buy 8,637 $ETH at $4,401 7 hours ago. https://t.co/wSLJN03zPK https://t.co/eCQVmuzJ1Z https://t.co/Gwz5p6HOuH pic.twitter.com/7GGUebSqXl — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 2, 2025 One of the addresses, beginning with 0x4Ee3, was seen liquidating more than $11 million worth of DAI into ETH within the one-hour window. The wallet sent 2,730 ETH valued at $12 million to a separate address while conducting smaller swaps in parallel. The transactions included two large outflows of 4 million DAI and 5 million DAI, which were swapped for 906 ETH and 1,133 ETH, respectively. Another transfer included 2.5 million DAI exchanged for 567 ETH, before all the accumulated Ether coins were forwarded to new address 0xA0168e…B89faCb6, now currently worth $14 million at current prices. A second wallet, beginning with 0x1c4, liquidated 521,000 DAI, 4 million DAI, and 5 million DAI, followed by a final conversion of 12.12 million DAI into 2,761 ETH. All of these funds were later consolidated and sent to other addresses, again routed via the CoW Protocol contracts. The largest of the three wallets, beginning with 0x272c, handled over $26.6 million in transactions during the same early morning period. Lookonchain’s screenshot showed the address swapped its holdings via Convex Protocol and converted 5 million DAI into 1,135 ETH. They later made a 12.12 million DAI swap, yielding 2,761 ETH. In total, the address accumulated 2,761 ETH worth $12.15 million, which was then sent to a wallet linked to the first address, 0x4Ee3. The timing, size, and routing of the trades strongly suggest the three wallets were acting in tandem, breaking up the $38 million DAI liquidation into pieces to reduce visibility. In total, the wallets converted 8,637 ETH valued at approximately $38 million. Blockchain analysts monitoring the flows say the activity fits the pattern of actors seeking to obscure the origins of illicit funds by splitting swaps into multiple tranches. But according to one user on X, the hackers could be banking on the Uptober market rally that has shot Ether’s price 13% up from its weekly lows, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum price rebounds to $4,400 at October’s start Ethereum was trading at $4,464 early Friday morning, hovering near its recent high of $4,529. Market analysts point to strong inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a stabilizing factor. Nine US-listed ETH funds recorded inflows of 14,864 ETH, worth $65.6 million this business week. These institutional purchases may have helped absorb selling or deterred bears pushing for a downward volatility spiral. Ethereum recently rebounded from a low of $3,900 on September 26, a level some traders are now calling a potential market bottom of the year 2025. Patterns known as the “Power of 3” suggest the possibility of an 80 to 100 percent price increase by the end of the year. TradingView’s market analysis suggests that Ethereum is in a neutral-to-bullish zone, supported by a level at $4,200 and resistance at $4,600. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 43.1, indicating neutral strength but no signs of being overbought or oversold.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $2.25 billion over four days, led by BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK & 21Shares. IBIT topped the latest session with $466.55 million in inflows, as Bitcoin reclaimed $120,000. ETF momentum signals accelerating institutional demand at the start of historically bullish “Uptober.” Inflows for the latest trading session alone reached $627.24 million as institutional capital continues to pour in, following Bitcoin’s climb above $120,000, according to SoSoValue . BlackRock’s IBIT led the session with $466.55 million in net inflow, pushing its cumulative total to $61.84 billion. Fidelity and ARK Lead Bitcoin ETF Inflows Behind BlackRock’s Surge Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $89.62 million, while ARK and 21Shares’ ARKB brought in $45.18 million. The surge in flows reflects renewed institutional confidence as spot Bitcoin ETFs regain momentum following weeks of market consolidation. The rally in ETF activity coincides with Bitcoin’s price rebound, which saw the asset hit an intraday high of $120,550 before pulling back slightly to $119,912 at the time of writing. Technical indicators remain bullish , with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) holding at 64.38 and the MACD histogram widening, both suggesting continued upward pressure. A confirmed breakout above $120,550 could pave the way toward $123,000, while near-term support sits around $117,000. ETF market data shows that BlackRock’s IBIT, listed on NASDAQ, now manages $93.95 billion in assets with 62.25 million shares traded on the day. Fidelity’s FBTC, trading on CBOE, holds $24.91 billion in net assets, while ARKB, also on CBOE, manages $5.43 billion. All three funds closed the day with gains near or above 2.9%. $IBIT has surpassed Coinbase's Derbit platform as the largest venue for bitcoin options with $38b in open interest.

Nice find by @sidharth_shukla pic.twitter.com/LUcnpW5g4I — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 2, 2025 Ethereum ETFs also attracted investor attention, posting $1.06 billion in inflows over the same four-day period. However, their daily figures still lag behind their Bitcoin counterparts, underscoring BTC’s dominant position in the current rally. The strong ETF inflows suggest that institutional demand is not only returning but accelerating, boosted by the start of October, a month historically known for bullish momentum in crypto markets. With $161.03 billion now locked in Bitcoin ETFs, representing 6.7% of Bitcoin’s total market cap, market watchers are closely eyeing whether this surge keeps momentum. Bitcoin ETPs Now Hold Over 1.47 Million BTC Data from HODL15Capital shows bitcoin ETPs now hold more than 1.47 million BTC, or about 7% of the capped supply, with U.S. ETFs accounting for 1.29 million BTC. BlackRock’s IBIT leads with 746,810 BTC, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with nearly 200,000. Bitcoin ETPs have amassed over 1.47 million BTC, accounting for roughly 7% of the cryptocurrency’s fixed 21 million supply. #Bitcoin #ETPs https://t.co/4xyi1EEzE1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 2, 2025 Globally, bitcoin ETPs have added 170,000 BTC so far in 2025 , worth $18.7 billion, though August brought net outflows of $301 million as investors rotated into ether funds, which drew $3.95 billion. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing 92 crypto ETF applications , including multiple Solana and XRP products. Franklin Templeton’s proposals for both tokens were delayed until November 14, while BlackRock’s Ethereum staking amendment was pushed to October 30. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 95% approval probability for Solana and XRP ETFs this year, with prediction markets putting Solana’s odds near 99% . Despite near-term outflows, digital asset inflows have bounced back sharply in September, with $2.48 billion entering funds last week alone.

Q3 2025 total losses: $509 million (down 36.6% from Q2) September recorded 16 incidents over $1M, the highest monthly total on record. Centralized exchanges led losses ($182M); DeFi accounted for $86M with mid-sized exploits predominant. Crypto hack losses Q3 2025: $509M total, down 36.6% vs Q2 — read analysis and protective steps. Learn what changed and how to respond. Crypto hack losses dropped 37% in Q3 to $509 million, but September saw a record surge in million-dollar incidents, led by exchange and DeFi exploits. Total funds lost to crypto hacks and exploits fell by nearly 37% in the third quarter of 2025, even as malicious actors shifted their approach from smart contract attacks to wallet-focused compromises and operational breaches. According to data shared by blockchain security firm CertiK, losses dropped from around $803 million in Q2 to $509 million in Q3, a 36.6% decline. Compared to Q1, when hackers stole nearly $1.7 billion, Q3’s losses declined by over 70%. Total amount lost and total amount of security incidents in 2025. Source: CertiK What caused crypto hack losses to fall in Q3 2025? Reduced code-exploit losses and stronger audit practices were primary factors. CertiK reported code-vulnerability losses fell from $272 million in Q2 to $78 million in Q3, indicating improvement in code hardening and vulnerability remediation across projects. How did attacker tactics shift in Q3? Attackers moved from large-scale smart-contract drains to wallet-focused compromises and operational breaches. Phishing and social engineering increasingly targeted multisig setups and hot wallets, yielding mid-sized but frequent payouts. Why did September record a spike in million-dollar incidents? September recorded 16 incidents exceeding $1 million—the highest monthly total on record—driven by concentrated attacks on exchanges and DeFi projects and a rise in targeted operational compromises. Security incidents with over $1 million in losses in 2025. Source: CertiK Which sectors were targeted most in Q3 2025? Centralized exchanges led losses with $182 million stolen in Q3. DeFi projects were the second-largest target at $86 million , with mid-sized exploits such as the GMX v1 DEX hack (≈$40M) notable for later partial restitution via a $5M bounty. Losses by project type in Q3 2025. Source: CertiK Are new chains a heightened risk? Yes. Security firms flagged new ecosystems such as Hyperliquid for recent incidents (HyperVault exploit, HyperDrive rug pull). Emerging chains often have immature security operations, making them attractive to opportunistic attackers. How should platforms and users respond to evolving threats? Security experts recommend doubling down on operational security: strengthen multisig controls, enforce strict key management, increase phishing resistance, and require third-party audits before mainnet launches. Expert perspective Hacken CEO Yevheniia Broshevan indicated that state-linked groups—particularly from North Korea—remain a top threat, and that roughly half of stolen funds this quarter were linked to such operations. She urged centralized platforms and users in emerging ecosystems to intensify operational security and due diligence. Frequently Asked Questions How much did crypto hack losses change in Q3 2025? Q3 2025 losses totaled $509 million, a 36.6% decline from Q2’s $803 million, driven by fewer code-exploit incidents and improved code hardening across many projects. Which attack types fell the most in Q3? Code-vulnerability losses fell sharply from $272 million in Q2 to $78 million in Q3, suggesting audits and patching reduced the incidence of smart-contract drains. What immediate steps can users take to reduce risk? Users should enable hardware wallets, avoid reusing keys, verify multisig signers, and exercise caution on new chains and projects with limited security history. Key Takeaways Losses declined : Q3 total losses were $509M, down 36.6% from Q2. Attack pattern shift : From smart-contract exploits to wallet and operational breaches. High-value incidents rose in September : 16 million-dollar-plus events, highest monthly total recorded. Exchanges remain a primary target : Centralized exchanges accounted for $182M in losses. Action required : Platforms and users must prioritize operational security and due diligence, especially on new chains. Conclusion The Q3 2025 decline in crypto hack losses to $509 million shows progress in code security but also highlights how attackers adapt—targeting wallets, multisig and operational vectors. Continued industry focus on operational defenses, audits and user hygiene is critical to reduce future losses. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Crypto hack losses drop 36.6% in Q3 2025 as attackers shift tactics; September sets record for $1M incidents"", ""description"": ""Crypto hack losses Q3 2025: $509M total, down 36.6% vs Q2.

But while attention drifts to speculative tokens, traders are paying closer attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a project in presale with momentum that is difficult to ignore. Over half of its current Phase 6 supply has already been sold, and the price is holding at $0.035 for only a short time before climbing to $0.040. SHIB 500% Target Analysts are floating bold predictions for SHIB—some see a 500% surge ahead. One notable forecast by Javon Marks places SHIB at $0.000081, assuming it breaks out of its long-term downtrend and sustains momentum. The target reflects a technical setup where SHIB has reportedly cleared resistance and retested the breakout zone as new support. However, a 500% run isn’t a short shot—SHIB would need strong buying volume, increased utility, more token burns, and favorable macro conditions to carry the move. The memecoin’s large supply and weak fundamentals still pose major headwinds. In sum: while a 500% gain is possible under ideal conditions, it remains speculative without consistent follow-through and supporting fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Strength and ROI Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured attention across crypto charts because of its consistent presale progress. The project has raised around $16.7 million to date, with more than 16,750 holders already backing the vision. Out of the 170 million tokens allocated to this phase, 55% are gone, and the remaining supply is being chased quickly. The total supply of MUTM is capped at 4 billion, and Phase 7 is already lined up to raise the price by 15% to $0.040. For investors who joined early, the gains are striking. A holder who placed $5,000 in Phase 1 at $0.01 is already sitting on $17,500 by Phase 6, representing a 250% value gain. With the token projected to list at $0.06 in later stages, and with longer-term analysts eyeing $1 or more, the long-term upside is being viewed as far stronger than the majority of sub-dollar tokens in the market today. This is why experts are pointing to MUTM as one of the best entry points for anyone considering investing in crypto before the presale runs dry. Lending Mechanics and Platform Utility Beyond its presale traction, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart through its peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending systems. In the P2C model, a depositor could place $18,000 worth of BTC into the protocol, receive mtBTC 1:1, and earn on average around 13% annually — which translates into $2,340 in passive income for the year. Borrowers on the other side of the system will post assets as collateral, for example $4,000 in LINK, and borrow 75% of that value, or $2,800, while staying above defined collateralization thresholds. The P2P model is equally significant because it will serve tokens that are more volatile or less liquid, such as SHIB or PEPE. By isolating those risks, the protocol ensures that core lending pools remain protected, while still offering higher-yield opportunities for traders willing to engage with more speculative assets. To maintain system stability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on mechanisms such as overcollateralization, a stability factor to measure risk, liquidation triggers to protect solvency, and reserve factors that ensure sustainable liquidity. These mechanics directly address the concerns of investors who often wonder why crypto is down during volatile periods — by designing rules that protect the system, the platform is preparing for more resilient growth. Security and Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also prioritized trust. The project has undergone an audit by CertiK, one of the most recognized names in blockchain security. The Token Scan scored 90, while the Skynet Score came in at 79, backed by both manual review and static analysis methods. The audit was first requested on February 25, 2025, with a revised timeline on May 20, 2025. For community incentives, a $50,000 bug bounty program is live with clear reward tiers depending on issue severity, ranging from $200 up to $2,000. Alongside that, a $100,000 giveaway is running, with ten winners set to receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Transparency and engagement with its growing base are central to the project’s approach, which explains why its social channels already boast over 12,000 followers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched its investor analytics dashboard, complete with an ROI calculator and a leaderboard that highlights the top 50 holders. These tools empower participants to monitor returns and build competitive spirit in the community, making investing in crypto more engaging and transparent. Bullish Catalysts Ahead Looking at forward growth drivers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a roadmap that will see the beta platform launch, expected exchange listings on venues like Binance and the introduction of staking with buybacks to boost token demand. With liquidity management, institutional partnerships, and multi-chain expansion on the horizon, investors are lining up early. While SHIB may have speculative hype of 500%, the mechanics behind MUTM offer stronger fundamentals that align with realistic yet aggressive price targets. The presale will not stay at $0.035 for long. With Phase 7 approaching fast and the price locked to rise 15%, traders have only a small window left to enter before the next leg higher. For those scanning crypto charts today, MUTM is being highlighted as the sub-$1 gem that sets itself apart.

52605013,596704,1759485610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52605013.jpeg,World Liberty Financial: Trump Jr. Defends Company Against Political Accusations,https://bitcoinist.com/world-liberty-financial-trump-jr-defends-company/,"Donald Trump Jr. recently took a strong stance against criticisms surrounding potential conflicts of interest related to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the cryptocurrency venture associated with his family. At the Token2049 conference in Singapore, he dismissed concerns that investors in the firm might be trying to curry favor with the Trump administration as “complete nonsense.” WLFI Leaders Insist Political Connections Are Overstated During his interview with CNBC at the event, Trump Jr. emphasized the improbability of his father, President Donald Trump, or Zach Witkoff’s father, Steve Witkoff, examining blockchain ledgers to identify investors and determine any preferential treatment. “I don’t think anyone actually believes that my father or [Zach’s] father would be looking at ledgers on the blockchain to see who bought what, and that carrying any kind of favor,” he stated, reinforcing his view that such allegations were unfounded. As a co-founder of World Liberty Financial, Trump Jr. was joined at the event by CEO Zach Witkoff , who has ties to the Trump administration as the son of the former US Special Envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff echoed Trump Jr.’s sentiments, asserting that their business mission is significant, but their fathers’ political agendas are far larger. “They’re not focused on stablecoins, nor are they involved in a stablecoin business,” he added, seeking to further distance their venture from political ties. ‘Unprecedented Conflict’ Tied To World Liberty Financial Despite the firm’s efforts to establish itself in the cryptocurrency market, critics have raised alarms over its connections to the Trump administration, particularly as it seeks international partnerships and expands into areas like debit payments and tokenized assets. During their keynote address at the conference, both Trump Jr. and Witkoff sought to downplay any political implications, asserting that their company is “100% not a political organization.” While World Liberty Financial’s website states that a Trump-affiliated entity, DT Marks DEFI LLC, and members of the Trump family receive a substantial share of the platform’s revenue and hold WLFI tokens , it also clarifies that Donald Trump and his family do not occupy any formal roles within the company or its affiliates. The ongoing scrutiny of the World Liberty Financial platform comes at a time when President Donald Trump has publicly embraced the cryptocurrency industry during his second term, rebranding himself as a “crypto president.” In light of these developments, Democratic lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Maxine Waters, have called for investigations into World Liberty Financial, characterizing the company’s connections to the president as an “unprecedented conflict” that could influence crypto policy. When writing, WLFI trades at $0.20, recording gains of 7% in the weekly time frame. Yet, the token’s price is still 37% below its $0.33 record reached right after its September 1st debut.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $110K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Having gained over 10% in just 7 days, Bitcoin is so far today forming an inside candle on the daily chart. This is exactly what we’d like to see after such a strong rally. An inside candle like the one we’re currently seeing implies the token is taking a breather, and a break above it could trigger further explosive momentum. For clarity, an inside candle simply means today’s high-low range is within yesterday’s high-low range. A break to the top side here could lead to a strong continuation of the rally. That said, given how one-sided the move has been, it’s almost important that Bitcoin gives a short pullback, at least to retest the $118K resistance it broke on the way up, if not a little deeper toward the 50 EMA near $115K. Either scenario would be ideal and would set Bitcoin up nicely to not only retest its all-time high but also push further into uncharted territory. Canaan’s 50,000 Rig Order: What It Means for Bitcoin Security, Scarcity, and $HYPER October 2, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Canaan, a Singapore-based crypto mining hardware firm known for its Avalon rigs, has announced its largest deal in years — A 50,000 Avalon A15 Pro rigs sale to a US buyer. The institutional-grade order underscores how US companies are doubling down on Bitcoin mining, even as it grows more complex and costly. The US now leads as the world’s Bitcoin mining hub , controlling 36% of global hashrate, which underscores the country’s pivotal role in Bitcoin’s infrastructure. Meanwhile, mining difficulty hit an all-time record high of 150.84T , suggesting smaller players slowly getting squeezed out. For retail investors, Canaan’s mega-deal signals that institutions still see long-term value in Bitcoin. Rising hashrates mean stronger security, while increasing scarcity reinforces the case for $BTC’s upside. Together, these dynamics create fertile ground for emerging tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a layer 2 scalability solution that aims to resolve the Bitcoin blockchain’s sluggishness and high transaction cost. Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) in our detailed guide. $761M Bitcoin Bear Positions Liquidated in 3 Days: Rally Ahead for Altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper October 2, 2025 • 10:00 UTC According to CoinGlass, over $760M bearish Bitcoin positions were liquidated in 3 days . That’s because $BTC rallied almost 10% in the last week alone. All the way from $108K–$109K to $120K. As Bitcoin reclaimed $120K, speculation arose that the crypto king might conquer a new ATH, exploding past $124.5K soon. But at the same time, Bitcoin’s dominance dropped by 0.7% in the last two days. And that means one thing – top altcoins are primed for gains. One in particular became viral this week, with whales adding almost $1 million to its presale in 5 days. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building a Layer-2 for Bitcoin, increasing transaction speed and adding support for dApps and smart contracts. If you know anything about crypto, you know that these things could be historical for Bitcoin. That’s why whales are rushing as quickly as possible to buy into the presale – $HYPER is now $0.013035 but the price will increase in less than two days. Here’s how to buy Bitcoin Hyper now.

Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions.

From CEX Frontends to DeFi Powerhouses: The Rise of Non-Custodial Wallets Led by Best Wallet Token ($BEST) October 3, 2025 • 10:00 UTC 1inch co-founder Sergej Kunz believes centralized exchanges (CEXs) are set to lose their dominance in crypto trading. Speaking recently, Kunz said that in the next 5–10 years, CEXs will no longer hold custodial control of assets and will instead function mainly as frontends for trades executed on-chain via smart contracts. Currently, Centralized exchanges isolate liquidity within their own platforms. Alternatively, 1inch’s aggregator pools liquidity across multiple DEXs , giving investors access to better pricing, deeper markets, and lower slippage. As this model scales, Kunz predicts that aggregated, cross-chain liquidity will replace centralized order books as the center of trading. This move also underscores the rising importance of non-custodial wallets, which Kunz views as the future of finance. Among them, Best Wallet has gained momentum as a next-gen Web3 wallet offering seamless DeFi access. At the center of its ecosystem is the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , currently in presale and drawing strong investor interest. Whales are already circling in stacking their bags with $BEST worth $70.2K and $50.9K . Here’s how to buy Best Wallet Token. Pump.fun Rallied 37% to $0.0069 in the Last Week, Accelerating Meme Coin Hype: Is Maxi Doge the Next Crypto to Explode? October 3, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Pump.fun has jumped by 37% in the last week , reaching $0.0069. According to the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), there’s increasing demand for $PUMP at the moment. The MACD is also showing good momentum, and if these two technicals converge, we could see $PUMP test its $0.0090 ATH after breaching $0.0077. All this translates to good potential for other meme coins – after all, the meme market is very cohesive. One token pumping often leads to a trickling-down effect on others. And Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is perfectly positioned to capture that hype. It’s Dogecoin’s younger cousin who’s always wanted to escape the king’s shadow. So, it opened its own presale, and traders have already added over $2.7M to it. $MAXI is now $0.0002605, and you can also stake it for 125% immediately after purchase. Here’s how to buy Maxi Doge if you’re interested.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-to-xrp-investors-xrp-time-is-here-heres-why/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld has emphasized XRP’s historical strength during periods of monetary policy shifts, particularly interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve . In his recent video commentary, he highlighted that during September of last year, XRP significantly outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum following the Fed’s decision to lower rates. He suggested that the current environment may mirror that trend, with the potential for XRP to again gain strongly than its peers. #XRP TIME IS HERE! pic.twitter.com/gXUFrmaXZv — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 30, 2025 Partnerships and Institutional Engagement Rietveld highlighted XRP’s growing connections with major institutions, underscoring that partnerships with global financial giants could favor the asset within the digital currency sector. His remarks included references to associations with BlackRock , one of the largest asset managers worldwide. While BlackRock has not officially confirmed a partnership, the broader conversation about institutional involvement continues to generate attention. The Prospect of an XRP ETF The discussion about a potential XRP exchange-traded fund remains a focal point for market watchers. According to reports, BlackRock has been cautious and deliberate in its approach to digital assets. It previously applied the same strategy before the launch of its spot Bitcoin ETF. Robbie Mitchnick, the firm’s Global Head of Digital Assets, has explained that investor demand, market maturity, and liquidity are central to determining whether BlackRock would pursue an XRP ETF. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Although regulatory clarity is improving after the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, outstanding questions about XRP’s classification continue to shape institutional decisions. Industry observers note that BlackRock is monitoring regulatory developments closely, with the possibility of a move when conditions align with its internal requirements. If an XRP ETF were to be launched under favorable conditions, it could enhance accessibility for traditional investors and solidify XRP’s role in broader financial markets. Rietveld concluded his remarks by projecting strong performance for XRP in the next three to six months. He emphasized that with rate cuts already underway and likely to continue, the environment could provide an advantageous backdrop for assets like XRP. His perspective suggests that macroeconomic policy shifts, combined with growing institutional engagement, may align to support renewed momentum for the asset.

Speaking at Circle Forum Singapore, Yam Ki Chan, Circle’s VP for APAC, stated that 56% of institutions across Asia are already live with stablecoins, the highest adoption rate worldwide, actively transacting for payments, settlements, and treasury purposes. Asia has the highest adoption rate of stablecoins worldwide. At Circle Forum Singapore, we explored how APAC is embracing onchain finance, with $2.4 trillion of activity from June 2024 to June 2025.

Monthly transaction volumes grew from under $100 million in early 2023 to over $3 billion by early 2025, driven by cross-border corporate payments, travel, luxury retail, and high-value goods sectors. This regional surge coincides with the global stablecoin market capitalization surpassing $300 billion for the first time, with Tether’s USDT maintaining 58% market share at $176.3 billion, followed by Circle’s USDC at $74 billion. Source: DefiLlama The sector’s 20% quarterly growth in Q3 2025 outpaced traditional asset classes, driven by institutional interest and the US GENIUS Act , which provided regulatory clarity. Hong Kong and Japan Race to Issue Regulated Local Currency Stablecoins The momentum has accelerated regulatory action across major Asian financial centers. Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Bill took effect on August 1 , establishing one of the world’s first comprehensive licensing regimes. Immediately, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority received inquiries from more than 40 companies , with application deadlines set for September 30. Among the most significant applicants, Bank of China Hong Kong’s shares jumped 6.7% on September 1 after reports revealed the state-owned lender is preparing to apply for a stablecoin issuer license. The bank formed a task force to study stablecoin issuance, potentially positioning itself as a rival to the digital yuan. The competition also intensified as Animoca Brands established Anchorpoint Financial Limited in collaboration with Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong and HKT, submitting a formal interest to the HKMA on August 1. @animocabrands partners with Standard Chartered to launch Hong Kong stablecoin venture targeting first issuer license as $261B market reaches 22-month growth streak. #HongKong #Stablecoin https://t.co/kTHeEWsGR8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 8, 2025 Publicly listed companies raised over $1.5 billion in July to fund stablecoin ventures, with a dedicated stock index surging 65% this year. While Hong Kong races to build its stablecoin infrastructure, Japan is moving on a parallel track. The country’s Financial Services Agency is expected to approve the first yen-denominated stablecoin this month , with Tokyo-based JPYC spearheading the launch. The firm plans to issue 1 trillion yen worth of JPYC over three years, approximately $6.8 billion, with interest from hedge funds and family offices for carry trade strategies. Building on this momentum, SBI Holdings and SBI Shinsei Bank invested $50 million into Circle following its June NYSE debut, which saw shares surge from $31 IPO price to close at $83. The companies established a joint venture, Circle SBI Japan KK, to accelerate USDC integration with Japan’s financial system. Visa and Ant Group Scale Cross-Border Payment Infrastructure Beyond regulatory frameworks, major payment providers are racing to capture stablecoin transaction flows. Visa announced on September 30 that it had begun testing a system enabling businesses to fund cross-border payments using stablecoins, rather than pre-depositing cash into local accounts. Credit card giant @Visa has begun testing stablecoin-powered cross-border payments, marking a major step in digital tokens gaining acceptance among global finance players. #Visa #Stablecoins https://t.co/bJwqFJe5tc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 30, 2025 The pilot, through Visa Direct, targets banks and remittance firms that hold funds in multiple currencies. The payments giant has already processed over $200 million in cumulative stablecoin settlement volume and plans to expand the program in 2026. Similarly, Ant Group plans to apply for stablecoin licenses in Hong Kong , Singapore, and Luxembourg. The Jack Ma-backed fintech’s international unit processed over $1 trillion in transactions last year, with one-third of these routed through its proprietary blockchain network, Whale. The company’s overseas arm reported nearly $3 billion in revenue for 2024. Singapore has also positioned itself as a key enabler of this expansion. The Monetary Authority hosted the inauguration of Circle’s Asia-Pacific office in May 2025, while Singapore-based businesses, including Wetrip travel agency, Capella Hotels, and luxury reseller Ginza Xiaoma, adopted stablecoins as payment options. The city-state serves as a pivotal gateway for cross-border transactions between China and the rest of the APAC region. Looking ahead, analysts project that stablecoins could handle 5-10% of cross-border transactions globally by 2030, translating to trillions of dollars in transaction volume.

Why Trump’s portfolio went up in Q3 Two forces explain the uptick, and neither looks like classic “buying the dip.” First, Trump’s wallet has continued to receive inbound transfers and unsolicited airdrops. Arkham has documented how meme-token creators often send coins directly to Trump’s public address in a bid for attention, with Trump Frog (TROG) and other “frog” tokens among the examples. These inflows add to the marked-to-market wallet value without any active purchases by Trump himself. Second, speculative flows into Trump-themed tokens have surged at times. Media coverage has highlighted how Trump-branded digital assets come with their own incentives, including exclusive event access for top holders and coordinated promotional pushes. These dynamics periodically ignite rallies across the Trump-linked ecosystem, temporarily inflating the on-chain value of the assets sitting in his wallet. Is Trump managing crypto in the account? Arkham ties the wallet entity to Trump through prior financial disclosures and royalty-linked inflows from his NFT projects, but that does not prove he is the day-to-day manager. Recent Coinbase-linked activity shows that after a large deposit, just 0.05 ETH remained, suggesting that proceeds were quickly converted or moved off the address. The overall composition of holdings further supports the idea that the wallet receives value, often in the form of donations, illiquid meme tokens, or unsolicited airdrops, rather than deploying capital in any deliberate strategy. The Q3 gains should therefore be viewed as paper appreciation on inbound flows rather than fresh investments. World Liberty Financial Beyond his personal wallet, the Trump family’s footprint in crypto extends into World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance platform promoted as a patriotic alternative to Wall Street. Finbold research also highlighted in its Q3 report that WLFI recorded one of the most eye-catching shifts anywhere in the digital asset market in Q3, with its holdings skyrocketing from $179.3 million on July 1 to $10.81 billion by September 30, a staggering 5,931% increase in just three months. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); The surge reflects a mix of aggressive token issuance, thin liquidity, and politically charged enthusiasm. WLFI expanded its token supply dramatically during the quarter, while Trump-affiliated promotion fueled demand among supporters who see the project not only as an investment but also as a political statement. At the same time, the on-paper valuation raises questions about sustainability. Much of the $10.8 billion market capitalization is concentrated in a handful of wallets and liquidity pools, where even modest trading volumes can magnify prices. That leaves the project vulnerable to sharp swings if enthusiasm cools. Even so, WLFI’s dramatic growth highlights how Trump’s name continues to act as a powerful accelerant in speculative markets. Unlike his personal crypto wallet, which largely reflects passive inflows from NFT royalties and meme-driven transfers, WLFI is an actively promoted DeFi platform with clear political overtones.

Digital tenge acts as legal tender for interbank settlement and monetary policy. Evo stablecoin is state-linked and tailored for ecosystem payments and cross-border activity. Kazakhstan’s dual-track model aims to boost financial sovereignty and attract crypto projects; the CBDC launched in 2023 and Evo rolled out in September 2025. Digital tenge pilot and Evo stablecoin: Kazakhstan advances a two-track digital-assets strategy to boost payments, sovereignty and crypto hub ambitions — learn what this means. Kazakhstan is advancing a dual model by piloting its digital tenge CBDC alongside the Evo stablecoin as part of its push to be a crypto hub. Kazakhstan is moving forward with a dual-track approach to digital assets, piloting its central bank digital currency (CBDC) while also backing a state-linked stablecoin. In September, the National Bank of Kazakhstan launched the Evo stablecoin in collaboration with Solana and Mastercard, marking one of the first cases of state-backed stablecoin development worldwide. The central bank has also been progressing with its CBDC, digital tenge , which launched in 2023. Berik Sholpankulov, deputy governor of the National Bank of Kazakhstan, said the Evo stablecoin and the digital tenge present integration opportunities and interoperability rather than competition. Sholpankulov confirmed the digital tenge pilot is ongoing, adding new participants and projects, and that lawmakers are working to establish the digital tenge as legal tender equal to fiat money. What is the digital tenge and how does it differ from the Evo stablecoin? Digital tenge is the national CBDC pilot intended as legal tender and a tool for interbank settlement, while the Evo stablecoin is a state-linked private token focused on specific ecosystems and commercial payments. The CBDC supports monetary policy; Evo targets user adoption and cross-border use. How will Kazakhstan integrate CBDC and stablecoins? Kazakhstan plans interoperability layers and clear regulation to let the digital tenge underpin settlement rails while allowing Evo and other stablecoins to serve businesses and consumers. The central bank sees the CBDC as a guarantor for payments and as a foundation for fintech innovation. Private issuers can build on CBDC rails without requiring direct bank settlement, expanding payment options across public and private networks. Berik Sholpankulov, deputy governor of the National Bank of Kazakhstan, during a policy briefing on digital asset regulation, May 2025. Source: YouTube Why adopt a two-tier system: CBDC for banks, stablecoins for ecosystems? Officials describe a two-tier model: a central-bank-issued digital tenge for policy and interbank settlement, and ecosystem stablecoins such as Evo for commercial payments and cross-border transactions. Talgat Dossanov, founder of Intebix exchange (issuer partner for Evo) emphasized complementary roles: the CBDC reinforces financial sovereignty while the stablecoin accelerates global crypto integration and practical payments. What evidence supports the approach? Kazakhstan has already allowed regulatory fees in USDt, launched a spot Bitcoin fund, and moved toward a state-backed crypto reserve. Meetings with industry figures and initiatives in tokenization and KZTx discussion show active public-private engagement. Frequently Asked Questions Will the digital tenge replace cash? The digital tenge is intended to be legal tender and coexist with cash, enhancing settlement efficiency rather than immediately replacing physical currency. Can Evo and the digital tenge be exchanged? Regulatory frameworks aim to enable conversion and interoperability between the digital tenge and ecosystem stablecoins under supervised conditions to protect stability. Key Takeaways Dual-track strategy : CBDC (digital tenge) for policy and settlement; Evo for ecosystem payments. Financial sovereignty : CBDC strengthens national control while stablecoins enable market growth. Practical next steps : Expect regulatory integration, pilot expansion, and public–private tokenization initiatives. CBDCs versus stablecoins. Source: B2BinPay When will the digital tenge enter full circulation? Authorities state that once the regulatory framework is complete, the digital tenge will enter circulation as a means of payment and a guarantor on behalf of the national bank. Kazakhstan’s parallel rollout reflects a broader ambition to be Central Asia’s crypto hub. The country’s initiatives — regulatory fees in stablecoins, spot crypto funds, and state discussions on tokenization — indicate a deliberate push to blend sovereign payment infrastructure with private-sector crypto innovation. Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev (left) met with former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao on Thursday. Source: Press office of the President of Kazakhstan How does this affect international partners? Kazakhstan’s model offers a blueprint for emerging markets prioritizing currency sovereignty and practical payments. International firms and exchanges may engage via approved partnerships and tokenization projects under national rules. Conclusion The dual-track deployment of the digital tenge and the state-linked Evo stablecoin positions Kazakhstan to secure monetary sovereignty while attracting crypto innovation. Expect expanded pilots, clearer regulation, and growing integration between public CBDC rails and private stablecoin ecosystems.

As Dogecoin leaps and SHIB consolidates, a majority of investors are thinking about where long-term growth can be achieved. Although both communities are dedicated, a greater number of SHIB holders are turning toward utility-based tokens like Remittix (RTX) now CertiK Verified and Ranked #1 for Pre-Launch Tokens. This shift highlights a maturing market that increasingly values real-world utility and trust over pure speculation. SHIB And Dogecoin Price Action Illustrate Renewed Meme Coin Interest The Shiba Inu Price has appreciated 2.38% in the last 24 hours, changing hands for $0.00001257 with a $7.43B market cap and $229.13 million daily volume — up 29.9%. Dogecoin (DOGE) has also jumped 7.36%, reaching $0.2575 with a $38.91B market capitalization and $3.53B worth of trading volume, an increase of 66.36%. This resurgence shows that interest in meme-based digital currencies is there once again, although skepticism regarding their long-term survival remains. Several SHIB Price watchers and Dogecoin Price Prediction trackers now view DeFi projects with tangible real-world use cases, like Remittix, as the future of crypto. Remittix Beta Wallet Live With Cross-Border Payment Utility Remittix (RTX) is emerging as one of the leading crypto presale 2025 projects, combining real-world adoption and cross-chain DeFi innovation. Its Beta Wallet is already live, enabling direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, and supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. The platform’s real-time FX conversion, transparent rates, and low gas fee crypto design render it ideal for freelancers, remitters, and businesses in search of borderless payments. This focus on utility ranks RTX among the best crypto under $1 and crypto solving real world problems as an alternative to purely speculative meme coins. Verified By CertiK And CEX Listings Announced In a milestone achievement, the Remittix team is now VERIFIED by CertiK, the world’s leading blockchain security auditor, and Ranked #1 on CertiK for Pre-Launch Tokens. This achievement enhances trust, transparency, and credibility in an upcoming cross-chain DeFi project. Remittix has surpassed $26.9 million raised with 673 million+ tokens sold, showing strong investor demand.

With the U.S. government shutdown and traditional market indicators like employment reports delayed, traders are leaning into alternative assets, especially bitcoin and gold. BTC climbed to $120,000 after rallying 9% this week, while gold rose 2.9% to touch $3,900. The shutdown has furloughed over 90% of SEC staff and left the CFTC with a skeleton crew. Reacting to the shutdown markets rallied, as investors see the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates by 25 bps later this month as a near certainty over an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls and a delay in other key economic data. “Traders have lacked immediate catalysts, evidenced by subdued commitment following the FOMC meeting, even as gold and equities have posted strong gains. However, the broader trend remains higher as we move into a rate-cutting cycle,” Jake Ostrovskis, Head of OTC Trading at Wintermute, told CoinDesk. Lower interest rates make risk assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive, and that’s coming in a month where sentiment is high given historical performance. ""October has historically been a bullish month for Bitcoin, and early signs suggest this year may be no exception . "" said Gadi Chait of Xapo Bank, in an emailed statement. ""Far from being a speculative outlier, bitcoin continues to show its ability to defy the odds and assert itself as a digital asset with staying power.” On-chain data backs that up. Apparent bitcoin demand has grown by roughly 62,000 BTC per month since July , according to CryptoQuant, driven largely by ETFs and whales. For context, ETF holdings surged by 71% in fourth-quarter 2024. On top of that, the crypto-native market has kept on growing. “Over the past month, DeFi’s share of trading activity has been climbing significantly, expanding both the market and our opportunity,” dYdX Labs President Eddie Zhang told CoinDesk. “A big driver of this shift is the renewed energy and participation we’re seeing out of Asia. We believe DeFi is beginning to fulfill its long-standing promise, and the pace of market adoption is accelerating in response."" Looking ahead, crypto markets are anticipating other potential catalysts: ETF decisions for several altcoins including solana and XRP that could be delayed over the shutdown, and Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade, which is slowly moving closer.

Day 2 of 3: Lightning Plus Plus Berlin Oct. 3: DePIN Day Singapore 2025 Token Talk By Oliver Knight The crypto market rose on Friday with tokens including ETH, SOL and XRP all rising more than 2%, while smaller altcoins like ETHFI and CAKE climbed as much as 25%. The relative strength comes as bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit $120,000 on Thursday as it takes aim at August's record high above $124,000. Still, unlike previous forays above $120,000, this move has been rather muted; with the price remaining in a tight range as opposed to a spike in volatility. This bodes well for altcoins, which typically perform well when bitcoin consolidates as it allows capital to rotate from bitcoin to more speculative bets. However, the upside shift has not been kind to a select few tokens, notably MYX Finance (MYX), which was dealt a grueling 43% decline due to a rapid unwind of leverag e. Plasma's XPL token, as reported in Thursday's Daybook , continues to stutter amid speculation around whether market makers are shorting on behalf of the founding team, a claim that XPL founders have denied. Derivatives Positioning The BTC futures market remains strongly bullish, with open interest holding at all-time highs above $32 billion. The three-month annualized basis is also elevated, approaching 8%. A notable divergence exists, however, in funding rates. Deribit's rate is exceptionally high at 25%, while other exchanges like Bybit show more neutral funding, suggesting a potential concentration of aggressive long positions in specific areas. The BTC options market is showing a state of neutrality. The 24-hour put-call volume is still slightly call-dominated at 52.25%, but this is a decrease from previous days, indicating a potential moderation of bullish conviction. Concurrently, the 1-week 25 delta skew is now essentially flat at 0.33%, signaling a balanced implied volatility for both puts and calls. This combination of metrics suggests a market that is settling into a more balanced and hesitant phase after a period of stronger bullish sentiment. Coinglass data shows $380 million in 24 hour liquidations, with a 35-65 split between longs and shorts. Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $121,300 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price rise.

While the price is trading above all key EMAs on the daily, it is currently within a bearish daily order block, an area of interest for a potential pullback.

Analyst Predicts Ripple to Hit Double Digits,https://cryptopotato.com/face-melting-xrp-rally-ahead-analyst-predicts-ripple-to-hit-double-digits/,"The past week or so has seen the resurgance of countless cryptocurrency assets. Bitcoin went above $120,000 for the first time since mid-August, BNB charted another ATH, while some alts, such as ZEC, posted triple-digit gains. XRP is also well in the green, trading 10% higher now than it did last Friday. This increase, albeit impressive on its own, has fueled the XRP Army to outline some massive predictions for what’s next for the underlying asset. XRP literally has the opportunity to go for the most face-melting pump of all time pic.twitter.com/9NXg9DTScT — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) October 3, 2025 It’s worth noting that Cobb is among the most vocal participants of the Ripple community, and their predictions should be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, the popular commentator highlighted a massive target of well within a double-digit price territory for Ripple’s token. Their graph, which was mocked by some as a simple “straight white line,” shows that the asset could explode to somewhere around $14-$15. This does sound a bit far-fetched at the moment, given the fact that XRP is fighting to reclaim the $3.00 level. It would require a massive surge of roughly 400% and its market cap would skyrocket to $900 billion, which would make it nearly twice as big as ETH’s current valuation. While this might sound highly unlikely at the moment, XRP has proven that it’s capable of such increases in a relatively short time. Recall that it struggled well below $0.60 before the US elections nearly a year ago and exploded by over 500% by January 2025 to match its then-ATH of $3.4. Nevertheless, such mind-blowing price pumps in just a few months are easier when the underlying asset’s overall valuation is smaller, as it was this time last year. For now, the XRP Army needs to be content with the fact that the token has bounced above the key $3.00 resistance and has flipped USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

It marks the first time the AI sector has captured over 50% of VC dollars in a single year. However, observers have warned about a potential “hype bubble” that could cause problems later. Venture capitalists are spending billions, but mostly on funding AI In the US, which is the world’s largest market, AI startups attracted over 60% of the $250.2 billion in VC funding , confirming the sector’s dominance. Globally, VCs have invested $192.7 billion into AI startups so far this year, setting new global records and making 2025 more likely to be the first year in which more than half of total VC dollars were skewed toward the AI industry, according to data provider PitchBook. The majority of this capital has gone directly to emerging startups like Anthropic and xAI, which both secured billions in funding this quarter, while some lesser-known startups struggled. This was even more so for companies not AI-focused. “Everywhere we look, the market is bifurcated,” Kyle Sanford, a PitchBook director of research, said . “You’re in AI, or you’re not. You’re a big firm, or you’re not.” While the growth in AI funding is proof of how enthusiastic investors are about its potential, the “bifurcated” market Sanford described has become a growing concern, as it means firms and startups that are not deeply embedded in AI will struggle to attract capital. Already, the data shows that this year, the total number of companies to secure venture funding globally in 2025 may turn out to be the lowest witnessed in years, and so is the number of venture firms raising new funds. About 30% of all VC deals in 2025 have gone to AI companies, though the dollar concentration is even higher due to mega-rounds. In the most recent quarter, US VCs allocated 62.7% of invested dollars to artificial intelligence companies, and global investors allocated 53.2%. The potential hype bubble that could attract future conflict There is no doubt that investors are racing to find the next best or potentially profitable AI startup and are putting their money where their mouths are. However, observers and seasoned investors have started to warn that a bubble may be forming. GIC Pte’s chief investment officer is one of them. According to him, there is now a “hype bubble” forming in early-stage AI venture investing due to the high expectations people have of these companies to deliver. If they don’t, there could be issues rationalizing the record-level dollar commitments. CIO Bryan Yeo, who recently attended the Milken Institute Asia Summit in Singapore, also shares the same sentiment, going further to warn of a fiscal risk event, especially after governments around the world took on more debt during the pandemic. “The question is whether the world can grow out of this large stock of debt,” he said, adding that it is politically difficult for governments to have their electorates cut spending and raise taxes. When economies reach this point, they could ultimately scare global markets and lead to a loss of confidence in the country’s currency.

Why XYZVerse Might Outrun PEPE and SHIB with an 8,500% Surge",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-why-xyzverse-might-outrun-pepe-and-shib-with-an-8500-surge/,"A new digital token, XYZVerse, is gaining attention for its unexpected growth. With buzz building about its rapid rise, talk has emerged of returns that could outpace popular meme coins like PEPE and SHIB. This article explores what is driving this sudden excitement in the market and asks if XYZVerse could be the next headline-maker. PEPE Hops to the Top: The Frog Coin Shaking Up Crypto PEPE is a fresh coin on Ethereum that honors Pepe the Frog, the cartoon that spread across forums in the early 2000s. Supply burns over time, so the token is deflationary. There are no trade taxes and no grand promises; it is meme fun, plain and simple. In spring 2023 the frog leapt high, lifting its value to a $1.6 billion peak. Early buyers woke up as millionaires, and a wave of fast-made meme coins followed, rising and falling within days. The team now eyes bigger ponds. Phase one put PEPE on price sites and got it trending on Twitter. Next comes more exchange listings, ending with a bold “meme takeover” on top-tier platforms. Its simple code, low fees, and shrinking supply echo the early days of Dogecoin and Shiba, yet the frog carries a fresher buzz. With the next Bitcoin halving on the horizon, traders hunt for lively stories that could bloom in a new bull run. If meme fever returns, PEPE’s clear brand and loyal crowd may give it another mighty hop. Shiba Inu: Meme Dog Goes High-Tech on Ethereum’s Playground Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the scene in August 2020 as a playful rival to Dogecoin. Built on Ethereum, it can plug into many popular crypto apps. Its hidden creator, Ryoshi, launched a mind-boggling one quadrillion coins and sent half to Ethereum legend Vitalik Buterin. Buterin gave a large chunk to India’s Covid Relief Fund and burned the rest, cutting the supply by 40%. The bold gesture turned SHIB from a joke into global news overnight. Now the little dog wants bigger bones. Being on Ethereum lets coders build extra tools like ShibaSwap, while future plans include an NFT art market and a community voting system. Dogecoin lacks these add-ons. In today’s lively market, cheap coins with loud online crowds often rally the fastest, and SHIB still owns one of the noisiest fan bases. Ongoing coin burns keep trimming supply, which may help prices. If the cycle stays kind to playful yet useful projects, SHIB could remain a top pick among meme lovers. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.0055 by Stage 17, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Conclusion PEPE and SHIB are good, but XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, fuses meme buzz with sports zeal, aiming for an 8,500% rally during the unfolding 2025 bull run.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum had an excellent week after its price rallied by 14%. This allowed it to move close to $4,500, which may offer the required support to re-test the key resistance at $5,000. With sellers exhausted, buyers are back in control. Bitcoin also made sustained gains this week, which primed the market for higher levels. This can boost the momentum of Ethereum, which is turning bullish again. Looking ahead, a clear breakout above $5,000 would place ETH in price discovery and allow it to run much higher quickly. Should that happen, key targets are found at $6,000 and $7,300. Ripple (XRP) XRP closed the week 11% higher, which took the price above $3. This is a psychological level that can act as support in the future and provide a base for new highs with key targets at $3.2 and $3.6. To capitalize on this momentum, the bulls will have to push this cryptocurrency to make higher highs. That would imply a price level of $3.2 and above. Looking ahead, XRP appears to be finishing its consolidation between $2.7 and $3 and is ready for higher levels. If so, the ATH at $3.6 could be a major magnet for buyers in the last quarter of 2025. Cardano (ADA) Cardano also had a good week after it managed to hold above the support at $0.77 and closed with an 11% gain. This puts buyers back in charge, but their biggest test awaits at the $0.90 resistance. The bullish momentum is not quite there yet to break the key resistance, but if the overall market remains bullish, a breakout is only a matter of time. If successful later, then ADA has a real chance to trade above $1 again. Looking ahead, October started with a bang as most cryptocurrencies are in green. Cardano also appears poised for new highs if buyers can push it beyond $0.90. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin appears unstoppable after it made a new price record at over $1,100. This allowed it to close the week with a 16% gain, making it one of the strongest digital assets in 2025. The most important resistance, at this time, is found at $1,200, and the price could easily reach that in the coming days if this bullish momentum is sustained. That’s only an 8% price increase at the time of this post. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency is well-positioned to capitalize on the enthusiasm across the market that appears to be forming in the last quarter of the year. If $1,200 is broken later, look towards $1,500 next. Hype (HYPE) This week, HYPE finally completed its correction and managed to briefly visit $50 after a sustained rally that saw its price increase by 15%. With sellers gone, this cryptocurrency has already recovered most of its recent losses. To be confident in this rally, HYPE has to claim $50 and defend it as support. If successful, then it has a real shot at revisiting its all-time high at $60. Looking ahead, despite the volatility, the price continues to show a lot of strength. Even if attention was briefly directed towards other decentralized exchanges, this did not last, and liquidity returned to Hyperliquid, which is now reflected in its token price as well.

While SOL is hopeful, market focus is quickly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility-driven DeFi project already trending. MUTM phase 6 presale has already sold 55% of its tokens and the subsequent phase will be priced higher, hence the need for early investors. At just $0.035, MUTM boasts a twin lending economy and real-world utility, rendering it one of the top high-upside altcoins of Q4 2025. Solana (SOL) Poised for October Breakout as ETF Rumor and Firedancer Upgrade Loom Solana (SOL) begins October 2025 at a pivotal juncture with a handful of catalysts that will propel a possible breakout. ETF-related momentum is driving institutional demand, with Volatility Shares’ SOLT and SOLZ ETFs both reporting over 4% month-over-month gains, and Rex-Osprey’s SSK staking product also reporting strong inflows. Mid-October regulatory deadlines for SOL, XRP, LTC, and DOGE ETFs would grant Solana institutional-grade status, potentially freeing up billions of capital into the larger altcoin space. Furthermore, the Firedancer upgrade proposed by Jump Crypto’s team proposes the removal of fixed compute unit limitations, allowing validators to significantly boost network throughput and further improving Solana’s lead over other Layer-1 blockchains. As network innovation and ETF momentum converge, October may be make or break time for SOL, positioning it for new highs and redefining investor attitude, something the market is also hoping to see in high-potential altcoins, such as nascent utility-driven DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Reaches New Heights Mutuum Finance is causing a stir in the DeFi space with its presale, having pulled in over 16,710 investors and raising over $16.7 million so far. Phase 6 presale is currently 55% complete and selling MUTM tokens at $0.035 per token. As a gesture of appreciation to its early supporters, the team has also instituted a $100,000 giveaway , to award 10 winners 10,000 MUTM tokens each. The MUTM Ecosystem As an innovation leader in decentralized finance innovation in the industry, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles to enable secure exchange, lending, and settlement of tokens backed by USD and very liquid tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform offers robust data integrity through multi-layer protection including fallback oracle guards, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages, providing precise and consistent price data even in adverse market conditions. Mutuum Finance introduces a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that go haywire during bear markets, the token is non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and is designed to achieve price stability even in bear markets. The protocol has a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism whereby each asset has an associated collateral cap that is proportional to its risk factor. This keeps lending in proportion and at arm’s length. Apart from users’ security during difficult periods, the protocol also comprises a buffer reserve mechanism whereby riskier assets are assigned higher reserves as further collateral and to support subsidize the ecosystem. With its presale history, progressive risk management, and openness, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its place as a safe, stable, and innovative DeFi platform. Don’t Miss the MUTM Opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised more than $16.7 million from more than 16,710 investors, and Phase 6 of the presale is now 55% sold. Early adopters are still able to get tokens at $0.035 before the next phase sends the price upwards. With a $100,000 giveaway and a safe, risk-adjusted borrowing environment in place, MUTM offers upside potential and long-term stability. As Solana awaits a possible “Uptober” break, astute investors are eyeing high-potential altcoins like MUTM as the way to diversify and catch the Q4 wave.

However, she stressed he is not the only option. Christine Lagarde’s comments were reported by Dutch newswire ANP ahead of the release of a podcast episode of “College Leaders in Finance,” scheduled for broadcast on Sunday. Her own non-renewable term as ECB president draws to a close in October 2027. “I’ve known him for at least six years. He has the intellect, the stamina, and the ability to engage others,” the ECB head was quoted speaking in the podcast. She added that the job requires balancing the voices of the Governing Council, which includes the heads of national central banks from the 20 eurozone member states. “They’re often all prima donnas, and you have to facilitate them all,” Lagarde continued, “He has that ability. But he’s not the only one.” Knot ended a 14-year tenure in June as president of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Dutch central bank, which he had led since 2011. He handed the reins to Olaf Sleijpen, who was appointed by the board after he was nominated by Dutch Minister of Finance Eelco Heinen. Klaas Knot’s tenure at the DNB was long Knot attended several interviews shortly before leaving the DNB, where he opposed proposals to reduce the appointment term for future Dutch central bank presidents from seven years to five. According to him, shorter terms would limit the ability of national leaders to build authority in international institutions. “I became chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in December 2021,” Knot told Het Financieele Dagblad (FD). “That was ten and a half years after I took office as DNB president. With two five-year terms, I would not have reached that position.” He argued that such international roles are imperative for the Netherlands. “Only with a strong position in international supervisory bodies can the Netherlands respond timely to developments impacting its financial system,” Knot said. The former DNB President admitted his extended leadership meant everyone in management was appointed by him, which is a vulnerability policymakers “must be aware of.” However, Knot reiterated that during his time in office, he encouraged independent voices to speak up. “If you were a fly on the wall during our board meetings, you would see plenty of pushback.” During his final months at the Dutch central bank, Knot bashed the tariff policy of US President Donald Trump. Trump’s advisers had drawn up plans for tariffs on all countries except Russia, Cuba, Belarus and North Korea. “It has nothing to do with economic theory,” Knot told Dutch television program Nieuwsuur. “And if it were not so serious, it would be laughable. Countries are at different stages of development, and some of those require a surplus or deficit. There is nothing wrong with that in itself.” Lagarde mulls steady approach on eurozone inflation Lagarde’s succession remarks come just a day after the Eurozone inflation data was released. Speaking at a monetary-policy conference in Helsinki on Tuesday, she said risks to inflation in the euro area seem balanced, although policymakers should keep an eye out for new shocks. “The risks to inflation appear quite contained in both directions. With policy rates now at 2%, we are well placed to respond if the risks to inflation shift, or if new shocks emerge that threaten our target,” she explained. The ECB halved its deposit rate within a year to maintain economic growth, but there are hiccups that could ensue from the ongoing trade tensions with the United States. As reported by Cryptopolitan on Wednesday, annual inflation in the eurozone accelerated in September to reach 2.2%, the highest level since April. That compared with 2.0% in August and was broadly in line with economists’ expectations. On a month-on-month basis, consumer prices rose 0.1%, matching August’s increase.

The analyst of the banking giant added: By taking into account this volatility ratio, which implies that BTC currently consumes 1.85 times more risk capital than gold, then mechanically the market cap of bitcoin at $2.3tr currently would have to rise by close to 42% (implying a theoretical bitcoin price of $165k), to match on a vol-adjusted basis the around $6tr of total private sector investment in gold via ETFs or bars and coins…This mechanical exercise thus could imply significant upside for bitcoin.” Citi, in a separate research update dated October 1, introduced new 12-month targets and bookended scenarios for the two largest crypto assets. For BTC, Citi set $181,000 as its base-case 12-month target, with $231,000 in a bull case and $82,000 in a bear case. For ether, the bank mapped $5,400 (base), $7,300 (bull) and $2,000 (bear). An accompanying near-term update maintained year-end forecasts around $132,000 for BTC and $4,500 for ETH while transitioning coverage to 12-month goals. “We update our forecasts for Bitcoin and Ether into year-end ($132k & $4.5k) … and move to 12M price targets ($181k & $5.4k),” Citi wrote. The report highlights continued adoption by institutional allocators and financial advisers, while cautioning that a stronger dollar. “We expect the positive flow backdrop to continue, driven by increased adoption as crypto investments are initiated by institutional investors and financial advisors. The macro backdrop sees offsetting factors, as positive expected 12M equity returns are offset by forecasts of a stronger dollar and, in the case of Bitcoin, a weaker gold price,” Citi writes. Notably, the bank is significantly more bullish on bitcoin than ether: “We are more positive on Bitcoin compared to Ether, as it captures an outsized portion of incremental flows into crypto markets. There is inherent uncertainty reflected in the bull and bear cases based on transparent assumptions around investor-demand and user activity where the extent of value accrual to ETH adds another layer of uncertainty.” Market context helps explain why these upgrades landed now. Spot BTC hovered around $120,000 in early European hours on October 3, with year-to-date performance increasingly dominated by ETF accumulation patterns, declining exchange balances , and correlations that have drifted lower versus risk assets. At press time, BTC traded at $119,833.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin price prediction|btc|BTC news|btc price|Citi|JPMorgan,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 11:30:38

The milestone marks another historic moment for the token, which only recently crossed the $1,000 threshold for the first time in late September. Its rapid ascent has fueled intense speculation about how far BNB’s bullish momentum can carry it as the broader market gains strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dynamics Show Healthy Market Structure: Analyst Sets $130K Target This surge has also reignited debates about BNB’s position in the crypto hierarchy. With Ethereum still holding its dominance as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, some analysts are beginning to ask whether BNB could eventually challenge ETH’s place. While Ethereum boasts unmatched network effects, smart contract activity, and institutional adoption, BNB’s consistent performance and utility within the Binance ecosystem provide a strong foundation for its growth narrative. The move above $1,100 cements BNB’s reputation as one of the strongest performers in the current cycle. For investors, the question now is whether this breakout signals a new sustained trend or a moment of overheating that could trigger a correction. Either way, BNB’s rally has placed it firmly in the spotlight as one of the most closely watched assets in the market today. BNB Leads the Charge as Market Eyes Altseason The crypto market is heating up once again as major players begin to wake up, setting fresh structural highs across the board. Bitcoin is currently testing its critical resistance just below the all-time high, a level that has historically acted as the springboard for explosive rallies when finally broken. Meanwhile, Ethereum is establishing leadership among altcoins, with its recent strength signaling a shift in momentum that could spill over into the broader market. Within this backdrop, BNB has emerged as one of the standout performers. This breakout above ATH has sparked conversations among analysts who see BNB’s surge as more than just an isolated move. For many, it represents a potential leading indicator that altseason may be approaching. Historically, strong breakouts in large-cap altcoins have often preceded broader market rotations, as capital flows down from Bitcoin and Ethereum into other assets. BNB’s decisive performance has fueled speculation that the same dynamic could be unfolding now. Its utility within the Binance ecosystem, combined with strong liquidity and institutional recognition, makes it a natural bellwether for the altcoin sector. As BTC hovers near record highs and ETH sets the tone, BNB’s surge to fresh highs could be signaling that the next phase of the cycle is beginning. If momentum holds and capital rotates into other large caps, the conditions for a full-fledged altseason may be falling into place. For now, traders are closely watching BNB’s trajectory as it takes center stage in shaping market sentiment.

The price action over the past week has been almost parabolic, with BNB climbing steadily from under $980 to above $1,100 in just a few sessions. This surge underscores the intensity of current buying pressure as bulls remain firmly in control. The chart shows clear support from the 50-period (blue) and 100-period (green) moving averages, both trending upward and reinforcing the bullish structure. Each minor dip over the past weeks has been quickly absorbed, suggesting that demand remains strong. The 200-period moving average (red) continues to rise beneath price, providing a long-term foundation and highlighting BNB’s strong uptrend.

A healthy retest of the $1,080–$1,090 range could serve as confirmation of new support before another leg higher.

In his view, Ripple’s public silence on XRP was not accidental but a deliberate strategy shaped by legal advice. In the tweet, Morgan says, “Ripple may have been acting on legal advice not to comment at all on XRP in social media.” He argued that responding to inaccuracies could have created new problems for the company. If Ripple corrected false claims about XRP, regulators might have treated those comments as promotional, reinforcing the idea that investors were relying on Ripple’s efforts to generate profits. Ripple may have been acting on legal advice not to comment at all on XRP in social media. Correcting false information might have run the risk that the SEC would have argued that those corrective posts were intended to promote XRP and relevant to the issue whether investors had… https://t.co/AzDYgPsQzu — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) September 30, 2025 Ripple’s Cautious Approach Morgan explained that this risk was central to Ripple’s cautious communication style. He said that if Ripple had corrected misinformation about XRP, the SEC could have argued those responses amounted to promotional activity and linked them to investor expectations of profit tied to Ripple’s efforts. By holding back, Ripple reduced the chance of giving regulators evidence to strengthen their case. This means from around 2018 onward, Ripple drastically reduced its XRP-related discussions. Instead of engaging in public debates or correcting misstatements , the company stayed largely quiet, but was indirectly building utility around it. The Contrast with Bitcoin Promotion Morgan also compared Ripple’s position with the behavior of prominent Bitcoin advocates. He pointed out that “It was never able to promote XRP the way Michael Saylor and bitcoin maxis have shamelessly and incessantly promoted bitcoin.” While figures like Saylor openly championed Bitcoin as an investment, Ripple had to act with caution to avoid legal consequences. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This difference, Morgan suggested, is a key reason why XRP’s promotion looked so different from that of other cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin advocates could freely amplify their message, Ripple’s executives faced restrictions that limited how they spoke about XRP’s value or its potential role in the market. What This Means for XRP’s Journey Morgan’s remarks highlight how legal strategy influenced Ripple’s communications. Instead of actively promoting XRP, Ripple focused on building technology and partnerships while limiting public commentary that might have been interpreted as investment promotion. This strategy shaped the way XRP has been perceived over the years and helps explain why the token’s narrative often developed outside of Ripple’s direct control. For XRP holders, this provides important context. Ripple’s silence was not a lack of confidence in the token but a reflection of the legal risks involved.

Analysts set an initial upside target at $236 while $215 is the critical support that will confirm whether the breakout holds or fails. Breakout above long-term downtrend signals renewed bullish momentum and a near-term target of $236. Key support range remains $125–$150; $215 is the immediate line that defines trend risk. Volume-backed rallies and repeated rebounds indicate strong investor demand; current consolidation sits between $200–$250. Solana breakout: SOL trades near $232 after breaking a year-long downtrend; watch $236 upside and $215 support. Read actionable analysis and trade cues. What is Solana’s breakout and what does it mean for price action? Solana breakout refers to SOL moving above a year-long declining trendline and holding that level as support, indicating a shift from persistent selling to renewed buyer control. This breakout, confirmed by higher volumes, raises the immediate upside target to $236 while $215 acts as a pivotal support level for trend validation. How strong is the technical backing for Solana’s move? Volume increased during rallies, confirming participation on the upside. Rebounds from the $125–$150 support zone show sustained demand at lower prices. Market observers such as Rekt Capital and Man of Bitcoin (plain text sources) highlight that a clear close above $236 would extend bullish bias, while a sustained break below $215 would reverse the setup. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Solana breakout: SOL reclaims downtrend, $236 target with $215 support"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-81-1.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T09:00:00+00:00"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T09:00:00+00:00"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Solana breakout analysis: SOL trades near $232 after reclaiming a year-long downtrend; analysts target $236 with $215 as key support.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is Solana's immediate price target after the breakout?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Analysts identify $236 as the immediate upside target following the breakout, provided SOL sustains above the reclaimed trendline and trading remains above $215 support."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What support levels confirm or invalidate the Solana breakout?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key support zones are $125–$150 for long-term demand; $215 is the critical near-term level—sustained breaks below $215 would question the breakout's validity."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Solana's breakout and set trade levels"", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-81-1.png"", ""totalTime"": ""PT30M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm breakout with close and volume"", ""text"": ""Wait for a daily close above the long-term declining trendline with above-average volume to validate the breakout."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Establish targets and stops"", ""text"": ""Set an initial upside target at $236 and a protective stop near $215 to manage trend risk."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor support zones and momentum"", ""text"": ""Track rebounds from $125–$150 as longer-term support and watch volume for follow-through or failure signals."" } ]} Solana has broken free from a year-long downtrend, with analysts eyeing $236 as the next key level while $215 remains critical support. Solana’s breakout above its year-long downtrend signals renewed bullish momentum as traders now watch for the critical $236 resistance. Strong rebounds from $125 to $150 support zones highlight consistent investor demand, keeping Solana’s trading range between $200 and $250 alive. Analysts see $236 as the next upside target for Solana while warning that a sustained drop below $215 could shift the market trend. Solana reversed a prolonged decline in early October by reclaiming the declining trendline, which now acts as support. Market commentators such as Rekt Capital noted this pivot as a key structural shift for SOL. The token currently trades near $232.21, reflecting resilience after months of volatility and corrective phases. SOL’s 2023–2025 path included a base between $10–$25 in 2023, consolidation, then a sharp ascent above $100 by early 2024 and into the $200s by mid-2024. A strong rally between August and November 2024 pushed prices toward $265, creating a notable resistance band that has capped multiple advances since. Source: Rekt Capital How does Solana’s technical structure affect near-term trading ranges? The declining trendline that had pressured SOL for months is now a reference for support and upside tests. Consolidation between $200 and $250 is the immediate trading range; a sustained move above $250 would increase the likelihood of an extension toward the $265 resistance zone. Market strategist Man of Bitcoin (plain text) commented that SOL already cleared the 100% Fibonacci extension, reinforcing the $236 target while cautioning that a decisive break below $215 could signal renewed downside momentum. Traders should watch volume and follow-through candles when evaluating entries and exits. Frequently Asked Questions What price should traders watch for a confirmed bullish trend? Watch for a daily close above $236 with expanding volume; this level functions as the first confirmation that buyers maintain control and may extend the rally toward prior highs. How should risk be managed around the breakout? Use $215 as the critical near-term stop level and consider scaling position size to maintain risk below 1–2% of portfolio value per trade while monitoring lower supports at $125–$150 for longer-term holdings. Key Takeaways Breakout confirmed : SOL reclaimed a year-long downtrend and trades near $232 with $236 as the next upside target. Critical support : $215 is the immediate trend-defining level; $125–$150 remain longer-term demand zones. Actionable plan : Confirm daily closes and volume, set a protective stop near $215, and monitor $200–$250 consolidation for trade entries. Conclusion Solana’s breakout signals a notable shift in market structure, with SOL trading near $232 and a short-term target at $236 while $215 remains the critical support. Investors and traders should prioritize volume-confirmed closes and disciplined risk management as they evaluate opportunities, and watch consolidation for the next decisive move.",Analysis|News|BTC|SOL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-03 11:39:50

Nach Wochen seitwärtsgerichteter Bewegung sehen viele Analysten jetzt das Potenzial für einen weiteren Aufschwung. Besonders das bestätigte W-Muster auf dem Wochenchart sorgt für Optimismus. Aus dieser Formation ergibt sich ein theoretisches Kursziel von rund 127.000 US-Dollar. Dennoch bleibt die Zone bei 122.000 US-Dollar entscheidend, da sie in der Vergangenheit mehrfach als starke Hürde gewirkt hatte. Such a massive chart on #Bitcoin . It has taken all the highs and we're not far away from a new ATH. I suppose we'll start seeing a new ATH coming in during the next few weeks. The moment $BTC consolidates = party time. pic.twitter.com/xcNF68oBXm — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) October 3, 2025 Der bekannte Analyst Crypto Rover, dem über 200.000 Nutzer auf YouTube und 1,3 Millionen auf X folgen, sieht in den kommenden Wochen die Chance auf eine letzte, große Rally. In seiner Prognose nennt er Kursziele von 130.000 bis 137.000 US-Dollar, bevor der Markt in eine Korrekturphase übergeht. Historische Muster stützen diese Erwartung: Sowohl 2017 als auch 2021 bildete Bitcoin seine Zyklus-Tops wenige Wochen nach einem bestätigten Ausbruchsmuster. In beiden Fällen erreichte der Kurs innerhalb von vier bis sechs Wochen nach dem Bruch des letzten Widerstands sein Hoch. Rover geht deshalb davon aus, dass sich auch 2025 dieses Zeitfenster wiederholen könnte. Ausstiegsszenario des Großinvestors Seine Strategie ist klar: Erste Teilverkäufe bei 130.000 US-Dollar, ein vollständiger Ausstieg bei 137.000 US-Dollar. Rover betont, dass Disziplin entscheidend ist. Viele Anleger würden in Euphorie zu lange warten, nur um dann die Gewinne wieder abzugeben. Er selbst hat in seiner aktuellen Long-Position bereits über eine Million US-Dollar an Buchgewinnen. Dennoch sieht er es nicht als Ziel, das absolute Hoch zu erwischen, sondern planvoll Gewinne mitzunehmen. Auch charttechnisch lässt sich diese Vorgehensweise nachvollziehen. Über 122.000 US-Dollar wartet die nächste Widerstandszone zwischen 130.000 und 137.000 US-Dollar. Dort kreuzen sich gleich mehrere horizontale Widerstände und Fibonacci-Level, die in der Vergangenheit oft als Wendepunkte dienten. Für den Experten ist knapp unter 140k Schluss, Quelle: https://www.youtube.com Sollte Bitcoin diesen Bereich erreichen, wäre die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch, dass der Markt dort zumindest temporär eine Pause einlegt oder eine größere Korrektur startet. Zusätzlich spielen makroökonomische Faktoren eine Rolle. Der Oktober – in der Szene oft „Uptober“ genannt – gilt als einer der stärksten Monate für Bitcoin. Historisch schloss BTC diesen Monat in über 70 Prozent der Fälle im Plus ab, oft mit zweistelligen Renditen. Hinzu kommt, dass schwächere Wirtschaftsdaten aus den USA die Wahrscheinlichkeit für weitere Zinssenkungen erhöhen, was die Risikobereitschaft im Markt stärkt. Auch wenn die Aussichten kurzfristig bullish wirken, bleibt der Hinweis auf Risiken wichtig. Das Zeitfenster für ein Zyklus-Top ist eng, viele wollen gerade auch im Memecoinsektor noch Gewinne mitnehmen. Nach Einschätzung der Experten könnten in den nächsten vier bis sechs Wochen die Hochs markiert werden, Altcoins etwas später. Wer zu lange wartet, riskiert, in eine Abwärtsbewegung hineingezogen zu werden. Während bei Bitcoin damit ein Hoch rund um 137k angepeilt wird, könnten risikoreiche Memecoins wie Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER ) noch exponentiell steigen und deutlich höhere Renditen bringen. Neuer Rekord im Presale Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) hat im Presale die Marke von 21 Millionen US-Dollar überschritten. Noch Anfang der Woche stand das Funding bei 19 Millionen, doch innerhalb von nur vier Tagen flossen weitere 2 Millionen hinzu. Große Investoren haben durch ihre massiven Käufe diesen Schub ausgelöst, erst heute wieder. Viele sehen darin ein Signal, dass institutionelles Kapital frühzeitig Positionen aufbaut, denn frühe Investieren in mögliche High Riser bringt oft die besten Renditen. Auszug aus Etherscan, Quelle: https://etherscan.io/ Bitcoin Hyper verbindet die Geschwindigkeit der Solana Virtual Machine mit der Sicherheit von Bitcoin. Das Projekt ermöglicht Entwicklern, performante Anwendungen zu bauen, während BTC als Settlement-Ebene dient. Das HYPER-Token übernimmt dabei zentrale Aufgaben wie Gebühren, Governance und Staking. Damit zeigt sich eine klare Trennung im Markt. Während Analysten wie Crypto Rover bei Bitcoin auf ein nahendes Top verweisen und Gewinne sichern wollen, lockt Bitcoin Hyper Investoren mit einer frischen Wachstumsstory. Für viele ist das Projekt eine Möglichkeit, von Anfang an dabei zu sein – und damit vielleicht eine ähnliche Chance zu nutzen, wie es Bitcoin in seinen frühen Jahren war.

While the government shutdown is expected to have an impact on Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market as well as financial markets, it is also stated that it will delay altcoinETF decisions. At this point, the SEC has not made any decision, even though the deadline for the spot Litecoin ETF application was yesterday. Analysts stated that the deadlines for ETF applications have now expired, while cryptocurrency journalist Eleanor Terrett stated that the SEC needs to approve the S-1 documents, but the institution is currently operating with limited staff. While the SEC has not made a decision on ETF applications due to the shutdown, new ETF applications are coming. At this point, VanEck, one of the leading asset managers in the USA, applied for and officially registered the VanEck Lido Staked Ethereum ETF in the state of Delaware on October 2, 2025. Such a registration typically signals that a fund manager is preparing to file an S-1 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Registration does not automatically mean that the fund manager has received SEC approval. This move by VanEck indicates that it aims to bring its Ethereum (ETH) staking products to a wider investor base. This application also represents an early but important step towards the widespread adoption of staking products in regulated markets. VanEck's application was also reflected in the price of Lido DAO (LDO), and the LDO price increased by 4 percent in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice.

Year-to-date inflows stand at $22.8 billion, with $58.4 billion since inception. Bitcoin price has surged by more than 10% in the last 7 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $120,460 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 6% to stand at $72.4 billion. Bitcoin ETFs inflow. Source: SoSoValue Data Ethereum ETFs also saw heavy demand, pulling in $307 million on the same day. It marked a parallel four-day streak of net inflows. The rebound comes after a patchy September for digital assets, with traders now watching if Ether can build momentum ahead of any new product launches. BlackRock’s ETHA recorded over $177 million of inflows, leading the upward run for ETH ETFs. Fidelity went on to rake in $60 million in the last session, while Bitwise’s ETHW posted $46.4 million of inflows. Ethereum price has spiked by over 15% over the last 7 days. ETH is trading at an average price of $4,532 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 3% to $46 billion. Earlier, Cryptopolitan reportedly that VanEck filed to set up a Lido Staked Ethereum ETF under Delaware trust law. It is the first step toward potential approval by the SEC. SEC closure delays altcoin ETF season But while inflows are heating up, the broader ETF rollout is facing headwinds from Washington’s shutdown. The SEC has warned it will not review or approve new products during the closure. It has effectively put dozens of applications on ice. This includes funds tied to Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. ETF analysts had expected the first Solana-based products to gain clearance this month. That timeline now looks shaky. “ETF Cryptober might be on hold for a bit,” said Nate Geraci of the ETF Store. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, who dubbed the current cycle “crypto ETF approval season,” said issuers will simply have to wait until regulators are back at full capacity.

The company, which earlier this year revealed ambitions to build one of the largest Solana-based digital asset treasuries, continues to blend traditional finance strategies with blockchain-driven investment. According to the press release , the new stock repurchase program will enable the company to repurchase its shares in the open market and in negotiated transactions, reinforcing confidence in both its business model and digital holdings. Expanding Solana Exposure In August, Sharps Technology launched a $400 million private investment in public equity deal to fund its treasury strategy. The company disclosed that it holds about 2 million SOL, currently valued at nearly $448 million. That holding positions the firm as one of the largest corporate owners of Solana. Furthermore, Sharps recently partnered with Crypto.com to leverage institutional-grade custody solutions, underscoring its commitment to safeguarding assets while maximizing long-term flexibility. Sharps is not alone in this approach. DeFi Development also recently expanded its own stock buyback program to $100 million, signaling broader adoption of digital asset treasury strategies. Such moves reflect a growing trend where companies integrate blockchain assets into their corporate balance sheets while simultaneously pursuing traditional financial maneuvers to strengthen investor trust. Solana’s Market Momentum Solana’s recent price performance has added weight to these strategies. The cryptocurrency traded around $232 , with a market capitalization of more than $126 billion. Its price has climbed over 16% the past week, fueled by strong technical patterns. Analysts note that SOL has established a series of rounded bottoms followed by rallies, creating a predictable bullish rhythm. According to FOUR | Crypto Spaces, the token has posted three major surges ranging from 54% to 73%. Each rally started after a consolidation phase, reinforcing the idea of accumulation before breakout. The latest rebound from $200 support has reignited expectations for a move toward $300, a key resistance level highlighted on technical charts. Pullback and Rally Structure Trader Tardigrade points out that Solana’s daily chart mirrors a recurring pullback-and-run cycle. The cryptocurrency has consistently retraced about 24% before resuming its upward path. Source: X This time, the pullback bottomed around $188–$196 before SOL rallied again. With momentum building above $225 , traders now eye the $280 to $300 zone as the next upside target.

Wall Street pipeline: ~ $200B in IPO-ready crypto firms, $30–45B potential raise Institutional flows may reduce Bitcoin volatility and favor ETF-backed altcoins.

Wall Street capital is flowing into late-stage, IPO-ready crypto firms, signaling new dynamics at play for the incoming altcoin season. Wall Street’s growing interest in late-stage cryptocurrency firms could alter the market cycle for digital assets, according to research from Matrixport. Institutional focus is shifting toward scalable, IPO-ready companies that are positioned for public markets. Matrixport estimates that more than $200 billion worth of crypto companies are preparing initial public offerings (IPOs), which could raise between $30 billion and $45 billion in new capital. Source: Matrixport What are Wall Street crypto IPOs? Wall Street crypto IPOs are late-stage cryptocurrency companies preparing to list on public markets, attracting institutional investors and large capital raises. These IPOs typically come from exchanges, custodians, and financial-service providers and can inject substantial, more stable capital into the crypto sector. How could a wave of crypto IPOs affect the 2025 altcoin season? Institutional IPO proceeds can stabilize markets by increasing long-term, paper-backed capital. Matrixport’s assessment of a ~$200 billion IPO pipeline and a $30–45 billion potential raise suggests capital rotation away from early-stage, high-volatility bets. That rotation may reduce pure risk-seeking flows into Bitcoin while selectively lifting altcoins with institutional exposure or pending ETF approval. Onchain data and industry commentary indicate Ethereum (ETH) and a limited set of tokens are already showing outperformance. Key data points: Matrixport: ~$200 billion in IPO-ready companies; $30–45 billion potential capital. BitGo filing (U.S. IPO): reported about $90.3 billion in assets under custody and 1.1 million users. Multiple ETF filing deadlines in October 2025 could act as catalysts for select tokens. BitGo files for US IPO. Source: James Seyffart Why are ETFs and IPOs being called a route to a “paper-backed altseason”? ETFs create a regulated, institutional-friendly vehicle for exposure, which can concentrate flows into tokens with approved or pending ETF products. Analysts describe this emerging environment as a selective, paper-backed altseason—driven by institutional products rather than broad retail speculation. Industry voices supporting this view include Nic Puckrin (The Coin Bureau), who notes ETH outperformance as Bitcoin dominance slips, and Ki Young Ju (CryptoQuant), who labeled the trend “paper-backed altseason.” Source: Ki Young Ju When are ETF and IPO decision windows that matter? Several ETF filing deadlines fall in October 2025; specific dates have been set for Solana, XRP, DOGE and Cardano-related ETF decisions. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s responses in these windows could materially influence where institutional capital flows next. Separately, high-profile IPO moves—such as exchange funding rounds and custodian filings—signal which firms are closest to public-market readiness and therefore more likely to attract large allocations. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much capital could Wall Street crypto IPOs raise?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Matrixport estimates a pipeline of roughly $200 billion in IPO-ready crypto companies that could collectively raise between $30 billion and $45 billion in new capital."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will crypto IPOs reduce market volatility?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Institutional IPO capital tends to be longer-term and can reduce volatility versus pure retail flows, though selling by miners and early adopters can offset some inflows."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which tokens could benefit from ETF decisions?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Tokens with pending ETF filings or strong institutional narratives—such as ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE and ADA—are most likely to receive targeted ETF-driven flows."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Which major firms are preparing IPOs? Reported examples include large exchanges and custodians moving toward public listings; BitGo filed a U.S. IPO with ~$90.3 billion in assets under custody, and Kraken has reported late-stage funding rounds consistent with IPO preparation (reported valuation figures are cited in industry press). How should investors interpret institutional IPO interest? Institutional interest signals maturation: expect more regulated products, selective altcoin outperformance, and capital that may be less prone to rapid churn than retail flows. Investors should focus on fundamentals and institutional backing. Key Takeaways Large IPO pipeline : Matrixport identifies ~ $200B in IPO-ready firms, potentially raising $30–45B. Selective altcoin rally : ETF filings and institutional backing favor specific tokens rather than a broad altseason. Watch timelines : October ETF windows and high-profile IPO filings are primary catalysts to monitor. Conclusion Wall Street crypto IPOs are reshaping the flow of institutional capital into digital assets, potentially reducing volatility while enabling a targeted, ETF-driven altcoin run. Market participants should watch IPO pipelines, custody figures like BitGo’s, and scheduled ETF decision windows for signs of where capital will concentrate next.

With just three months left, optimism is mounting among investors who expect a sharp rally. Historical performance, reduced exchange reserves, and bullish community sentiment have all fueled speculation of a breakout. YourPOP’s Bold Forecast Shiba Inu community member YourPOP told his 250,000 followers that SHIB is on track to set a new record. He urged supporters to bookmark his prediction, maintaining that the token will surpass its previous all-time high of $0.00008845 this year. That milestone was achieved on October 28, 2021, after SHIB surged more than 150 million percent from its launch price of $0.000000000056. Since then, the asset has struggled through prolonged bearish conditions, with its price often stuck near $0.00001. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00001242, down 1.17% in the last 24 hours. SHIB Price Source: CoinMarketCap For the token to retest its record, it would need to climb 603.49%. This rise would place its market capitalization at $52.14 billion, assuming the current circulating supply of 589.24 trillion tokens remains constant. Community confidence in the projection has grown after analysts, including “Anonymous” and Eunice Wong, suggested that SHIB could even reach $0.0001 in 2025. Their views align with the broader optimism that the ongoing bull cycle could lift meme coins to new heights. Exchange Reserves and Q4 Track Record SHIB exchange reserves have fallen to a two-year low of about 84 trillion tokens. The reduced reserves often ease selling pressure, as more investors shift to self-custody. This trend signals a stronger preference for holding, rather than offloading tokens into the market. Another factor strengthening community belief is SHIB’s historical performance in the final quarter of the year. Since its 2020 debut, the token has recorded only one negative Q4. That decline came in 2022, when SHIB dropped 28.94%. In contrast, the last three Q4 periods showed strong gains of 364% in 2021, 41% in 2023, and 20% in 2024. Shiba Inu Quaterly Returns (USD) This positive pattern has set expectations high for 2025. Already, two days into the new quarter, SHIB has gained 6.45%. Supporters argue that the historical trend and ongoing accumulation could sustain momentum. However, critics continue to highlight SHIB’s massive circulating supply as a barrier to significant price appreciation. They warn that while short-term rallies are possible, surpassing the 2021 peak may be difficult without a meaningful supply reduction. As the countdown to year-end continues, all eyes remain on whether SHIB can replicate its past success. YourPOP’s forecast has intensified debate, bringing renewed focus to Shiba Inu’s community-driven growth. Whether the token reaches a new ATH or faces resistance, the next three months could prove decisive for its trajectory.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-03 11:54:32

According to an October 2 release, the country’s finance ministry said the Financial Intelligence Unit-India has already directed the exchanges to disable app and website access within the country. This comes after India noted that it is leaning towards not creating legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies in the country, instead opting for partial oversight, fearing that bringing digital assets into its mainstream financial system could raise systemic risks, as a government document reveals. The report cites the Reserve Bank of India’s ( RBI ) view that, in practice, regulating the risks of cryptocurrencies would be cumbersome. India put exchanges under the 2002 anti–money laundering law India’s FIU-IND has issued enforcement notices to 25 exchanges , 14 of which collectively saw $22 billion in trades in just 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Thursday’s enforcement action dates back to a March 2023 decision, in which the state brought crypto service providers under its 2002 anti–money laundering law and mandated that they register with the FIU and submit reports on their activities. Even so, India has stopped short of enacting a comprehensive crypto law, instead opting for piecemeal oversight. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) argued as recently as last month that regulating the sector effectively would be extremely challenging. To fill the gap, the country has turned to heavy taxation and compliance, levying a 30% tax on profits as well as a 1% TDS (tax deducted at source) on transactions, which has led to a decline in trading volumes in the country. The government still permits overseas exchanges to operate if they comply, as highlighted by Bybit resuming service after a ₹9.27 crore fine, equivalent to approximately $1.06 million, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). To date, over 50 crypto exchanges are registered with the FIU-IND. On-chain activity grew nearly 70% year over year Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and OKX were all hit with enforcement measures in 2023 and 2024. OKX chose to exit India, while the other exchanges complied with FIU rules and resumed their business. Many platforms had their sites and apps taken down until they complied with the penalties and registration requirements. Binance and KuCoin later restarted, although regulation remains heavy-handed. Despite the restrictions, Indians are estimated to hold roughly $4.5 billion in digital assets, while regulation limits systemic exposure. The country remains the largest market by transaction volume, supported by grassroots adoption, remittances, and fintech integration. Japan, although smaller in absolute volume, marked the fastest year-on-year growth of 120% by June 2025, pushed by regulatory reforms, broader investor participation, and increased usage of major digital assets. This growth highlights the diverse adoption models shaping the APAC crypto landscape. Offshore exchanges continue to view India as a prime market. Chainalysis ranked it No. 1 in global adoption for the third year straight, with India leading in retail, institutional, DeFi, and decentralized services. Between June 2024 and June 2025, on-chain activity increased by 69% year-over-year. Across India and the APAC region, crypto transaction volume has surged from $1.4 trillion to $2.36 trillion, drawing exchanges to the market despite stringent requirements. Separately, India aims to adopt the OECD’s CARF by April 2027, enabling cross-border reporting of crypto flows. A top finance ministry official stated that India plans to sign the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) next year, thereby establishing the legal framework for the automatic exchange of tax information. The country already joined the MCAA in 2015 for financial accounts, and the new version will extend to digital assets. The new system will track investors’ digital assets on foreign platforms and mandate reporting of trades on overseas CEXs. Tax experts warn that, once implemented, the regime will apply retrospectively, allowing officials to issue notices for prior undeclared gains.

With deadlines fast approaching, traders are watching closely. Alongside this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing quiet but growing attention, making some believe it could rival the gains expected in XRP and Solana. XRP ETF Countdown and Price Prediction The XRP ETF review is advancing quickly as asset managers rush to submit final amendments before the SEC’s October deadlines. Issuers including Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Canary Capital are adjusting their filings in line with the regulator’s new listing standards. Industry watchers like Nate Geraci suggest the countdown to launch has begun , with the possibility of approvals landing early next month. If greenlit, analysts expect the XRP ETF to attract traditional investors who prefer exposure without handling the token directly. On price outlook, XRP currently trades around $2.87. Market discussions suggest that if ETFs get approved, XRP could climb into the $5 to $7 range , mirroring the rallies seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum when their ETFs went live. However, traders are also mindful of the “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect, where prices spike briefly before cooling. Either way, ETF approval is expected to inject fresh energy into XRP price predictions. Solana ETF Outlook and Price Prediction Like XRP, the Solana ETF has entered its final stretch. Applications from Grayscale, Bitwise, and others are under review, with an October 10 deadline set for decisions. Some issuers have already amended their filings to address SEC requirements, signaling that approvals could be just weeks away. Well-known analyst Scott Melker has flagged Solana as one to watch in Q4 2025 . Many believe the token could climb back above $300 and possibly make a new all-time high near $500 if ETFs roll out successfully. His view is backed by Solana’s network speed, treasury initiatives, and the added credibility of an SEC-approved ETF. Solana’s current price of $201 reflects a quieter phase after its earlier rally, but many expect ETF flows and institutional interest to reawaken the asset. A surge in attention could make Solana one of the most closely watched tokens this year, with ETF approval serving as the spark. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Another Altcoin Heating Up Away from the ETF spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building traction. Over 18,000 investors have already joined , and listings on both DEX and CEX have been confirmed. Analysts whisper that while XRP and Solana may do 3X to 5X on ETF approval, MAGACOIN could stretch further, with predictions ranging between 7X and 12X. For those scanning the market for fresh plays, this altcoin is creating a sense of FOMO as people position early. The buzz is that MAGACOIN may outpace the very assets currently dominating ETF discussions. How Traders Can Position Themselves With the SEC countdown for the XRP ETF and Solana ETF underway, traders have clear timelines to watch. Keeping an eye on October deadlines is key. At the same time, diversification into promising altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE may prove timely.

Bitcoin may reach a new all‑time high within weeks if ETF inflows continue Standard Chartered notes BTC has diverged from the typical 18‑month post‑halving decline pattern. Net Bitcoin ETF inflows total $58 billion year‑to‑date, with $23 billion recorded in 2025. Bitcoin price prediction: BTC trades above $120k; institutional ETF flows and U.S. government risk signal upside—read the analysis and next steps. What is the Bitcoin price prediction after the April 2024 halving? Bitcoin price prediction is that BTC could continue climbing: current momentum above $120,000 reflects strong ETF demand and macro risk drivers, and Standard Chartered’s research suggests a path toward $135,000–$200,000 if inflows persist and risk premia remain elevated. How did Standard Chartered explain Bitcoin’s deviation from the 18‑month post‑halving pattern? Standard Chartered’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, explained that Bitcoin has diverged from the historical 18‑month weakness pattern because current market conditions differ materially. Kendrick highlighted the role of U.S. government shutdown risks and the relationship between BTC and the U.S. treasury term premium. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Standard Chartered: Bitcoin Diverges From 18‑Month Post‑Halving Drop; $135k to $200k Possible"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin price prediction: BTC trading above $120k as Standard Chartered notes divergence from post‑halving weakness, driven by ETF inflows and U.S. government risk."", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-standard-chartered"" }} Why is institutional demand important for the Bitcoin price prediction? Front‑loaded flows matter: net Bitcoin ETF inflows of $58 billion year‑to‑date signal sustained institutional allocation. Strong ETF creation and investor confidence can compress supply and push prices higher. Standard Chartered forecasts additional inflows could underpin targets up to $200,000 by year‑end. When did BTC recently trade above $120,000 and what does that mean? BTC traded above $121,000 during a recent surge and was around $120,420 early Friday, reflecting renewed momentum.

Prediction‑market sentiment shifted quickly: nearly half of users now expect BTC above $120,000 by October 15, up from 20% days earlier. This increased probability reflects recent price stability and growing ETF inflows. What are the main risks to this Bitcoin price prediction? Key risks include sudden ETF outflows, tighter monetary conditions, or unexpected macro events that compress risk premia. These could reverse momentum even if institutional demand remains positive. Key Takeaways Divergence from history : Bitcoin has not followed the typical 18‑month post‑halving decline, driven by different macro and market conditions. Institutional flows matter : $58 billion in net ETF inflows year‑to‑date, with $23 billion in 2025, are a central bullish factor. Watch indicators : Monitor ETF flows, treasury term premium, price support at $120k, and prediction‑market sentiment for near‑term signals. Conclusion Standard Chartered’s analysis suggests a bullish Bitcoin price prediction supported by robust ETF inflows and altered macro dynamics. Front‑loaded evidence—price action above $120,000 and sizable institutional demand—implies upside potential, while investors should monitor flows and macro risk for changes.

Rising credit stress, capital returning to Japan, and fragile currency dynamics are exposing cracks that demand faster, neutral solutions. Black Swan Capitalist founder Versan Aljarrah has spotlighted these issues, underscoring why XRP has become increasingly relevant in today’s global economy. Capital Rotations and the Yen’s Shifting Role Japan has long been the world’s preferred funding hub thanks to its ultra-low interest rates. For years, traders used the “carry trade,” borrowing low-yielding yen and investing in currencies with higher returns. However, recent policy shifts by the Bank of Japan and renewed foreign demand for Japanese assets have complicated this picture. The Yen has shown bouts of firmness, and capital is flowing back into Japan, reshaping traditional currency strategies. This change increases the stakes for institutions that depend on stable funding and predictable foreign exchange rates. As capital flows back into Japan and global credit markets tighten, the demand for a neutral, real-time settlement system beyond the dollar or yen is no longer optional. That’s where XRP matters. The reverse carry trade isn’t a threat, it’s what @Ripple anticipated all along. pic.twitter.com/DgM0w0oaTj — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 3, 2025 Tightening Credit Markets Increases Settlement Risk Global credit conditions are no longer benign. Liquidity corridors have narrowed, and corporate issuers face rising borrowing costs amid policy uncertainty. For treasuries and banks, this means holding large pools of idle capital in nostro accounts to support slow, cross-border settlement is becoming more expensive and less sustainable. Any sudden capital rotation — such as a reversal of carry trades — can magnify settlement risk and trigger liquidity crunches, making efficient, real-time payment rails more essential than ever. Versan Aljarrah’s Warning on Reverse Carry Trade Versan Aljarrah recently drew attention to these dynamics by sharing a video that explained the mechanics of the Yen carry trade and the dangers of its reversal. The content highlighted the fragility of global flows when the Yen strengthens or capital rotates back to Japan. His message is clear: the risks of FX exposure and delayed settlement are not theoretical — they are structural, and solutions are required. XRP as a Neutral, Real-Time Settlement Solution This is where XRP enters the conversation. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) leverages XRP as a bridge currency to enable real-time cross-border settlement without requiring massive pre-funded accounts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Transactions that once took days can now be completed in seconds, compressing FX risk windows and freeing up working capital. For banks and corporates facing tighter credit conditions and volatile FX markets, XRP provides operational flexibility and efficiency that traditional systems struggle to match. Competition Validates the Demand Importantly, incumbents are not standing still. SWIFT recently announced the development of a blockchain-based shared ledger to modernize its infrastructure and enable faster, more neutral settlement. This move validates the broader thesis: global finance is transitioning toward instant, interoperable settlement rails. Yet, while SWIFT prototypes solutions, XRP already offers live, real-world utility that institutions can adopt today. A Strategic Imperative for Treasuries Versan Aljarrah’s insights underscore a crucial truth — the global financial system can no longer rely solely on dollar- or yen-centric structures. The risks of delayed settlement and FX exposure are magnified in a world of tightening credit and volatile capital flows. For treasuries and banks, adopting neutral, real-time solutions like XRP is no longer an optional experiment but a strategic necessity. The institutions that move early will be best positioned to navigate the next wave of market dislocations. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Many digital projects come cheap for valid reasons, while others slowly build solid foundations before the broader crypto market spots them. For small investors, identifying projects under $0.01 and still offering value, purpose, and credibility can make a huge difference. Among these projects is Ozak AI , a new project currently in the sixth stage of its presale that has garnered significant attention due to its viable potential for growth and real-world utility. Why Best Cryptos Under $0.01 Matter for 2025 Cheap does not always mean worthless, and sometimes the best chances hide in plain sight. For newbies, cheap projects, especially those under $0.01, can be an easy entry because they offer small investors the opportunity to join the market without breaking the bank as much as top altcoins with higher value would require. Of course, not every token priced below $0.01 deserves attention, as most of them cannot boast of a clear roadmap and have no real function. What makes a token stand out is when the team shows both purpose and effort, proving that there is more to the low price. Why Ozak AI Presale Has Caught Attention Ozak AI has entered stage six of its presale , already selling more than 926 million tokens. At just $0.012 each, the project has raised over $3.51 million, suggesting that early confidence is not just from hype but from real interest. Its expected listing price sits at $0.05, leaving room for curiosity about how buyers might respond once it hits exchanges. The project has also been noticed outside its immediate circle. It is listed on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, plus it has been featured by platforms like CryptoDaily, Cryptopolitan, and Cointelegraph. For investors, these signs bring credibility, showing that the project is not operating in the shadows. Features That Make Ozak AI Stand Out Ozak AI combines blockchain with artificial intelligence to solve data and system needs. It is built on a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, known as DePIN, which uses IPFS to store and manage information across many nodes. That means no single point of failure and a system that is safe, reliable, and scalable. Smart contracts keep everything transparent and each transaction is written to the blockchain, unchanged and permanent. For industries that depend on constant real-time data, this kind of framework is not just useful; it feels almost essential. Partnerships That Push the Ecosystem Further The presale alone is not the whole story; Ozak AI has been forming key partnerships that expand its reach. Last month, OZak AI announced that it has teamed up with Dex3 to offer advanced solutions relating to liquidity while also enhancing trading experiences for its community. This follows its initial collaboration with SINT technology to enable users to upgrade smart systems with AI on the go, with the aim of showcasing how the protocol fuses convenience and ambition together. It is believed that these integrations will give the project's ecosystem the depth and further relevance and value that most projects lack. Also, it suggests that the team is not only raising funds but also building a structure that can hold value over time. Other Cryptos Under $0.01 Apart from Ozak AI , other projects with prices sitting below $0.01 include: Bonk (BONK) Bonk is a popular meme coin on the Solana ecosystem that made its presence felt a few years back when it surged beyond imagination before cooling off significantly. Its focus is on decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, etc. It is currently priced at $0.000019 Pepe Coin (PEPE) Pepe Coin, another altcoin with a price below $0.01. Also known as Pepe the Frog, PEPE attracted a significant following when it entered the crypto market in the early 2000s. With a trading price of $0.0000093, PEPE ranks among the topic cryptos under $0.01 Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy is a new Layer 2 project that aims to enhance the spread and scalability of Bitcoin transactions through the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Solaxy’s focus is on facilitating fast transactions and low fees Final Thoughts For small investors searching for the best cryptos under $0.01, OZak AI is worth adding to the watchlist, given its appealing features such as DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network). The increasing partnership deals, presale success so far and growing visibility add more confidence in the project, which is also under $0.01. It is still early days, and outcomes are never guaranteed, but the signs point to a project with both ambition and follow-through. If 2025 becomes a year for low-priced projects to make their presence felt in the crypto space, Ozak AI has already made a strong case for being at the front of that conversation.

These digital assets, often overlooked, can potentially offer substantial returns as they mature and gain market recognition. A standout in this category for its robust framework and strategic market positioning is Ozak AI . The Appeal of Sub-$0.01 Cryptocurrencies Investing in cryptocurrencies that are priced below $0.01 can be an attractive proposition for newcomers to the crypto world. These assets provide an accessible platform for investors to dip their toes without committing vast financial resources. However, the key lies in selecting tokens like Ozak AI that are backed by a solid project roadmap and clear usability, distinguishing them from less viable options. Ozak AI's Market Entry and Presale Success The presale phase of Ozak AI has been met with enthusiastic response from the investment community, with over 926 million tokens already distributed. Priced at $0.012 during the presale, the project has successfully raised substantial funding ahead of its expected listing price of $0.05, indicating strong investor confidence and market potential. Technological Edge of Ozak AI Ozak AI leverages artificial intelligence in tandem with blockchain technology, presenting a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) which employs IPFS for efficient data handling across diversified nodes. This ensures enhanced security and scalability, crucial for industries reliant on consistent data flow. The project's commitment to transparency and immutability is secured through smart contracts, ensuring every transaction is permanently recorded on the blockchain. Strategic Partnerships and Ecosystem Expansion Ozak AI isn't just about technical prowess; strategic partnerships play a pivotal role in expanding its ecosystem. Recent collaborations with Dex3 and SINT technology are set to enhance liquidity solutions and smart system integration for users. These partnerships not only provide technological leverage but also help in cultivating a reliable and expansive network. Comparative Look at Other Sub-$0.01 Cryptos While Ozak AI leads in innovation, other cryptocurrencies in this price range also vie for attention. Notables include: Bonk (BONK) from the Solana ecosystem, known for its peak performance in meme coin categories. Pepe Coin (PEPE), a cultural icon in the crypto space with roots in the early internet meme culture. Solaxy (SOLX) aims to improve Bitcoin's scalability and transaction efficiency through the Solana Virtual Machine. Conclusion: Why Ozak AI Stands Out For those eyeing potential in the 2025 cryptocurrency landscape, Ozak AI represents a compelling candidate. Its robust technological infrastructure, coupled with strategic partnerships and a successful presale, underscore its readiness to play a significant role in the evolving digital currency arena.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $4,795.01 and a minimum price of $4,195.63. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $7,791.89 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

The price analysis reveals the coin recently reached a new all-time high of 1,111.90. While the coin has slightly pulled back to $1,105.20, despite this small correction, it has managed to gain a significant 6.59 percent in value. As BNB is at its peak price, traders must be cautious because this is the point where profit-taking, or selling pressure, is most likely to begin.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin also surged to an all-time high of $1,111.90 today but has since corrected down to $1,105.2. If traders continue buying assets, the BNB price might see a further spike and discover a new ATH above 1,111.90. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $7,791.89 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $1105.2, as bulls target $1,111.90. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 6.59 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? BNB price has already touched $1000 in 2025 and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $7,791.89 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB achieved the mark of $1,079.07, and in October, it achieved its current ATH of 1,111.90 and is trading at approximately the $1104 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-03 12:10:00

USDT, issued by Tether, remains the leader with a 58.4% share. The market distribution by assets is as follows: USDT — 58.44% USDC — 24.56% USDe — 4.92% DAI — 1.66% The rest — 10.42% Over the past month, the capitalization of the three largest stablecoins increased by 5.6%, 2.7%, and 18.9%, respectively. Experts point to regulatory clarity as a key driver of growth. In mid-July 2025, US President Donald Trump signed the Genius Stablecoin Act (GENIUS), establishing a clear legal framework for stablecoins. GENIUS Act Spurs Growth According to JPMorgan Chase experts, the sector’s market capitalization has grown by 19% since the act’s adoption and 42% since the start of 2025, double the growth rate of the broader crypto market. Stablecoins now account for approximately 1.3% of the US money supply, up 35 basis points since January 2025. Circle and its stablecoin USDC have been the primary beneficiaries. Since early 2025, USDC’s dominance has increased by 4%, while USDT’s share has decreased by 9%. This shift reflects Circle’s status as a US-based public company with a stablecoin fully aligned with GENIUS regulations. What This Means for Investors The surge highlights a turning point in stablecoin adoption, signaling growing investor confidence and the critical role of regulatory clarity.

Consumers should secure backup passwords and use hardware wallets to mitigate exposure. UK legal order targets iCloud encrypted backups for British users Access to backups could enable dictionary and brute‑force attacks on wallet key files. Security relies on backup passphrase strength; hardware wallets remain safer. Apple iCloud backdoor risks crypto wallet keys in UK encrypted backups; learn protective steps and act now. Read expert guidance and key takeaways. Published: 2025-10-03 | Updated: 2025-10-03 What is the UK order for an Apple iCloud backdoor? The Apple iCloud backdoor order is a UK government demand that Apple enable access to iCloud encrypted backups for British accounts. The directive seeks technical capability to retrieve end‑to‑end encrypted backup data for investigations, a step critics say weakens overall security and directly threatens crypto wallet backup safety. How could iCloud access expose crypto wallet keys? Many mobile wallets allow encrypted backups to iCloud, storing wallet keys or seed fragments. If a government or attacker obtains the encrypted backup file, they can attempt dictionary or brute‑force decryption against the backup passphrase. The protection then depends entirely on password strength and encryption parameters. Security experts and digital‑rights groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), warn that any backdoor or mandated access increases attack surface, heightening risks of hacking, identity theft, and fraud. The UK government previously issued a Technical Capability Notice (TCN) under the Investigatory Powers Act seeking such capabilities. Financial Times reported the renewed, UK‑limited request; Apple earlier restricted Advanced Data Protection for UK accounts after the initial demand. Why do crypto advocates and privacy groups oppose the change? Opponents argue that mandated access creates intrinsic vulnerabilities. Backdoors or escrowed keys often become targets for malicious actors. Vitalik Buterin and other crypto community voices caution that any intentional weakening of encryption is “inevitably hackable.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation described the move as an “unsettling overreach” that diminishes user safety and freedom. These critiques stress that technical access for lawful purposes frequently becomes exploitable by unauthorized parties. How can users protect wallet keys stored in iCloud backups? Use strong, unique backup passphrases : Choose long, random passphrases and avoid reusing passwords. Enable hardware wallets : Keep private keys off cloud backups when practical. Use local encrypted backups : Prefer device‑level encrypted exports stored offline. Enable multi‑factor authentication : Protect iCloud accounts with robust 2FA where available. Monitor account access : Audit devices and sessions linked to cloud accounts regularly. What wallets and apps are affected? Several widely used mobile wallets support encrypted iCloud backups, including Coinbase Wallet, Uniswap Wallet, Zerion, Crypto.com DeFi Wallet and MetaMask. If backups are accessible via a legal order, any wallet keys stored in those backups are potentially at risk of offline brute‑force attempts. Key Takeaways Legal change risk : UK orders aim to allow access to iCloud encrypted backups for British users. Primary vulnerability : Backup file access enables dictionary and brute‑force attacks against passphrases. User action : Strengthen passphrases, use hardware wallets, and prefer offline backups.

Early cypherpunks advocated for strong cryptography and privacy, resisting government restrictions on cryptographic tools. That legacy informs contemporary opposition to any policy perceived to weaken cryptographic protections. Recent debates, such as criticism of proposed client‑side scanning laws in the EU, echo similar concerns: law enforcement access built into systems often undermines universal security. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will the UK order let police read iCloud messages?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The order targets encrypted iCloud backups rather than live iCloud Messages.

Legal orders can compel companies to provide capability within a jurisdiction. In practice, Apple may be asked to alter features like Advanced Data Protection or implement technical measures that enable access for UK accounts. Should I stop using iCloud for wallet backups? Consider disabling cloud backups for private keys and use hardware wallets or encrypted offline backups. If you must use cloud backups, strengthen passphrases and account security immediately. Who has commented on the risk? Digital‑rights organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and influential crypto developers like Vitalik Buterin have publicly warned that mandated backdoors weaken security and are likely to be exploited.

ETH briefly hit $4,500, up ~1.6% in 24 hours Q3 saw an outsized 74% return for Ethereum while year-to-date gains are roughly 34% (CoinGlass, CoinGecko). Market sentiment and institutional buying (digital asset treasuries) are key watchpoints for sustained upside. Meta description: Ethereum price jumps to $4,500 as institutional buying and improved options flow drive optimism—read expert analysis and key takeaways to act now. Published: 2025-10-03 | Updated: 2025-10-03 | Author: COINOTAG What is driving the ETH surge to $4,500? Ethereum price climbed to a two-week high near $4,500 driven by a mix of improved options market positioning, renewed buying pressure across the crypto market, and the prospect of resumed institutional accumulation by digital asset treasuries. Short-term sentiment improvements and rising staking metrics support the move. How strong is recent market performance for Ethereum? Ethereum delivered a strong quarterly performance, closing Q3 with an outsized return of 74% and roughly 34% year-to-date gains, according to CoinGlass and CoinGecko data. Over the past 24 hours ETH was up about 1.6% on reported pricing feeds, indicating renewed intraday buying interest. Why are traders optimistic about near-term ETH momentum? Options market flows have shifted: analysts report higher relative demand for calls over puts in near-term expiries, signaling short-term bullish positioning. Market analysts at Block Scholes noted the change in September-to-October positioning as a primary sentiment driver. Prediction market signals (Myriad, DASTAN) also show growing retail and trader bullishness for a $5,000 target. How could digital asset treasuries affect price direction? Digital asset treasuries (DATs) were a material source of institutional demand prior to the recent pause. Analysts from Bitget and LBank Labs indicate DATs have paused due to broader equity pressure but characterize this as a temporary pause rather than a reversal. If DATs resume accumulation alongside continued staking inflows, analysts expect a significant boost to ETH upside momentum. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Ethereum Briefly Climbs to Two-Week High Near $4,500 as Institutional Demand Returns"", ""description"": ""Ethereum price jumps to $4,500 as options flows and potential institutional accumulation boost sentiment; expert commentary and key takeaways."", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/ethereum-4-500-institutional-demand"" } } { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will institutional treasuries start buying Ethereum again?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Analysts report that institutional treasuries paused purchases amid equity pressure but view the break as temporary; a resumption would materially increase institutional demand and support higher Ethereum prices."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the options market signaling a sustained rally for ETH?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Near-term options flows show higher demand for call options versus puts, indicating short-term bullish sentiment, but longer-term put premiums remain elevated according to options analytics commentary."" } } ] } { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to Monitor Institutional Ethereum Accumulation"", ""description"": ""Steps to track whether digital asset treasuries and institutions are accumulating ETH."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check on-chain treasury flows"", ""text"": ""Monitor public treasury addresses and known institutional wallets for inflows to Ethereum via on-chain analytics."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch staking and supply metrics"", ""text"": ""Track total ETH staked and net issuance metrics to gauge long-term supply-side pressure."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Observe options and derivatives markets"", ""text"": ""Review options positioning and relative call/put demand to identify shifts in trader sentiment."" } ] } Frequently Asked Questions How high could Ethereum go this quarter? Short-term prediction markets show rising odds for a $5,000 target, with 72% of participants favoring a rise to $5,000 rather than a drop to $3,500; analysts caution that momentum depends on institutional accumulation and macro volatility. What are the main risks to this rally? Key risks include a return of equity market weakness, reduced institutional appetite, and any supply-side shocks. Options market data still shows longer-term put premiums, which signal lingering downside protection demand. Key Takeaways Price action : ETH reached ~$4,500, gaining roughly 1.6% in 24 hours. Drivers : Improved options positioning, market-wide buying pressure, and potential institutional (DAT) accumulation. Watchlist : On-chain treasury flows, staking growth, and derivatives positioning for confirmation of a sustained breakout. Conclusion Ethereum’s recent surge to a two-week high reflects improved short-term sentiment, driven by options flows and the prospect of resumed institutional accumulation by digital asset treasuries. Continued monitoring of on-chain flows, staking levels, and derivatives positioning will help determine if this momentum translates into a sustained fourth-quarter advance.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is decreasing after a continued bearish wave observed over the current trading session. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might plunge below the $8 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $31.11 level by 2027 and above $63.87 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bearish phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding value, and so is UNI. As sellers gained ground around $8.40, negative sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $14.74, while the average price is expected to be around $12.28. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $8 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $9 and $10.1; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2026, which is quite higher than its current value, making it a good option to buy UNI tokens. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. However, this is not investment advice, and one should seek independent professional consultation before making any investment decision. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $63.87 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

As mentioned, however, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing seven XRP ETF filings, with the first decision deadline set for October 18, 2025. The crypto’s trajectory hinges on approvals, as they could trigger substantial institutional inflows and result in a price surge rally, while delays or outright rejections risk short-term sell-offs.

The event brought together more than 20,000 industry professionals and thousands of companies and institutions, reinforcing its role as a key barometer of global blockchain and fintech development. Interlace, a global leader in card issuance and fund management platforms, made its presence known at Token2049 Singapore, actively participating in several events. The company also announced that it has surpassed the milestone of issuing over 6 million cards, serving more than 12,000 enterprise clients, with a payment network spanning over 180 countries and regions. This achievement reflects the widespread acceptance of stablecoin-based payment models and underscores Interlace’s leadership and successful practices in scaling, compliance, and ecosystem development. Interlace: The Innovative Financial Bridge Between Web2 and Web3 As a leading global platform for card issuance and fund management, Interlace is committed to becoming the financial bridge between Web2 and Web3. Through a comprehensive suite of products, including accounts, payments, card services, API interfaces, and wealth management, Interlace helps enterprises achieve complete fund management from “on-chain assets” to “off-chain consumption.” To date, Interlace has issued over 6 million cards and serves more than 12,000 enterprise clients, with a payment network covering over 180 countries and regions, validating its industry-leading position in terms of scale and global operations. In terms of global compliance, Interlace holds financial licenses in the U.S., Hong Kong, Lithuania, and other regions, and is PCI DSS Level-1 certified, providing businesses with secure, auditable fund transfer guarantees. The platform supports over 40 mainstream fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, including USDT and USDC, establishing a unified fund management and payment system for global enterprises. With its extensive client coverage, forward-thinking compliance strategies, and full-stack product ecosystem, Interlace is not only a provider of payment products but also a foundational element of the stablecoin compliance and payment ecosystem. During Token2049, Interlace shared insights into its innovative products, compliance advantages, and ecosystem value, showcasing its ability to offer full-stack financial services. Industry Trends: Stablecoins Drive Payment and Settlement Upgrades On October 1st, Interlace’s CBDO Mark Homeier was invited to the PayFi Huma Summit, where he shared practical business insights—payment efficiency, security, and compliance are the core factors for businesses in deciding whether to adopt stablecoin payments. At the Stablecoin Summit, Mark also gave a keynote speech titled “How Stablecoins Are Changing the Financial Landscape,” emphasizing that the integration of stablecoins with traditional payment systems can significantly reduce settlement times, lower exchange costs, and enhance fund transparency, making stablecoins a key tool for enterprise payments and fund management. Since its founding in 2019, Interlace has aligned with industry trends, pioneering a platform that covers over 40 major fiat and cryptocurrency assets to enable unified management and exchange between fiat and crypto. Supported by global accounts, Infinity Cards, and CaaS APIs, the platform facilitates enterprise transfers, crypto payments, and card issuance across diverse scenarios, truly closing the loop from “on-chain assets” to “off-chain consumption.” Compliance as a Strong Foundation for Scalable Growth At the Web3 Finance: Powering the Future of Trust Summit, Interlace’s Head of Compliance and Operations, Henry Chan, was invited to share his insights into the regulatory challenges faced by stablecoins in practice. He noted that as global regulations tighten, compliance requirements like KYC, KYB, and AML have become essential barriers for enterprises adopting stablecoin payments. “Balancing compliance and user experience is a common challenge in the industry,” Henry said. “Interlace achieves ‘seamless compliance’ through the smooth design of its products, allowing users to enjoy the convenience of decentralization while still meeting regulatory requirements across different countries, thus laying the foundation for the long-term healthy development of the industry.” Interlace embeds compliance and risk control deeply into product design: using non-custodial MPC wallets to ensure fund security, integrating on-chain AML and KYC systems for real-time risk control, and balancing decentralization and compliance in an ideal manner. Ecosystem Strategy: Building a Full-Stack Enterprise Financial Services Platform Interlace’s founder and CEO, Michael Wu, was invited to attend the “Building Value through Connection: Stablecoin Payment Ecosystem Synergy and Future Landscape” forum, where he expanded on the development of stablecoins. He noted that stablecoins are becoming the value bridge connecting Web3 and traditional finance, and Interlace has built a comprehensive financial ecosystem based on “accounts + payments + card services + wealth management” to support this bridge’s infrastructure. Michael explained that Interlace connects fund flows through seamless exchange between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, based on enterprise accounts.

Adoption spike: 1,963 new addresses on Oct 1 signals growing on-chain demand Exchange outflows of $4.5M point to accumulation by stronger hands Technical setup: bullish pennant targets $25.2 breakout and possible extension to $27.8 Chainlink breakout evidence: rising adoption, $4.5M outflows, bullish pennant—monitor $25.2 resistance. Read quick analysis and trade-ready takeaways. What is driving Chainlink’s breakout potential? Chainlink breakout signals come from converging on-chain and technical indicators: a one-day addition of 1,963 new addresses, meaningful exchange outflows and a bullish pennant in price action. These factors together reduce immediate sell pressure and increase the odds of a continuation rally if momentum holds. How are exchange flows and MVRV affecting LINK? Exchange flows show $4.5 million in outflows on Oct 3, indicating transfers from exchanges to private wallets and potential accumulation. A rising MVRV Z-score further confirms improving holder profitability and lower likelihood of mass liquidation. Combined, the outflows and climbing MVRV create a firmer base for a move higher and suggest supply is tightening while holder conviction improves. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Chainlink Adoption Rises; Bullish Pennant, $4.5M Outflows Point to LINK Breakout"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LINKUSD_2025-10-03_09-15-48.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T09:15:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T09:15:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/chainlink-adoption-bullish-pennant-2025-10-03"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Did Chainlink add new addresses recently?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

LINK is consolidating in a bullish pennant between approximately $20.9 and $23.1. This pattern typically precedes continuation moves when confirmed by volume and on-chain strength. If price breaks above $23.1 with follow-through, the next key resistance sits at $25.2, with an extension target near $27.8. Failure to clear resistance could keep LINK rangebound for a period. Source: TradingView Exchange outflows signal accumulation by strong hands Chainlink recorded $4.5 million in exchange outflows on October 3, showing net transfers off exchanges into private custody. This behavior often reduces available sell liquidity. Consistent outflows paired with bullish technicals typically indicate accumulation by stronger hands, supporting a higher probability of upside continuation if demand persists. Source: CoinGlass Why does rising MVRV matter for LINK holders? Rising MVRV Z-score signals growing holder profitability, which typically lowers the probability of broad-based selling. As more investors move into profit, market stability tends to improve. When MVRV improves alongside accumulation and adoption, the setup often precedes sustained rallies rather than short-lived spikes. Source: Santiment Is LINK preparing for its next pump? Chainlink’s rising adoption, marked outflows and a bullish pennant create a favorable risk-reward backdrop for a potential rally. If volume confirms a breakout above $23.1, targets near $25.2 and $27.8 become plausible. Nonetheless, traders should watch for rejection at resistance and monitor macro liquidity; a failed breakout could result in extended sideways action before a decisive move. Frequently Asked Questions How many new addresses did Chainlink add recently? Chainlink added 1,963 new addresses on October 1, indicating renewed participation and network growth versus prior subdued activity. What does $4.5M in exchange outflows mean for LINK? Net outflows reduce immediate sell-side liquidity on exchanges and are commonly interpreted as accumulation by investors moving funds into private wallets for longer-term holding. When will LINK confirm a breakout? A confirmed breakout requires a sustained close above the pennant resistance (~$23.1) with rising volume and follow-through to first resistance at $25.2. Key Takeaways Adoption: 1,963 new addresses show renewed on-chain interest and demand. Accumulation: $4.5M outflows point to accumulation and reduced selling pressure. Technical: Bullish pennant targets $25.2 breakout; extension possible to $27.8 if momentum continues. Conclusion Chainlink demonstrates a constructive mix of on-chain adoption, accumulation signals and a bullish technical pattern that together increase the probability of a meaningful breakout. Traders should confirm a close above $23.1 with volume before assuming further targets; monitor exchange flows and MVRV for continued evidence of strengthening fundamentals.",News|LINK,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|LINK|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-03 13:12:57

ETF Capital Inflows Highlight Growing Investor Interest JPMorgan Chase notes that capital inflows into gold and Bitcoin ETFs have surged in recent months. Market data supports this trend. 1. Gold ETFs have seen weekly net inflows between $1.8 billion and $4.2 billion since late August 2025 2. In September 2025, gold ETFs recorded approximately $13.6 billion in inflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $3.53 billion during the same period. This activity suggests that Bitcoin may be subtly undervalued relative to gold. JPMorgan Chase reports that Bitcoin's volatility index against gold has fallen below 2, meaning Bitcoin could attract nearly twice the risk capital of gold. Theoretical Valuation and Market Correlation Taking this into account, Bitcoin’s market capitalization would need to grow by 42% to match $6 billion of private gold investment, implying a theoretical valuation of $165,000. However, the report notes that Bitcoin was overvalued at the end of 2024. The two assets remain correlated in the short term (30 days) and long term (365 days), while the 90-day moving average still indicates an inverse correlation. Charts show gold has outperformed Bitcoin since mid-August 2025. Ahead of market fluctuations, gold hit a new all-time high, while Bitcoin briefly dipped. As Bitcoin recovered, gold became a less attractive investment, increasing demand for the world’s first cryptocurrency, JPMorgan Chase emphasized.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-03 13:17:01

That is why two names keep rising on every watchlist: Ripple’s XRP and Remittix. In a fast PayFi market, both aim to make cross-border payments cheaper and quicker. This quick read looks at the XRP price prediction into the ETF window, and why Remittix keeps showing up as the best crypto to buy now for early movers seeking strong tokenomics, real-world utility, and CEX listings. The XRP price prediction section reviews key levels, liquidity, and catalyst dates. Then we compare it with Remittix , a PayFi project with a live wallet beta, a referral reward paid in USDT, and full CertiK verification. Together, these trends point to where capital may rotate next. XRP Price Prediction: Setups, Levels, and Catalysts Source: Crypto metric The XRP chart shows higher lows into the $2.86 to $2.80 support band, with resistance at $2.97 to $3.25. Our base XRP price prediction is simple. Hold the band, and a push over $2.97 can open the door to $3.15 to $3.25. Lose $2.80 and bulls likely pause. Liquidity is building as futures open interest grows and options talk increases. That supports a constructive XRP price prediction into mid-month. The ETF timeline is the wild card. If spot approvals land, an XRP price prediction that targets $5 over the medium term becomes more realistic because fresh institutional demand can tighten exchange supply. Ripple’s push into on-demand liquidity and new XLS-33 features on XRPL also support a long-run XRP price prediction focused on utility, remittances, and bank-grade rails. Remittix: The PayFi Upstart With Growing Proof Remittix aims to move money for people and merchants at low cost, while rewarding the network for growth. The project has raised over $26.9 million from the sale of more than 674 million tokens at $0.1130. CEX listings include Bitmart and LBank, with another reveal teased soon. The wallet is in Beta testing, the team is fully verified by CertiK , and Remittix is ranked number 1 on CertiK Skynet for Pre-Launch Tokens. This traction is why many call it the best crypto to buy now in the PayFi lane. Why Remittix Keeps Gaining Two CEX listings live, with two more secured and to be revealed when milestones are hit CertiK KYC is complete and ranked number 1 Pre-Launch on Skynet for security and transparency Wallet Beta live, second update rolling after tester feedback for smoother UX Web App near completion, with crypto to fiat Beta planned before full wallet integration Viral referral rewards.

Two Paths To The Same Goal For payment utility, the XRP price prediction hinges on ETF decisions and continuing network adoption. For early-stage upside, Remittix blends presale traction, exchange access, and audited security to target fast growth.

The bank argues that the cryptocurrency is undervalued on a risk-adjusted basis and could, in theory, rise to $165,000 — around 40% above its current $120,000 level. The calculation hinges on volatility. JPMorgan points out that Bitcoin’s price swings compared to gold have been narrowing, with the BTC-to-gold volatility ratio now below 2.0. That makes Bitcoin look more attractive relative to the yellow metal. JPM Says Bitcoin Undervalued vs. Gold, Highlights ""Significant Upside"" to $165k. ""The steep rise in the gold price over the past month has made bitcoin more attractive to investors relative to gold, especially as the bitcoin to gold volatility ratio keeps drifting lower to… pic.twitter.com/7YuIaP2Kzi — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 2, 2025 Analysts note that if Bitcoin’s $2.3 trillion market cap were to align with the $6 trillion invested in gold bars, coins, and ETFs, once adjusted for relative risk, Bitcoin would need to rise by roughly 42%. Seasonal Strength Supports Uptober Rally The timing of this call adds to its weight. Bitcoin closed September around $114,000, up 5% for the month and breaking a pattern of seasonal weakness. Historically, when Bitcoin ends September in positive territory, the final quarter tends to deliver significant rallies. In years like 2015, 2016, 2023, and 2024, fourth-quarter gains averaged more than 50%. This history has traders speculating whether the current “Uptober” rally could extend through year-end. Macroeconomic conditions may help: weaker U.S. labor data and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have bolstered Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainty. September’s 5% gain improves Q4 odds for stronger returns Previous positive Septembers led to 50%+ rallies in Q4 Current price near $120,000 sits about $45,000 below JPMorgan’s $165,000 model Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bearish Butterfly Forms as BTC Eyes $128K Bitcoin is trading at $120,421 after breaking resistance near $119,500, extending its “Uptober” momentum. On the surface, the chart looks bullish. Price is holding above both the 50- and 100-period moving averages, while higher lows confirm an upward trend. A bullish engulfing candle last week reinforced buyer strength, and traders are now watching $124,600 as the next resistance, with a potential push toward $128,000. Momentum indicators also reflect this strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is elevated near 75, showing strong demand. While this suggests buyers are in control for now, it also signals the market is stretched and could be vulnerable to pullbacks once short-term enthusiasm cools. Why the Pattern Signals a Bearish Risk Beneath the bullish tone lies a technical warning: Bitcoin is forming a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern, a structure that often signals exhaustion near the top of a rally. The projected completion zone sits between $128,000 and $130,000. In plain terms, Bitcoin may continue to climb into this range, but once it does, the probability of a sharp reversal increases. Think of it like climbing a ladder: each step up feels strong, but the top rungs are weaker and risk snapping under weight. Traders who only see the climb may miss the risk building overhead. If Bitcoin fails to hold above $128K–$130K, a retracement could bring it back toward $118,500, or deeper supports near $113,500. Bitcoin is forming a Bearish Butterfly pattern. Resistance: $124.6K, PRZ $128K–$130K Support: $117K / $113.5K / $106.9K Momentum looks bullish short term, but caution: risk of reversal grows as price nears the PRZ. #BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/C4r5rWUm5B — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 3, 2025 For traders, the strategy is twofold: capitalize on near-term bullish momentum, but remain cautious as Bitcoin nears the reversal zone. This dual outlook explains why the market can rise while still flashing bearish warnings — a reminder that even strong rallies carry risks at the top.

The launch underscores Gate’s commitment to its long-term strategy of going “All in Web3”, as articulated by Founder and CEO Dr. Han Lin in his keynote speech during TOKEN2049 Singapore at the Gate x Red Bull Grid Reception. Gate Fun is the ecosystem’s first meme-token launchpad, designed around the principle of “zero-code issuance + all-scenario trading.” With just one click, users can create a token in under a minute for less than $0.001 in gas fees, set initial trading features, and immediately access liquidity. Once a token reaches graduation (≈1000 GT raised), liquidity is automatically migrated to Gate Swap, where it becomes tradable. Creators also earn a 50 GT bonus and fee-sharing rights, reinforcing Gate’s mission to empower Web3 creators. By integrating with Gate Wallet, MetaMask, Meme Go, and Gate’s CEX, Gate Fun lowers the barriers for token creation while streamlining the path from idea to market. Dr. Han emphasized that “the All in Web3 on-chain ecosystem is not only the next evolution of exchanges, but also the future of finance.” He noted that Gate’s Web3 ecosystem now spans Gate Layer (high-performance L2 infrastructure), Gate Perp DEX (on-chain perpetuals), Meme Go (real-time meme token tracker), Wrapped Assets ($1.2B+ AUM), and the newly launched Gate Fun. Together, these products form a comprehensive, transparent, and efficient on-chain financial ecosystem that bridges CEX and DEX, enhances user empowerment, and accelerates global crypto adoption. DEX Momentum & Breakthroughs are fueling this transition. Gate’s infrastructure now processes up to 700,000 transactions per second, surpassing even some traditional exchanges. Wallet UX has been simplified through Gate Wallet and MetaMask integration, allowing anyone to issue tokens in minutes with immediate liquidity. DEX total value locked (TVL) is now approaching CEX levels, with approximately 15,000 tokens launched daily — over 10 million annually. With DEXs capturing 25–50% of trading market share and rising, the sector is cementing itself as the new core of the crypto economy, validating Gate’s All in Web3 strategy. “One World, One Gate is our vision,” Dr. Han concluded. “Through cutting-edge technology, a global compliance framework, and an integrated Web3 ecosystem, Gate is redefining the role of exchanges and shaping the future of finance.” For more details, users can visit: https://www.gate.com/announcements/article/47462 Gate Fun: https://web3.gate.com/gatefun About Gate Gate , founded in 2013 by Dr. Han, is one of the world's earliest cryptocurrency exchanges.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the AI industrial revolution has already begun and that building the infrastructure to power it is essential in Japan and worldwide. Japan aims to lead AI and robotics globally Huang argued that Japan can lead the world in AI and robotics. The firms revealed that the initiative aims to build an AI infrastructure on which various futuristic AI uses will be based. Both parties plan to customize the AI agent for specific sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, next-generation computing, and consumer services in the AI agent platform . Fujitsu said it will achieve the initiative by leveraging NVIDIA NeMo and enhancing its multi-AI agent technologies, including optimization of its Takane AI model. The AI platform will integrate the FUJITSU-MONAKA CPU series and NVIDIA GPUs via NVIDIA NVLink Fusion. Fujitsu aims to transform industries, starting with Japan, to foster widespread adoption of AI, which it believes will enhance competitiveness across all sectors. According to the report, Fujitsu and Nvidia aim to establish AI infrastructure in Japan by 2030. Fujitsu believes that the combined AI computing infrastructure will accelerate the AI industrial revolution with AI agents that continuously learn and improve. The firm said it will allow cross-industry, self-evolving, full-stack AI infrastructure, which it believes will overcome the limitations of general-purpose computing systems. “Fujitsu’s strategic collaboration with NVIDIA will accelerate AI-driven business transformation in the enterprise and government sectors. By combining the cutting-edge technologies of both companies, we will develop and provide full-stack AI infrastructure, starting with sectors such as manufacturing, where Japan is a global leader.” – Tokahito Tokita , Representative Director and CEO of Fujitsu. Tokita also mentioned that both companies will expand their collaboration in the areas of high-performance computing and quantum to support the growing needs of AI infrastructure further. Huang also maintained that Fujitsu is a pioneer in computing and Japan’s trusted leader in supercomputing, quantum research, and enterprise systems. The executives did not specify any projects or provide a monetary figure for planned investments, but stated that AI will remain a priority. They also hinted at a potential collaboration in AI for robots with Japanese machinery and robot maker, Yaskawa Electric. Fujitsu plans to unlock new AI markets in challenging domains Nvidia and Fujitsu have continuously championed the AI industry , working together to speed up manufacturing with digital twins and robotics to tackle Japan’s aging labor shortages. Tokita maintained that the collaboration with Nvidia aims to help Fujitsu create new, unprecedented technologies and contribute to solving more serious social issues. Fujitsu said it is focused on key initiatives through collaboration, including the development of an AI agent that balances high speed and strong security through multi-tenancy support. The firm said the AI infrastructure will be built on Fujitsu Kozuchi and will integrate Fujitsu’s AI workload orchestrator technology with the NVIDIA Dynamo platform. Fujitsu has announced that it is combining its software technology for ARM with NVIDIA CUDA to establish a comprehensive HPC-AI ecosystem that provides one-stop support for AI transformation. The firm said it plans to unlock new AI markets in previously challenging domains. Nvidia’s stock hit a record $191.05 on Thursday before pulling back below $190. At the time of publication, the firm’s share price is trading at $188.98, up nearly 11% in the past 30 days. Fujitsu’s shares surged by 3.68% in the last 24 hours to 3,523 JPY after the announcement. The firm’s stock has also risen by more than 22% in the past 6 months. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

CertiK data showed a steep decline in code exploit losses, while hackers shifted toward mid-sized attacks targeting centralized exchanges and DeFi platforms. New ecosystems like Hyperliquid also faced exploits, and North Korean cyber units were still the biggest threat. Hackers Steal Less in Q3 Losses from crypto hacks and exploits fell sharply in the third quarter of 2025, despite September being a record month for million-dollar incidents. According to data from blockchain security firm CertiK that was shared in a recent interview , total losses dropped from $803 million in Q2 to $509 million in Q3. This was a decline of nearly 37%. Compared to Q1, when hackers stole almost $1.7 billion, losses fell by more than 70%. Incidents and the amount lost (Source: CertiK) CertiK reported that code vulnerability-related losses plummeted from $272 million in Q2 to just $78 million in Q3, while phishing-related theft also declined despite a similar number of incidents. Analysts pointed out that no single hack in the quarter reached the $100 million mark, which means that attackers instead focused on mid-sized exploits. September stood out as the most active month for high-value theft, and recorded 16 hacks that each surpassed $1 million. This set a new monthly record, topping the previous high of 14 in March of 2024. Even with this surge, the year-to-date average sits at about six million-dollar hacks per month, down from over eight per month in both 2023 and 2024. Centralized exchanges were the biggest targets in Q3, and accounted for $182 million in stolen funds. Hackers also increasingly relied on phishing and social engineering tactics to compromise multisignature and hot wallets, according to security firm Hacken. DeFi projects were also hit, and lost $86 million in the quarter, including a $40 million exploit of the GMX v1 decentralized exchange. That case ended with the hacker returning the funds after receiving a $5 million bounty. New ecosystems also came under fire, with Hyperliquid suffering incidents like the HyperVault exploit and HyperDrive rug pull late in the quarter. Hacken warned users to exercise extreme caution when engaging with newer and emerging chains. Hacken CEO Yevheniia Broshevan said North Korean cyber units are still the biggest threat, as they are responsible for around half of all the funds that were stolen in Q3. She added that their methods are becoming more sophisticated, and are evolving from basic phishing to layered operational compromises. While the quarter saw a rise in million-dollar hacks, the overall decline in losses and a drop in code-based exploits suggest that the fight to harden protocols and codebases may actually be working.",News|Security,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-03 13:30:00

Yesterday, our BTC Holdings closed at a market value of $77.4 billion, a new All Time High! pic.twitter.com/BrVfaHd9Py — Strategy (@Strategy) October 3, 2025 The company disclosed the figure in a social media post on Friday, highlighting the rapid growth of its crypto balance sheet in just a few years. From Early Adoption to Record Valuations Strategy began adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury in 2020, positioning itself as one of the earliest publicly traded companies to treat BTC as a primary reserve asset. At the end of that year, the firm’s holdings were valued at $2.1 billion, a move that was considered aggressive at the time but set the tone for a growing corporate trend. Subsequent years brought both volatility and expansion. By 2021, Strategy’s Bitcoin stack had appreciated to $5.7 billion, before retracing to $2.2 billion in 2022 amid the broader crypto bear market. The company’s conviction, however, remained intact. Through consistent purchases and market rebounds, Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio grew to $8 billion in 2023, before more than quintupling to $41.8 billion in 2024. The latest jump to $77.4 billion shows the impact of Bitcoin’s 2025 bull run, which has seen the asset push into new record price levels above $124,000. Corporate Treasury Pioneer Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy has long been a focal point of debate in financial circles. Critics questioned the risk of tying so much corporate value to a highly volatile asset class, while supporters pointed to Bitcoin’s performance against inflation and fiat depreciation. The company’s latest disclosure is likely to reinforce the narrative that early corporate adoption of Bitcoin can deliver outsized returns. Compared with its $2.1 billion position in 2020, the current $77.4 billion valuation represents more than a 35-fold increase in just five years. Michael Saylor Escapes Multi-Billion Tax Bomb Strategy has also recently announced it no longer expects to face a multi-billion tax liability tied to unrealized crypto gains after new guidance from the IRS and Treasury. The 71-page update says companies don’t have to include unrealized Bitcoin gains or losses in the 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) calculation. This saves Strategy from billions in potential payments and eases fears that long-term Bitcoin treasuries would be penalized for appreciation. For Strategy, which has never sold a Bitcoin since it began buying in 2020, the relief comes as it sits on roughly $28 billion in unrealized profit.

According to analysis shared on X by CryptoQuant contributor Pelinay P.A., taker buy volume on Binance has dominated sell volume throughout the month. Bitcoin Funding Rates on Binance Indicate a Potential Rally “Overall, the setup remains bullish, negative funding suggests accumulation opportunities while strong spot demand underpins the rally’s sustainability.” – By @PelinayPA Link https://t.co/mJmLZJMVhX pic.twitter.com/OHXi1eJUGk — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 2, 2025 “It’s a clear sign that traders are betting long, and they’re doing it hard.” The move comes as Bitcoin trades between $110,000 and $120,000, driven more by spot demand and long-term holders than by excessive leverage. Binance Futures Funding Rates Stay Negative As Accumulation Signals a $130K BTC Breakout Funding rates on Binance are either neutral or slightly negative, which is unusual. Usually, when prices rise, funding rates go positive as longs pile in. But right now, the market looks more like a quiet accumulation than a speculative trend. And that’s exactly the kind of environment that can lead to sharp upward moves when buying pressure finally breaks through resistance. This setup sets the stage for potential upward squeezes, with BTC set to test $120,000–$125,000 and possibly extend to the $130K level. Just a few days ago, traders were watching a “gap” in CME Bitcoin futures that pointed to a possible dip back to $110K. These gaps usually get filled fast; the hit rate this year was 100%, but this time, sellers couldn’t push hard enough. The gap stayed open, and Bitcoin kept its bullish momentum. Current conditions also align with the STH-MVRV pricing corridor , which tracks the profitability of short-term holders. The upper boundary of this range sits near $130K, a level where profit-taking historically intensifies. Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin has stayed above its realized price since early 2024, which means the broader trend is still bullish. Even if some short-term holders cash out near $130K, it doesn’t mean the rally is over. Spot market signals confirm this strength. Coinbase Premium Gap Nears 92 as U.S. Demand Drives Price Higher On Coinbase, Bitcoin is trading about $92 higher than on Binance. That premium shows strong demand from U.S. buyers, likely institutions, who are willing to pay more to get in. At the same time, profit-taking hit $3.7 billion in a single day recently, the fifth-highest this year. But even with that much selling, the market absorbed it without flipping bearish. That’s a healthy sign that there’s enough buying power to handle supply without breaking the trend. Additional support comes from US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $600 million in inflows on Thursday alone, lifting the weekly total to $2.25 billion. On the derivatives side, Bitcoin Open Interest has climbed to a record $45.3 billion , the highest level of leverage ever recorded. With both spot and futures markets moving in sync, upward pressure is mounting toward the $130K breakout. Bitcoin Open Interest just hit a new all-time high: $45.3B That’s the highest level of leverage the market has EVER seen. pic.twitter.com/8hNP29vLkf — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) October 3, 2025 In parallel, IBIT options tied to BlackRock’s spot ETF are experiencing rapid growth. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas added that IBIT options now outpace futures in open interest, underscoring Wall Street’s growing role in Bitcoin price discovery. Technical Analysis: RSI on the 4-Hour Chart Targets $130K BTC Breakout Technical indicators further back the bullish case. Bitcoin’s RSI sits at 69 , comfortably below overbought levels, while Coinglass data shows none of the 30 peak-cycle signals have been triggered. The market also bounced firmly from the 21-week EMA , a key support, gaining more than 10% and closing in on the $124K range. Source: TradingView On the 4-hour chart , Bitcoin is testing the $120K level following a strong rebound from the $108K–$110K support zone. The $115K region has flipped from resistance to support, giving bulls a stronger base. Immediate upside targets lie at $126,500, where trendline and horizontal resistance converge, with a possible extension to $132,000 if momentum holds. Volume supports this view, showing strong buying activity. Failure to maintain $120K could prompt a retest of the $114K–$115K area, but the broader structure remains bullish.

Quick: SEC generic listing standards reduce case-by-case delays for spot crypto ETFs. Altcoin ETF filings (Solana, XRP, Litecoin) benefit from existing futures markets and investor interest. Market impact: analysts expect modest single-asset flows and stronger demand for diversified index products. Altcoin ETFs: October 2025 SEC deadlines for Solana, XRP and Litecoin could unlock institutional flows — read expert analysis and next steps. With 16 crypto ETF applications on the SEC’s October calendar, a new regulatory framework could fast-track approvals for Solana, XRP and beyond, signaling a pivotal shift for US markets. What is changing with SEC ETF approvals in October 2025? The SEC’s Sept. 17 adoption of generic listing standards for exchange-traded products tied to spot commodities streamlines approvals for spot crypto ETFs. This reduces the need for bespoke rule changes and places 16 ETF applications — many for altcoins — on final deadlines in October 2025. How do these approvals differ from prior Bitcoin-only ETF waves? The current filings extend beyond Bitcoin and Ether to include single-asset proposals for Solana, XRP and Litecoin and diversified index ETPs. Shorter administrative requirements and clearer listing criteria can move altcoin products through the process faster than prior, case-by-case reviews. Why do Solana and XRP stand out? Solana and XRP already have established derivatives and futures markets, which analysts say supports liquidity and surveillance. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart noted these markets improve the mechanics of ETF creation and redemption, though flows may trail Bitcoin-level demand. How might approvals affect investors and product innovation? Approvals could expand product types rapidly: staking-focused ETFs, covered-call wrappers, leveraged or inverse ETPs and index-based diversified funds. Industry experts anticipate a wave of financial engineering once the SEC signals openness to altcoin spot listings. What do analysts forecast for demand and assets under management? Analysts expect single-asset altcoin ETFs to attract measurable but muted inflows versus Bitcoin. Long-term growth may favor diversified index products that bundle multiple crypto exposures into one instrument, offering a one-stop portfolio solution. Comparison: Solana, XRP and Litecoin ETF considerations Asset Existing Futures Market Staking/Utility Solana Yes High staking/DeFi activity XRP Yes (liquid futures) Payments-focused, less staking Litecoin Limited futures Store-of-value analogy to Bitcoin When will investors know the SEC’s decisions? Final deadlines for 16 filings fall in October 2025. The SEC’s procedural timeframe means some decisions could be issued on or shortly after those dates, creating a concentrated period of regulatory clarity for multiple products. Frequently Asked Questions Will altcoin ETFs get approved in October 2025? Approval is possible but not certain. The SEC’s generic listing standards increase the likelihood, and 16 applications are on October deadlines; however, each filing is assessed on surveillance, custody and market manipulation safeguards. How should investors prepare for potential altcoin ETF launches? Investors should assess product structure (single-asset vs. index), fees, custody arrangements and market liquidity. Consider diversified index ETPs for broad exposure and expect product variety to expand after regulatory green lights. Where can I hear full interviews referenced in this report?

Investor action : Evaluate product types, custody and liquidity; consider diversified index ETPs for broad exposure. Conclusion October 2025 could mark a turning point for altcoin ETFs in the US. The SEC’s new listing standards raise the probability that Solana, XRP and Litecoin products move closer to market. Investors should prepare by reviewing product structure, custody arrangements and liquidity. Stay informed as decisions are issued in October 2025. Publication: COINOTAG — Published 2025-10-03.

Despite the uncertainty brought by the government shutdown in the US, BTC, which has surpassed $120,000, is targeting a new ATH. Standard Chartered, which manages $850 billion in assets, has predicted that Bitcoin will reach a new record high within the next week. Speaking to Decrypt, Geoff Kendrick, Head of Global Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, revealed his new BTC prediction. Accordingly, Geoff Kendrick said that Bitcoin could reach a new record high next week and continue to climb to $135,000. Kendrick also noted that his previous predictions that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025 also hold true. In this context, the analyst stated that this optimistic outlook for BTC is supported by strong market momentum and increasing institutional interest, adding that he expects institutional demand to increase towards the end of the year. Bitcoin ETF inflows currently stand at net $58 billion, with $23 billion of that occurring in 2025. “I expect at least another $20 billion inflows by the end of the year.

The Las Vegas-based mining firm produced 629 bitcoin during the month, averaging nearly 21 coins a day, and sold 445 BTC for about $49 million at an average price of $109,568. Its operational hashrate averaged 45.6 EH/s with fleet efficiency reaching 16.07 J/Th. The company's holdings rose to more than 13,000 self-mined BTC, underscoring its strategy of using bitcoin as a core treasury asset. Over the past year, CleanSpark expanded capacity with the purchase of GRIID Infrastructure , launched a derivatives program to manage volatility and fund operations and strengthened its balance sheet with $650 million in convertible notes and $400 million in bitcoin-backed credit facilities. Chief executive Matt Schultz said September was “monumental,” in the release, highlighting new leadership appointments and an additional $200 million in credit capacity. With 1.03 gigawatts (GW) of power under contract and 808 megawatts (MW) in use, CleanSpark is positioning itself as one of the industry’s largest self-operated miners heading into fiscal 2026. CleanSpark shares were 5.7% higher in early trade, around $16.00.

The network was targeted through a sophisticated bridge exploit that disrupted operations and threatened user assets. After a nonstop ten-day recovery effort, developers reported that security had been reinforced and assets secured. The team has confirmed that preventive measures have now been implemented to protect the ecosystem from future attacks. Recovery Efforts and Security Enhancements According to lead developer Kaal Dhairya, the exploit was carried out through three fake checkpoints submitted to Shibarium’s Ethereum contracts. This manipulation halted Heimdall by breaking the link between its local and on-chain state. Additionally, the attacker staked 4.6 million BONE tokens in an attempt to influence validator thresholds, creating a critical risk that required immediate intervention. In response, the Shiba Inu core team, alongside external partners, worked continuously for over ten days. Dhairya explained that developers worked late nights and weekends to restore security. Cybersecurity firm Hexens.io was brought in as an independent reviewer to test and validate every fix. Daily standups, emergency syncs, and continuous log reviews were conducted to ensure accuracy in all steps. Responsibilities were separated across infrastructure, validator operations, test networks, and monitoring. This structure enabled parallel progress while maintaining strict oversight. Once the system was stabilized, several long-term measures were introduced. Over 100 contracts across Shibarium, ShibaSwap , and the Shiba Inu Metaverse were migrated to multi-signature wallets. Validator signing keys were rotated, and a blacklist feature was introduced to staking operations. Each measure was first tested on Devnet and Puppynet before deployment on Mainnet. One of the most notable outcomes was the rescue of the 4.6 million BONE tokens tied to the attacker. Since the tokens were staked through a contract, the team executed a targeted recovery via the StakeManager. This correction restored ledger integrity and removed the malicious delegation. Withdrawal delays were also extended from one checkpoint to around 30 checkpoints, giving developers more time to detect suspicious activity. Roadmap, Plasma Bridge, and Infrastructure Upgrades The Shiba Inu team confirmed that checkpointing on Heimdall has been safely restored. Dhairya stated that repairs were implemented through a staged process beginning in Devnet, then Puppynet, and finally deployed to Mainnet. Although developers initially considered negotiating with the attacker, no response was received, and stolen assets were observed being moved. As a result, the team chose not to deploy a bounty contract , citing operational risks. Looking ahead, developers outlined a cautious roadmap for restoring full bridge functionality. A blacklist mechanism will be added to the Plasma Bridge to prevent malicious addresses from initiating transactions. Once this system is fully in place, bridge operations will be gradually reintroduced. Additionally, plans are underway to ensure fair compensation for affected users through phased withdrawals, transaction limits, and coordination with partners. Timelines will only be disclosed when it is safe to do so. Beyond recovery, the team is focusing on long-term resilience. Shibarium has partnered with dRPC.org to consolidate RPC services under a single endpoint, rpc.shibarium.shib.io, improving reliability and accessibility. Developers are also updating documentation for node setup and validator operations to encourage broader participation and strengthen security across the ecosystem.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|ETH|WALLET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-03 13:51:42

OnePay crypto support refers to the Walmart-backed banking app’s reported plan to enable cryptocurrency trading and custody for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) later this year. The move aims to integrate crypto services into OnePay’s existing banking, payments and telecom offerings. How will OnePay add Bitcoin and Ether support? According to a report by CNBC (reported as plain text source), OnePay will roll out trading and custody features in phases. Initial support will target Bitcoin and Ether , with custody infrastructure integrated to hold user assets securely. OnePay already offers high-yield savings, credit and debit cards, loans and wireless plans. Adding crypto trading and custody follows a pattern among fintechs to expand financial services within one platform. Why is OnePay positioning itself as a U.S. superapp? OnePay aims to emulate the WeChat model by combining payments, banking and digital services in a single app. Executives view crypto as a complementary product that can increase user engagement and lifetime value. Regulatory context matters: recent commentary from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and public statements by SEC officials highlight a willingness to consider frameworks that allow multi-service financial platforms to operate under coordinated oversight. How does this fit into the broader superapp race? Industry moves by major players underscore the trend. Plain text references: Coinbase has publicly discussed building a crypto superapp; Toss is expanding finance services in international markets; Elon Musk’s X is developing broader app capabilities. These developments show multiple approaches to the same goal.

Reporters say OnePay plans to roll out BTC and ETH trading and custody later this year. No official release date has been provided by OnePay at publication time. Will OnePay provide custody for crypto assets? Yes. The report specifies custody services will be available, indicating OnePay will store user crypto assets in a custodial solution rather than offering non-custodial wallets at launch. Is OnePay regulated for crypto services? OnePay’s regulatory status for crypto has not been fully detailed publicly. Recent regulatory commentary from SEC leadership suggests evolving frameworks that could affect how superapps offer trading, lending and staking. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When will OnePay enable Bitcoin and Ether trading?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Reports indicate OnePay plans to enable Bitcoin and Ether trading and custody later this year, but an official launch date has not been announced."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will OnePay custody crypto assets?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The announced plan includes custodial services for user crypto assets, suggesting a custodial model at launch."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How does OnePay fit into the superapp trend?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""OnePay aims to combine banking, payments and crypto within one app, mirroring the multi-service superapp approach used by platforms such as WeChat in China."" } } ]} Key Takeaways OnePay crypto launch : OnePay will add BTC and ETH trading and custody later this year, according to reporting.

Bitcoin is nearing the Power Law Corridor’s blue line, a level that preceded major breakouts in prior cycles. Historical breakouts in 2013, 2017 and 2021 led to steep multi-month rallies; 2019 shows breakout signals can fail without volume support. Adoption developments and the 2024 halving-era momentum increase the odds of a durable move if confirmed by volume and on-chain flows. Bitcoin Power Law Corridor: Bitcoin nears the blue line — monitor breakout volume and adoption signals for a data-driven outlook and next steps for traders and investors. Bitcoin approaches the blue line of the Power Law Corridor, a level that has triggered massive rallies across previous cycles, raising anticipation. Bitcoin is nearing the Power Law Corridor’s blue line, where previous breakouts led to extraordinary rallies and historic upward price movements. Breakouts in 2013, 2017, and 2021 each took Bitcoin to peaks of the cycle, and made the model consistent over several years. Bitcoin is again challenging the blue line in the present cycle, which increases market attention to a possible breakout-driven increase in the future. Bitcoin Rally Soon? The cryptocurrency is approaching a decisive point within the Power Law Corridor, a long-standing model guiding its multi-cycle performance. Historical data shows that each breakout above the corridor’s blue line has led to extraordinary rallies in past cycles. What is the Power Law Corridor and why does the blue line matter? The Power Law Corridor is a long-term price channel model mapping Bitcoin’s multi-cycle trajectory; the blue line represents a structural resistance level that, when breached with conviction, historically preceded parabolic advances. Traders treat a durable break above this blue line as an inflection that often accelerates momentum. How have past Bitcoin breakouts above the blue line performed? Past breakouts show a recurring pattern: 2013 produced a steep rally, 2017 advanced toward the then-cycle peak near $20,000, and the 2020–2021 breakout culminated in an all-time high near $69,000. Notably, 2019 demonstrated that not all moves above the blue line sustain; volume and macro context mattered. #Bitcoin Rally Soon ? #BTC is approaching the blue line of the Power Law Corridor once again. Past breakouts have led to massive rallies. pic.twitter.com/bm4ezpV9gC — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) October 3, 2025 In 2013, the first breakout carried Bitcoin into a steep upward surge, pushing the asset well into the upper red band. A similar outcome occurred in 2017, with prices advancing toward $20,000 after crossing this critical level. The 2020–2021 cycle delivered the most striking breakout to date, sending Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $69,000. However, 2019 showed that not every move above the blue line sustains momentum, as the market corrected sharply soon after. How does the current cycle compare and what is the price outlook? In 2025, Bitcoin is pressing again against the same blue line, raising the question of whether prior cycle behavior will repeat. If the breakout is confirmed by higher trading volume, institutional flows and on-chain demand, analysts note a possible advance toward the corridor’s upper red band. Such a move could put Bitcoin on a path toward six-figure territory if macro liquidity and adoption catalysts align. The Power Law Corridor’s consistency over a decade gives many analysts a framework to interpret structure, but confirmation remains essential. What adoption developments are supporting the technical picture? Major corporate and device-level integrations are increasing user access to crypto services. Plain text sources reporting these developments include Bitcoin Magazine and public corporate announcements cited by market observers. These adoption trends may support liquidity and broaden retail participation.

For Bitcoin, adoption updates complement the technical setup as price approaches the breakout level. Cycle comparison table Cycle Breakout Year Peak (approx.)

Traders should watch breakout volume, spot exchange flows, funding rates and on-chain withdrawals. Confirmation over multiple sessions with institutional-sized buys and increasing on-chain demand strengthens the breakout case. Can adoption news alone drive a parabolic move? Adoption news can amplify momentum, but historically it has been most effective when paired with technical confirmation and positive macro liquidity conditions. Adoption widens the pool of participants and liquidity over time. Key Takeaways Power Law Corridor is a durable framework : It has tracked Bitcoin’s multi-cycle path for over a decade and highlights structural resistance at the blue line. Breakout confirmation matters : Volume, on-chain flows and institutional participation determine whether a breakout leads to a sustained parabolic advance. Adoption complements technicals : Corporate integrations and device-level access increase user pools and liquidity, which can reinforce price moves if fundamentals align. Conclusion The Bitcoin Power Law Corridor remains a leading structural reference as price approaches the blue line in 2025. While history shows breakouts above this line have often preceded major rallies, traders and investors should seek volume and adoption confirmation before assuming a parabolic run.

With several spot ETF decisions expected in October 2025, institutional demand could arise, and the price outlook for SOL may change next year. As the crypto world has become excited about the upcoming bull cycle, which altcoins will perform best in the next? Some of the most-mentioned projects include Solana, a top-layer 1 network with solid fundamentals, and MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project that many analysts are now calling one of the best altcoins to buy during this accumulation phase. The two represent two sides of the same coin, with one already established and gearing up for a fresh wave of institutional flooding and the other poised to emerge early with a strong initial investor momentum. Solana Price Momentum and the Upcoming ETF Catalyst Solana has been one of the strongest-performing altcoins of the past two years, but its price recently took a pause. SOL price fell to $192 on Thursday, but an upcoming ETF decision may kickstart institutional investor demand and reset Solana’s price momentum. Solana slipped below the $200 mark on Thursday, erasing its recent rally to an eight-month high of $253. The 19% dip that unfolded in a week has rattled market momentum and raised questions about near-term strength. Yet, a looming catalyst may change the narrative. Grayscale’s spot SOL exchange-traded fund (ETF) faces its first approval deadline on Oct. 10. This decision could determine whether institutional capital flows begin to support SOL in a way similar to Bitcoin. While the REX Osprey Staking SOL ETF, launched in July, offers spot exposure, its structure is less significant than a pure spot product. A Grayscale spot ETF would allow for more direct institutional participation, potentially unlocking deeper liquidity and broader adoption. That decision is only the first in a series of rulings. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to review five additional applications, with a final deadline of October 16, 2025, including proposals from Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, Grayscale, and Canary. Collectively, the lineup underscored the growing institutional interest in bringing SOL into mainstream investment vehicles. Analyst Mentions: MAGACOIN FINANCE Enters the Conversation As Solana is the more mature side of the market, several analysts are also spotlighting new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as part of the best altcoins to buy as the bullish season gets heated in 2025. The project has been garnering attention for early-phase altcoin action and has shown solid community growth. It has an audited smart contract too, making it stronger than many early-stage tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE has successfully raised millions of dollars in its ongoing sale process, while rapidly building a solid global investor base. Analysts say that such projects can serve as a supplement to larger stakeholdings, like Solana, by providing them the opportunity to grow faster. Though more volatile, they can deliver outsized returns if anticipation for launch becomes mainstream. Conclusion The price drop of Solana could be interpreted as the next set of price actions. Due to the several different ETF decisions expected in October, demand from institutions is likely to skyrocket, setting the stage for a possible rally into 2025. One of the most likely altcoins to rally due to its speed, adoption and market relevance, this is a strong contender for the next market cycle. Investor interest is shifting towards new projects, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, while existing projects are also growing. The market is now entering a new phase with large-scale adoption and early-stage opportunities helping shape the future of crypto investing.

Analysts see MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the best early-stage projects due to its strong presale performance, growing community, and audited smart contract. Q4: Should investors buy Solana before the ETF decision?

Citibank Issues Bold Short-Term Crypto Prediction,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/231k-bitcoin-citibank-issues-bold-short-term-crypto-prediction/,"Citibank has issued fresh 12-month price targets for Bitcoin and Ethereum, laying out a wide set of possible outcomes that range from steep drops to large gains. Related Reading: No Accident: The Powerful Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Late-September Rally According to the bank’s latest note, Bitcoin’s base case sits at $181,000, while a bearish scenario puts it at $82,000. A bullish run could push Bitcoin to $231,000 within a year. Citi Lays Out Wide Range Based on reports, Citi is avoiding a single forecast and instead gives three clear paths for Bitcoin. The bank’s bearish mark of $82,000 represents a 31% fall from Bitcoin’s current quoted price of $120,314. The base case of $181,000 would be a 52% rise. At the top end, Citi’s $231,000 figure is roughly 95% above today’s level. Those are big swings. They show how much uncertainty traders face.

A stronger US dollar and weaker gold prices were noted as headwinds for crypto returns. At the same time, the bank highlighted continued interest from large investors and more institutional flows as reasons Bitcoin could climb. The note also compared these targets with Citi’s earlier year-end calls — $132,000 for Bitcoin and $4,500 for Ethereum — and said it extended the timeline to a 12-month horizon that runs to October 2026. Market Reaction, Other Forecasts Reports have disclosed that over the last 24 hours Bitcoin was up 2% and Ethereum rose 2.10%. Other big-name forecasts were mentioned alongside Citi’s view. Standard Chartered and Fundstrat’s Tom Lee are among analysts saying Bitcoin could reach between $200,000 and $250,000 by the end of this year. Tom Lee has put forward a much higher figure for Ethereum, forecasting $15,000 for ETH — a number well above Citi’s most bullish estimate. Related Reading: Fast And Furious: XRP’s Next Rally Predicted To Shock Markets Ethereum’s Path Less Clear? According to Citi, Ethereum faces more unknowns. The bank set a bear case for ETH at $2,000, a base target at $5,400, and a bullish number at $7,300. Those levels sit around a 65% rise from Ethereum’s current price of $4,480 in the best case. Citi explained that Ethereum’s ecosystem is still shifting, so it’s harder to predict how value will be shared across projects and staking participants. Citi’s range is both a warning and a roadmap. It warns that prices can fall sharply — as shown by the $82,000 bear case for Bitcoin and $2,000 for Ethereum — but it also maps possible upside.

52612504,596966,1759500055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52612504.jpeg,Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $1.08B In 4-Day Volume: Fueling Price Momentum,https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-record-1-08b-4-day-volume-momentum/,"Bitcoin is holding strong above the $120,000 level, reinforcing bullish sentiment after a series of volatile weeks. The market now turns its focus to the $125,000 mark, which analysts describe as a critical resistance zone. A decisive break above it could open the door to fresh all-time highs, but for now, traders remain cautious as this level has historically attracted strong selling pressure. Despite the looming resistance, optimism is growing among bullish analysts who see room for continuation in the current cycle. The argument is supported by renewed institutional interest and robust inflows into Bitcoin investment products. Top analyst Maartunn recently shared insights pointing to a key driver of this momentum: Spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Maartunn, these ETFs have generated high trading volumes over the past several days, providing a steady stream of demand that is pushing prices higher in unison. This collective effect underscores how institutional vehicles are playing an increasingly central role in shaping Bitcoin’s price action. Spot ETF Volume Surges as Bitcoin Faces Uncertain Maartun has highlighted fresh data showing that Spot Bitcoin ETFs have processed $1.08 billion in trading volume over the last four days, adding fuel to Bitcoin’s latest push above the $120,000 level. This volume surge supports Maartun’s view that ETFs are playing a central role in sustaining Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, providing consistent inflows that are keeping demand elevated. In his analysis, such strong institutional participation reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class, especially as it continues to gain traction among US investors. However, the picture isn’t entirely clear-cut. The coming days promise to bring heightened volatility, with macroeconomic uncertainty weighing heavily on risk assets. Tightening financial conditions—driven by persistent inflation concerns and cautious Federal Reserve policy—have already begun to limit liquidity across markets. On top of that, the looming threat of a US government shutdown injects an additional layer of instability. Historically, events of this nature have impacted investor confidence, creating sharp swings in both equities and crypto. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin finds itself at a critical juncture. If ETF-driven demand continues, BTC could decisively break higher, targeting fresh all-time highs beyond $125,000. On the other hand, should macro pressures intensify and liquidity dry up, Bitcoin could face a sharp correction, potentially marking the beginning of a more prolonged bearish phase. BTC Price Analysis: Testing $120K Level Bitcoin is holding above $120,000, a level that has quickly become a focal point for both bulls and bears. The chart shows BTC reclaiming momentum after bouncing strongly from the $112,000–$113,000 zone last week, where the 100-day moving average provided key support. The decisive break above $117,500 resistance marked the start of this rally, and BTC has now pushed into the $120K region, a level that previously acted as heavy resistance in August. Short-term momentum looks bullish, as the daily candles show a sequence of higher lows and strong buying pressure. The 50-day moving average has turned upward, aligning with the broader bullish structure. However, BTC now faces the challenge of consolidating above $120K to target the $122,500–$125,000 zone, which analysts view as the next critical resistance before new all-time highs. On the downside, $117,500 now acts as a strong support level. If Bitcoin fails to sustain above $120K, a retest of this zone would not necessarily break the bullish structure but could extend consolidation.

The company is positioning its digital asset, XRP, at the forefront of a financial revolution , aligning with traditional institutions and regulatory frameworks to reshape the digital asset ecosystem. DTCC’s Strategic Integration of XRP The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a pivotal entity in global financial infrastructure, has filed a patent detailing a system for managing digital liquidity tokens. This system explicitly incorporates XRP and Stellar Lumens, highlighting their potential role in tokenizing liquidity across various asset classes. Given that the DTCC processes trillions of dollars in securities annually, this move signifies a significant endorsement of XRP’s capabilities in modernizing financial operations. THE XRP ENDGAME IS IN MOTION This isn’t hype. This is coordination on a scale crypto has never seen. Banks, regulators, and Ripple are quietly locking pieces into place – a setup that could reshape not just XRP, but the entire market in 2025. If you don’t see what’s… pic.twitter.com/2Etc6XVpk7 — Phantom_Defi (@0xPhantomDefi) October 2, 2025 Ripple’s Institutional Advancements Ripple’s commitment to integrating XRP into the traditional financial system is evident through several strategic initiatives: RLUSD Stablecoin: Ripple launched Ripple USD (RLUSD), an enterprise-focused stablecoin, with reserves held by BNY Mellon, a financial institution worth $53 trillion. This partnership underscores Ripple’s dedication to compliance and institutional-grade infrastructure. Banking Charter Application: Ripple has applied for a national bank charter with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) under the name “Ripple National Trust Bank.” This move aims to enhance regulatory clarity and operational legitimacy. Federal Reserve Access: In tandem, Ripple is pursuing a Federal Reserve Master Account through its subsidiary, Standard Custody & Trust Company. This would grant Ripple direct access to the U.S. central bank’s payment infrastructure, positioning XRP as a central player in the financial system.

These filings, from prominent issuers such as Bitwise, ProShares, and CoinShares, could facilitate the influx of institutional capital into XRP, transitioning it from a speculative asset to a mainstream investment vehicle. ISO 20022 Compliance and Global Standardization As the global financial sector transitions to the ISO 20022 messaging standard , XRP’s compliance positions it favorably. While XRP itself may not be ISO 20022 compliant, Ripple’s involvement in the standardization body facilitates its integration into the evolving financial infrastructure. DNA Protocol: Merging Identity with Blockchain Beyond financial transactions, Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL) is exploring the fusion of biometric and genomic identity through the DNA Protocol . This initiative aims to anchor personal identity data on the blockchain, enhancing privacy and security in digital interactions. In conclusion, Ripple’s strategic initiatives are positioning XRP as a cornerstone of the evolving financial ecosystem. Through collaborations with traditional financial institutions, regulatory advancements, and innovative technological integrations, XRP is poised to play a pivotal role in the future of global finance.

The second-largest cryptocurrency has reclaimed the $4,400 level, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Investors are closely watching whether ETH can extend this recovery into a sustained breakout, with many expecting that a decisive move higher could open the path toward testing yearly highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dynamics Show Healthy Market Structure: Analyst Sets $130K Target Still, not all market voices are aligned. While momentum appears to favor the bulls, several analysts warn of risks that could challenge Ethereum’s upward trajectory. Concerns range from declining liquidity in certain segments of the market to profit-taking by large holders, which could weigh on price action if upside fails to hold. Adding to the discussion, top analyst Axel Adler has shared insights comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance this year. His data reveals that while both assets have taken different paths in their respective rallies, they ultimately point to the same destination: a continuation of the broader bullish cycle. This perspective has fueled optimism that ETH’s recovery may not just be a short-term bounce but part of a larger, ongoing trend that aligns with Bitcoin’s strength. Ethereum Catches Up to Bitcoin l Adler highlights an important development in Ethereum’s market trajectory. Over the last quarter, Ethereum has nearly matched Bitcoin in annual performance, a sign of growing strength for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. In his latest analysis, Adler shared a chart comparing the one-year performance of BTC and ETH, measured from October 2024 to today. The data reveals that both assets have surged over 90% in the past year, despite taking different routes to arrive at similar results. Bitcoin has largely been the driver of crypto market momentum in 2025, with ETFs, institutional inflows, and macroeconomic narratives fueling demand. Ethereum, on the other hand, faced periods of underperformance earlier this year, weighed down by high volatility and concerns around liquidity. However, its recent resurgence has narrowed the gap and demonstrated that ETH remains firmly aligned with the broader bullish cycle. Adler’s findings suggest that ETH’s current positioning is not just a coincidence, but a reflection of strengthening fundamentals and adoption. With Ethereum continuing to dominate in DeFi, stablecoin issuance, and tokenization initiatives, the recovery in performance compared to Bitcoin indicates growing confidence from both retail and institutional investors. This convergence between BTC and ETH performance reinforces the view that the two assets, while distinct in their use cases, are moving in tandem toward the same broader trend: a bullish cycle that could see both testing new all-time highs in the coming months. Related Reading: Metaplanet Expands Bitcoin Holdings To Over 30K BTC – Details ETH Testing Pivotal Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $4,483, showing signs of strength after reclaiming the $4,400 level. The 8-hour chart highlights a decisive bounce from sub-$4,000 levels last week, with buyers stepping in aggressively to defend support around $3,900. This recovery has pushed ETH back above its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, a positive technical signal that reinforces short-term bullish momentum. The next major resistance lies around the $4,500–$4,600 zone, an area that has repeatedly capped upside attempts since August. A clean breakout above this band could trigger a move toward the previous local highs near $4,800, and potentially open the path toward $5,000. On the downside, $4,300 now acts as immediate support, followed by the $4,000 psychological level. Related Reading: Tokenized US Stocks & ETFs Coming To Telegram Wallet Via Kraken & BackedFi Volume has been supportive during this recent rally, signaling strong demand.

The U.K. controls $7.35B in seized Bitcoin tied to a Chinese fraud case — movements are market-sensitive. Seized on July 27, 2021, the wallets rose from ~$2.4B to $7.35B as Bitcoin appreciated, creating legal and market risk ahead of 2026 hearings. ETF inflows ($675.8M single-day) and October optimism lift demand; experts note lower correlation with equities and possible institutional interest. Meta description: U.K. $7.35B Bitcoin stash seized in 2021 now draws investor scrutiny; learn why movements matter, market context, and what traders should watch. Read more. The U.K.’s $7.35B Bitcoin stash from a Chinese fraud case stirs legal battles, ETF inflows, and market-wide investor attention. The U.K. holds $7.35B in seized Bitcoin from a Chinese fraud case, with any wallet movement closely watched by traders. Bitcoin’s surge to $7.35B in seized U.K. wallets highlights legal uncertainty for victims and looming 2026 court hearings. Strong ETF inflows, rising October optimism, and the U.K.’s frozen $7.35B stash combine to keep Bitcoin in sharp focus. The United Kingdom now controls one of the world’s largest Bitcoin stashes, valued at $7.35 billion . This holding is linked to a large Chinese investment fraud prosecution and has become a focal point for both legal proceedings and market watchers. CryptoQuant analyst JA_Maartun reports the seized addresses remain under continuous surveillance as traders, forensic analysts, and investigators look for any signs of movement. The consolidation of these coins and their static on-chain pattern since seizure heighten sensitivity: any transfer could be interpreted as government liquidation, custodial reshuffling, or over-the-counter (OTC) settlement activity. What is the background of the seized Bitcoin and who is involved? The seized Bitcoin relates to a fraud case centered on Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, who recently pleaded guilty in London to laundering billions in Bitcoin. Her associate, Jian Wen, was convicted in 2024, and other accomplices have admitted laundering charges. Authorities are pursuing civil recovery of the assets while victims seek restitution. How did the stash grow from $2.4B to $7.35B? The seized coins were consolidated into official seizure addresses on July 27, 2021, when the total value was roughly $2.4 billion. Bitcoin’s subsequent multi-year appreciation transformed the static seized balance to a current value near $7.35 billion . That price appreciation — not new inflows — explains the larger valuation. Why does any movement from these wallets matter to markets? Any wallet transfer could signal several outcomes: government sale to satisfy judgments, custody transfers to regulated custodians, or private OTC settlements. Traders watch these addresses because large outflows can create immediate liquidity pressure, while transfers inside regulated custody may be neutral but still prompt speculative reactions. What role do ETF inflows and macro sentiment play? Renewed demand for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs adds a parallel source of buying pressure. On one recent session, funds received $675.8 million — the largest single-day inflow since mid-September — suggesting strong institutional appetite. Analysts, including Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas (quoted in market commentary), note that lower correlation of Bitcoin with equities can increase institutional interest. Additionally, growing speculation about an October rate cut and historical seasonality known as “Uptober” (nine of the past ten years showing strong October gains) are cited by market participants as supporting demand. How should traders and investors monitor the seizure wallets? Traders should track on-chain alerts for large transfers, address clustering changes, and sudden spikes in transaction fees. Use exchange and OTC desk flow data, monitor U.K. court filings for new recovery actions, and watch ETF inflow reports for demand-side signals. Combine on-chain evidence with market microstructure indicators for best results. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much Bitcoin does the U.K. hold in the seized stash?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The U.K. seizure addresses currently hold Bitcoin valued at approximately $7.35 billion, consolidated in July 2021 and remaining largely untouched on-chain since then."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Could movement from the seized wallets impact Bitcoin prices?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

The coins were consolidated on July 27, 2021, when the total value was approximately $2.4 billion; price appreciation since then raised the valuation to about $7.35 billion. Who are the defendants and what are the legal timelines? Zhimin Qian (Yadi Zhang) pleaded guilty in London to laundering Bitcoin; Jian Wen was convicted in 2024. Civil recovery actions are ongoing with key hearings slated for 2026. Key Takeaways Seized value: The U.K. seizure addresses now hold approximately $7.35B in Bitcoin, up from $2.4B due to price gains. Market sensitivity: Any movement could be interpreted as liquidation or custody changes and may influence price action quickly. Context matters: Strong ETF inflows, macro rate speculation, and historical seasonal patterns increase the potential market impact. Conclusion The U.K.’s $7.35B Bitcoin stash is both a legal asset recovery story and a live market variable. Traders and institutions should monitor on-chain activity, court developments, and ETF flows to gauge potential volatility.

Nearly five months later, the deal remains stalled as Commerce Secretary demands U.S. investments first, frustrating CEO Jensen Huang. According to a WSJ report, Jensen Huang and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks are disappointed by the delays. Jensen Huang and David Sacks view the UAE agreement as key to staying ahead of China in the AI race. President Trump secures $200 billion U.A.E. chip pact MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN 💸 President Trump secured a $200 billion investment by @MicronTech , a U.S.-based manufacturer of chips—another win for American workers and national security! pic.twitter.com/6OwK2aD8hH — The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 12, 2025 A White House report showed that President Trump had negotiated more than $200 billion in U.S.-UAE agreements. The trade agreements are built on $1.4 trillion investment framework that will support the U.S. growth in AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, quantum computing, biotechnology, and manufacturing. The President announced that the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates had agreed on a framework that would enable Abu Dhabi to purchase advanced American AI chips. The chips are expected to be produced by tech giants like Nvidia. The UAE agreed to invest in the U.S in exchange for up to 500,000 AI chips annually from 2025 to 2027. According to the agreement, the UAE will invest $1 billion in U.S.-based projects to construct and finance data centres for training AI models. Nvidia is expected to export $7 billion worth of advanced chips in return, with most of them going to U.S. companies operating in the Middle East. Jensen Huang stated that the UAE is progressing with its arrangement by exchanging $1 billion worth of Nvidia processors for a 1:1 ratio of the country’s investment in the United States. Huang also revealed that at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia chips will be shipped from the United Arab Emirates to the United States in return. However, the agreement depends largely on approval from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. U.S. According to the Congressional Research Service, Intelligence Agencies, Regulators, and Congress have taken notice of Emirati-based corporations partnering with other tech businesses from China. For instance, the report revealed that G42, a technology group that invents visionary artificial intelligence in Abu Dhabi, used Huawei hardware banned in the U.S for its data centers. According to the report, G42’s use of Huawei hardware prompted U.S. officials to warn the UAE government that it must decide whether to collaborate with Chinese companies or with U.S. and other Western-based companies in the field of Artificial Intelligence. U.S officials have reportedly discussed denying G42 Nvidia chips after the discovery. The Abu Dhabi-based AI company was supposed to have direct access to approximately 20% of the 500,000 Nvidia semiconductors under the arrangement. Nvidia challenges U.S export rules as chip sales face 15% The White House is reportedly facing growing tension with Nvidia over trade regulatory policies imposed on U.S. export controls on semiconductors. The Biden Administration imposed these restrictions in October 2022 in an effort to prevent China from acquiring advanced semiconductors, which are essential for the development of AI. Nvidia collaborated with Lutnick to obtain the necessary licenses to export chips to China. In August, Nvidia and AMD agreed to allocate a 15% share of their revenues from chip sales to the U.S. government in exchange for an export license to China. Doug Jacobson, an international Trade Attorney, argued that 15% is an illegal export tax. Nvidia responded in a press release that the company adheres to the rules set by the U.S. government for its participation in global markets. Nvidia reported in July that strict export regulations on its chip shipments would cost the business an additional $5.5 billion. The strict export regulations were enforced after the tech firm announced plans to build AI servers worth $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years with help from partners such as TSMC.

How Will This Affect the Fed? Three Fed Members Speak Out!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-government-shutdown-suspends-data-how-will-this-affect-the-fed-three-fed-members-speak-out/,"As a result of the US shutdown, the government will suspend all operations except essential services and many employees will be furloughed. This will negatively impact the functioning of government institutions, as many will continue to operate with limited staff. At this point, the shutdown could also affect the FED, which acts based on economic data. This means that the FED may not have enough data to assess the economic situation and the continuation of interest rate cuts may become uncertain. While the effects of the government shutdown in the US are being wondered, three FED members Austan Goolsbee, John Williams and Stephen Miran evaluated the effects of the government shutdown on the economy. Speaking to CNBC, Goolsbee said the Fed is playing a double role, saying it's wary of cutting interest rates too quickly because the threats posed by the shutdown could boost both inflation and employment. “I'm a little nervous about front-loading interest rate cuts and waiting for inflation to come down.” New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams, in his statement, did not directly comment on interest rate cuts. Williams stated that there will always be unforeseen situations and that the FED should be prepared for these unforeseen situations. At this point, Williams said central banks need to prepare strategies to operate in an environment of uncertainty, and that this uncertainty will continue “for the foreseeable future.” Finally, Stephen Miran, who was recommended by Trump and elected as a member of the FED in recent weeks, predicted that the FED would have the data it needs by the next FOMC meeting. Miran, who supports the Fed's decision to cut interest rates further, stated that access to data is important for the Fed's decisions. *This is not investment advice.

Indeed, historical data shows that October tends to deliver high returns for the cryptocurrency (over 20% on average), earning the month its signature “Uptober” nickname. The situation this year is particularly interesting, as the Bitcoin price has been propped by more than favorable macroeconomic conditions, including the U.S. government shutdown following a failure to pass a funding bill on Wednesday, October 1. Given all the positive factors that are coinciding together, it is not surprising that “digital gold” has seen a noticeable increase in valuation over the past few days. Indeed, since the beginning of the month, Bitcoin market cap has climbed up from $2.276 trillion to roughly $2.40 trillion at press time, Friday, October 3, as per CoinMarket Cap . That marks a $124 billion, or nearly 5.5%, increase. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at approximately $120,280, up a modest 0.60% on the daily chart. BTC price. Source: Finbold Bitcoin on a run With the $120,000 level reclaimed, investor confidence is also rising, particularly in the exchange-traded funds ( ETF ) sector. For instance, BlackRock alone saw $446 million in inflows on Thursday, October 2. Large-holder activity has also been noteworthy, as whales have bought over 30,000 Bitcoin BTC in 48 hours, worth about $3,6 billion. Further appetite could, of course, drive the momentum further, extending the rally to potentially new all-time highs (ATH) in the final quarter. Accordingly, Citigroup raised its year-end targets for the asset to $132,000. However, maintaining the $120,000 level will be critical. Immediate resistance sits at $122,000, just below the August 14 ATH of $124,474. Conversely, a slip below $120,000 could potentially lead to further losses at $117,000 and temporarily stall the rally.

Privacy ensures sensitive data is protected, while accountability guarantees compliance and trust. The conversation around XRP has now reached a turning point where both demands intersect, placing Ripple’s XRP at the heart of a much larger shift in global finance . Why Privacy Is Now at the Core of XRP’s Future RippleX recently emphasized that public ledgers must provide privacy for institutions to operate and deliver accountability for regulators to sign off. This dual requirement is not optional. Banks cannot afford to expose client data or transaction flows on an open ledger, while regulators cannot compromise on transparency and compliance. Programmable privacy — the ability to tailor what is visible and to whom — is emerging as the solution that bridges this divide. For XRP, this means becoming more than just a token traded on public exchanges. With privacy-enhanced features, it positions itself as a neutral settlement layer where banks, governments, and financial institutions can move value without undermining regulatory oversight. This is where it gets interesting… XRP https://t.co/2L9UgxJ17j pic.twitter.com/g8Wxz5v6Dx — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 2, 2025 Chad Steingraber’s Perspective on What Comes Next Chad Steingraber, a prominent game designer and long-time XRP advocate, has pointed out that this is precisely where things get interesting for XRP investors. He highlights that privacy is not just a technical feature, but the missing piece that enables XRP to scale from a retail-traded asset into a global institutional settlement tool. According to Steingraber, the XRP community has long underestimated the extent to which institutional adoption hinges on these privacy solutions. He suggests that programmable privacy could usher in a new phase where liquidity is managed primarily through bank-grade custody and off-ledger mechanisms, significantly altering XRP’s demand and supply dynamics. Regulatory and Institutional Implications Steingraber’s vision aligns with broader regulatory conversations around tokenization. Institutions are only willing to tokenize assets and settle payments on-chain if the infrastructure provides both selective disclosure and legal audit trails. Regulators, in turn, require the ability to review transactions when needed without compromising commercial confidentiality. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This balance is the foundation upon which financial institutions can commit trillions in value to distributed systems. Without it, large-scale adoption of XRP or any other settlement token remains a nonstarter. Building the Tools for the Next Era The technical groundwork is being laid through projects exploring privacy-preserving transaction layers and selective-disclosure protocols. These advancements ensure that public networks such as the XRP Ledger can still provide auditability and compliance while safeguarding sensitive financial flows. Steingraber’s remarks point to this technological readiness as the critical moment investors should be watching. Why Investors Should Pay Attention Now Chad Steingraber’s message to the XRP community is clear: the narrative is shifting from speculative trading to institutional-grade infrastructure. Privacy is no longer an afterthought; it is the gatekeeper to real-world adoption. As programmable privacy matures and regulatory clarity emerges, XRP could be propelled into the “big leagues” — not by hype, but by solving problems global finance can no longer ignore.

The token achieved the highest daily turnover, with daily trading exceeding the token’s supply. XPL is the most actively traded token, with daily turnover exceeding the supply for a ratio of 1.1. The token is still trading with a high mindshare, though this is not reflected in the market price. XPL open interest also stalled at just under $1B, with around 67% in long positions. For now, the token mostly saw long liquidations , to the tune of $3.3M in the past 24 hours. The token is still highly active on Hyperliquid, with 56% of whales going long. However, the biggest Hyperliquid position is a short trade with a $72.5M notional value. XPL has been sliding since September 28, after peaking at $1.67. The token’s price remained relatively depressed, despite the recent news of picking up ChainLink as a reliable oracle. Stablecoin rails for global money movement require accurate, high performance data feeds. We are partnering with @Chainlink to provide oracle services on Plasma so builders can use digital dollars to create life-changing financial applications for those who need it most. https://t.co/FSt7zHSTwZ — Plasma (@Plasma) October 3, 2025 Even with the promises of becoming a stablecoin and financial hub, the early performance of XPL disappointed some of the investors, while the chain still has to show its real utility. XPL trades with multiple sources of liquidity Despite the attention, XPL traded under $0.90, getting closer to its all-time low of $0.74. The launch of XPL coincided with other high-profile airdrops, especially Aster (ASTER). However, XPL did not achieve the ‘up only’ result following its airdrop , despite the overall market recovery. Plasma is still the most active token based on the ratio of its trading volumes to market cap. Volumes ranged between $2.4B and $1.7B, turning over the entire circulating supply of 1.8B tokens. The volumes are also consistently above the token’s market cap of $1.6B, suggesting significant liquidity and lively trading. XPL activity includes KRW pairs, though the liquidity on those markets is shifting quickly. | Source: Cryptocompare XPL activity shifted to Bybit, which carries over 24% of the trade volume, with 18% on Binance. The current XPL valuation also includes a reported 49% of volumes against the Korean won. The token’s pairs on Upbit and Bithumb, however, have fluctuating volumes as XPL still discovers its main sources of liquidity. Did the Plasma team sell XPL tokens? One of the sources of price pressure for XPL was rumours of insider selling. However, most of the XPL is vested and visible on a single address , at least on its BSC version. There are no signs of selling or sending XPL to exchanges. Plasma’s CEO, Paul Faecks, denied the rumours of insider selling, despite chart analysts suspecting a directed effort to tank the price of XPL. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, on-chain data indicate that the Wintermute market maker transferred significant amounts of XPL to exchanges. The token gained immediate listings and may also have some of its volumes boosted by market makers. Plasma’s high-profile launch and its positioning as the sixth-largest chain by value locked and stablecoin supply also meant XPL was seen as a potential breakout token, similar to ASTER.

Long-term Bitcoin holders (18–24 months) are increasing their share of supply. This accumulation aligns with the January 2024 spot Bitcoin ETF approval and greater institutional access. On-chain data from CryptoQuant indicates a measurable uptick in long-term retention since 2024. Long-term Bitcoin holders rising: evidence of durable accumulation after the spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Read the data-driven analysis and expert notes. What are long-term Bitcoin holders and why are they rising? Long-term Bitcoin holders are investors retaining BTC for 18 months or longer; their rising share suggests deliberate accumulation and stronger investor conviction. On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows growth in the 18–24 month cohort, which historically stabilizes price through cycles and supports sustained rallies. How did the spot Bitcoin ETF approval influence long-term holding? The January 2024 approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF increased accessibility for institutional and retail investors, coinciding with higher accumulation among long-term holders. CryptoQuant analyst Avocado_onchain observed that ETF-listed access and traditional finance entry points contributed to strategic portfolio allocation and longer holding horizons. Long-term Bitcoin holders are rising in share, signaling stronger conviction and positioning as Bitcoin consolidates in the current rally. The 18 months to 2-year long hold of Bitcoin by investors boosts momentum as more participants commit to long-term expansion. The accumulation trend is consistent with structural changes after the spot Bitcoin ETF approval in January 2024. Rising long-term holders indicate active conviction and a transition from passive endurance to intentional market positioning. Bitcoin is leading the current rally, and the distinct trend is a growing proportion of long-term investors. These investors are increasingly aligning for multi-year growth, signaling a strategic shift in market participation and conviction. How does on-chain data show the trend in long-term holding? On-chain metrics from CryptoQuant register increases in supply held by addresses that have not moved coins for 18–24 months. This cohort, historically resilient through bear cycles, now represents a larger share of circulating supply. The data indicates accumulation peaks correlated with improved market infrastructure and ETF uptake. Why does a higher share of long-term holders matter? Higher long-term retention reduces available liquid supply, which can amplify price stability and upward momentum. These holders have historically acted as a stabilizing base during downturns. If the trend continues, the market could shift from short-term volatility-driven moves to more durable, conviction-based rallies. A Growing Base of Committed Holders CryptoQuant, via analyst Avocado_onchain, noted that Bitcoin’s rebound is supported by investors holding assets for 18 months to 2 years. Historically, this group preserved positions through extended bear markets and now appears to be deliberately positioning for continued growth. Why the Rising Share of Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Matters in This Rally “If trend continues, it signals that investors are not just holding because of past conditions but are deliberately positioning for long-term growth.” – By @avocado_onchain Link: pic.twitter.com/heRrmVcHry — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 3, 2025 The current trend suggests behavior evolution: many holders now deliberately align with Bitcoin’s growth trajectory rather than merely enduring volatility. The expanding cohort demonstrates how market participation is adapting as Bitcoin consolidates at higher levels. When did accumulation accelerate? Accumulation accelerated around January 2024 with the spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Since then, on-chain indicators showed a sustained increase in long-term holding cohorts, reflecting strategic portfolio shifts and institutional engagement in the market. Key Takeaways Long-term accumulation : The 18–24 month holder cohort has grown, strengthening market foundations. ETF correlation : Spot Bitcoin ETF approval in January 2024 coincided with increased long-term retention. Market impact : Rising long-term holders reduce liquid supply and support more durable rallies; monitor on-chain metrics for confirmation. Frequently Asked Questions How do long-term holders affect Bitcoin price stability? Long-term holders reduce circulating supply available to trade, which can dampen volatility and support upward pressure when demand rises. Historically, increased long-term retention has correlated with more stable recovery phases. Can ETF approvals change investor holding behavior? Yes. Structural access provided by ETF approvals encourages institutional and retail allocations, often leading to longer holding periods as Bitcoin becomes more integrated with traditional portfolios. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How do long-term holders affect Bitcoin price stability?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Long-term holders reduce circulating supply available to trade, which can dampen volatility and support upward pressure when demand rises.

52615472,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=826756,1759505200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52615472.jpeg,Shareholders push back against Musk’s $1 trillion compensation plan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tesla-investors-dispute-elon-musk-1-trillion/,"A group of Tesla investors has written a letter asking other Tesla shareholders to vote against the new pay proposal at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on November 6. The proposal provides a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, which could be worth around $1 trillion. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Tesla revealed the proposed $1 trillion pay package last month. However, for Musk to access the full payout, he needs to increase Tesla’s market capitalisation to $8.5 trillion over the next decade and achieve a series of significant product milestones. These include boosting annual earnings to $400 billion a year, building a million Optimus robots, and delivering around 12 million EVs by 2035. This translates to an average of 1.2 million a year. According to the Tesla board, “Tesla’s Special Committee designed a performance incentive plan that completely aligns Elon’s compensation & shareholder value creation. If Elon Musk doesn’t deliver results, he receives nothing “We’re talking about trillions of dollars of value for shareholders + efforts that will accelerate global prosperity.” Tesla board members have personal ties with Musk Signatories of the letter include Tesla investor SOC Investment Group, the American Federation of Teachers, and the state treasurers of Nevada, New Mexico, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Colorado, as well as the controllers of Maryland and New York City. The shareholder group criticized Tesla’s board for not securing a commitment from Musk, who runs several companies, to “devote his attention” to Tesla. They warned that the pay package could lead to share dilution for Tesla shareholders. The letter said, “The Board has permitted Mr Musk to be overcommitted for years, allowing him to continue as CEO while taking time-consuming leadership roles at his other companies, xAI/X, SpaceX, Neuralink, and Boring Company.” They also pointed to how the board most recently failed to intervene when Musk took a leadership position at the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to them, the role had a negative impact on the company’s performance and brand. The group of investors said that the board of directors of the EV giant isn’t independent enough from Musk and that the billionaire’s pay package’s performance criteria are vague and not as hard as they seem at first. They questioned the board’s ability to provide objective and rigorous oversight of management at Tesla, noting that directors have deep personal and professional ties to CEO Musk. Shareholders cite poor performance The letter also pointed to the EV giant’s volatile performance, with sales and revenue both slumping in the first half of the year amid rising competition and backlash over Musk’s political activities. Tesla reported a 13% year-over-year decline in sales in both the first and second quarters of 2025. Through July 2025, Tesla’s sales dropped the most in France by 27%, Belgium by 58%, Sweden by 86%, Denmark by 52%, and the Netherlands by 62%. According to reports, Tesla’s sales in Europe decreased by more than a third in the first six months of 2025. Its market share for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) went from 21.6% to 14.5%. Reports also indicate that Tesla’s battery business experienced a decline in sales, partly due to Mr Musk’s political activities. Tesla’s car sales were 18% lower in the first half of 2025 than in the first half of 2024. Its operating income and net income plummeted by 52% and 38%, respectively. According to the group of investors, quick drops in sales and profits are signs of problems that need to be solved by a board that keeps a close eye on management and makes sure there is a full-time Tesla EV production. Source: CNBC According to their reports, the company reported 497,099 total deliveries in the third quarter of this year. This is a 7% surge from last year’s 462,890 deliveries. However, Tesla saw a decline in production this quarter compared to the 469,796 vehicles produced last year.

BTC's 4-year cycle and technical indicators suggest a potential market top within the next 6-12 months, possibly peaking near $150,000. Global liquidity trends and central bank actions will be crucial, with risks from inflation or an AI-driven recession threatening the rally. Given mounting risks and overextended technicals, now is a prudent time to de-risk and reduce Bitcoin exposure. Thesis Summary Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has once again reclaimed the $120,000 area as we enter what could be the most bullish month of the year. However, the Bitcoin 4-year cycle is nearing its end, suggesting Bitcoin could be topping in the next run-up. Ultimately, though, I believe global liquidity will determine if we can head even higher for longer. Nonetheless, as we reach my long-term Bitcoin target, I do think this could be a good time to de-risk from Bitcoin. While I remain bullish long-term, I am downgrading Bitcoin to a Hold due to these reasons. Uptober And The 4-Year Cycle Historically speaking, October has been the best month for Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation, hence the coining of the term Uptober. BTC Seasonality (TrendSpider) With not that much to go on in terms of traditional fundamentals, crypto investors often look at things like seasonality. This brings me to my next point, which is the fact that we are approaching the end of the Bitcoin 4-year cycle. BTC 4-year Cycle (Crypto Rover) This 4-year cycle also coincides with the dates of the Bitcoin halving, which usually precedes a big price rally, followed by a top, bear market, consolidation, and then the next halving, which restarts the cycle. Bitcoin’s last halving was on April 19th, 2024. If history is about to repeat itself, then we should see Bitcoin top anywhere from 12-18 months following this halving. Ultimately, this means Bitcoin’s four-year cycle could complete in Q4 of 2025. But although the halving cycle has served us well in the past, I think the real mover of Bitcoin is the liquidity cycle, which has just happened to coincide with the 4-year halving cycle. What’s Next For Liquidity? Bitcoin vs. M2 (Bitcoin Magazine) As we can see, Bitcoin has moved in line with Global M2 for the last decade. The tops in 2018 and 2022 also coincided with liquidity and market tops. So the real question here is: what’s next for liquidity? Over the past few months, we have benefited from some favourable liquidity dynamics. PBoC liquidity injections Weaker USD Lower bond volatility Fiscal stimulus As we approach 2026, this is something that could change. Japan and the US continue to taper, though the Fed has now begun cutting rates. China’s PBoC should continue to support markets as it expands liquidity. And the dollar looks set to keep sliding. Overall, it looks like countries around the world are intent on keeping stimulus in line with the dynamics I’ve mentioned before of monetary debasement necessary to deliver global debt. The Two Big Risk Factors As we approach 2026, though, there are two big risk factors that could derail markets. AI Recession Inflation The outlook for liquidity depends on what Central Banks and markets do. My biggest worry, right now, is that as Central Banks like the Fed cut into an already hot economy, inflation could spark another 2022-style selloff in equities and crypto. On the other hand, an AI recession could take the market down in the other direction, through deflation. Expectations are sky high right now, perhaps with good reason, but this could begin to unwind in the other direction as growth and valuations peak. In my opinion, the biggest bottleneck right now is power, with today’s power grids potentially not being ready to accommodate the sudden increase in AI demand. Data Center Energy Demand (SemiAnalysis) This means even if AI efficiencies are real, it’s possible that data centers are going to be overbuilt, to the extent that not all of them might be able to operate given energy limitations. Bitcoin Technical Analysis All in all, there are various risk factors lining up, which, paired with the dynamics of the 4-year cycle and the fact that we are reaching important technical levels, make me wary about Bitcoin over the next six months. BTC TA (Author's Work) This Bitcoin rally is running on fumes. Note that we are having trouble breaking through the resistance from the green trendline drawn from the 2021 top, which also lines up quite well with the 2 ext of the bear market. On the other hand, we are forming a huge RSI divergence on the weekly chart. In my view, if we managed to reach the 2.618 ext at $150,000, paired with the RSI entering overbought and touching that trendline we have drawn on the indicator, this would be enough for me to reduce exposure significantly to Bitcoin. On the other hand, a break below the 50-week EMA now, which sits at $100,000, would be an initial indication that momentum has turned decidedly bearish Final Thoughts Bitcoin has increased more than 8x since its bear market lows, and it could 10x if we reach the $150,000 level outlined above. With mounting risks in terms of liquidity, AI hype reaching a fever pitch, and technicals looking shaky, I think we could be near the end of this Bitcoin bull run. What happens next will depend on the actions of Central banks, but either way, I think it’s time to take some chips off the table.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-03 15:33:22

Passive income, stable settlements, and transparent audits are becoming the new consensus in crypto asset allocation. As “maintenance-free, low-threshold, and verifiable” infrastructure-like investments, cloud mining platforms are drawing long-term attention from global investors. Among many options, DefiMiner has become the flagship and bellwether in 2025 cloud mining thanks to regulatory credentials, transparent settlements, USDT daily payouts, and superior BTC/DOGE contract returns. Why choose DefiMiner ? The triple moat of compliance, transparency, and stability Regulatory oversight and corporate credentials: DefiMiner is legally registered in the UK and listed with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). A clear compliance framework suits institutional and cross-border capital. Transparent settlement with on-chain verifiability: Each unit of hashrate is anchored to real miners and electricity usage. Payouts are settled daily in USDT, with auditable and traceable data that reduces information asymmetry and operational risk. Institutional-grade security: Dual protection via McAfee and Cloudflare; contract rules and distribution mechanisms are publicly disclosed; supports third-party audits. Zero-cost onboarding for new users: Start with zero cost! New users receive $100 trial funds upon registration and enjoy a stable daily income of $1.6, making it easy to begin your cloud mining earnings journey. Multi-asset, multi-strategy support: Covers BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, SOL, LTC, BCH, USDT, USDC, and more to enable diversified allocation and multi-horizon strategies. Stable operations and scaled hashrate: As of August 2025, publicly reported cumulative hashrate reached 35.6 EH/s, approaching enterprise-grade stability with scale-driven cost advantages. Green energy and sustainability: All data centers run on 100% renewable energy, aligning with ESG and green computing trends for long-term asset managers. Contracts and return examples (short-term flexibility, daily compounding) Who it’s for: Users seeking stable cash flow, strategy traders using short-term compounding, and mid-to-long-term investors prioritizing flexibility and controllable risk. Lateral comparison with major platforms (key differences) 1.Bitdeer: Typically longer contract terms with separate electricity and maintenance fees. Monthly returns often 3–7%. Higher entry threshold, better for experienced miners; less flexible and weaker short-term returns than DefiMiner. 2.ECOS: Strong mobile UX and tools, but minimum 180-day terms and BTC-only payouts. Compared with DefiMiner’s USDT daily settlements and short-term plans, liquidity and volatility hedging are weaker. 3.IQ Mining: Flexible contracts and reasonable pricing, but weaker regulation and audit transparency versus DefiMiner. 4.Genesis Mining: Decent historical reputation, but pricing and transparency are less competitive, higher prepayment thresholds, and returns are more affected by real-time block production, reducing certainty. Conclusion Amid tighter regulation and accelerated energy transition, cloud mining is evolving from “hardware competition” to a “contractual, auditable, steady-cashflow” allocation tool. With FCA oversight, USDT daily payouts, transparent settlements, green hashrate, and flexible short-term contracts, DefiMiner remains near the top of 2025’s cloud mining platforms. Register with DefiMiner now to start your journey toward future-proof passive income and sustainable mining.

Chart Patterns Point to Big Move Ahead,https://cryptopotato.com/is-pepe-waking-up-chart-patterns-point-to-big-move-ahead/,"Pepe (PEPE) is gaining traction among traders, as chart patterns and blockchain activity suggest a potential move higher. The token traded at around $0.00001 at press time, with a 24-hour volume of over $608 million. While the daily change is slightly negative, the token is up 8% over the last seven days. Analysts are now focusing on the $0.0000125 level as the next possible area of interest. Power of 3 Setup Points to a Bullish Move According to Bitcoinsensus, a Power of 3 (PO3) setup is forming on the PEPE/USDT chart. This type of setup includes a period of sideways movement, a temporary drop below support, and then a breakout above the range. The recent dip and recovery seen in late September fit this model. #Pepe Power of 3 Setup in Play $PEPE could be targeting the 0.0000125$ zone next. Range, bear trap , mark up pic.twitter.com/3L3ZBQgKx3 — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) October 3, 2025 Interestingly, the chart shows the price moving from a false breakdown, known as a bear trap, into a new upward phase. With PEPE breaking above the $0.00001000 mark, the setup suggests momentum is shifting. If this continues, the $0.00001250 zone is the next area being watched by traders. Weekly Structure Follows Historical Breakout Pattern A weekly chart posted by EtherNasyonaL shows PEPE forming another triangle pattern, similar to past setups that led to sharp price increases. These past moves started from lower levels such as $0.00000045, followed by breakouts near $0.00001722 and $0.00002836. Notably, the current formation also includes a tightening triangle, with the price now close to the upper trendline. If this pattern holds, a breakout could follow the same direction as earlier moves. The post referred to the setup as “ The sleeping giant $PEPE will soon awaken ,” suggesting the current consolidation phase could be nearing its end. Source: EtherNasyonaL/X In addition, blockchain data from Nansen shows that total token balances held by smaller holders have declined from around 259 trillion to 253 trillion over the past month. In contrast, the top 100 addresses have raised their holdings by 4%, now controlling 307 trillion tokens. Currently, 60.21% of the supply is held across all wallets, with a distribution score of 20. This shift suggests tokens are moving from smaller wallets to larger ones, often interpreted as accumulation during periods of lower activity. Technical Indicators Suggest Pullback May Be Temporary The short-term chart shows PEPE recently pulling back after a sharp move up. Bollinger Bands are widening, indicating more price movements ahead. The token has dropped from the upper band and is now near the middle band, which sits around $0.0000097. Source: TradingView In bullish territory is where the MACD lies. It still remains above the signal line, and the bars of the MACD histogram are shrinking. This indicates that the momentum of the rise is waning; nevertheless, the trend stays in power unless support is blown away. The post Is PEPE Waking Up?

According to the company, approximately 75 million Galaxy device owners in the US will gain direct access to Coinbase One through Samsung Wallet integration. Samsung and Coinbase Partnership: Crypto Access for 75 Million Galaxy Users This development is considered both Coinbase’s largest individual distribution to date and Samsung Galaxy’s most ambitious move into the crypto ecosystem. With the new integration, Galaxy users will be able to trade without fees and benefit from increased staking rewards within Coinbase One. This allows users to experience cryptocurrency directly without downloading additional apps or moving their assets between platforms. Additionally, Samsung Pay will be linked to Coinbase accounts, allowing Galaxy owners to make payments tied to their crypto assets. Users will also be able to access their crypto assets through payment cards, public transportation tickets, and the wallet where they store their ID. “Our mission is to bring over a billion people to blockchain. And the way we do that is by meeting them where they are: on their phones,” said Shan Aggarwal, Head of Business Development at Coinbase. Drew Blackard, Senior Vice President of Mobile Product Management at Samsung Electronics America, emphasized that Samsung Wallet is a trusted tool for millions of users, so they constantly focus on improving the experience with new functions.

A 2025 survey conducted by Boosty Labs found that nearly 90% of companies are experimenting with or have already implemented blockchain . In addition, a number of large banks have started to incorporate crypto offerings into their business models. For example, Spanish banking giant BBVA recently became the first major lender to roll out 24/7 retail cryptocurrency trading. Spanish banking giant @bbva has launched its 24/7 BBVA Bitcoin trading service, along with Ether, for retail customers in Spain. #Bitcoin #Spain #BBVA https://t.co/wlOkGtcsTC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 2, 2025 Privacy Remains the Missing Link for Mass Adoption Privacy remains a key missing link for mass blockchain and crypto adoption. According to findings from the consulting firm EY, enterprise transactions have been slow to take off due to the lack of privacy tools. A commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of EY further reveals that enterprises are most concerned with privacy and security. Tomer Weller, chief product officer at the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), told Cryptonews that while privacy was acceptable to sacrifice for early crypto adopters, it has become a non-negotiable for mass adoption—especially for enterprises that require privacy when using a public ledger. The Role of ZKPs for Blockchain Privacy Yet while privacy remains a major challenge for businesses using blockchain, Weller believes that many of these issues can be resolved through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs ). “ZKPs enable both the openness that makes blockchains secure and trustworthy, along with the privacy that real-world users demand,” Weller said. “ZKPs allow someone to prove something is true, like ‘I have sufficient funds’ or ‘this transaction is compliant,’ without exposing the underlying data.” Weller added that while zero-knowledge technology has been one of the most talked-about areas in blockchain for years, the concept has now matured to demonstrate scalability and privacy for Layer-1 (L1) networks like Stellar. The Evolution of ZKPs: From Theory to Reality To put this in perspective, Weller explained that SDF recently implemented tools to allow Web3 developers to easily write zero-knowledge applications in well-known programming languages. This is important, as Weller noted that building zero-knowledge applications (often referred to as “zk circuits”) has historically been challenging. For instance, ZK circuits typically require domain expertise in zero-knowledge cryptography. For example, most ZK applications in existence today were built using the Circom DSL , also known as “domain-specific language.” “Circom is a very powerful programming language, but equally challenging to master,” Weller said. To make ZK applications more approachable, SDF recently partnered with privacy-focused Layer-2 Aztec Network to build a Noir programming language (NoirLang) verifier compatible with Stellar’s smart contract runtime. Weller pointed out that “NoirLang” is a more modern ZK DSL that is very similar to the common programming language Rust. As a result, the learning curve required with NoirLang is less steep than that of Circom, making ZK applications more accessible. Milica Vulic, developer relations engineer at zkVerify and a PhD candidate in Zero-Knowledge Proofs, further told Cryptonews that advancements such as these show how ZKPs are moving from academic theory into developer reality. “A few years ago, writing a ZKP application meant designing custom circuits in low-level maths, something only cryptographers could do,” Vulic said. “Today, we are seeing new tools and languages that make ZK development accessible to any skilled programmer.” For example, Vulic noted that in addition to NoirLang, “Leo” is another programming language that lets developers write circuits in a high-level syntax, similar to traditional programming languages. Vulic added that L1 blockchains can now integrate with existing zero-knowledge stacks, as demonstrated by Stellar. “Aztec’s Noir and Risc0’s zkVM make ZK practical, letting developers turn existing codebases into ZK-enabled apps without needing to be cryptographers,” Vulic said. Additionally, Vulic mentioned that open-source kits like zkVerifyJS and APIs through Horizen’s Relayer allow developers to verify proofs with a single function call instead of building infrastructure from scratch. “The result is a shift from ‘cryptographers only’ to ‘any developer can plug in ZK.’ This evolution is what will push ZKPs from specialized use cases into mainstream applications,” Vulic stated. The Rise of zkVMs As ZK applications become easier to write, the rise of Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs) is also helping programmers build these applications. A recent blog post from Block & Capital explains that, unlike traditional virtual machines (VMs) that execute programs, a zkVM integrates cryptographic processes to ensure privacy and security by incorporating ZKPs. This allows the verification of program execution without revealing information about the program’s data or internal logic. Additionally, while “zkEVMs” are specialized for the Ethereum blockchain , zkVMs provide general-purpose solutions for various blockchains. For example, Weller shared that “ Risc0 ” is one such zkVM that has recently been gaining traction in the blockchain industry. “SDF has partnered with Nethermind, a leading dev shop in the ZK and blockchain space, to bring the Risc0 verifier to Stellar. This project is well underway,” Weller said. First Risc0 Stellar contract. It's beautiful. https://t.co/lDrlA9spLw — Tomer Weller (@tomerweller) September 18, 2025 The Next Phase of ZKPs As ZKPs become more accessible, industry experts believe that zero-knowledge technology will help scale blockchain and crypto adoption. However, it remains questionable as to how fast this will occur. “ZK is entering its next phase with instant proofs, cross-chain interoperability, and walletless verification that anyone can use,” Vulic said. “But we are not sure how fast the shift from research labs to global infrastructure will happen.” In the meantime, Zac Williamson, co-founder and CEO of Aztec Labs, told Cryptonews that Aztec Network is currently in its testnet phase, with the mainnet projected to be launched by early next year. “Once the Aztec Network is live, we will see privacy-preserving applications built with ZK technology deployed and available for all users. What WhatsApp did for private messaging, the Aztec Network will do for all applications, making them secure, private, and universally accessible,” Williamson stated. Weller further commented that the Stellar protocol will soon offer a wide array of built-in cryptographic primitives to ensure cutting-edge ZK innovation. While promising, it’s also important to note that challenges associated with zero-knowledge technology may slow adoption. For instance, findings from Block & Capital note that developers must learn to balance speed, efficiency, and succinctness (the amount of data that needs to be transmitted and stored to prove that a transaction or contract execution is valid without revealing unnecessary information). The blog post states: “Finding the balance between these three factors is the great challenge of the zkVM trilemma, since improving one aspect often means compromising the other two. For example, increasing speed may require more resources, reducing efficiency, or may result in less succinct testing.” The post ZKPs Evolve From Theory To Reality To Bring Mainstream Blockchain Adoption appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Privacy|Technology|ZKPs,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ZK|TECHNOLOGY|BTC,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-03 15:42:26

Yet, US equities are at an all-time high. I think this is an effect of USD debasement; the S&P 500 is flat in gold terms since 2016 and declining in Bitcoin terms. Global expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, compounded by demographics, AI disruptions, and geopolitics, erode governments' credibility worldwide, including America's. I think Bitcoin on-chain metrics signal growing maturity: short-term cost basis rising to $110,000-$118,000, balanced long-term holder activity, and declining exchange balances. My updated valuation model targets $1 million in a bullish reserve asset case versus $100,000 in a bearish one; my expected value for a BTC bet, at $162,500-$275,000, exceeds the current ~$120,000 price. The state of the US economy has been a hot topic of discussion for most analysts lately. US inflation seems to be sticking closer to 3% than the theoretical 2% target. In that context, the Fed might not have much room for any significant cuts in the coming quarters. The economy has been growing, with recent estimates of up to 3.8% GDP growth in Q3. However, employment numbers give a conflicting view following multiple revisions, indicating a somewhat softening labor market. To complicate matters, we have an unorthodox administration pursuing isolationism and a government shutdown, all putting pressure on the bond market: the United States 10-Year Bond Yield ( US10Y ) yields 4.10%, a rate I would expect with a more hawkish Fed stance. America is far from being alone in being in a tricky situation, with Europe and China having their own issues - including a demographic crisis and stagnant economies. All the while, US equity markets are sitting at or close to All-Time-Highs. How is that possible? As I argued some time ago, the reason is that we are making a mistake when we think in USD terms. When measured in gold , the S&P 500 is roughly at 2016 levels. When measured in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the S&P 500 has been on a decline since 2018 (see chart below). SP500 measured in gold (BITBO) I think it is not equities (nor gold or Bitcoin) that are rallying, but rather the USD currency (together with other fiat currencies) that is collapsing as a result of a “perfect storm” of macro indicators and questionable policymaking. That affects the price of “real” assets disproportionately - those that generate yields and/or are completely independent from governments. Today, I am updating my Bitcoin bull case, commenting on recent price movements, on-chain metrics, and Bitcoin ETF inflows. The picture that will emerge is that of an asset that, I believe, is rapidly maturing and should be present in most people’s portfolios as a hedge against a global crisis of governments’ credibility. Bitcoin: possibly the ultimate hedge against government recklessness In my past Seeking Alpha coverage , I discussed in detail why I see Bitcoin as an excellent bet in the context of a multipolar world order and the collapse of US credibility. I encourage readers to go through my previous work. In a nutshell, these are the two main reasons: Its technical qualities, which render it technically superior to gold and any other reserve asset. These include its durability, divisibility, fungibility, portability, verifiability, and, most important, its scarcity. The asymmetric nature of an investment in BTC today. Compared to gold, a “mature” Bitcoin can appreciate by a significantly greater order of magnitude if it does become a global asset. To be clear, I have nothing against gold per se. I do own a small position in gold as part of one of my retirement accounts. However, I think there is room for more than one global reserve asset, and I believe Bitcoin is poised to become one. Not only do I think Bitcoin has the technical qualities to become a global reserve asset, I also believe that we live in times where the need for a new global reserve is becoming more clear. From a macro standpoint, I see a strong acceleration of currency debasement and a global crisis in governments’ credibility (note how I use the plural in governments, as this goes well beyond America). Below, I summarize the monetary and fiscal policies by macro geographical region: Monetary Policy Fiscal Policy USA Turning expansionary, with the Fed being pressured into cutting rates. Expansionary - government deficits of 5%+ in times of full employment. Europe Expansionary - ECB interest rates at ~2% and Swiss rates at 0%, with inflation in check. Expansionary - EU overall deficit at 3%+, with core countries like France running wider deficits. China Expansionary - declining interest rates and stimuli packages . Expansionary - China is running an 8%+ budget deficit to finance stimuli packages. Japan Expansionary - with rates at 0.5%, Japan never really started a contractionary cycle. Expansionary - with one of the highest public debt-to-GDP ratios, Japan has been running wide deficits for decades. The above observations are only compounded by the following macro trends, which I think will put ongoing pressure on governments and central banks to maintain expansionary policies: An ongoing global demographic crisis , impacting Europe, China, and Japan in particular. Rising welfare costs (linked to pensions and healthcare) are a long term headwind against fiscal discipline. AI potentially disrupting the job market and leading to higher structural unemployment. While an AI industrial revolution has the potential to “fix” national debts by igniting a new wave of GDP growth, short- and mid- term it represents a threat from the perspective of government spending (governments will need to increase spending further if mass unemployment does happen). An increasingly multi-polar world, where non-aligned countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, and those in the African continent will have more economic and demographic weight globally, to the detriment of Europe, America, and China. While in the past America could be trusted also in virtue of its sheer size, the future may look different. When it comes to America in particular, I see the ongoing politicization of the Fed as the potential fall of the last global bastion of monetary rigor. As per my table above, the Fed was (and perhaps is, to some extent) the only significant global institution to not yet run a fully expansionary policy of any sort. It is now starting to pivot, despite inflation being far closer to 3% than to its theoretical 2% target. In this context, I think we are witnessing a significant erosion in America’s credibility - something that can be seen in the decline of the US Dollar Index ( DXY ), as well as stubbornly high yields on American debt. The asymmetric bet: Is Bitcoin maturing as a reserve asset? To understand whether or not Bitcoin is maturing as a reserve asset, I will be analyzing the evolution of some on-chain metrics. Simply put, these are the movements that can be observed on Bitcoin's blockchain (its transparent ledger). Because Bitcoin is an asset that does not generate any future cash flow, I think on-chain metrics can prove very helpful in gauging what market participants are thinking and doing. First, I find it helpful to refer to its Short-Term Cost Basis (see chart below). This represents the overall cost basis of recent Bitcoin holders. I believe this is an important psychological threshold, as people may be less willing to sell their Bitcoin below their cost basis. Short Term On Chain Cost Basis, BTC ( Glassnode ) Historically, this resistance has served well as an indicator of recent market bottoms. It currently stands around the $110,000-118,000 mark and has been on a steady rise in the past months. To note, Long-Term Holders Realized Price is currently at ~$36,000 , a much lower figure. This metric is up ~22% since May 2024, the time of my first coverage of Bitcoin on Seeking Alpha. The fact that both metrics are rising is, in my opinion, a positive development for Bitcoin. It means that we are likely to see higher bottoms for BTC, even in case of market correction. In my Bitcoin valuation model, which I will update and cover later, I do take into consideration both figures. Another interesting on-chain indicator, in my view, is the Long-Term Holder Net Position change. This indicates whether long term BTC holders are selling or buying Bitcoin (see below). Long Term Holders Net Position Change, BTC ( Glassnode ) Contrary to what readers might think, I believe that long term holders selling is a healthy dynamic. Ultimately, if Bitcoin is really to mature into a reserve asset, it is necessary that it passes hands from long term holders to new holders, including institutional investors. The fact we are seeing a healthy balance between sellers and buyers indicates, in my opinion, that Bitcoin is passing hands while its price is still sustained by long term holders. Finally, for a possible short or midterm catalyst for BTC I like to look at the number of Bitcoins on exchanges. This metric has been on a steady decline for the past months, as the chart below shows. Bitcoin on exchanges (MacroMicro) This decline has been accelerating since the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs and increased regulatory clarity following the advent of Trump’s administration. On top of representing a potential catalyst (with Bitcoin demand eventually outpacing what’s readily available on exchanges), I see this trend as healthy for Bitcoin. It means that holders are increasingly choosing to move their BTCs to cold storage - a behavior consistent with people seeing Bitcoin as a global reserve asset. Updating my Bitcoin valuation model: a great entry point My Bitcoin valuation model, which I last updated in November last year, relies on two cases. My bullish case sees Bitcoin maturing as a global reserve asset, roughly matching gold in market capitalization. In my past model I used $750,000 per BTC as a target, but given gold’s sustained rally in the past years, I have updated my model to $1,000,000 per BTC . Note that Bitcoin at $1 million per coin would still be ~20% smaller than gold in terms of market capitalization at the time of writing. My bearish case sees Bitcoin as an “online casino.” In this scenario, Bitcoin would never mature but rather remain a failed experiment. I never believed that, even in a bearish scenario, Bitcoin could actually reach zero. That’s simply because there will still be value in using Bitcoin for short term trades (taking profit from its volatility) and for some fringe cases, such as sending money abroad or paying for goods and services in a relatively anonymous manner. For this scenario, my target is $100,000 per Bitcoin . This target is in between the short-term and long-term holders realized prices that I discussed in my previous section. For each of my two cases, I assign three scenarios of probability for them to happen: 25%, 35%, and 50% probability that the bullish case takes place. The outcome of my model is an expected value of a Bitcoin bet (as in, the probability that a scenario takes place multiplied by the target prices of said scenario) between $162,500 and $275,000 per Bitcoin. BTC valuation model, Geneva Investor (Author's work) Given that Bitcoin is trading at roughly ~120,000 at the time of writing, I believe today’s prices represent a great entry point - below even the lowest expected value of my valuation model. In plain terms, while Bitcoin has matured massively in the past years; with ETF launches, regulatory clarity, and global macro headwinds, I think its price has remained somewhat stable and represents an interesting entry point. I see Bitcoin as having the potential of eventually reaching my bullish scenario, at $1,000,000 per Bitcoin. That is why I rate it a STRONG BUY . Risks of investing in BTC today Just because Bitcoin has all the technical characteristics to be a global reserve asset, it doesn’t mean it will actually mature to become one. Bitcoin remains, even today, a relatively high risk bet and an asset with high volatility. While I believe Bitcoin’s risk profile is extremely attractive, readers should carefully consider whether it is adept to their profile and to what extent to integrate it in their portfolios (if at all). Regarding my valuation model, its main limits concern my assumptions. Readers can play and assign what they think are more “realistic” or likely probabilities for each scenario to happen. Assigning lower probabilities will inevitably result in lower expected values. As an asset that does not generate any yield or predictable cash flow, any valuation model has to inevitably rely on a somewhat qualitative assessment of probabilities. Finally, there is also a risk tied to opportunity cost. If Bitcoin is to remain an “online casino” (my bearish case), investors would not only be exposed to high volatility but also suffer from the opportunity cost of not having invested in better performing assets. Conclusion I see widespread governmental fiscal recklessness (both global and America-specific) only compounding an ever increasing monetary supply. America’s credibility crisis, signaled by the decline of the US Dollar Index and high yields on US debt, is only accelerating a global phenomenon where every major government and central bank is now in a de facto expansionary cycle. This is the world we live in, which I see as in dire need of global reserve assets to shield investors from asset (and not only consumer) inflation. Bitcoin happens to be such an asset, with all the technical characteristics to mature into what gold is today. That is not to say that Bitcoin will replace gold (at least in the short- or mid- term), but rather that there is room for more than one global reserve asset. Given this current macro context, I think an exposure to Bitcoin is recommendable for most investors. That's why I rate Bitcoin once again a STRONG BUY, seeing it as an asymmetric bet.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-03 15:47:10

The recent move has shifted momentum, but overbought conditions and supply zones could bring short-term challenges. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH is trading above $4,500 inside its broader ascending channel. The asset reclaimed the $4,000 support area and pushed higher, but it’s now approaching the $4,800 resistance zone that capped previous rallies. The RSI stands around 57, still in neutral territory, showing there’s room for continuation if momentum persists. Holding above $4,000 maintains the broader bullish structure, while a daily close above $4,800 would mark a major breakout toward new all-time highs above $ 5,000. On the other hand, as long as the 100-day moving average, located around the $3,900 mark, is not broken to the downside, the market trend would still remain bullish. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH rallied sharply from the $3,900 demand block, reclaiming the $4,200 level and extending gains toward $4,500. RSI spiked into overbought levels above 70, with a minor pullback already visible. Short-term structure shows strong momentum, but sellers may step in again around the $4,600 supply zone. If the price consolidates above $4,200, ETH could set up another push higher, while failure to hold that level risks a retrace back to $3,900-$4,000 support area. This could lead to a break below the ascending channel, which could shift the overall market structure to bearish. Onchain Analysis Exchange Reserve Exchange reserves for ETH have dropped to 16.1M, marking a steady multi-year decline. This indicates fewer coins are being held on exchanges, a bullish structural signal suggesting reduced selling pressure. Historically, such declines have coincided with major accumulation phases and rallies. With supply on exchanges dropping at a significantly rapid pace and reaching its lowest in years, ETH’s medium-term outlook remains favorable, especially if demand continues to build around the $4K range. Of course, it is essential for the futures market not to go through a liquidation cascade that could overwhelm the spot market demand and lead to a price crash.

October has historically been BTC’s strongest month, and the psychology of “Uptober” goes far deeper than seasonal superstition. CryptoQuant explained that it reflects the powerful interaction of investor sentiment, capital flows, and macro catalysts that reliably converge in the crypto asset’s favor during Q4. Uptober Unleashed After months of subdued summer trading, the arrival of October ignites a shift in psychology: the very narrative that Bitcoin historically performs well this month primes investors to anticipate upside. Early buyers are motivated by these expectations and push prices higher, as the familiar cycle of FOMO quickly reinforces momentum. On-chain metrics such as the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) consistently illustrate this pattern, which can be evidenced by values climbing above 1 in Q4, which means that participants are selling into strength and realizing profits without causing damaging distribution. Institutional flows add further fuel. October coincides with portfolio rebalancing, as asset managers inject fresh capital to optimize year-end performance, and Bitcoin increasingly claims a slice of this reallocation. Meanwhile, macro backdrops often provide the wind at its back: US elections, shifting Federal Reserve policy, and dollar weakness all push investors toward hard, uncorrelated assets. These forces build upon seasonal optimism, creating a synergistic boost. Supporting evidence comes from valuation metrics like the MVRV ratio, which typically trends upward into December, indicating expanding unrealized gains and strengthening conviction, while declining exchange balances point to structural accumulation rather than speculative churn. Ultimately, Uptober is less about folklore and more about psychology amplified by capital and macro catalysts – October sparks belief, and belief becomes the engine of Bitcoin’s year-end surges. The Decode Macro Trend Oscillator (MTO) has played a key role in signaling Bitcoin’s latest breakout. It first hinted at a shift as early as May, when broader market sentiment remained weighed down by the stock market crash. In July, the indicator’s special “Pulse” mode reinforced these early signs, providing further confirmation of an upward trajectory. By September, the MTO officially confirmed the breakout with its first green monthly bar. Now, with a second green bar underway in October, the indicator pointed to a growing momentum, while urging investors to stay patient and focused during this trend. History Points to $143K Bitcoin could be staring down its most explosive Uptober yet, with researcher Bull Theory predicting a rally to nearly $143,000 is on the table. While the number sounds bold, history supports the claim. October has consistently been one of Bitcoin’s most profitable months, closing green in 10 of the last 12 years, giving it an 83% win rate. More importantly, every time September has ended green, October has followed suit – four out of four times since 2013. This year, October is already showing signs of strength. Historically, Bitcoin averages a 20.62% gain in October, which at current levels would imply a rally to $143,500. Even the median return of 14.71% points toward almost $136,500, underscoring that even conservative scenarios remain highly bullish. Adding fuel, in all previous cases where September and October were green, November also rallied, compounding gains further. That pattern suggests Uptober is not just about a single month, but potentially the ignition of a multi-month surge.

Solana (SOL): Technical Strength Builds with ETF Buzz Solana price prediction 2025 remains bullish as the token recently bounced strongly from the $200 support region, supported by the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and VWAP levels.

Bulls now eye $260 as the next target. Bitcoin vs Solana 2025 comparisons are intensifying, but Solana’s upside potential remains compelling. If momentum continues, Solana could be one of the best performing altcoins of 2025 , especially if ETF approvals arrive sooner than expected. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Confidence Intact Bitcoin price forecast this month has been bolstered by Strategy’s latest acquisition, adding $22 million worth of BTC to its treasury. The firm now owns about 64,000 Bitcoin, worth $73 billion, further proving institutional appetite. While skeptics debate sustainability, Bitcoin remains the foundation of most cryptocurrency investment strategies . With BTC trading above $114,000, it continues to shape altcoin season 2025 as capital flows into both Bitcoin and emerging assets.

Cardano (ADA): Bounce Sparks Recovery Hopes Cardano (ADA) surprised traders with a sharp 4% rebound after dipping below $0.80, backed by strong volume and an RSI bounce from oversold levels.

The move comes through Laser Digital Holdings, a Nomura unit based in Switzerland that is now in pre-consultation with Japan’s Financial Services Agency to seek a license to offer trading services to institutional clients. The talks signal a push to bring more traditional finance players into the market. Nomura Deepens Its Bet Laser’s CEO, Jez Mohideen, told Bloomberg the application reflects the group’s confidence in Japan’s digital asset scene. Laser was launched in 2022 and already won a full crypto business license in Dubai in 2023. Nomura Holdings plans to expand in Japan’s digital-asset market through a subsidiary, as crypto trading in the country heats up https://t.co/vV6z8i9JTZ — Bloomberg (@business) October 3, 2025 A Japanese subsidiary was set up that same year. If regulators approve the new application, Laser plans to act as a broker-dealer for banks, pension managers and crypto firms, and to support exchanges that operate in Japan. A History Of Ambition And Mixed Results Nomura created Laser to cover asset management, venture investments and trading services for digital assets. The unit has not been a steady profit engine. Nomura disclosed a quarterly loss in Europe earlier this year that was partly tied to Laser’s activities. CFO Hiroyuki Moriuchi described the unit’s results as “not very good.” Mohideen had predicted Laser would break even within two years of launch, but he later warned that turning a profit might take longer than originally expected. Trading Volumes Double According to the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association, the value of crypto transactions in Japan rose to ¥33.7 trillion — about $230 billion — in the first seven months of the year, roughly double the previous pace. On-chain value received jumped 120% in the 12 months to June 2025, outpacing markets such as South Korea, India and Vietnam. Reports have disclosed that policy steps, including possible tax cuts and new rules for crypto funds, are helping attract both younger retail investors and larger institutional players. Mainstream Firms Move Toward Crypto Collateral Daiwa Securities recently allowed clients at its 181 retail branches to use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral for yen loans. That sort of move shows how some big financial firms are incorporating crypto into everyday financial services. A yen-backed stablecoin issuer has also gained a license, adding more tools for traders and fund managers to use. Profit Questions Remain Even as trading and on-chain measures climb, the business case for some newcomers is still unproven. Laser’s early losses and delayed profit expectations highlight that risk. Nomura’s expansion into Japan is a clear long-term play, but short-term returns are uncertain and will depend on how quickly institutional flows keep growing and how regulators set the rules.

The latest edition highlights limited impact of the ongoing US government shutdown on digital assets, renewed caution in the options market, and growing momentum for privacy tokens such as Zcash (ZEC). Key Highlights Limited Impact from U.S. Shutdown : Bitcoin and Ethereum quickly rebounded from late-September liquidations, with BTC trading above $118K and ETH at $4,400. Options Market Cautious : BTC and ETH volatility remains suppressed, but options pricing continues to favor puts, reflecting defensive positioning. Privacy Tokens Outperform : Zcash (ZEC) nearly doubled, fueled by new integrations and rising concerns over global surveillance. The report notes that despite macroeconomic uncertainty, crypto assets have shown resilience in spot markets. Following September’s liquidation-driven correction, Bitcoin and Ethereum both staged recoveries, supported by stabilized trading flows. Bitcoin’s implied volatility collapsed to levels not seen since mid-2023, reflecting subdued realized volatility. However, options markets remain defensive, with long-dated tenors continuing to price in downside risk through put-skewed volatility smiles. Ethereum options also reveal a risk-averse posture. Volumes surged during ETH’s September dip, with positioning heavily favoring puts. Spot ETF outflows further underlined market caution, while implied volatility continued to trend lower throughout the month. Privacy-focused assets, particularly Zcash, stood out recently. ZEC nearly doubled in value, bolstered by the launch of Zashi CrossPay, its integration with THORSwap, and heightened global debate over digital surveillance. Its strong performance outpaced other leading privacy tokens.

Traders should monitor the altcoin market cap trendline and secure profits as volatility commonly increases near cycle tops. Altcoin market holding $315B support: ascending trendline from spring lows underpins recent gains. Bitcoin’s 1064-day cycle timing could peak in late October, potentially extending altcoin strength into November. Analysts advise profit-taking as volatility spikes near historical cycle tops; position sizing and stops remain essential. Altcoin market stabilizes near $315B support; monitor trendline and Bitcoin cycle for timing. Read COINOTAG’s analysis and protect profits now. Altcoin market stabilizes near $315B while Bitcoin nears its cycle peak, signaling opportunities for traders but also rising volatility. Altcoin market shows recovery signs as $315B support holds, with momentum building after a volatile year of sharp corrections. Bitcoin’s 1064-day cycle pattern suggests a potential October peak, giving altcoins room to extend gains into late November. Analysts warn traders to secure profits as volatility spikes near cycle tops, even as both Bitcoin and altcoins show resilience. The altcoin market sits at a turning point as traders weigh fresh signs of recovery. Analysts are watching closely as valuations hold above $315 billion, a level many see as essential support. According to Rekt Capital on X, “$ALTS Altcoin Market Cap successfully held the trendline (light blue) as support which has enabled a challenge to try to reclaim $315bn as support. So far, so good but has to continue to hold $315bn on any future short-term dips.” What is the altcoin market doing now? The altcoin market is consolidating above a key $315 billion support level, showing renewed buying after a prolonged correction. Short-term momentum has built on an ascending trendline from spring lows, suggesting measured upside potential while risk remains elevated near cycle highs. How does the Bitcoin cycle affect altcoins? Bitcoin’s multi-year cycle drives liquidity and risk appetite across crypto markets. Analyst Jelle on X noted that the previous two Bitcoin cycles lasted 1064 days; if mirrored, a cycle top could occur around 27 October, creating a window for altcoins to extend gains into late November. Historical cycle phases—accumulation, expansion, correction—correlate with altcoin rallies and subsequent volatility. Altcoins Rebound After a Volatile Year The broader altcoin market endured a turbulent run over the past year. In late October 2024, valuations hovered near $250 billion before a November surge pushed them to $425 billion. That rally quickly faded, and December 2024 saw a sharp correction to roughly $330 billion. By February 2025, heavy selling drove the figure down to $260 billion. April marked the cycle low near $200 billion, after which buyers returned in May and a steady rebound began. Through summer consolidation between $240 billion and $320 billion, market structure improved. By September 2025, the market cap recovered to $322 billion. Current figures show it stabilizing at $315.57 billion. This ascending trendline from spring lows continues to support the rebound and underpins short-term bullish technicals. Why should traders consider profit protection now? Volatility typically increases near cycle tops as participants rotate profits and liquidity tightens. Protective measures—partial profit-taking, tighter stop losses, and reduced position sizes—help preserve gains without exiting exposure entirely. Analysts emphasize disciplined risk management as the cycle approaches potential peak timing. Frequently Asked Questions What level confirms a sustained altcoin market recovery? Holding and reclaiming $315 billion on the altcoin market cap, supported by an ascending trendline and rising volume, would be the clearest technical sign of sustained recovery in the near term. When could Bitcoin’s cycle top and how will that impact altcoins? If the 1064-day pattern repeats, a Bitcoin cycle top could occur around late October. Historically, a Bitcoin peak often precedes heightened altcoin rotation and a short-term window of extension into November. Key Takeaways Support level: $315B is the crucial altcoin market cap support to watch. Cycle timing: Bitcoin’s 1064-day rhythm may pressure markets around late October, affecting altcoin momentum. Risk management: Secure profits and use stops as volatility typically rises near cycle tops. Conclusion The altcoin market shows stabilizing signs around a $315 billion support level while Bitcoin approaches a potential cycle high. Traders should balance participation with disciplined profit protection and monitor trendline support.

52616399,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85233,1759507533,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Predicts $10.30 XRP Based on This Indicator,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-10-30-xrp-based-on-this-indicator/,"A chart can sometimes speak louder than headlines, offering a long-term perspective that reshapes how investors view an asset’s potential. XRP, one of the most debated digital currencies in global finance, is back in focus as analysts draw attention to a striking technical formation. Rather than short-term speculation, this formation suggests a powerful long-term resistance point that could redefine XRP’s trajectory if broken. At the center of this discussion is what market analyst Egrag Crypto has termed “The Chasm,” a level now aligned with the $10.30 mark. Understanding “The Chasm” According to Egrag Crypto, “The Chasm” is not a simple price target but a long-term resistance line that XRP has repeatedly struggled to break through in its trading history. As of today, that level sits at $10.30. #XRP – The Chasm ($10.30) : As of today, the price of touching The Chasm is $10.30 . As time goes on, the price of the Chasm continues to rise. ONLY FEW AND PATIENCE TRULY GETS IT #XRPFamily STAY STEADY and STRONG , Together We Rise and Soon We Shall Fly… pic.twitter.com/rTA4YAkvta — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 3, 2025 Importantly, this threshold is not fixed — it gradually rises over time as the underlying trendline extends, meaning that patience is an essential part of the equation. Egrag emphasizes that very few investors truly understand this dynamic, and fewer still are prepared to wait it out. Current Market Context XRP is currently trading around $3.02, a level that reflects the asset’s renewed strength in the broader crypto rally. Short-term technical indicators show bullish momentum , with several analysts noting favorable moving average crossovers and improving relative strength index (RSI) readings. However, while interim resistance levels are projected near the $4 range, the leap to double digits remains a significantly larger undertaking. To bridge that gap, XRP would need sustained liquidity inflows, institutional participation, and continued confidence in its long-term use cases. Why the $10.30 Level Matters Breaking above The Chasm would represent more than just a price milestone — it would profoundly shift market psychology. Technical traders view such structural resistance points as gateways that can attract institutional investors, increase derivatives activity, and potentially spark broader adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analysts argue that a breakout at this level could revalue XRP’s market capitalization into the hundreds of billions. Such scenarios depend heavily on macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity, and real-world demand for XRP’s payment solutions. The Regulatory Dimension XRP’s outlook cannot be separated from its regulatory journey. The resolution of the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple reduced a major layer of uncertainty that had weighed on XRP for years, clearing a path for greater institutional confidence. Still, the climb to $10.30 will require more than regulatory closure — it will demand a confluence of strong fundamentals, global liquidity flows, and adoption by financial institutions. Egrag Crypto’s analysis identifies $10.30 as a key level for XRP, providing investors with a structured long-term framework to assess its potential. It is not a short-term forecast nor a guarantee, but rather a map of where market momentum must ultimately travel if XRP is to rewrite its price history. For those willing to wait, The Chasm serves as both a challenge and a promise: a reminder that in crypto, only patience and conviction separate momentary gains from generational opportunities.

The recent whale activity suggests that the bullish momentum could continue in the short term. Scooping up More Coins The popular X user Ali Martines revealed that ADA whales (investors holding between one million and ten million tokens) have purchased an additional 70 million coins in the last week. The USD equivalent of the stash (at current rates) is approximately $60 million, while this group of market participants now controls almost 5.6 billion ADA, or 15% of the circulating supply. Developments of that type are considered bullish and could trigger a further ascent for Cardano’s native cryptocurrency. Whales are considered investors who may have access to inside information about upcoming events, and their massive purchases could prompt smaller players to enter the ecosystem as well. Moreover, such buys leave fewer coins available on the open market, which could be a precursor to an upward move (should demand remain constant or head north). Price Forecasts Towards the end of September, Martinez claimed that ADA is at a crossroads, arguing that a drop below $0.80 may derail a potential rally toward $0.95. During the latest correction of the crypto market, ADA plunged below that mark, and it now remains to be seen whether his prediction will prove accurate. Other crypto analysts made much more optimistic forecasts. X user Crypto King maintained that the asset’s price chart is “extremely bullish” and revealed they have increased the exposure to the coin. “One breakout and we will see 2$, which decides up or down,” the market observer added. Meanwhile, another X user disclosed that the sentiment across the Cardano community has risen to its highest level in the past 30 days, and currently, 92% are bullish. While this might sound like great news for the asset’s proponents, it could also be interpreted as a bearish factor. Extreme optimism can signal overbought conditions, meaning the sellers might soon take control. It is also worth noting that the crypto market is an unusual one and often moves in the opposite direction of the crowd’s general expectation.

Speakers from Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) , Centrifuge, and Moody’s argue that tokenization is already moving from experiments to production—and that institutions waiting “five years” risk being left behind. What counts as an RWA—and what’s actually working RWAs encompass anything originating off-chain and brought on-chain—receivables, funds, real estate, and more, said Lucas of Moody’s. For now, the first movers are the “boring but compelling” yield products: U.S. Treasuries and high-quality funds, with CLOs (collateralized loan obligations) and private credit emerging as next-wave candidates, added Graeme of Centrifuge. Liz Ray, CFO at SDF, notes the importance of making previously gated instruments “widely available in small amounts,” showing up in wallets around the world. That shift, she said, is the real power of DeFi distribution. Why TradFi can’t wait Institutions are already piloting digital twins of funds and deposits, panelists said, citing activity from BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Goldman Sachs. The short-run driver is simple: new on-chain liquidity hungry for RWA yield. The long-run prize is efficiency—lower costs, faster settlement and reduced counterparty risk. Ray pointed to FX as a near-term, high-impact use case: today, it’s complex, ISDA-heavy, and slow to settle. “Bringing that on-chain where it’s instantaneous opens the market,” she said—provided there is sufficient liquidity behind the assets. How big is the market now? Depending on the methodology, on-chain RWAs are often cited around $30 billion today, panelists said—“realistically, maybe a bit less.” But the group expects an accelerating adoption curve as capital sources deepen and regulators clarify rules, pushing the market toward the trillions sooner than many expect. Importantly, adoption isn’t just about market cap; it’s about use. Ray pointed to the transition from “buy-and-hold” to RWAs being used as collateral and embedded in on-chain cash-flow loops—for example, CLOs parking idle cash in tokenized treasury funds. Risk, trust, and the Moody’s lens For investors asking how to trust the off-chain performance of on-chain tokens, Moody’s is adapting its frameworks, Lucas said. The agency is examining four buckets: platform risk (reliability and continuity), smart-contract risk (audits and functionality), asset-representation risk (does the token legally mirror the underlying), and cyber/external risk. “An asset is an asset and credit is credit,” he said—the fundamentals don’t change, but operational risk does. What unlocks the next leg: liquidity and interoperability Two watchwords surfaced repeatedly: liquidity and interoperability. Deep, connected pools will determine which platforms win. Fragmented liquidity across chains will slow growth; interoperable rails could “unlock all the liquidity” and create stable, scalable markets. Bold predictions By 2030, panelists expect everyday savings products across wallets and DeFi apps to be quietly RWA-backed, streaming yield from treasuries, CLOs, and other regulated instruments—abstracting complexity for end users. Payments with yield-bearing stables, rapid FX, and less bureaucracy via programmable assets were flagged as high-conviction outcomes. Bottom line: Institutions aren’t “coming”—they’re here. The next phase is stitching together compliant infrastructure, cross-chain liquidity, and transparent risk to carry RWAs from tens of billions to trillions.

XRP rebounded ~12.17% and moved above the 50-day EMA — a key bullish signal. Technical patterns (falling wedge and cup-and-handle) point to a likely upside breakout. ETF interest: XRPR ETF assets reported at $77.6 million; broader spot ETF approvals could bring large institutional inflows. XRP price shows bullish momentum, clearing the 50-day EMA and poised for ETF-driven inflows — monitor breakout levels now. XRP price shows strong bullish signals, with technical patterns pointing to a potential surge and SEC’s approval of spot ETFs boosting investor optimism. XRP’s price is on the brink of a significant move, bolstered by both clear technical indicators and the prospect of meaningful regulatory developments. As the digital asset approaches critical technical milestones, a breakout could materialize in the coming weeks. XRP’s recent price action suggests upward momentum after a ~12.17% rebound from a Murrey Math support level. The token has moved above its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) , indicating bulls are regaining control. Short-term volume patterns support the push higher, while momentum indicators remain positive. XRP has formed a falling wedge, typically a bullish reversal pattern, and sits in the handle portion of a cup-and-handle setup. These chart formations increase the probability of a decisive upward move as trendlines converge. Traders should watch for a confirmed breakout above the wedge resistance on increased volume. What is driving the XRP price surge? XRP price is being driven by a mix of technical bullish formations and growing institutional interest tied to potential SEC approval of spot ETFs. The combination of price reclaiming key moving averages and ETF-related capital inflows creates a favorable setup for further gains. How could a spot XRP ETF affect price and liquidity? Approval of a spot XRP ETF would likely increase access for institutional and retail investors. ETFs aggregate capital and can channel large inflows; for reference, the XRPR ETF reached $77.6 million in assets. Larger, well-known fund sponsors entering the market could amplify liquidity and reduce bid-ask spreads. Key technical and market indicators Indicator Current Signal Implication 50-day EMA Price above EMA Short- to mid-term bullish trend Falling wedge Pattern forming Potential breakout on confirmation ETF interest XRPR: $77.6M Institutional inflows possible Why do chart patterns favor a breakout? Short consolidation near pattern apexes reduces downside room and concentrates buying pressure. The falling wedge reduces volatility while maintaining higher lows, and the cup-and-handle handle suggests a measured consolidation before continuation. Traders often see these formations as high-probability setups when volume confirms the move. Market participants should monitor resistance near the year-to-date high of $3.60 and the psychological $5 level. A sustained break above $3.60 on volume could target $5, implying a potential upside in the range referenced by market observers. Risk management remains essential; stop placement below recent support levels can limit downside exposure. How should traders and investors prepare? 1. Watch for a confirmed breakout above the wedge on increased volume. 2. Position size to limit risk to a predefined percentage. 3. Monitor ETF approval news from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and institutional flows. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is XRP price likely to rally after a spot ETF approval?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A spot ETF approval typically increases institutional access and can drive inflows, which may support an XRP price rally, especially if technical conditions confirm a breakout."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What technical signs indicate XRP could break out?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Clear signals include a move above the 50-day EMA, a falling wedge pattern completing, and a cup-and-handle handle breakout accompanied by rising volume."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much upside could XRP see in a strong rally?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Analysts point to a break above $3.60 targeting psychological resistance near $5; the magnitude depends on capital inflows and broader market conditions."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How much has XRP rebounded recently?

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission evaluates ETF filings for compliance and investor protection. Its decision on spot XRP ETF filings will influence institutional participation and liquidity. Key Takeaways Technical momentum : Price above the 50-day EMA and bullish patterns favor a breakout. ETF catalyst : Spot ETF approvals could unlock significant institutional inflows. Risk management : Use confirmed breakouts and volume as entry signals; set stops below recent support. Conclusion In summary, XRP price shows several bullish indicators, including a rebound above the 50-day EMA and formation of classic breakout patterns. Coupled with growing spot ETF interest, the token is positioned for a potential upside move.

These include both company-wide developments and tailwinds in the crypto space. The September 8 Luxor financing, September 30. Soluna's 20 MW A15 XP deployment and the Oct 2, 50,000 A15 Pro order are strong news leading to a breakout beyond $1. Industry-wide, Riot’s hashrate reached 36.4 EH/s in August with BTC production +48% yoy. CleanSpark recently secured $200M in facilities. BTC is consolidating $100k–$125k. I believe a breakout could spur miners’ CapEx. Risks remain tied to Bitcoin price volatility. I'm betting that near-term tailwinds (anticipated rate cuts, softer dollar, and historically strong October for BTC) keep sentiment and purchasing momentum intact. I initiate my coverage on Canaan Inc. ( CAN ) with a strong buy rating after I noticed clear signs of a much-needed turnaround in the sentiment surrounding this stock. To me, fundamentals alone are not enough to buy a stock. That's why I never considered adding this stock to my portfolio since the decline at the end of last year, despite the top-line growth (please notice that the decline I'm referring to is part of a broader decline since the ATHs in 2021). My investment style, which I mostly consider akin to gambling, needs a story, a compelling narrative, followed by irrational optimism. I see these signs in Canaan (and the broader crypto space), which made me start a highly speculative position in the form of call options. First, on September 8, Luxor began offering financing to Canaan’s mining customers. More than 5,000 A15 Pro units were sold in August to a leading U.S. miner. Second, on September 30, the company announced a 20 MW deployment at Soluna in Texas using the A15 XP, slated to start in Q1 2026. The icing on the cake happened with the October 2 announcement, when Canaan announced the largest order in three years; over 50,000 A15 Pro units for a U.S. customer with delivery in Q4 2025. All these announcements come on top of high top-line growth, with the Street projecting double-digit growth for the next few quarters. On a valuation basis, the stock looks quite attractive, trading below sales on a TTM basis at the time of writing this article. Overall, I believe there is plenty of upside ahead with tailwinds in the crypto space that could lead to more CapEx being deployed. Below, I lay out the pillars of my bull case. A Turnaround In Sentiment On September 8, Canaan announced a partnership with Luxor Technology Corporation to expand financing for institutional buyers. According to the terms, Luxor will now offer financing directly to Canaan's mining customers for purchasing the Avalon miners. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any specific rates or tenors that could benefit from this partnership, aside from the following statement: The partnership already facilitated the sale of more than 5,000 Avalon® A15 Pro bitcoin mining machines in August to a leading U.S.-based institutional bitcoin miner. Interestingly enough, Canaan's stock was flat on September 8 and September 9. TradingView However, as you can see above, September 8 was the spark of the bull run that happened in the following weeks. I believe the market was not that convinced that the partnership would change the sentiment, which is why the reaction around September 8 and 9 was muted. On September 30, the company announced a 20 MW deployment with Soluna at a wind-powered data center in Texas. According to the deal, Soluna selected the Avalon A15 XP Bitcoin miner for this deployment, with a planned start in Q1 2026. Even though no pricing, contract length, hosting rate, revenue split, or capex/opex allocation were disclosed, this news was enough for the market to regain the much-needed optimism in Canaan, and following the announcement, the stock climbed by 18%. This is when the stock popped up in my screener. However, on October 1, I was still not convinced. Why? Price action. On October 1, I was looking at the chart below and I was trying to understand if the recent news was enough to turn around the sentiment and break out beyond $1. TradingView Back then, I took a look at fundamentals, and I couldn't really understand why the stock was trading below $1, considering the top-line growth for the past four quarters. Seeking Alpha From my experience as a market practitioner, fundamentals and (emphasis) price action have to make sense for a turnaround story to take place. Buying just on strong fundamentals, when the chart looks like the Niagara waterfalls (to put it nicely), is the number one rookie mistake that I see, especially around value investors reluctant to look at charts (stating the random walk argument, which I believe is absolutely wrong). That's why I was hesitant to buy on October 1. I am the type of investor who would happily pay a premium on the share price at the expense of higher conviction, especially when I am dealing with risky, overpriced options. The announcement on October 2 was the final confirmation that I (and I believe many investors) needed to open a position. That day, Canaan secured its largest order in three years: a landmark US order, comprising over 50,000 Avalon A15 Pro miners from an undisclosed US customer, scheduled for Q4 2025 delivery. This was the perfect catalyst at the perfect time. As seen below, the share price gapped through the $1 resistance, jumping by 27%. TradingView That was the second-highest day by trading volume for the stock, with 121 million shares exchanging hands. To me, this last order is the ultimate evidence of a recovering US mining market. Back in August, Riot deployed hashrate up to 36.4 EH/s, with BTC production up by 48% yoy. CleanSpark recently added $100M bitcoin-backed capacity with Coinbase Prime and another $100M facility with Two Prime. From what I'm reading, these funding rounds were explicitly to fund energy and compute growth. With the Bitcoin price in a consolidation phase, trading between $100k - $125k, I believe there is plenty of upside ahead for the US-based miners once Bitcoin breaks out beyond $125k. Again, as an active market practitioner, I believe a breakout after a consolidation phase is a hyper bullish signal. Valuation On a valuation basis, I see a cheap company trading below sales on a TTM basis. When looking at the projections for next year, the P/S multiple is 1, which is 70% below the sector median. Given that the company is not profitable, we cannot talk about P/E multiples. All we have is top-line growth. As seen below, the figures that the Street is projecting are really attractive. Seeking Alpha Cheap multiples, combined with strong top-line growth and an improvement in sentiment, are music to my ears. That said, there are risks to my bull case. Risks I strongly believe that the growth figures that the Street is projecting above have priced in a significant price increase in BTC. Considering the high volatility of Bitcoin, the biggest risk that I see for my thesis is a decline in BTC price, which would slow down the CapEx deployment of miners, as they would have less incentive to operate their centers at full steam. Naturally, this would depress the number of new orders for Canaan's mining machines, leading to a deterioration of sentiment and fundamentals. My bet with Canaan is that this is not going to happen in the near term. With more rate cuts ahead (CME projects rates between 350-375 bps before year-end, with 88% certainty) and a softer dollar (dollar sits sub 98 on DXY), I believe Bitcoin has strong tailwinds to break from the consolidation phase that I mentioned before. Also, historically, October has been BTC’s best month , with a median 10.8% return. Conclusion I stick my neck out with my strong buy rating, and I bought January 16, $1 call options to back up my thesis. Overall, I believe the recent partnership with Luxor will lead to more deals with institutional US-based buyers. The October 2 announcement, being the largest order in three years, is a strong sign that the miners are deploying CapEx again. With tailwinds in the crypto space, mainly from further rate cuts, a softer dollar, and favorable seasonality in October, I believe we would see a breakout beyond $125k before year-end. What does this mean for Canaan? Well, in this scenario, I believe US-based miners would have more incentives to operate, which will likely increase their CapEx needs, leading to more purchases from Canaan.",CAN,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-03 16:56:59

While not all assets are moving, rotation into PancakeSwap, BNB, and Story has drawn attention from both retail and institutional desks. The drivers differ across the three. PancakeSwap has rallied on ongoing supply burns and new feature rollouts. BNB has advanced on a fee reduction and growing ecosystem use. Story is holding gains through attention to its decentralized intellectual property infrastructure and steady trading volume. Together, they illustrate the layered way capital is flowing during altseason. PancakeSwap (CAKE): Supply Burns and Cross-Chain Growth CAKE is currently trading around $3.50 , up by 31% in 24 hours. CoinMarketCap reports strong turnover, placing CAKE among the top gainers. The rally coincides with PancakeSwap’s monthly burn program, which removed over $60 million worth of tokens in August. This deflationary pressure supports the price during active sessions. Gonna be a big month — PancakeSwap (@PancakeSwap) October 3, 2025 At the same time, PancakeSwap has expanded cross-chain routing and perpetual trading options. Liquidity has increased across EVM-compatible and Solana pathways, creating more on-ramps for users. Data shows CAKE breaking through prior resistance near $2.80, which is encouraging technical buyers. The combination of structural burns and usage expansion is providing momentum for its current surge. BNB: Ecosystem Expansion and Fee Reduction BNB is trading at approximately $ 1,130, up 7% in the past 24 hours. The market cap remains above $150 billion, reinforcing its status as the largest exchange-linked token. The latest move follows BNB’s announcement to reduce transaction fees to half a cent, which boosted community confidence and participation. The network continues its auto-burn program, adding a steady deflationary component. Binance’s exchange flows have also supported BNB’s strength. Higher spot and derivatives activity across Binance pairs has kept demand steady. The token is consolidating above $1,100 after clearing resistance, indicating that momentum traders remain active. Together, exchange activity and technical positioning explain its 7% gain. Story (IP): Growing Interest in Decentralized IP Infrastructure Story is now trading near $9.60 , showing a 3.6% daily increase. While the move is smaller than CAKE’s or BNB’s, daily volume above $120 million keeps it in active rotation. The protocol’s model—tokenizing and managing intellectual property rights—has kept it relevant as Web3 infrastructure expands. Recent mentions of institutional products linked to Story have also raised visibility. In addition, statistics show Story bouncing from support levels after prior drawdowns, suggesting stabilization. Although less aggressive than CAKE’s or BNB’s, Story’s steady increase shows capital rotating into infrastructure projects beyond DeFi and exchange tokens. Altcoin Season Outlook PancakeSwap, BNB, and Story demonstrate how altcoin season develops across categories . CAKE is driven by supply compression and feature growth. BNB benefits from community participation. Story draws participation through its IP infrastructure and consistent trading pairs. For altseason participants, the next test is follow-through. If PancakeSwap holds elevated volumes, if BNB sustains above $1,100, and if Story maintains steady participation, this rotation could extend. The flows into these tokens underline that altcoin season remains selective, with liquidity clustering where catalysts align with usable depth.

Traders see this as a wait-and-see zone where sharp moves can form. Big players are turning eyes toward ETH, XRP, and a fresh presale named MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has already raised $15.2M and is climbing fast. Fear & Greed Index at 50 — What Neutral Sentiment Means When the Fear and Greed Index 50 appears, the crypto market is balanced. A day earlier it sat at 37 (fear) and last week at 45 (still fear) . Moving to neutral shows selling pressure slowing and risk appetite slowly returning. A crypto market sentiment neutral reading often means whales are quietly planning moves. Neutral levels can lead to either breakouts or pullbacks, so watching where money flows next is key. Fear and Greed Index—under 50 means fear-driven selling, above 50 shows risk-on appetite. Right now, traders are waiting for direction. Ethereum — Fresh Whale Activity Fuels Bold Price Calls Ethereum remains a prime focus with whales showing confidence. Bitmine just grabbed 234,846 ETH ($963M) and now holds over 2.6M ETH worth about $10.87B. Another deep-pocketed buyer scooped up $865M ETH, pushing market watchers to rethink the ETH price prediction for 2025 . Analyst ZYN says Ethereum is in the “Power-of-3” pattern — after accumulation and manipulation, ETH is in expansion. ETH price analysis by ZYN Calls for $6,000 ETH by November 2025 are making rounds. Still, some warn ETH needs to reclaim $4,250 or risk sliding toward $3,600–$3,800. For long-term believers, this pullback could be entry territory. Ethereum’s strength keeps it on the list of top altcoins to watch in 2025 and a solid bet in the Ethereum and XRP investment outlook. XRP — Whale Accumulation & ETF Hype Create Big Speculation XRP is heating up as whale wallets scoop record amounts. CryptoQuant data shows the largest accumulation phase in XRP’s history. That’s fueling an aggressive XRP price prediction for 2025 , with some traders eyeing $5–$15 if momentum holds. XRP price analysis by Milkybull Another spark is the set of SEC deadlines for several XRP ETF filings, including Grayscale and Bitwise. Approval could bring a new wave of inflows. Analyst Milkybull notes XRP just flipped green on its quarterly chart for the first time since 2017, a sign bulls love to see. With whales active and ETF decisions close, XRP is once again being called a top altcoin to buy during neutral market conditions . MAGACOIN FINANCE — A Rising Crypto Presale Grabbing Attention Beyond the giants, some traders are shifting focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE , viewed as the best crypto presale in 2025 by early backers. The project has already raised over $15M and early stages are filling quickly. Price levels are climbing as buyers rush in before wider exposure. The project is already getting attention for its safety and strong roadmap. For those looking for the next big crypto presale , MAGACOIN FINANCE is appearing across trading groups as a fresh way to position while the market is undecided. With the Fear and Greed Index at 50, signaling neutral market sentiment, some see rotating into a strong 100x prospect as smart risk positioning. Balanced Takeaway — Strategy in a Neutral Market Neutral conditions create opportunity. Ethereum and XRP remain top picks with whales backing both. ETH price prediction for 2025 leans bullish if $4,250 is reclaimed, and XRP price prediction for 2025 has turned positive with ETF hype and whale action. But traders hunting asymmetric upside are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE , calling it the best crypto presale opportunities while sentiment is neutral . Its rapid raise and strong traction show appetite for high-growth plays even when the broader market waits for direction. For investors, mixing established assets with one or two 100x crypto presale bets can balance risk and potential. FAQs Q1: What does the Fear and Greed Index 50 mean for crypto? A: It shows a balanced mood — not fearful enough for panic selling, not greedy enough for mania. Price can swing either way as traders wait for a breakout. Q2: Why are whales buying so much ETH? A: Large players see long-term value. Big buys from entities like Bitmine show belief in future price growth and network strength. Q3: Can XRP hit $5–$15? A: Analysts say it’s possible if ETF approvals land and whale accumulation continues. Technicals also turned bullish after breaking resistance levels. Q4: Why are investors interested in MAGACOIN FINANCE? A: The 100x crypto presale narrative and fast $15.2M raise make it attractive for those seeking early entry into a potential breakout project while sentiment is flat.

52618304,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85237,1759511113,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Mega Breakout. I Don’t Need to Tell You What Comes Next,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-mega-breakout-i-dont-need-to-tell-you-what-comes-next/,"Markets often simmer in silence before unleashing moves that command global attention. For XRP, that silence has been broken. Traders, institutions, and on-chain analysts are converging on a single point of focus: the asset’s latest technical breakout. The cryptocurrency, long known for dramatic swings and pivotal moments, is once again at a crossroads that could define its trajectory for months to come. Technical Structure Points to Acceleration Analyst Mikybull Crypto has drawn attention to a “mega breakout” on XRP’s chart, highlighting a decisive move beyond a prolonged descending channel. TradingView data confirms this breakout, with price pushing above the upper trendline and holding firmly near its 50-day moving average. In technical terms, this is often a bullish trigger: the compression phase has ended, and momentum may accelerate if volume sustains the move. For traders, such confluence between breakout structure and moving-average support often signals the beginning of a fresh uptrend. $XRP mega breakout I don't need to tell you what comes next https://t.co/WPMztVwf1x pic.twitter.com/zFgPWU7xnq — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) October 2, 2025 Institutional Catalysts Behind the Move What strengthens this breakout beyond chart dynamics is the growing role of institutional participation. CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives marketplace, launched XRP-linked futures products in May. Also, the REX-Osprey XRP ETF, trading under the ticker XRPR, began trading in September as the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded fund offering direct spot exposure to XRP This development opens the door for hedge funds, asset managers, and corporates to hedge exposure and trade XRP in a fully regulated environment. Institutional-grade infrastructure provides not just liquidity but also credibility, reshaping the narrative from speculative rallies to mature market adoption. Price Reaction and Market Outlook The immediate price reaction has been notable. XRP has reclaimed the $3 psychological level , an area of strong interest among traders, and analysts are now mapping potential targets in the mid-to-high single-digit range if momentum follows through. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The bullish thesis is supported by a blend of structural tailwinds — regulatory clarity, institutional onramps, and growing liquidity — all converging with technical confirmation on the charts. Yet, seasoned traders are cautious. Breakouts without sustained volume often falter, and macro headwinds such as tightening global liquidity could still influence risk appetite. Profit-taking at key resistance levels remains a realistic possibility. For this reason, disciplined risk management remains critical, even amid growing optimism. The message from Mikybull Crypto is clear: XRP has entered a defining moment, and the technicals suggest a breakout phase with meaningful upside potential. More importantly, this time is different. Institutional products are being launched , regulatory issues have been resolved, and the price structure aligns with broader adoption trends. Whether XRP fulfills the promise of this breakout will be determined in the coming sessions, but one fact is certain: the market is watching closely, and the stakes could not be higher.

Uptober kicked off with a 7% pop for XRP while the rest of the market heated up, fueled by growing institutional support. One of the biggest moves came from VivoPower (VVPR), which raised $19M at $6.05/share to build out its digital asset treasury. The focus? Stacking XRP. That makes it one of the first Nasdaq-listed firms to put serious capital into Ripple.

The world’s largest derivatives exchange is getting ready to roll out 24/7 crypto trading next year, pushing the market even closer to mainstream. World’s Largest Exchange Moves to 24/7 Trading For Crypto CME Group is gearing up to roll out 24/7 crypto trading next year . The exchange confirmed that its Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and options will become tradable around the clock starting early 2026, pending regulatory approval. On top of that, Solana and XRP options are lined up for launch on October 13. Starting early 2026, trade crypto on your schedule. https://t.co/x1FLEwVAnl pic.twitter.com/RmCGMLWh4h — CME Group (@CMEGroup) October 2, 2025 This move gets CME closer to matching crypto’s nonstop market, though it still will not be fully seamless. A weekly two-hour maintenance window and holiday pauses will remain in place. Even so, CME pointed out that its crypto futures and options have already hit record volumes this year, backed by a friendlier regulatory environment and a supportive White House. Thanks, Trump. For crypto as a whole, this opens the doors wider to traditional market players. Ripple, in particular, is seen as a prime fit for institutions and is expected to benefit heavily from the added exposure and boosted volume, and this has been reflected on the chart. XRP Price Prediction: Can $5 Realistically Happen Before Year-End? Source: XRPUSD / TradingView XRP just bounced cleanly off the $2.70–$2.80 support range, kicking off Uptober with strength. The chart shows a clear breakout attempt from a falling wedge, with price now sitting at $3.04, just above the wedge’s upper boundary and right on a key breakout zone. Short-term resistance comes in at $3.17, with a tougher barrier near $3.37. If both levels get cleared, XRP could push toward the $3.60–$3.80 supply zone, and a stretch to $5 is not off the table. RSI is pushing higher, signaling momentum, but if strength cools off, support rests first at $2.81 and then $2.70. A drop back under those would weaken the setup. BTC’s action stays critical here. Holding above $118K could keep altcoin momentum alive, while growing BTC dominance might cap upside. A clean break above $3.15 would be the green light for a run toward $3.30 and beyond as Q4 plays out. Bitcoin Hyper: First BTC Layer 2 Hits $20M Presale Milestone, Can It Outshine XRP? In just 4 months, Bitcoin Hyper —the first and fastest Bitcoin Layer-2—smashed past its $20M raise goal. That kind of momentum is hard to ignore, and smart whales have been the ones fueling much of the action. Big buyers clearly see it as more than a side play. They are betting Bitcoin Hyper can shape BTC’s long-term trajectory while also emerging as a breakout altcoin that fuses Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed. The real hook is in the design. Developers can build high-performance applications through the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), gaining Solana’s execution power while anchoring settlement to Bitcoin’s trusted security. That blend of scale and stability is rare. The Bitcoin Hyper dApp itself delivers fast, lag-free transactions that hold up under heavy demand. Its trustless bridge lets users mint Bitcoin 1:1 on Layer 2, protecting BTC while unlocking added upside. At the moment, HYPER trades at just $0.01305, with staking rewards at a hefty 56 % APY. Pairing Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s throughput and those rewards makes this setup look primed for explosive growth.

BNB neared $1,113 while holding an ascending trendline Spot volume and liquidity have intensified, supporting higher price levels Open Interest jumped 15.27% to $2.14 billion, signaling stronger positioning BNB price nears $1,100 with low volatility and rising Open Interest — watch for a breakout to $1,150. Read the latest analysis and key trade signals. What is BNB price doing as it nears $1,100? BNB price is staging a steady ascent toward $1,100, trading around $1,096 at press time while volatility cools to ~1.2%. The move appears institutionally supported, with buyers defending an ascending trendline and momentum indicators favoring continued upside. How did BNB react as it approached $1,100? BNB surged to $1,113 before retracing, showing strong demand while maintaining support above its rising trendline. Each trendline retest has sparked renewed rallies, underscoring buyer conviction in the $1,100–$1,115 zone. How is trendline strength influencing a potential breakout? The Parabolic SAR remains below price and the DMI shows +DI leading –DI, confirming positive directional momentum. A decisive close above $1,115 with continued volume support would strengthen the case for a breakout toward $1,150. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""BNB Nears $1,100: Volume, OI and Trendline Signal Institutional Momentum"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BNBUSDT_2025-10-03_09-23-12.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T11:20:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T11:23:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""BNB nears $1,100 with low volatility, rising spot volume and a 15.27% Open Interest spike to $2.14B, suggesting institutional-driven momentum and potential extension toward $1,150.""} Can BNB’s trendline strength unlock a breakout above resistance? BNB continues to respect its ascending trendline, reinforcing bullish strength across sessions. The Parabolic SAR is positioned below price, reflecting buyers in control and minimizing immediate downside risk. The Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows persistent positive momentum, with +DI above –DI. Together with repeated trendline bounces, these technicals point to growing buyer confidence around the $1,100 area. Source: TradingView How is spot volume affecting BNB’s rally? Spot volume has increased materially, with bubble-map data showing intensified participation and deeper liquidity pools. Rising spot demand often sustains higher price levels and lowers the risk of abrupt reversals. This pattern implies BNB’s rise is supported by real buyer inflows rather than purely speculative flows, which improves the odds of a durable move above $1,100 if liquidity holds. Source: CryptoQuant Why does Open Interest matter for BNB’s outlook? Open Interest (OI) jumped 15.27% to $2.14 billion, reflecting heavier speculative positioning in derivatives markets. Expanding OI during an uptrend typically amplifies momentum as leveraged bulls add exposure. However, enlarged OI also raises liquidation risk if sentiment flips. The current alignment—rising spot demand, low volatility, and expanding OI—favors continuation but requires monitoring for sudden volatility spikes. Source: CoinGlass Will BNB sustain above $1,100 and extend higher? BNB’s path depends on whether it holds the $1,100 threshold with continued spot inflows and stable volatility. A close above $1,115–$1,120 paired with rising volume would point toward $1,150 as the next logical target. In the near term, the market is skewed to buyers thanks to institutional demand and steady technical support. Traders should watch OI and volume for confirmation and remain mindful of liquidation-driven volatility. Frequently Asked Questions How high can BNB go if it breaks $1,100? If BNB sustains a breakout above $1,115 with robust volume, short-term targets include $1,150 and then $1,200. Confirmation requires follow-through buying and expanding spot liquidity. What indicators confirm a valid BNB breakout? Look for a daily close above resistance, increased spot volume, rising Open Interest, Parabolic SAR below price, and +DI leading –DI on the DMI. These combined signals reduce false-breakout risk. Is current BNB volatility supportive of a sustained rally? Yes. Low realized volatility (~1.2%) suggests measured buying rather than frantic speculation, which often leads to more sustainable moves if liquidity remains intact. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How high can BNB go if it breaks $1,100?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A sustained break above $1,115 with expanding volume could open a path to $1,150 and then $1,200; confirmation requires follow-through buying and strong spot liquidity."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What indicators confirm a valid BNB breakout?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key confirmations include a daily close above resistance, rising spot volume, growing Open Interest, Parabolic SAR below price, and +DI above –DI on the DMI."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is current BNB volatility supportive of a sustained rally?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Low volatility (~1.2%) supports a steady, institution-led rally by reducing the chance of impulsive reversals, provided liquidity holds."" } } ]} Key Takeaways BNB maintains bullish momentum : Trendline support and technical indicators favor buyers. Liquidity is improving : Rising spot volume underpins price stability and reduces reversal risk. Derivatives show confidence : A 15.27% OI spike to $2.14B signals stronger positioning but increases liquidation risk. Conclusion BNB is trading near $1,100 with low volatility, rising spot demand, and a notable Open Interest increase, all of which point to institutional-driven momentum. Holders and traders should watch $1,100–$1,115 for confirmation; a sustained break could target $1,150.

Platform fees have not been disclosed. Typical mobile trading integrations use spread, transaction, or custody fees; OnePay will publish official fee schedules when the product launches. Is my crypto insured if held in OnePay? Custody insurance depends on the third‑party custody provider and OnePay’s disclosures. Users should review published custody and insurance policies in the app before depositing funds. Key Takeaways OnePay crypto trading: Walmart’s OnePay will add Bitcoin and Ethereum trading in‑app later this year, integrating with a third‑party infrastructure provider. Custody partner: Zerohash is reported to be the infrastructure and custody partner; it completed a $104M raise and reported a $1B valuation. What to do now: Update the OnePay app, complete identity verification, and review custody and fee disclosures once published. Conclusion The planned OnePay crypto trading feature positions digital assets as an integrated retail banking product, allowing users to manage Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside traditional accounts. With Zerohash reportedly providing custody and execution, OnePay aims to streamline crypto access — watch for official product and fee disclosures in the coming months.

PI Network (PI) and Flare (FLR) highlight this trend, with PI’s AI-powered KYC and Flare’s fAssets module aiming to attract new users. Both show ambition but still rely on hitting milestones and market sentiment to advance. For investors, though, the focus is shifting toward projects delivering tangible results. Measurable progress, liquidity planning, and real-world visibility matter more than short-lived hype. That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. Its presale has sold over 26.5 billion coins, raised nearly $420M, and built a strong foundation of adoption, making it a top crypto to buy in the current cycle. PI Network Price Analysis: Building on AI-Driven Verification PI Network’s (PI) price analysis highlights steady recovery alongside technical upgrades. The introduction of AI-enabled KYC verification is a critical development, resolving long-standing verification challenges while supporting a larger, more secure user base. With its community-driven growth model, this move strengthens trust and provides a stronger foundation for exchange integrations. Price performance has reflected cautious optimism, with PI holding above key consolidation zones. Analysts believe maintaining this base could invite renewed bullish sentiment, though liquidity access remains a bottleneck. PI’s future trajectory will depend on whether improved verification translates into broader adoption. Despite these advances, PI continues to walk the line between speculative enthusiasm and utility delivery. For investors seeking top crypto to buy, PI offers short-term appeal, but the sustainability of gains will depend on continued upgrades and stronger institutional confidence in its ecosystem. Flare Network News: fAssets Push Toward DeFi Expansion XRP news today intersects with Flare (FLR), as its fAssets framework introduces synthetic versions of tokens like XRP into DeFi ecosystems. Through fXRP and similar assets, Flare aims to bridge traditional crypto holdings with yield farming, lending markets, and cross-chain applications. Analysts argue this approach could position Flare as an interoperability hub if adoption accelerates. Price activity has been moderately resilient, supported by the enthusiasm around fAssets. Yet execution risk remains high, as developer engagement and liquidity migration will ultimately determine success. FLR’s narrative has shifted from speculative movements toward functional use cases, a necessary evolution in an increasingly competitive sector. While still in early phases, Flare demonstrates potential alignment with broader DeFi growth. For investors tracking crypto coins to watch, FLR’s current progress merits attention, though it remains a work in progress compared with more established players. BlockDAG’s $420M Raise, 2940% ROI & Expanding Global Reach Unlike PI and Flare, BlockDAG (BDAG) is not waiting on future upgrades to prove its relevance. It has already secured measurable achievements, raising nearly $420 million during its presale, with early backers from Batch 1 enjoying 2940% ROI while Batch 31 trades at $0.0304 but remains available for a limited-time at $0.0015. These returns mark BlockDAG as one of the most successful presale campaigns in recent memory. Adoption has been equally striking. The X1 mobile mining app has surpassed 3 million users, reflecting broad global engagement well before token launch. On the hardware side, BlockDAG has shipped over 20,000 X-Series miners, with capacity scaling toward 2,000 units per week. This dual adoption model of mobile accessibility plus hardware mining ensures inclusivity across investor profiles. Cultural reach adds another layer of differentiation. Partnerships with Seattle’s Orcas and Seawolves sports teams are embedding BDAG into mainstream fan culture, extending beyond crypto-native circles. This positions BlockDAG as not just a network, but as a recognised global brand. For those evaluating what makes the top crypto to buy, BlockDAG offers unmatched transparency and readiness. With 20 exchange listings confirmed and global traction already underway, it bridges the gap between presale excitement and real-world functionality. Unlike projects still proving their concepts, BDAG has delivered verifiable adoption, making it a frontrunner for both immediate and long-term relevance. Separating Speculation from Proven Momentum PI Network and Flare highlight how innovation and adoption efforts continue to drive market speculation. PI’s AI-powered KYC adds credibility to its ecosystem, while Flare’s fAssets framework aims to unlock new interoperability pathways for DeFi. Both show promise and remain relevant crypto coins to watch. However, BlockDAG’s trajectory illustrates the distinction between speculative potential and proven execution. With nearly $420 million raised, 2940% ROI delivered, and millions already engaged through apps and hardware, it is delivering outcomes that peers are still chasing. Its mix of mainstream visibility, exchange readiness, and large-scale adoption ensures it is positioned beyond market noise. For investors weighing the top crypto to buy heading into 2025, BlockDAG represents a project where delivery and momentum are already a reality.

The couple asked the judge to remove and prohibit the creation of AI videos infringing their intellectual property rights. The couple want Google to have safeguards to ensure that such YouTube videos uploaded anyway don’t train other AI platforms. The couple argues in their filings that if AI platforms are trained on biased content that negatively portrays them and infringes their intellectual property rights, then AI models are likely to learn and disseminate such untrue information. Hundreds of AI-generated Bollywood videos have been taken down In response to the lawsuit, the judge ordered the takedown of a handful of YouTube links last month, which the actors sought. Now hundreds of AI-generated Bollywood videos with 16 million views have been deleted from Google’s YouTube because they were similar to those at the centre of a legal challenge filed by the celebrity couple to protect their rights. The most popular video on the now-deleted channel was a video with 4.1 million views showing an AI animation of Salman Khan and Aishwarya in a swimming pool. Khan was in a relationship with Aishwarya long before she got married. Among them were a clip showing Abhishek posing but then suddenly kissing a film actress using AI manipulation, and an AI depiction of Aishwarya and Khan enjoying a meal together, while Abhishek Bachchan fumes. The lawsuits contain hundreds of links and posts specifically listed by the actors to be taken down, stating that they caused harm to the couple and damaged their dignity and goodwill. The couple is seeking $450,000 in damages against Google and other little-known websites offering unauthorised merchandise with images of them. Still, some other videos similar to the examples mentioned in Abhishek’s lawsuit papers on YouTube were still online as of Friday. India is YouTube’s largest market globally, and it is popular for entertainment content, such as Bollywood videos. It has around 600 million users. In May, YouTube disclosed that it had paid more than $2.4 billion to Indian creators over the last three years. Therefore, creators infringing on their personality rights can make money when videos become popular. Grok and China’s AI found in the mess The actors argue that YouTube’s content and third-party training policies are concerning, as they allow users to consent to sharing a video they created to train a rival AI model, thereby risking the further proliferation of misleading content online. The filings read, “Such content being used to train AI models has the potential to multiply the instances of use of any infringing content, i.e. first being uploaded on YouTube, being viewed by the public and then also being used to train.” YouTube said that the creator deleted the channel mentioned in the news agency’s report. The company said that it only prohibits harmful misinformation and removes content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users. YouTube’s data-sharing policy states that creators can opt in to share their videos for training models of other AI platforms, such as OpenAI, Meta, and xAI. YouTube added, “We can’t control what a third-party company does” if users share videos for such training purposes. In one of the tutorials, the illegal channel explains that it used simple text prompts to create an image via xAI’s Grok and then turned it into a video using Chinese AI startup Minimax’s Hailuo. This comes after the US reports on AI. The US dubbed China’s AI dangerous because it can be easily manipulated. Get seen where it counts.

Key Levels to Watch Now and the 50x Crypto on Investors’ Radar,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-ripples-cto-resignation-bearish-for-xrp-price-key-levels-to-watch-now-and-the-50x-crypto-on-investors-radar/,"Ripple (XRP) is facing more pressure following the resignation of its CTO, leaving investors questioning short-term price momentum. With the uncertainty lingering, savvy investors have turned attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a feature-rich DeFi altcoin priced at $0.035, which has already sold over 55% of its Phase 6 presale. Through its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contracts, MUTM is garnering both whale and retail interest, with the potential for 50× upside. The increasing demand makes Mutuum Finance one of the most promising high-reward projects on investors’ radar going into the next market cycle. XRP at a Critical Juncture as CTO Steps Down XRP is now trading around $2.86, under pressure after it printed a Head & Shoulders pattern on the 1-hour chart, a bearish signal that has traders on red alert. Support areas of major concern are $2.83 and $2.79, while resistance is at $2.87 and $2.91. Not being able to sustain support would shift momentum further bearish, while reclaiming $2.91 would void the pattern and leave the door ajar for continuation higher. Adding to the uncertainty, Ripple’s legendary CTO David Schwartz is retiring after 13+ years, though he will remain engaged as CTO Emeritus and join the Board of Directors, so his influence on the project will persist. As XRP reaches its moment of truth, investors are turning increasingly to the market for emerging utility-driven projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are building momentum for their upside potential amidst general market volatility. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance is generating even more hype and anticipation for its presale, with the platform having already raised over $16.7 million and more than 16,710 investors on board to date. Stage 6 of the project is now ongoing, during which MUTM tokens are available to buy at $0.035 per token. As a reward for early adopters, Mutuum Finance is conducting a $100,000 giveaway promotion, whereby 10 users will be awarded $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. In accordance with continued security and transparency, Mutuum Finance has collaborated with CertiK to launch a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The program rewards white-hat hackers and security researchers for discovering bugs in the protocol codebase. Bugs are ranked according to severity as minor, low, major, or critical, and corresponding rewards are given to contributors. The protocol will have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that maximizes the utilization of liquidity. Low interest rates and times of excess liquidity encourage borrowing and ecosystem activity and times of higher demand and elevated interest rates encourage repayment of loans and incoming capital flows. Fixed interest models function optimally when liquidity is constant, adjusting automatically to overall market forces. As a fully decentralized system, Mutuum Finance empowers the holders of the MUTM token. Lending and borrowing are decoupled from the rest of the system and are supported by an interest rate mechanism that maximally exploits long-term efficiency, promotes diversification of portfolios, and increases with higher overall DeFi market expansion. Profitable lending, borrowing, and liquidation require efficient valuation of assets. To this effect, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to obtain real-time USD and major crypto asset prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform maximizes data precision using fallback oracle systems, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges to ensure sound valuations during the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. MUTM Stands Out Amid XRP Uncertainty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a high-upside DeFi opportunity, raising over $16.7 million from more than 16,710 investors in its Phase 6 presale, which is now over 55% sold. Tokens are presently priced at $0.035, with early buyers afforded the ability to get in before the price is increased in the subsequent phase. The platform combines a dual lending ecosystem, dynamic interest rates, and Chainlink-enabled asset valuations to offer both security and efficiency. To complement these features, a $50,000 bug bounty and $100,000 early-adopter giveaway reinforce investor trust and participation. Getting in early on the presale positions investors to profit from this rapidly evolving DeFi ecosystem.

Pundit Reveals Where The Market Is At Right Now,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bear-trap-over/,"After months of uncertainty and sideways trading, fresh technical analysis suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) may have finally exited its bear trap phase. A leading crypto pundit indicates the market has entered a classic cycle of emotions, transitioning from fear to optimism. If this trend continues, the next phase could spark a major rally, with altcoins set to explode. Bitcoin Bear Trap Ends, Altcoins Next Crypto analyst Ardizor posted on X social media on Wednesday that Bitcoin has officially reached the end of its bear trap stage. He argued that the recent downturns were not signs of further collapse but a final shakeout before the next stage of the cycle. Related Reading: Analyst’s Prediction Plays Out As Bitcoin Price Rebounds, Here’s The Full Forecast To support his view, the crypto expert shared a chart illustrating the classic psychology and emotional transitions of a market cycle. From early momentum building to euphoric peaks and painful capitulation, the chart identifies where traders currently stand in the market. Ardizorn’s chart also emphasized that the declines and false breakdowns that rattled investors and caused extreme fear in recent weeks have concluded, and now, the market is at the stage of “renewed optimism.” Interestingly, this shift has led the analyst to believe that altcoins could soon start outperforming as traders rotate their capital from BTC. Based on this trend, Ardizor boldly predicts that altcoins will explode next, with many potentially reaching new all-time highs. His outlook is reinforced by another market analyst, Mister Crypto, who argues that September was merely a bear trap for Bitcoin, and that October, often dubbed “Uptober” in trading circles, will spark a new bullish phase, with altcoins poised to outperform dramatically. Adding further weight to the bullish case, crypto expert Jelle pointed out that both of Bitcoin’s last two cycles lasted exactly 1,064 days. If history repeats, the current cycle could peak around October 27, giving altcoins extra room to perform strongly into late November. Altcoin Season On The Horizon With the broader altcoin market already recovering from past declines, market analyst Chiefy paints a similarly bullish picture for these assets in 2025. His chart demonstrates a series of breakouts, each marking a significant surge in altcoin valuations relative to Bitcoin. According to the crypto expert, altcoins could reach their breakout stage on October 5, ushering in what he calls “the biggest altseason in history.” Related Reading: Expert Says ‘The Time Has Come’, What Could Drive The Next Explosive Altcoin Season The analyst’s chart highlights past breakout points that have multiplied prices by 120x, 175x, and 150x, with the next stage projected to reach as high as 200x. This exponential growth pattern mirrors what traders witnessed in previous cycles, reinforcing the idea that the crypto market trends to rhyme, if not repeat. Chiefy has stated that the unfolding altcoin season could push prices to new ATHs and deliver massive opportunities for traders. He highlighted that, after months of consolidation and endless shakeouts, the market momentum has officially shifted toward a clear uptrend phase, with low-cap cryptocurrencies poised to kick off rallies. According to him, back in 2017 and 2021, traders who accumulated altcoins in this stage saw life-changing gains.

52619120,596753,1759512630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52619120.jpeg,"Bitcoin Holders Locking In Gains As Profit-Taking Surges Amid Market Recovery, Rally To Extend?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-holders-locking-in-gains/,"Bitcoin is heavily riding the renewed bullish wave observed across the broader crypto industry, and its price has now reclaimed the pivotal $120,000 price level. Heightened selling pressure from investors and traders seems to have followed the ongoing upward action in BTC’s price. Massive Profit-Taking Frenzy Hits Bitcoin Investors are currently exhibiting a worrying trend as Bitcoin gains notable upside traction in a positive crypto market condition. In a quick-take post on the CryptoQuant platform, Caueconomy, a market expert and investor, highlighted that Bitcoin investors are rushing to lock in gains during the newfound rally. Following weeks of erratic trading, the price recovery of Bitcoin has sparked profit-taking at levels not seen in months, with traders and long-term holders grabbing hold of the trend. This spike in realized profits demonstrates both renewed market confidence and cautious positioning, as investors strike a balance between the appeal of rising prices and the memory of previous volatility. Data from the Bitcoin Realized Profit and Loss metric shows that the crypto king has registered several landmarks in profit-taking in 2025 alone. On Wednesday, as Bitcoin prices spiked further, profit-taking levels exceeded $3.7 billion. According to the market expert, this massive figure marks the fifth-largest profit-taking volume recorded since the year began. The pattern indicates that the most recent surge in Bitcoin is bringing liquidity back into the market and testing investor confidence in how long the momentum can last. While this high level of profit-taking may impact spot selling pressure, Caueconomy noted that it does not yet show that short-term investors make up a sizable majority of the market. Expressing his expectations on the notable profit-taking, the expert stated that the market might see this volume increase in the upcoming weeks. BTC’s Price Action Moving In A Range Amid the current uptrend in Bitcoin’s price, market expert and author Darkfost reported that the crypto king continues to move within a range. The range represents an area where the market is usually flooded with optimism whenever the price hits the upper bound, and vice versa. Meanwhile, the consensus turns to predicting a bear market as it gets closer to the lower bound. In the crypto market, this pattern is frequently seen during periods of market pause and consolidation. These are times that are especially good at creating doubt, while the market itself is not doing much. Darkfost has outlined multiple price zones within the $105,000-$119,000 range of the Rectangle pattern where supply is being exchanged in the chart. Typically, higher values in certain zones reflect stronger investors’ interest in those zones. During periods like this, Darkfost outlines that the ideal strategy usually is to do nothing and wait for confirmation. It’s important to note that over 20% of today’s Bitcoin trading volume has occurred beyond $105,000, which is a very intriguing indication of genuine investor activity even when BTC holdings are above $100,000.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Realized Profit and Loss|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Caueconomy|CryptoQuant|Darkfost|Profit-taking|Rectangle Pattern,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 17:30:30

VC funding dropped to $1.97B across 378 deals in Q2 2025 Institutional flows favored digital asset treasuries, which raised roughly $15B YTD through Aug. 21 Investor focus moved to Bitcoin accumulation, stablecoin infrastructure, and real-world asset tokenization Meta description: Crypto venture capital slowdown hits funding: Q2 VC funding declined to $1.97B as investors pivot to treasuries and Bitcoin accumulation — read the VC roundup. What is causing the crypto venture capital slowdown? Crypto venture capital slowdown is driven by investor preference for direct digital asset accumulation and treasury strategies, reduced appetite for early-stage risk, and demand for clearer revenue paths. Galaxy Research and Insights4VC data show Q2 VC funding fell significantly while treasuries attracted major capital flows. Galaxy Research reported startups raised $1.97 billion across 378 deals in Q2 2025, a 59% decline in funding and a 15% drop in deal count versus Q1. That level is the second-lowest quarterly total since Q4 2020. Crypto-focused venture capital has yet to fully reclaim its 2021 highs. Source: Galaxy Research How are capital flows shifting within crypto markets? Capital is re-routing from venture rounds to digital asset treasuries and tokenized asset strategies. Insights4VC data indicate treasury vehicles raised about $15 billion through Aug. 21 to acquire Bitcoin, Ether and other tokens. This shift reflects a strategy to hold liquid crypto assets on balance sheets. Investors cite clearer revenue models and balance-sheet utility as reasons to favor treasuries over speculative startup backing. Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, has publicly noted the growing emphasis on sustainable business models and explicit token accumulation strategies. Mavryk raises $10 million to advance institutional RWA tokenization — what does this mean? Mavryk Network’s $10 million raise, led by Multibank Group, funds plans to tokenise over $10 billion of UAE property assets. The round supports institutional access to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a sector attracting strategic capital despite the broader VC slowdown. This raise follows an earlier $5 million round and highlights continued investor interest in tokenizing physical assets that deliver yield and on-chain liquidity. How significant was Grvt’s $19 million Series A? Grvt’s $19 million Series A, co-led by ZKsync, Further Ventures and EigenCloud, funds privacy-preserving onchain finance infrastructure built on ZKsync technology. The company reports growing trading activity; DefiLlama shows rising perpetual futures volumes tied to onchain products. Why is stablecoin infrastructure attracting funding now? Stablecore’s $20 million seed round underscores demand from banks and credit unions for compliant stablecoin rails. The company said regulatory developments such as the US GENIUS Act could accelerate adoption among traditional financial institutions. The total stablecoin market capitalization recently topped $300 billion, highlighting sector momentum. Source: Hunter Horsley Which early-stage projects still attracted funding? Plural raised $7.13 million to build an “electron economy” connecting real-world energy assets with digital markets. The platform tokenizes distributed solar and battery assets, offering yield exposure to onchain investors. Plural reports over $300 million in assets available on its marketplace. The supply of stablecoins in circulation has surged over the past year. Source: DefiLlama Funding roundup — who raised what? Below is a quick comparison of notable rounds mentioned in this VC Roundup. Company Amount Focus Mavryk Network $10 million Institutional RWA tokenization Grvt $19 million Privacy-preserving onchain finance Stablecore $20 million Bank and credit union stablecoin rails Plural $7.13 million Tokenized energy assets Frequently Asked Questions How large was the Q2 2025 crypto VC funding drop? Q2 2025 saw crypto VC funding total $1.97 billion across 378 deals, a 59% decline in dollars and a 15% drop in deal count from Q1, per Galaxy Research. Are investors still backing crypto startups? Yes, but selectively. Investors prefer projects with clear revenue or token utility—RWA, stablecoin infrastructure, privacy, and onchain finance remain priorities. What alternatives are investors choosing? Many are allocating to digital asset treasuries, focusing on Bitcoin and large liquid tokens, and to tokenized real-world assets that offer yield and lower execution risk. Key Takeaways Funding contraction : Crypto VC funding fell to $1.97B in Q2 2025 — down sharply from Q1. Shift to treasuries : Treasury vehicles raised ~ $15B YTD through Aug. 21 to accumulate crypto. Selective capital : Investors favor RWA tokenization, stablecoin rails, and privacy focused infrastructure. Conclusion The crypto venture capital slowdown reflects a strategic pivot: investors are prioritizing direct digital asset accumulation, treasury plays and projects with proven revenue models. Expect continued selective VC activity in tokenization, stablecoins and privacy infrastructure as institutional adoption rises.

LSEG Lipper data revealed that U.S. equity funds received $36.41 in net inflows during the week, their largest weekly net purchase since November 13, 2024. The large-cap equity funds recorded net weekly inflows of $40.75 billion, the largest amount since around 2022.

They invest more in short-to-intermediate government and treasury funds to a total of $9.37 billion in their largest weekly sales since at least January 2022. U.S. short-to-intermediate investment-grade funds saw $1.95 billion in inflows, while general domestic taxable fixed-income funds recorded net inflows of $1.55 billion. Money market funds also recorded an increase in net investments, surging to a four-week high of $47.08 billion during the week.

Money market funds received a net of $8.84 billion, posting the first weekly net purchase in three weeks. Global equity funds recorded strong demand in the week through October 1, following an inline U.S. inflation report and a weaker-than-expected jobs report. U.S. economy regains momentum in Q3 U.S. equity funds surged as the U.S. consumer spending increased slightly more than expected in August. The U.S. Commerce Department reported last Friday that the economy has so far regained most of its momentum from the third quarter. The government shutdown witnessed on Wednesday suggested that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is closed and unable to release the official government jobs report on Friday. The weak labor report also came as chances of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates again this year rose after the U.S. central bank resumed policy easing in mid-September. At the time of publication, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 97.8% probability that the central bank will cut rates by 25 bps during the upcoming October 29 Fed meeting. “There is no support in this report for (Fed Governor) Stephen Miran’s suggestion that policy interest rates have to be cut right away, and by a lot. Indeed, there is no recommendation in these numbers for any easing of monetary conditions at all.” -Carl Weinberg, Chief Economist at High Frequency Economics. The U.S. labor market declined, with U.S. companies shedding 32,000 jobs in September. Payroll processing company ADP’s private sector employment report on Wednesday showed lower than the expected job report of 45,000 in the month. ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson argued that last month’s release validated that U.S. employers have been cautious with hiring, despite the strong economic growth witnessed in the second quarter. The weak labor report followed a slightly more positive GDP and unemployment claims report for the U.S. economy. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Speaking to Bloomberg Television, Miran said he was not shy about offering different views from other members of the central bank and that there was only one condition that would change his thinking on the current inflation outlook. Fed Governor Stephen Miran said there's only one scenario in which he could change his current positive inflation outlook: an unexpected, sudden rise in housing costs. Miran argued that housing is the “single largest component” of the inflationary process, but added that his “neutral inflation forecast” would have to be adjusted if there were a shock that significantly pushed housing costs up. He stated that he expected a significant decline in housing-related services inflation, considering that the increase in housing costs was largely due to population shocks and that the effects of these shocks were reversing. Related News: One of Japan's Largest Financial Companies May Have Had Its Cryptocurrency Wallets Hacked - Here Are the Details Miran also clarified misconceptions about his position on the neutral interest rate (r-star). He stated that the view that the neutral interest rate is zero is incorrect, explaining that his calculations indicate that the rate is not zero, but around half a percent (0.5%). Miran, who noted that he does not hesitate to frequently present unconventional and “non-consensus” ideas, said, “I see it as part of my job to occasionally bring fresh and non-consensus ideas to an established way of thinking.” Miran added that after his inauguration, President Trump called to congratulate him but “never asked him to take any specific policy action.” *This is not investment advice.

This critical moment could lead to significant shifts in cryptocurrency prices. Investors and traders are keen to see which digital assets will break out or face a downturn. In a market where visibility and timing are everything, agencies like Outset PR are also playing a crucial role in helping crypto businesses present their narratives clearly and gain traction at the right moment. Bitcoin Eyes New Highs with Strong Momentum Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently trading in a range just above one hundred eight thousand dollars. The cryptocurrency is gaining attention as it shows a positive weekly price change over ten percent. In just six months, Bitcoin's value has soared over forty-four percent. Its nearest resistance point is approaching one hundred nineteen thousand dollars. If it breaks through, it could push towards its next target over one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars. The simple moving averages and key indicators like the RSI suggest solid bullish momentum. If Bitcoin continues this trend, we might see significant growth beyond current levels. However, traders are closely watching these levels for potential movements. Ethereum Eyes New Highs Amid Strong Growth Potential Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently trading within the range of around $3800 to $4450. The coin has shown significant growth over six months, gaining almost one and a half times its previous value. It faces resistance near $4770, with the next barrier at about $5400. However, if momentum continues, Ethereum might break through these highs. The coin's support is solidly positioned near $3500. Short-term indicators show a mixed signal, but with recent gains of over 15% in the last week, confidence in Ethereum's upward trend is growing. If it sustains this pace, Ethereum could soon climb another few hundred dollars, continuing its impressive bull run. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Conclusion BTC and ETH prices depend on many factors, including the expiration of options. This event can cause noticeable moves in their values. The reaction may vary, leading to either increased volatility or stabilization. How the market will respond remains to be seen, but the expiration of options is a key moment to watch for potential price adjustments. As Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to capture investor attention during this crucial options expiration period, projects looking to stand out can learn a key lesson: timing and precision matter—in trading and in PR.

Despite several market fluctuations, the cryptocurrency has managed to hold critical support levels, fueling optimism that a significant breakout may be close. With trading activity surging and new investment flows entering the ecosystem, DOGE appears to be preparing for its next upward phase in the ongoing cycle. Accumulation Structure Holds Above Key Support According to analyst Ali Martinez, Dogecoin continues to consolidate within an ascending channel, showing strength above its accumulation range. The token has repeatedly defended support near $0.13, an area that has triggered rallies in past cycles. Price action now focuses on the $0.25–$0.26 range, where buyers are attempting to reestablish momentum. Martinez noted that a decisive move above $0.34 could push DOGE toward $0.50, aligning with long-standing channel projections. Hence, as long as $0.13 remains intact, the market structure suggests Dogecoin is still building the base for its next advance. Retest Confirms Breakout Pattern Analyst EtherNasyonaL emphasized that Dogecoin recently completed a successful retest of a multi-year descending trendline, confirming a bullish reversal. This retest mirrors a setup observed during late 2024, where support at $0.22–$0.23 preceded a strong rebound. Source: X Immediate resistance now sits near $0.30, but EtherNasyonaL noted that sustained buying could extend gains toward $0.42 and $0.60. Consequently, the technical structure reinforces the idea that DOGE has validated its breakout and may be entering its next upward leg. Transition Into Parabolic Phase Trader Tardigrade presented a broader view, pointing to Dogecoin’s weekly chart as evidence of a shift into a parabolic phase. After spending much of 2022–2023 consolidating between $0.05 and $0.09, DOGE gradually advanced into a slow-bull cycle through 2024 and early 2025. The recent breakout above $0.40 marked the start of parabolic momentum, with psychological targets at $0.75 and $1.00 now in sight. Significantly, strong support near $0.25 and rising volumes provide the structural foundation for this transition. Market Momentum and Mining Expansion Beyond chart patterns, fundamental developments are also bolstering sentiment. Dogecoin’s price as of press time stands at $0.2646 , representing a 3.43% daily gain and 17.31% growth in the past week. Market capitalization has climbed to nearly $40 billion, supported by $3.1 billion in daily trading volume. Additionally, Nasdaq-listed Thumzup Media Corporation recently invested $2.5 million into Dogehash Technologies , boosting its DOGE mining capacity. The capital will fund the deployment of over 500 miners, expanding the active fleet to more than 4,000 ASIC units. This increase in infrastructure signals growing institutional confidence in the asset.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-03 17:46:44

The sheer scale of these expiries highlights how central options have become to crypto price action — and why protocols like Zexpire , which aim to democratize this booming niche, are starting to capture investor attention. Billions at Stake: BTC and ETH Options Expiry According to data from Deribit, Bitcoin leads today’s action with $3.36 billion worth of contracts set to expire, while Ethereum accounts for just under $1 billion. Together, the expiries represent one of the most closely watched events of the week. Source: deribit Bitcoin Options Overview Open interest: 27,962 contracts Max pain: $115,000 Put-to-call ratio (PCR): 1.13 (slightly bearish) Current price: $120,124 Ethereum Options Overview Open interest: 216,210 contracts Max pain: $4,200 PCR: 0.93 (neutral) For the uninitiated, the max pain level refers to the strike price where most options expire worthless — often acting as a “gravitational pull” on prices around expiry. With Bitcoin trading above $120K, bulls currently have the upper hand, though market makers could still push prices closer to the $115K zone. What This Means for Traders Options expiry days are notorious for volatility, and today is no different. For Bitcoin, the slightly bearish PCR suggests caution, though bulls have managed to keep BTC above the key $120K threshold. Meanwhile, Ethereum volatility has collapsed, and traders are rotating into Bitcoin, leaving ETH in a fragile sideways trend. Compared to last week’s record-breaking $21 billion monthly expiry, today’s event is smaller. Still, with billions of dollars in contracts unwinding, the broader market can expect sharp, short-term turbulence. The Bigger Picture: Options Are Crypto’s Growth Engine The headline numbers from today’s expiry — billions in contracts, sudden price swings, and intricate hedging dynamics — all point to one fact: options trading has become one of the fastest-growing pillars of crypto. On centralized venues like Deribit, daily trading volumes now average around $3 billion. But here’s the catch: this market is still dominated by professionals who understand complex Greeks, hedging strategies, and leverage risks. Retail participation has remained minimal — until now. Enter Zexpire: One-Click Options for the Masses This is where Zexpire comes in. Branded as the first 0DTE DeFi protocol, Zexpire strips options down to their essence and transforms them into a simple, binary experience. Here’s how it works: Users bet whether the price will stay within a range or break out in the next 24 hours. Guess right, and you win. Guess wrong, and your loss is capped at your stake. No margin calls. No cascading liquidations. Just a fixed-risk play on volatility. In other words, Zexpire is packaging the same volatility that drives billion-dollar expiries on Deribit into an accessible format that anyone can use. Learn more about Zexpire Why This Context Fuels Zexpire’s Rally Potential Today’s BTC and ETH expiries highlight two truths: Options are driving crypto’s volatility. Retail traders remain largely excluded. Zexpire bridges this gap by: Offering a simplified “one-click” format that mirrors the dynamics of options without the complexity. Backing the platform with a native token, $ZX, which powers governance, provides staking rewards, and includes deflationary mechanics like fee burns and buybacks. Opening access across multiple chains (Base, Solana, TON, Tron), with the ability to buy directly by card. Currently priced at just $0.003 in seed access — nearly 800% below its planned listing price of $0.025 — $ZX also carries the speculative upside that traders look for in early-stage DeFi projects. Early participants benefit from loyalty bonuses, staking rewards up to 5%, and exclusive airdrops. How to buy $ZX A Retail-Friendly Spin on the Derivatives Boom We’ve already seen how HYPE, Hyperliquid’s native token, surged by capturing the derivatives narrative. Zexpire is attempting to carve out a similar niche — but with an even broader appeal. Its fixed-risk, gamified structure makes it more like prediction markets than traditional options desks, giving it a shot at viral adoption. If Zexpire can capture even a fraction of the momentum that BTC and ETH expiries show every week, $ZX could position itself as the breakout DeFi token riding the options wave. Final Thoughts The billions expiring today on Bitcoin and Ethereum options underscore just how crucial derivatives have become in shaping crypto markets. They also highlight how difficult this environment is for retail traders to navigate. Zexpire offers a striking contrast: a simplified, fixed-risk, DeFi-native gateway to the same volatility that institutions profit from. With its token still in early-stage pricing, the timing could prove compelling for those looking to ride the next leg of the options-driven boom. BTC and ETH expiries move markets — but Zexpire is building the on-ramp for everyone else.

Starting this week, Galaxy users can access Coinbase services directly through the Samsung Wallet app. Excited to be partnering with @Samsung to make crypto even more accessible. We’re offering 75M+ Samsung Galaxy users in the U.S. free access to Coinbase One to bring them onboard. And we’ve fully integrated Samsung Pay, so every Coinbase user in the U.S. can use that to buy… pic.twitter.com/kfBvo2znCQ — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) October 3, 2025 The collaboration introduces exclusive benefits, including a free three-month subscription to Coinbase One, the exchange’s premium membership program that offers zero trading fees on select assets, boosted staking rewards, priority support, and account protection. Users will also receive a $25 credit after making their first trade on Coinbase. Galaxy Users Can Now Store IDs, Cards, Keys—and Crypto—in Samsung Wallet The partnership expands on earlier work between the two companies. In July, Coinbase integrated with Samsung Pay, allowing U.S. users to purchase crypto in-app. With the new update, Galaxy owners can now consolidate digital essentials such as IDs, payment cards, keys, and crypto holdings within Samsung Wallet, making the platform a central hub for financial and digital identity management. “Together with Samsung, we’re pairing their global scale with Coinbase’s trusted platform to deliver the best value for people to access crypto—starting with more than 75 million Galaxy users across the U.S. and soon around the world,” said Shan Aggarwal, Coinbase’s chief business officer. Samsung executives framed the partnership as part of a broader effort to make the Wallet app an all-in-one tool for everyday use. “Millions of Galaxy users rely on their smartphone to complete daily tasks. With our Coinbase partnership, they now have a simple and streamlined way to access crypto from a leader in the industry,” said Drew Blackard, senior vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America. @Coinbase is racing to stay ahead of a wave of new competitors as it pivots to a broader financial services platform. #Coinbase #Crypto https://t.co/fXnzrY53nw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 14, 2025 Coinbase has been pursuing expansion as it faces growing competition in both traditional finance and the crypto sector. The company, which entered the S&P 500 this year and holds an $83 billion market capitalization , has been diversifying its services beyond trading. Additionally, Coinbase acquired crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion , indicating its intention to dominate that space. It is now active in custody, payments, asset management, and derivatives, while also serving as custodian for eight of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. With Bitcoin trading near record highs and institutional adoption accelerating, the Samsung partnership positions Coinbase to tap into one of the largest consumer bases in the world. The companies said they intend to expand access globally, bringing crypto services to hundreds of millions of Galaxy users worldwide.

On one side, Bitcoin whales are quietly building positions again, pulling billions of dollars’ worth of BTC off exchanges. On the other, smart money is shifting into the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale , signaling that investors are not only accumulating Bitcoin but also hunting for the next big crypto to explode in 2025 . Bitcoin Whales Accumulate $8 Billion in BTC Bitcoin has bounced back quickly, reclaiming $111,800 within a day, as signs of strong conviction reappear. Data from Glassnode shows the largest accumulation phase in over eight months, with nearly 71,000 BTC—worth close to $8 billion—withdrawn from exchanges. Such Bitcoin whale accumulation is historically associated with reduced selling pressure and long-term optimism. Institutional investors and long-term holders appear to be capitalizing on temporary weakness, positioning themselves for the next upward move. Despite accumulation, the Bitcoin RSI remains below the neutral 50 mark, suggesting that short-term momentum is still fragile. At present levels, BTC is trading near $111,842, with $112,500 acting as a critical resistance. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Chart: Glassnode A clean break above this level could flip $115,000 into support and open the door for a rally toward $120,000. Failing to do so, however, risks another retest of $110,000 or even $108,000. The balance between whale buying and market hesitancy reflects the current tug-of-war shaping crypto market predictions this month . On-chain data further confirms that accumulation is widespread, with wallets holding over 1,000 BTC increasing steadily. Meanwhile, long-term holders—those keeping coins unmoved for more than six months—are continuing to stack, signaling unwavering confidence despite macro uncertainties. The growing institutional appetite is also fueled by the momentum behind Bitcoin ETFs , which have been absorbing liquidity and legitimizing Bitcoin as a core part of modern portfolios. This combination of whale buying, exchange outflows, and ETF demand suggests that Bitcoin may be building a foundation for its next rally. While short-term volatility remains, the scale of accumulation indicates that whales and institutions are preparing for a much larger move, keeping Bitcoin firmly on the list of the best cryptocurrency investments in 2025 . Smart Money Shifts Into MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale While whales are reinforcing confidence in Bitcoin, many traders are seeking growth opportunities elsewhere. That “elsewhere” is MAGACOIN FINANCE , now widely viewed as one of the best crypto presales for 2025 . Analysts are of the opinion that, contrary to the projects where venture capital has a major influence, MAGACOIN FINANCE prioritizes community ownership and limited tokenomics, thus being a good option for those investors who are not only interested in Bitcoin. On-chain data highlights that thousands of early investors have already joined the presale, raising tens of millions of dollars and pushing each phase closer to sell-out. Analysts highlight that MAGACOIN FINANCE combines scarcity, credibility, and momentum in a way similar to the early days of Bitcoin. As a result, its upcoming listings on major CEXs and DEXs are expected to unlock even more demand. Conclusion: Bitcoin Whales and Presale Momentum Bitcoin whale activity is still a powerful trend that significantly influences the overall market as the latest data clearly shows. One of the main indicators for this is the movements of large sums of money in the billions that have been withdrawn from exchanges. Moreover, smart money crypto moves are not only targeting Bitcoin but also other altcoins, with the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale rapidly taking off as one of the most exciting new crypto projects for 2025. The MAGACOIN FINANCE price prediction indicates a strong potential that could be fuelled by a low token supply combined with a large community support. Thus, Bitcoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE are two of the most interesting assets to keep an eye on in the coming weeks.

BTC got a boost from a short squeeze, as well as hints at bringing back legalized crypto trading to Russia. Bitcoin (BTC) was unstoppable ahead of the weekend, breaking out from $120,000 to over $123,900 within hours. BTC is now seen as capable of reaching a new all-time high, probably targeting $126,000. BTC gained positions rapidly, causing up to $100M in short liquidations within hours | Source: Coingecko The rally followed the weekly futures expiration event, which may have caused some downward pressure on the price. Without the expiration looming, BTC was free to chart a new rally, with trading volumes at a one-month peak of $78B. The high-volume rally indicated a strong overall sentiment for BTC, as the asset expanded by more than 12% over the past week. BTC set up a local bottom for September at $107,000, based on both derivative liquidity and spot accumulation. BTC then quickly returned to the $122,000 range, with expectations for additional attempts to break new price records. The current rally happened during a time of neutral sentiment based on the fear and greed index, showing BTC was ready to rally even without excessive greed. The main driver was the accumulation of short liquidity that could be attacked and liquidated. BTC futures trade at a premium During the recent rapid rally, price reports showed disparities between exchanges. Binance’s USDT pair had a premium, reaching over $123,990. Futures markets are showing even larger premiums to the spot price, with Binance futures at $124,616. However, on Aster, the BTC futures traded at $120,242. The most liquid Binance trading pair was also trading at a premium, reaching $127,579. The climb to $123,000 tracked the liquidations of short positions. The other option for BTC was a dip to $118,000 to liquidate long positions. Most of the short liquidity has been taken, and BTC is still threatening a dip as low as $110,000. The recent BTC price move liquidated almost all short positions above $123,000 | Source: Coinglass The rapid price expansion caused $72.97M in liquidations for the past hour. BTC rallied ahead of other altcoins, as ETH and other assets remained near their usual range. The BTC rally, however, helped BNB break to a new all-time peak above $1,167. Is retail BTC trading coming back to Russia? BTC had multiple triggers for the current rally, but the news about Russia allowing retail trading has added to the hype. Reports have surfaced of the Moscow stock exchange, the country’s largest market operator, calling on regulators to bring back retail crypto trading. Russia has been one of the regions with broad crypto adoption, though it has been excluded from international trading due to sanctions. It remains uncertain how much BTC would be mopped up by potential Russian buyers. BTC has once again shown its appeal as an asset during times of economic turbulence.

Daily price movement shows a slight dip, while trading volume stands near $950 million. Attention is now on whether LINK can continue its climb toward $47, a level that matches the highs of 2021. Technical Setup Signals Higher Levels Analyst Ali Martinez shared a 3-day chart showing LINK moving inside an ascending parallel channel since 2023. The price action is holding above $20, which aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. Staying above this zone gives room for further gains. Notably, the projection marks potential steps toward $29, $35–$39, and then $46 at the 1.272 Fibonacci extension. That level also meets the top line of the channel.

The asset is now consolidating above this level, which has historically served as a pivot point for past moves. If LINK holds above this band, the chart shows a possible move toward the upper boundary of the channel. The next heavy resistance remains the 2021 all-time high supply zone between $47 and $52. Support has firmed in the $18–$20 area after a successful retest. Source: EtherNasyonaL/X Additionally, on-chain activity is also expanding. Martinez noted that 1,963 new addresses joined the network on October 1. Data from DeFi Llama reports that total value secured (TVS) in Chainlink has reached $66 billion, up from $25 billion in April this year. Meanwhile, this increase in adoption strengthens Chainlink’s position in decentralized finance and may support higher price levels if momentum continues. Short-Term Market Signals LINK is trading near $22 on the 4-hour chart, where the EMAs 20, 50, 100, and 200 have converged. This tight cluster of moving averages marks an important decision zone, with a clear break above or below likely to set the next short-term direction. Source: TradingView The MACD indicator has given a slight bearish crossover with a red histogram. The momentum is likely to lose its strength, indicating sideways movement or a pullback will be seen merely before another breakout attempt.

He stated that XRP must reach $4.75 on or before October 21, 2025, and if it fails to do so, he will reward one random participant with 100 XRP. To qualify, followers are asked to like, share, and provide their XRP address in the comments. #XRP to $4.75 on or before October 21, 2025, or I am giving away 100 XRP to one random person. To play you have to like and share this post and put your XRP address in the comments. pic.twitter.com/b1qmcxgFrQ — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 1, 2025 The Forecast and Its Timing The chosen date is significant because it aligns with a period of heightened anticipation in the XRP community. Several spot XRP ETF applications are under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with key decisions expected in mid-to-late October. If approved, such products could pave the way for greater institutional participation and potentially accelerate capital inflows. For this reason, October has become a focal point for bullish price expectations, and CryptoBull’s forecast directly ties into this timeline. Factors Driving Optimism Optimism around XRP’s price outlook is not based solely on regulatory speculation. On-chain data and exchange metrics indicate that available supplies of XRP on trading platforms have been declining , a condition some interpret as a potential supply squeeze if demand rises suddenly. Additionally, large holders are reported to be steadily accumulating , reinforcing the view that confidence is building at current price levels. From a technical perspective, analysts indicate XRP’s resilience above important support zones, which strengthens arguments for a possible breakout should buying momentum increase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Challenges and Uncertainties Still, the prediction carries notable risks. The SEC could delay or reject ETF applications, which would dampen expectations. Even in the event of approval, history shows that markets sometimes react with short-term volatility or profit-taking rather than sustained rallies. Moreover, the promotional nature of the post means that much of the engagement it generates is tied to the giveaway itself, rather than purely market conviction. CryptoBull’s statement has added another layer of attention to an already pivotal month for XRP . By attaching a clear price target and a public incentive, the post highlights the sense of urgency and expectation surrounding October’s developments. Whether XRP reaches the $4.75 mark or not, the forecast reflects the growing belief among some analysts that institutional catalysts, supply dynamics, and technical positioning could converge to push the asset higher in the near term.

XRP has just flashed such a signal, drawing renewed attention to its price trajectory. According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, a confirmed bullish MACD crossover has appeared on XRP’s daily chart, a development that has historically aligned with sharp upside movements. The analysis highlights past instances where similar crossovers preceded significant rallies, underscoring why this latest signal is being closely watched. Understanding the MACD Bullish Crossover A bullish MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line moves above its signal line, reflecting strengthening short-term momentum compared to longer-term averages. This shift suggests that selling pressure is waning and buying strength is beginning to dominate. Traders often view this as an early signal that an asset could be gearing up for an upward trend. #XRP BULLISH MACD CROSS CONFIRMED pic.twitter.com/dwJdBoKfC2 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 2, 2025 Because the MACD is derived from exponential moving averages, it is considered a lagging indicator — it reacts to price changes rather than predicting them outright. However, its strength lies in confirming momentum. When a crossover coincides with rising volume or supportive price action, its credibility increases significantly. Historical Context Steph’s chart illustrates two recent examples where XRP responded strongly after bullish MACD crossovers. The first, in July, preceded an explosive rally of more than 90%, while the second, in September, was followed by a more modest but still notable 13% gain. These outcomes suggest that XRP traders have historically reacted positively to this signal, using it as confirmation to enter positions. Why This Signal Matters Now The latest crossover does not exist in a vacuum. XRP has been navigating a unique environment shaped by its ongoing role in global liquidity discussions, the expectation of XRP ETFs approval , and broader shifts in crypto market sentiment. With these fundamental factors setting the stage, technical signals such as a bullish MACD cross carry added weight, as they can accelerate price momentum when traders already anticipate positive developments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This alignment between technical confirmation and market context is critical. Traders are not simply looking at a chart; they are weighing the crossover against Ripple’s evolving regulatory clarity and XRP’s expanding use cases in cross-border settlements. The Trader’s Perspective: Confirmation and Risk For experienced traders, a bullish MACD cross is rarely acted upon in isolation. Many seek additional confirmation through higher highs and higher lows in price structure, or through volume expansion that indicates genuine buying interest. Without these, crossovers can turn into “false positives” that lead to sharp reversals. Risk management remains vital. Traders typically align their stop-loss levels with recent structural lows, ensuring that a failed signal does not translate into outsized losses. While XRP has seen positive outcomes in the past, the MACD crossover should be viewed as a factor that increases the likelihood of success, rather than a certainty. A Signal Worth Watching Steph’s analysis of the bullish MACD crossover brings attention to a critical moment for XRP. With prior crossovers coinciding with significant gains and the current setup forming just below the $3.00 level, traders are right to monitor this development closely. Technical signals can give you an advantage, but they’re not foolproof. A bullish MACD cross can amplify optimism and attract new buyers, but the outcome will depend on whether the market confirms the move with sustained momentum. For XRP holders and active traders alike, this latest crossover is a signal worth watching — and one that could shape the next chapter in XRP’s market story.

Despite weak sentiment across the broader crypto landscape, data points to resilience and potential upside. This article explores Avalanche’s technical momentum, while also highlighting how forward-looking communication strategies from agencies like Outset PR can amplify visibility for projects riding these market waves. Avalanche (AVAX) Poised for Growth with Positive Momentum Source: tradingview Avalanche (AVAX) is showing an upward trend within its current price range of mid-$20s to mid-$30s. Recent data reveals an impressive one-month price hike of over 23%, complemented by a longer-term growth of around 70% in the past six months. The current RSI, a low 43.6, hints that AVAX isn't overbought, suggesting room for growth. If momentum continues, breaking past $40 resistance is key, with potential to climb toward the upper $40s. While short-term support lies at $22, the 10-day and 100-day moving averages are nearly identical, hovering around $30, marking stability and potential for upward movement. AVAX may soon approach a bullish run if resistance levels are surpassed.

Bitcoin could reach $150,000 quickly after a confirmed breakout above $120,000. Safe-haven flows, ECB liquidity and retirement-plan allocations are key drivers. On-chain data and weekly market breadth show recovery: BTC up ~6% last week; ZEC led top-100 gains at +157%. Bitcoin breakout to $150,000: BTC may surge quickly after a $120,000 breakout—read analysis, expert views, and market data to act fast. What is driving the Bitcoin breakout narrative toward $150,000? Bitcoin breakout talk centers on renewed investor demand for safe-haven assets amid macro uncertainty. Market participants point to U.S. political events, expanding central bank balance sheets and renewed institutional allocation as the primary catalysts that could push BTC from $120,000 to $150,000 within a short window. BTC/USD, one-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph How likely is a rapid move from $120,000 to $150,000? Analysts including Charles Edwards view a “very quick” move as plausible once BTC clears the $120,000 range. Short-term momentum, rising bid depth and renewed flows into spot and derivatives markets raise the odds. Data shows Bitcoin rose over 6% last week, recovering above $118,500 and then trading above $120,122 at time of reporting. Why would safe-haven demand impact Bitcoin’s price? Safe-haven demand amplifies when traditional markets face political or fiscal shocks. The recent U.S. government shutdown and concerns over expanding central bank deficits in Europe increase expectations for liquidity. Market voices, including Arthur Hayes and others, have pointed to potential ECB money printing as a tailwind funneling liquidity into risk assets like Bitcoin. What other market headlines could influence BTC in the near term? Key headlines shaping sentiment include: institutional adoption narratives (401(k) inclusion discussions and large-cap allocations), regulatory legal outcomes (high-profile cases such as Tornado Cash), and competitive token launches in DeFi that shift trader attention. Each item can affect short-term volatility and directional conviction. BTC/USD, one-month chart. Source: Cointelegraph How did expert commentary shape the market outlook this week? Charles Edwards (Capriole Investments) forecasted a potential rapid climb to $150,000 after breakout confirmation. Cathie Wood (ARK Invest) compared Hyperliquid’s early performance to Solana’s early cycle, highlighting investor interest in new protocol tokens. Rob Hadick (Dragonfly) and Sergej Kunz (1inch) offered insight on tokenized stocks and exchange evolution, influencing capital allocation expectations. What legal and regulatory events matter for crypto sentiment? High-profile legal developments—such as the motion for acquittal filed for Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm—directly affect privacy-focused protocol perceptions and regulatory risk pricing. Outcomes in U.S. courts and policy shifts at regulators like the SEC carry immediate sentiment and structural implications for institutional participation. Tornado Cash website. Source: Tornado.Cash When could institutional flows materially lift Bitcoin prices? Institutional flows accelerate when allocators gain regulatory clarity and product access. Projections cited by industry researchers estimate that even modest retirement-plan allocations (for example, 1% of 401(k) volumes) could unlock tens of billions in fresh capital. Timing depends on product rollouts and custodial infrastructure readiness. Rob Hadick speaking to Cointelegraph at TOKEN 2049. Source: Andrew Fenton/Cointelegraph Frequently Asked Questions Can Bitcoin reach $150,000 this year? Yes. Analysts say a confirmed breakout above $120,000 combined with strong liquidity flows and renewed institutional allocations could send BTC to $150,000 within weeks. This scenario depends on continued market breadth and macro-driven safe-haven demand. What are the main risks to a rapid BTC rally? Main risks include regulatory crackdowns, sharp macroeconomic tightening, large liquidations in derivatives markets, and sudden declines in on-chain demand. Legal outcomes and policy moves can shift momentum quickly. How are DeFi and tokenization trends affecting crypto capital flows? Tokenized equities and DeFi innovation can redirect institutional activity toward specialized infrastructure, sometimes off public chains. This reduces or reshapes liquidity available to general-purpose networks like Ethereum while creating new venues for capital deployment. Sergej Kunz at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph Key Takeaways Momentum setup: BTC breaking and holding above $120,000 increases probability of a fast move to $150,000. Macro catalysts: Safe-haven flows and central bank liquidity could funnel new capital into Bitcoin. Watch signals: Monitor on-chain demand, derivatives open interest, ETF/retirement product uptake, and regulatory news for directional confirmation. Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent recovery and expert commentary have renewed talk of a potential $150,000 target if a decisive breakout above $120,000 occurs. Market participants should track liquidity cues, institutional adoption signals, and regulatory developments. COINOTAG will continue monitoring price action and structural drivers as the story unfolds. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-breakout-150k-analysis-2025-10-03"" }, ""headline"": ""Bitcoin breakout analysis: Could BTC hit $150,000 after $120,000 breakout?"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a996-3ddc-75c3-b24e-e682c8db37d3.webp"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Analysts say a Bitcoin breakout above $120,000 could prompt a swift rally to $150,000 as safe-haven and institutional flows return amid macro uncertainty.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can Bitcoin reach $150,000 this year?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A rapid move to $150,000 is possible if Bitcoin confirms a breakout above $120,000 and sustained liquidity and institutional flows support the rally."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What could trigger a quick Bitcoin rally?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Triggers include safe-haven demand from macro shocks, increased central bank liquidity expectations, retirement-plan allocations, and strong on-chain demand."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are the main risks to Bitcoin's rise?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key risks are regulatory actions, rapid macro tightening, derivatives liquidations, and negative legal rulings affecting market confidence."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret a Bitcoin breakout toward $150,000"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step signals to watch for confirmation of a rapid Bitcoin breakout."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a996-3ddc-75c3-b24e-e682c8db37d3.webp"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm price action"", ""text"": ""Wait for a sustained close above $120,000 on daily timeframes with increasing volume."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check liquidity metrics"", ""text"": ""Review derivatives open interest and spot exchange inflows for growing bid-side liquidity."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor institutional signals"", ""text"": ""Track announcements related to retirement-plan allocations, ETF flows, and custody integrations."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch macro and regulatory news"", ""text"": ""Assess central bank balance-sheet expectations and legal/regulatory outcomes that affect risk appetite."" } ]}",Analysis|Bitcoin|News|1INCH|BTC|ETH|SOL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-03 18:08:31

Bitcoin breakout catalyst: Safe‑haven demand and central bank liquidity could drive BTC to $150,000. Market momentum returned after late‑September weakness, with BTC reclaiming the $120,000 range and weekly gains above 6%. Data shows DeFi tokens rallied; ZEC rose ~157% weekly while institutional interest (401(k) inclusion talk) may unlock significant capital. Bitcoin $150,000 prediction: Bitcoin $150,000 target driven by safe‑haven flows and ECB liquidity; read analysis and expert quotes to act fast. Analysts were eying a “quick” Bitcoin breakout to $150,000, as ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood compared the Hyperliquid token’s performance to Solana during the previous crypto cycle. The digital asset market staged a significant recovery over the past week following the end-of‑September slump. Investor interest began to return, driven by a renewed appetite for safe‑haven assets amid US political uncertainty. Growing demand for safe havens may see Bitcoin (BTC) follow gold’s rally and reach a new all‑time high near $150,000 before year‑end, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said. Bitcoin reclaimed the $120,000 level for the first time since mid‑August and traded above $120,122 at time of writing. BTC/USD, one-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph What is driving the Bitcoin $150,000 breakout prediction? Bitcoin $150,000 forecasts rest on two core drivers: renewed safe‑haven buying that follows macro shocks, and potential fresh liquidity from central banks. Analysts point to BTC’s reclaiming of $120,000 as a technical trigger that could spark a rapid rally toward $150,000. How could safe‑haven demand push Bitcoin to $150,000? Front‑loaded macro headlines and geopolitical uncertainty can redirect capital into perceived stores of value. Charles Edwards and other macro analysts argue that if investors treat BTC like digital gold, inflows could intensify quickly. Arthur Hayes highlighted the possibility of large‑scale ECB liquidity, noting France’s central bank deficit could force expansive money printing by the European Central Bank and send fresh liquidity into risk and non‑sovereign assets. What technical and institutional signs support a fast breakout? Technically, recovering above $120,000 removes a key psychological resistance and can attract momentum trading. Data shows BTC rose over 6% in the last week, signaling renewed buyer conviction. Institutionally, comments from asset managers — including estimates that 401(k) inclusion could unlock $122 billion — present a material demand case. André Dragosch of Bitwise estimates even small allocations by retirement managers could lift BTC materially. Frequently Asked Questions Will Bitcoin reach $150,000 before year‑end? Analysts say it is possible if current momentum continues and macro liquidity increases; the scenario depends on safe‑haven flows, ECB policy, and sustained technical breakout above $120,000. What role does central bank liquidity play? Central bank easing can increase available cash for risk assets. Arthur Hayes suggested that European money printing could create cross‑asset liquidity that supports Bitcoin’s price appreciation. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin $150,000: Analysts See Rapid Breakout After $120,000 Reclaim"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199a996-3ddc-75c3-b24e-e682c8db37d3""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199a996-3ddc-75c3-b24e-e682c8db37d3"" } }, ""description"": ""Analysts say Bitcoin could surge to $150,000 if safe-haven demand and renewed liquidity push BTC past the $120,000 breakout."", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-150000-breakout-analysis"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the $150,000 Bitcoin prediction based on?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The $150,000 prediction is based on technical breakout above $120,000, safe‑haven inflows, and potential central bank liquidity that could accelerate capital entering Bitcoin."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which experts are cited in this analysis?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Experts cited include Charles Edwards (Capriole Investments), Arthur Hayes (BitMEX co‑founder), and André Dragosch (Bitwise); source mentions: Cointelegraph, DefiLlama (plain text)."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret a Bitcoin breakout to $150,000"", ""description"": ""Steps to evaluate whether BTC can reach $150,000 after a breakout above $120,000."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199a996-3ddc-75c3-b24e-e682c8db37d3"", ""totalTime"": ""PT24H"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm technical breakout"", ""text"": ""Look for daily closes above $120,000 and rising volume to validate momentum."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor macro liquidity"", ""text"": ""Watch central bank statements and European balance sheet signals that could increase market liquidity."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track institutional flows"", ""text"": ""Follow announcements about retirement plan allocations or large fund inflows as a demand indicator."" } ]} Key Takeaways Safe‑haven flows matter : Macro shocks can redirect capital into Bitcoin quickly.

Markets now expect at least two cuts beginning as soon as the October FOMC meeting , with one more possible before the end of 2025. The macro backdrop has already helped Bitcoin rally to a 50-day high of $123,841 , gaining over 11% in October’s so-called “Uptober” surge. That change in expectations is a key bullish catalyst for risk assets, including Bitcoin.

Source: YCharts The move from quantitative tightening (QT) to a possible easing bias is part of why analysts are debating a rotation back into risk-on positioning. Monetary easing and the prospect of easier financial conditions historically lift risk assets and speculative flows. When macro liquidity and derivatives demand line up, price discovery can accelerate quickly. Major banks and research desks have turned bullish on BTC’s upside in this environment. Standard Chartered recently said Bitcoin could reach $135K soon and perhaps hit $200K by year-end. At the same time, spot ETF demand, growing options activity tied to ETFs, and a rising share of long-term holders (those who’ve held since the ETF approvals) are shifting market structure away from pure short-term leverage toward more durable demand. Spot ETFs Post $1.08B in Volume as Bitcoin Open Interest Hits $45.3B Spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $1.08 billion in volume over the last four days, showing that institutional inflows remain robust. At the same time, Bitcoin Open Interest just hit an all-time high of $45.3 billion, marking the largest leverage buildup the market has ever seen. On-chain data shows another bullish shift, with the rising share of long-term holders who have kept their BTC for 18 months to two years. Adding to the bullish narrative, there are reports that President Trump is considering new stimulus checks of $1,000–$2,000 funded through tariff revenues.

If confirmed, fresh fiscal stimulus would add another powerful liquidity injection into markets already preparing for Fed easing, potentially accelerating Bitcoin’s trajectory toward $150K and beyond .

Examining the weekly chart of Bitcoin, the technical picture reveals clear signs of strength. Price has successfully held the 20-week moving average as support, which has historically been one of the most reliable levels for sustaining long-term bullish trends. Source: TradingView The recent move also saw Bitcoin decisively break above the $112K downtrend resistance , a level that had capped momentum for several weeks. That breakout now sets the stage for continuation higher. What makes the current setup important is that Bitcoin is on track for the highest weekly close in its chart history , as the ongoing weekly candle is already showing a 7% gain . With these technical confirmations lining up, the probability of Bitcoin reaching $150K this quarter looks increasingly realistic.
