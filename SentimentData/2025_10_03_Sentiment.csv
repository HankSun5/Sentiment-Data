Rebound confirmed at $0.22 support and 100‑day EMA Futures Open Interest rose to $4.23 billion, showing strong speculative positioning. Liquidity clusters above $0.25 and historical trendline bounces make $0.30 a key near‑term target. Dogecoin price rebounds off $0.22 support, reclaims key EMAs and shows bullish on‑chain signs toward $0.30. Read full technical breakdown and trade signals now. What caused Dogecoin’s rebound? Dogecoin price bounced after hitting the $0.22 support level that coincided with the 100‑day EMA, prompting buyers to step in. Short‑term momentum improved as DOGE reclaimed the 20‑day EMA (~$0.24) and the 50‑day EMA (~$0.23), triggering a rapid 9% intraday recovery and renewed upside interest. How do on‑chain metrics support the bullish case? CoinGlass data showed DOGE Futures Open Interest surged to $4.23 billion, indicating more capital and speculative exposure. Liquidity heatmaps reveal clusters above $0.25, which can act as magnets for price if momentum persists. Rising OI with liquidity above current price typically amplifies directional moves. Dogecoin [DOGE] bounced from a key technical level this week, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The memecoin dipped to $0.22 before recovering sharply and retesting a rising trendline support. Bulls defended the $0.22 zone, sparking a 9% daily gain that preserved the broader uptrend. The zone aligned with the 100‑day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), reinforcing its strength as support. After the rebound, DOGE crossed above the 20‑day EMA at approximately $0.24 and the 50‑day EMA near $0.23. That technical shift boosted confidence in a potential move toward the $0.30 resistance level. Source: TradingView DOGE on‑chain metrics: what do they show? Futures Open Interest surged to $4.23 billion, signaling increased leverage and participation in DOGE futures markets. That level of OI typically reflects higher speculative conviction and can precede sharper intraday moves. CoinGlass’ liquidation heatmaps show multiple liquidity pockets above $0.25. If buyers sustain momentum, those clusters may attract price up to near‑term resistance bands. Source: CoinGlass Liquidity patterns also supported upside potential. CoinGlass’ DOGE/USDT liquidation heatmap highlights multiple resistance clusters above $0.25 that can act as price magnets if momentum continues. Source: CoinGlass History repeats at trendline support — what does the past tell us? Dogecoin has previously produced sharp rallies after similar trendline rebounds. Early July and earlier this month saw rebounds from comparable trendlines that led to 15–20% rallies within days. Those historical moves make $0.30 a logical near‑term target, but traders should watch funding rates and profit‑taking risk, which can quickly reverse sentiment.

Near‑term upside targeting centers on $0.30 if momentum holds. Immediate resistance sits at $0.24–$0.25; a sustained break above those levels increases the likelihood of testing $0.30 in the coming days. How risky is trading DOGE after this rebound? Trading risk is elevated due to higher futures open interest and concentrated liquidity. Use position sizing, clear stop levels (below $0.22 support), and monitor funding rates to manage fast reversals. Key Takeaways Support held at $0.22 : The 100‑day EMA and trendline acted as reliable support, initiating a sharp rebound. On‑chain confirmation : Futures OI reached roughly $4.23B and liquidity clusters above $0.25 suggest upside targets near $0.30. Risk management : Watch funding rates and set stops below $0.22; profit‑taking can quickly shift short‑term bias. Conclusion Dogecoin has displayed a technically constructive rebound from the $0.22 zone, with short‑term EMAs and on‑chain metrics aligning to support a push toward $0.30. Traders should combine chart structure, Futures Open Interest and liquidity heatmaps when sizing positions.

Goolsbee stated that the shutdown would most directly impact federal employees by not receiving their salaries on time. He argued that without the release of economic data, the Fed would be “virtually blind” in its decision-making process. “Even if official unemployment data isn't available,” he said, “we will make decisions based on other indicators we have.” Related News: On-chain Data May Indicate a Significant Dump Risk for This Altcoin Goolsbee stated that various indicators indicate the labor market maintains a certain degree of stability, noting that current data indicates the unemployment rate remains stable. However, he emphasized the importance of avoiding hasty interest rate cuts, saying, “We should avoid lowering interest rates too soon.” Finally, Goolsbee said he hopes the shutdown ends soon and doesn't impact the broader economy. As of this writing, a 25 basis point cut is widely expected for the Fed's interest rate decision on October 29, 2025. US President Donald Trump, however, is calling for a more aggressive cut. *This is not investment advice.

Institutional investors drove the rally with $676 million in net inflows on October 1, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust recording $405 million and Fidelity acquiring 1,570 BTC valued at $179 million in a single day. Bitcoin surpassed $120,500 today with trading volume exceeding $50 billion across all markets.

The potential reversal comes under the new CEO, Salim Ramji, who previously worked at BlackRock and has spoken about the promise of cryptocurrency. Vanguard finds itself in an awkward position as the largest owner of Strategy stock, primarily through funds tracking the Nasdaq 100, despite adopting a skeptical tone about Bitcoin. A Vanguard spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company “ continuously evaluates our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment ,” although they declined to confirm whether crypto ETFs are imminent. Even if just 1% of Vanguard’s 50 million customers decided to invest in Bitcoin ETFs, that would represent 500,000 new investors entering the market.

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the firm registered the name iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF as a “ 33 Act spot product ,” positioning it as a sequel to its $87 billion IBIT. The $12.5 trillion asset manager’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are generating more than $260 million in annual revenue , with $218 million from Bitcoin products and $42 million from Ethereum. Including smaller crypto holdings, BlackRock’s total digital asset custody now exceeds $101 billion. BlackRock’s Ethereum fund recorded $512 million in net capital inflows last week, according to Farside Investors. The firm disclosed $14.1 billion in digital asset inflows in its second-quarter earnings report, making the category one of its fastest-growing product lines despite representing only 1% of total assets under management. Technical Analysis Points to $128K Target With Consolidation Risk Bitcoin’s weekly chart displays systematic consolidation zones followed by impulsive advances throughout 2023-2025, with current positioning at $120,953 placing the crypto at the upper boundary of what analysts label “Price Discovery Uptrend 3.” Source: X/@rektcapital Each consolidation phase has lasted several weeks to months before resolving with breakouts. The pattern reveals consistent behavior where Bitcoin establishes base-building periods within horizontal ranges before breaking higher into new price discovery phases. However, diminishing percentage gains between each uptrend phase suggest potentially slowing momentum, with moves from $70,000 to $120,000 representing approximately 71% gains compared to 75% gains in the previous phase. The simplified price structure shows even a key break-and-retest pattern around the $110,000 level. Source: X/Coinvo Bitcoin appears to have broken above resistance, pulled back to retest this level as support, and is now positioned for potential continuation higher. Technical evidence supports a potential advancement toward $128,000-$135,000. However, the extended nature of the move suggests that this would likely occur with increased volatility and deeper pullbacks. The key support level for maintaining a bullish structure appears at $110,000-$112,000, where previous resistance is expected to provide support. Failure to hold this zone could trigger retracement toward $103,000-$105,000 channel support, while sustained breaks above $128,000 would open the path toward $135,000-$140,000 before testing upper channel resistance near $173,000.

ADA’s journey was always characterized by slow and careful advancement, prudent management, and research-driven innovation.l But slow and careful always have their shortcomings. It lays solid foundations while potentially lagging behind during seasons that privilege rapid progress and compelling narratives. Investors now wonder whether Cardano can reclaim its reputation of being a growth leader or remain forever shrouded by the shadow of ecosystems that progress faster. Right now, people are paying attention to new presales that do well because they are scarce, have community support, and are relevant. In retail areas on Telegram and X, excitement is growing for tokens that are not fully launched yet but are gaining attention. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to lead the discussion, making itself a strong candidate for presale with audits, fast growth, and a promise of high returns. The difference between Cardano’s slow decline and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s fast rise shows the two forces that are affecting the crypto market at this time. Cardano’s Slow Burn Cardano’s drop to $0.79 betrays some investor impatience. All its stress on peer-reviewed literature and academic rigor notwithstanding, its adoption timetable appears glacial compared with its rivals Solana and Ethereum. Its developers go on about its robust design, while its traders desire velocity and volume — its weakest points. The tension between ADA’s long-term promise and short-term patience simmers. The blockchain ecosystem keeps expanding through the form of governance upgrades and interoperability initiatives, but the market appears to be unsettled. The pullback reflects the broader volatility while also showing a sentiment that ADA failed to offer the breakout catalysts necessary to spark fresh rallies. The Emergence of Presale Narratives Whilst ADA consolidates, presales are getting all the attention. Early-stage token fans among retail investors will always be drawn to tokens that can send small allocations into overdrive. Presales provide one thing that majors don’t: the potential of exponential return that ground-floor access grants. Communities exist within this narrative. Speculation brews through Telegram channels, influencers shine a light on diverse initiatives, and money pours into tokens that will inevitably be “the next big thing.” Such vibrant energy separates itself from infrastructure projects, motivated not by thoughtful roadmaps but rather by an enduring outlook. MAGACOIN FINANCE As A Top Presale Contender Cardano’s slip under $0.80 highlights the difficulty of extracting large returns from established names. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining recognition as one of the top presale contenders, attracting both retail and whale discussions. Analysts suggest that early allocations could deliver 1,000%–1,400% ROI , given its structure and demand curve. The PATRIOT50X bonus code has added urgency for investors aiming to secure allocations before stages rise further. The contrast is sharp: ADA’s path to double requires billions in inflows, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s small cap base makes triple-digit ROI mathematically more accessible. This difference has fueled its momentum as the presale choice for those dissatisfied with Cardano’s pace. Whales And Retail Converge Whale tracking data indicates increased interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Big players are quietly positioning while retail groups offer ground-floor traction. Such alignment is uncommon — and potent. When whales and retails both get on board, tokens tend to explode dramatically. For traders managing their investments, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides something that ADA does not: quick results. While Cardano is a slow and steady investment, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors the excitement of possible big growth soon. Together, they show how investment portfolios can combine safety with risk. Changing Market Sentiment Cardano’s slow and steady approach is attractive to companies and individuals who plan long-term, but day traders want brighter horizons. The MAGACOIN FINANCE growth demonstrates how this desire appears. Investors don’t want to abandon good projects; they only want to invest in tokens that will rapidly multiply their funds. The outcome is a marketplace that caters to ADA for stability and research purposes and MAGACOIN FINANCE for future gains. The balance explains why MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the top choices during presales and why ADA is debated regarding its relevance during rapid adjustments. Conclusion Cardano’s drop to $0.79 reflects its struggle to maintain momentum in a market that rewards speed and excitement. Its academic foundation and careful governance remain valuable, but investors seeking rapid returns are rotating toward presales with viral growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its audits, scarcity-driven design, and strong community, has emerged as one of the top presale contenders of 2025. It represents the speculative spark that ADA currently lacks, offering retail and whales alike a chance to chase asymmetric upside. For portfolios, the lesson is clear: combine the long-term promise of projects like Cardano with the explosive potential of early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Solana has already seen added institutional action while it waits for prospective ETF approval, and regulatory go-ahead may trigger a robust leg higher and usher in billions of fresh inflows. But even considering SOL’s positioning, much of the market’s hype remains centered on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale project that’s sweeping the DeFi space off its feet. MUTM is now valued at a meager $0.035 in phase 6 of its presale. Mutuum Finance has already recorded over 16,700 holders and raised $16.7 million in pre-launch funds. With whales and retail traders both positioning for Q4, Mutuum Finance could be one of the best-upside altcoins heading into 2026. Can Solana (SOL) Reclaim $220 as Bulls Eye Key Technical Levels Solana (SOL) is flashing new strength after bouncing off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement near $193, a key technical level that has a tendency to be a launching pad for bull bounce-backs. Price action is currently heading towards a previously broken channel that will serve as near-term resistance, with investors carefully watching for potential short-term correction prior to the next decisive move. If momentum persists and market conditions remain favorable, reclaiming the $220 level seems quite within reach, pointing to a possible prolongation of SOL’s resurgence. As Solana gets back on its feet, investors also look for early-stage, high-potential coins that combine technical innovation with usability, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been a quick-emerging DeFi initiative attracting considerable buzz ahead of the next market cycle. Mutuum Finance Registers Robust Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still trendy in Phase 6 of presale, where it has seen more than 16,700 investors and more than $16.7 million. All this activity is evidence of the increasing faith in the long-term project vision and potential to build the future of decentralized finance. In their continuing commitment to security and transparency, Mutuum Finance partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Security engineers and developers are invited to find vulnerabilities in four levels of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low. This is just one part of Mutuum’s overall initiative to secure its infrastructure and gain the trust of its expanding community. Dynamic Interest Rates and Optimized Efficiency Mutuum Finance protocol is a real-time operating algorithmic floating interest rate system that dynamically reacts to liquidity levels. The borrow cost is lowered in times of high liquidity to incentivize lending and the inflow of new capital. The borrow cost increases when liquidity is low, thereby incentivizing new deposits and loan repayments. This self-regulating process discourages over-leveraging and promotes overall ecosystem equilibrium. Efficiency is augmented by collateral optimization, particularly for correlated assets. Well-collateralised positions have higher borrowing allowance and more favourable Loan-to-Value (LTV) margins, and reserve factors act as a buffer against market volatility. Volatile assets call for higher reserves to stem exposure to volatility, while less-volatile assets allow for higher borrowing with minimal liquidation risk. LTV margins and liquidation points are dynamically calibrated on the basis of each token’s own volatility profile, spreading the risk equitably across the platform. With its presale success, advanced risk management system, and unwavering commitment to security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming a stable and sustainable platform for long-term adoption, growth, and prosperity in decentralized finance. Pushing Ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to press forward, raising over $16.7 million from over 16,700 owners, with Phase 6 already over 55% sold at $0.035 per token. Whereas Solana (SOL) is poised to perhaps reach $220 in the wake of ETF rumors, MUTM rewards early birds with a high-potential DeFi trade through its dual lending protocol, variable interest rates, and robust security, including a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty program. Investors seeking exposure to a utility-driven, fast-growing altcoin should purchase MUTM tokens before presale is over.

Why XRP Is Still The Better Option,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-is-still-the-better-option/,"SWIFT’s decision to test a blockchain prototype with Consensys (Ethereum) has stirred debate in the crypto space, raising concerns about whether XRP’s role in global finance may be under threat. While Ethereum may offer experimentation, a crypto analyst argues that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) already delivers enterprise-grade performance, compliance features, and real-world adoption that institutions rely on. SWIFT’s Blockchain Partnership Challenges XRP Position On Tuesday, September 30, crypto market expert Pumpius shared a thread on X social media, unveiling the recent collaboration between SWIFT and Consensys that has triggered panic in the market. Although the partnership is presented as an innovative step, Pumpius argues that it exposes a fundamental weakness within SWIFT. According to the analyst, SWIFT has traditionally depended on legacy financial rails and is now attempting to modernize by leveraging Ethereum-based solutions. However, Pumpius points out that Ethereum continues to struggle with scalability, high transaction fees , and centralization concerns. He argues that while SWIFT is aware its legacy rails are deteriorating, adopting a “band-aid fix” is no replacement for core infrastructure. Ripple, on the other hand, has already moved beyond the experimental stage. Pumpius notes that the XRPL is designed to process transactions within three to five seconds, at minimal cost, making it far superior in terms of speed and accessibility. Unlike Ethereum prototypes, the analyst stated that Ripple’s solutions are actively in use across international payment corridors, supported by partnerships with over 100 banks, regulators, and major payment providers. Another major challenge that debates SWIFT’s Ethereum venture is compliance. Pumpius explained that global financial systems demand robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) frameworks—areas where blockchain options often face limitations. He highlighted that Ripple addresses these challenges head-on with the integration of the DNA Protocol, a system enabling verifiable digital identities, zero-knowledge proof verification , and on-chain compliance mechanisms that satisfy regulators while preserving user privacy. Why XRP Holds The Long-Term Advantage Upon further review of Pumpius’ analysis, he highlights that XRP’s position is strengthened by fundamentals that remain significantly relevant to institutions. He mentioned that Ripple has gained legal clarity in the US following the resolution of the SEC lawsuit and is also aligned with ISO 20022 , the global standard for financial messaging. The analyst further pointed to Ripple’s growing momentum, highlighted by the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin with SBI and its ongoing applications for banking licenses. Against this backdrop, he emphasized that institutions do not chase hype but rather adopt infrastructures that reduce costs, boost efficiency, and ensure compliance with regulations. In his view, RippleNet and the XRP Ledger already meet all three requirements, which explains their growing global integration. Concluding his report, Pumpius calls SWIFT’s blockchain move a “desperation play,” framing it less as a threat and more as a sign that change is inevitable. He also described the effort as experimental, contrasting it with Ripple’s rollout of solutions while Consensys pushes Ethereum through lobbying efforts. To XRP investors , he stressed that they are holding an asset with the potential to reprice immediately once new financial rails are fully activated.",XRP|AML|Anti-Money Laundering|ConsensYs|ISO 20022|know-your-customer|KYC|Pumpius|ripple|RLUSD|stablecoin|SWIFT|US SEC|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 22:00:09

Related Reading: Galaxy’s Digital Bitcoin Sales Continue: 1,190 Bitcoin Moves To Binance After bouncing from a September low near $0.205, HBAR has formed constructive patterns, an Elliott Wave advance, a double bottom, and a 10-week descending wedge, that together suggest a bullish turn. With a final decision on a proposed HBAR spot ETF expected in November, traders are wondering if a clear break above $0.23–$0.24 could lead to the $0.30 level. ETF Season Puts HBAR in the Spotlight Macro tailwinds are strengthening, with the SEC expected to make decisions on numerous crypto ETF applications in October–November. Analysts believe that current listing standards improve the chances of approval. Hedera, which has been under review for a spot ETF since 2024, could benefit from an increase in approvals that would expand U.S. investor access. Additionally, Hedera’s reputation in the enterprise sector, governed by reputable council members and involved in real-world finance initiatives like SWIFT panels and public-sector pilots, supports positive sentiment and keeps HBAR relevant as institutions seek scalable, low-cost settlement solutions. Elliott Wave & Wedge Patterns Flag Upside Continuation On the daily chart, HBAR completed a double bottom at approximately $0.205 (on September 5 and 26), with a neckline around $0.255. Price action has since contracted into a falling wedge lasting over 10 weeks, often a sign of upcoming breakouts, while analysts view the move as Wave 2 within an Elliott Wave cycle that started with a 140% surge from late June to late July. A shift into Wave 3, typically the longest and most impulsive phase, would bring the year-to-date high of about $0.3065 into focus, with potential to challenge last November’s peak of around $0.40 if momentum broadens. Market internals are also improving, with a rising Chaikin Money Flow indicating steady net inflows. A move above $0.242–$0.248 could trigger approximately $32 million in short liquidations, fueling any upside breakout. HBAR's price trends upside on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview Hedera Key Levels to Watch: $0.22 Support, $0.30 Resistance, and $0.40 Target The near-term structure remains tight. Traders need a clear close above $0.230–$0.242 to confirm a wedge breakout; reaching $0.248 could trigger forced short exits, boosting gains. Breaking above $0.30 would confirm the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and support the Elliott Wave projection toward $0.3065, then $0.35–$0.40 as market breadth improves. Related Reading: No Accident: The Powerful Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Late-September Rally On the downside, $0.205 serves as the main invalidation level.

Government Shutdown To Drag On, Polymarket Bettors Predict According to the poll titled “When Will The Government Shutdown End,” 43% of participating bettors believe that October 15 is the earliest date the U.S. government shutdown will end. Meanwhile, 35% of Polymarket bettors believe that the shutdown will come to a close between October 10 and October 14. October 6 through October 9 trails behind at 20% of the vote, followed by October 3 and October 5 with just 3% of the vote. Congressional Deadlock Continues With No End In Sight News of the Polymarket poll’s latest figures comes just one day after the U.S. government officially entered a shutdown after both Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on government spending bills. The congressional deadlock continued on Thursday following a failed vote on Wednesday that would have effectively ended the shutdown, leaving no end in sight to the political dysfunction. “…The president has directed his cabinet, and the Office of Management and Budget is working with agencies across the board to identify where cuts can be made, and we believe layoffs are imminent,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an October 1 statement. Meanwhile, key players in the crypto sector have urged U.S. lawmakers to work together in a bid to keep key policy initiatives from stalling. On Wednesday, leading crypto trade group the Blockchain Association took to social media to push members of Congress to find common ground and keep their “foot on the gas.” 1/ Bipartisan momentum is building in Washington around digital asset policy.

The meme coin has reclaimed a key 5-month breakout setup from near invalidation, rising over 7% since the start of the month and showing no signs of slowing down. Derivatives traders are leaning into the move. Coinglass data shows open interest up 10% to $200 million, a level last seen during September’s rally. Shiba Inu open interest surges.

Still, it remains widely sidelined from major market narratives like TradFi. Its open interest lags behind rival PEPE’s $600 million, underscoring the underdog position SHIB carries into the quarter. Shib Price Prediction: SHIB Could Be the Sleeper Pick This early-month rebound affirms the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle forming since May, now nearing its apex as momentum indicators flip bullish. SHIB / USDT 1-day chart, symmetrical triangle sets focus on breakout move. Source: TradingView. The RSI has reclaimed the neutral line, signaling buyers are driving the move. The MACD histogram shows a similar potential trend shift, closing in on a golden cross above the signal line that could mark the start of a lasting mid-term uptrend. The key threshold for a Shiba Inu price breakout sits at $0.0000145, a stubborn resistance level that has capped upside since July. A successful flip of this level into support would confirm the breakout, setting sights on $0.000025 for a potential 90% surge from current levels. But if Shiba Inu manages to claim a bigger share of the market narrative, particularly through new SEC listing standards qualifying it for spot ETPs, demand could expand dramatically. In that case, the rally could extend toward $0.00005, a milestone that would represent a 300% gain. It Took SHIB 5 Months to Get Here – Here’s a More Strategic Play Breakouts are rare for a large altcoin like Shiba Inu.

Bill targets high-usage miners with tiered excise rates to fund energy assistance. Tax ranges: 2¢/kWh (2.25–5M kWh) to 5¢/kWh (above 20M kWh); sustainable-energy miners exempt. Research cited estimates $79M added annually for individuals and $165M for small businesses in statewide electricity costs. New York Bitcoin miner tax proposed to fund energy aid; learn how the tiered excise works and who is exempt. Read the bill summary and implications now. What is the New York Bitcoin miner tax proposal? New York Bitcoin miner tax is a proposed excise on proof-of-work crypto mining under Senate Bill S8518 that charges miners 2¢–5¢ per kilowatt-hour based on consumption tiers and directs proceeds to Energy Affordability Programs to reduce bills for low- and moderate-income households. How would the excise rates and tiers work? Senate Bill S8518 sets tiered rates by annual consumption: miners using 2.25–5M kWh pay 2¢/kWh, 5–10M kWh pay 3¢/kWh, 10–20M kWh pay 4¢/kWh, and consumption above 20M kWh pays 5¢/kWh. Operations using verified sustainable energy are exempt , incentivizing cleaner power use while raising funds for utility relief. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/new-york-bitcoin-miner-tax"" }, ""headline"": ""New York Proposes Excise Tax on Bitcoin Miners to Fund Energy Assistance"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""New York lawmakers propose an excise tax on proof-of-work miners under Senate Bill S8518; funds go to state Energy Affordability Programs to offset higher utility costs.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How the proposed excise tax on Bitcoin miners would be applied"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step outline of how Senate Bill S8518 would assess and allocate the excise tax on proof-of-work mining operations."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Measure annual electricity consumption"", ""text"": ""Regulators calculate a miner's annual kWh usage to determine the applicable tax tier."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Apply tiered excise rate"", ""text"": ""Apply 2¢/kWh, 3¢/kWh, 4¢/kWh or 5¢/kWh based on the consumption bracket defined in the bill."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Verify sustainable energy status"", ""text"": ""Exclude operations that demonstrate use of verified sustainable energy from the excise tax."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Allocate revenue"", ""text"": ""Direct collected funds to New York's Energy Affordability Programs for low- and moderate-income households."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Who introduced the bill to tax Bitcoin miners in New York?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Democratic Senator Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Anna Kelles introduced Senate Bill S8518 to impose an excise tax on proof-of-work crypto miners in New York."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which miners would be exempt from the proposed tax?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Mining operations that demonstrate use of sustainable energy would be exempt from the excise tax under the proposed bill."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How will the tax revenue be used?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Revenue from the excise would be directed to New York's Energy Affordability Programs to provide assistance to low- and moderate-income households and reduce utility burden."" } } ]} Why are lawmakers proposing a tax on proof-of-work miners? Lawmakers say high-power crypto mining increases statewide electricity demand and can push up utility costs for residents and small businesses. The bill references research estimating an additional $79 million annually in costs for individuals and $165 million for small businesses tied to cryptomining-related rate impacts. What are the fiscal and policy implications? The excise would create a direct revenue stream for energy assistance while encouraging miners to switch to sustainable power to avoid taxation. State regulators would need to implement measurement and verification protocols for energy consumption and renewable sourcing. The proposal follows New York’s historically stringent regulatory stance on crypto operations. Frequently Asked Questions How much would the tax cost a typical large mining operation? Tax liability depends on annual kWh use. For example, a facility consuming 15 million kWh would face 4¢/kWh, resulting in $600,000 in excise payments annually under the proposed rates. Will this bill affect AI or other high-performance computing centers? The bill focuses on proof-of-work crypto mining and does not impose the excise directly on AI data centers. A bill release noted broader growth in high-power computing but did not include AI-specific levies in the current text. Key Takeaways Tiered excise: Senate Bill S8518 proposes 2¢–5¢/kWh based on annual consumption brackets. Exemptions: Verified sustainable-energy mining operations would be exempt to encourage cleaner power. Revenue use: Proceeds would fund New York’s Energy Affordability Programs to reduce utility costs for vulnerable households. Conclusion New York’s proposed Bitcoin miner tax aims to make high-energy proof-of-work operations contribute to utility relief funds while promoting sustainable energy adoption. Stakeholders — from mining firms to state regulators — will watch for implementation details, verification standards, and the bill’s legislative progress.

Yes. When megaphone formations are paired with rising volumes on breakouts and defended support levels, they can precede sustained rallies. Confirmation requires higher-than-average buying volume and macro stability. What indicators are most useful to track this setup? Volume, RSI, and moving averages are useful. Volume confirms breakouts, RSI gauges momentum (currently ~55), and moving averages help identify trend alignment and dynamic support. Key Takeaways Structure: Ascending megaphone with higher highs and lows supports a bullish view. Supports: $0.16 and $0.19 have been defended and validate the trendline. Actionable insight: Watch for volume-backed breakouts and RSI trends before committing to long positions. Conclusion This technical review of Dogecoin shows an ascending megaphone structure reinforced by defended supports and repeated accumulation cycles since 2023.

Morpho vaults on Cronos bring on-chain DeFi lending to Crypto.com users, with support for US users and vault launches expected this year. Crypto.com integrates Morpho on Cronos for stablecoin lending Users can deposit wrapped ETH/BTC (CDCETH/CDCBTC) and borrow stablecoins to earn yield via Morpho vaults. Morpho is the second-largest DeFi lending protocol with ~ $7.7B TVL (DeFiLlama); similar Coinbase integration reported yields up to 10.8%. Crypto.com Morpho lending on Cronos enables wrapped BTC/ETH deposits to borrow stablecoins and earn yield — learn how vaults work and what it means for stablecoin yields. Crypto.com is adding Morpho lending to Cronos, enabling wrapped BTC and ETH deposits as collateral to borrow stablecoins and capture DeFi yields via Morpho vaults. What is Crypto.com Morpho lending on Cronos? Crypto.com Morpho lending on Cronos is an integration that lets users deposit wrapped Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) tokens on the Cronos chain into Morpho-managed vaults to borrow stablecoins and earn yield. The feature embeds Morpho’s peer-to-peer lending overlays into Crypto.com’s platform for in-app DeFi access. How does Morpho’s stablecoin lending work on Cronos? Morpho matches lenders and borrowers on top of existing lending markets (e.g., Aave, Compound) and will open stablecoin lending markets on Cronos. Users deposit wrapped assets such as CDCETH and CDCBTC, then borrow stablecoins against them to earn yield from lending spreads and optimized routing. Industry data shows Morpho has grown rapidly, with a total value locked (TVL) of around $7.7 billion, per DeFiLlama. Coinbase’s similar integration cited potential yields up to 10.8% for on-chain USDC lending versus ~4.5% holding rewards on-platform. Total value locked on DeFi lending protocols. Source: DeFiLlama Why does wrapped crypto matter for Cronos lending? Wrapped tokens (CDCETH, CDCBTC) mirror value from their source chains and enable ETH/BTC liquidity to be used on Cronos without native chain transfers. This brings deeper collateral options to Cronos DeFi markets and expands on-chain lending capacity for Crypto.com users. Will US users have access to these vaults? Yes. Morpho’s co-founder confirmed the protocol will be accessible to US users. The Genius Act (July 2025) bans interest-bearing stablecoins but does not explicitly prevent exchanges or platforms from offering lending-derived yields, a distinction Morpho and Crypto.com cite to support access. Frequently Asked Questions Can I deposit wrapped ETH or BTC and earn yield on Crypto.com? Yes. Crypto.com’s Morpho integration will allow deposits of wrapped ETH and BTC (CDCETH/CDCBTC) into Morpho vaults on Cronos, enabling users to borrow stablecoins and capture lending yield while remaining on the platform. How much yield can users expect from Morpho vaults? Yields vary by market conditions. Industry integrations (Coinbase) reference potential on-chain lending yields up to 10.8% for USDC in some markets, while platform holding rewards can be lower (around 4.5%). Actual yields depend on supply/demand and onchain rates. Does the Genius Act prevent exchanges from offering these lending services? No. The Genius Act bans interest-bearing stablecoins but does not explicitly bar crypto platforms from offering lending services where users borrow or lend stablecoins. Legal interpretations may evolve, and platforms cite that lending is a distinct activity from stablecoin reserve yields. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/crypto-com-morpho-cronos"" }, ""headline"": ""Crypto.com Integrates Morpho Lending on Cronos to Enable Wrapped BTC/ETH Stablecoin Yields"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a664-5c45-7e93-a04d-e9c96d35cc82.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Crypto.com adds Morpho lending to Cronos, enabling wrapped BTC/ETH deposits to borrow stablecoins and earn yield through Morpho vaults accessible to US users.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can Crypto.com users lend wrapped assets via Morpho on Cronos?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Bitcoin, the $2 trillion giant of the crypto sector, is currently trading about 4% under its record peak of $124,128. It climbed 2% overnight, matching the 2% uptick in overall crypto market capitalization, which now sits at $4.19 trillion. October, often dubbed “Uptober,” has historically been among Bitcoin’s strongest months, boosting the odds that new all-time highs are on the horizon for multiple leading assets. Meanwhile, U.S. policymakers are providing additional momentum. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first federal statute to clearly regulate stablecoins, mandating full reserve backing. Soon after, the SEC rolled out Project Crypto , a sweeping update aimed at aligning securities regulation with digital assets. With clearer guardrails forming, analysts suggest this next altcoin rally could eclipse the 2021 cycle. Should Gemini’s outlook hold, XRP, Pi Network, and Shiba Inu may lead the charge. XRP (Ripple): Gemini AI Forecasts Significant Surge to $5 Gemini’s models predict Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb up to $5 by late 2025, a roughly 68% surge from its current price of $2.98. XRP has already shown notable strength this year. On July 18, it spiked to $3.65, surpassing its 2018 high of $3.40, before sliding nearly 18% amid global political and economic headwinds. Ripple continues expanding its international payments network, gaining institutional traction. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund recognized XRP as an affordable remittance option for emerging markets. Source: Google’s Gemini It also scored a huge legal victory: the SEC abandoned its lawsuit in early 2025, following a 2023 court ruling that retail XRP sales were not securities. Gemini’s outlook suggests that breaking decisively above July’s high could set XRP on course for $5 by year-end, although other LLMs like ChatGPT posit a more aggressive bull-case run, potentially lifting it into the $7–$20 range. Over the last 12 months, XRP has surged 404%, quadrupling Bitcoin’s 94% gain and Ethereum’s 79% climb. Technical signals are also supportive, with three bullish flag formations this year pointing to possible strength in Q4. While recent Fed rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF failed to spark a breakout. Upcoming XRP ETF rulings in the middle of the month, together with new US crypto legislation by Christmas, could serve as powerful catalysts. Pi Network ($PI): Gemini AI Expects Explosive 20x Growth From Mobile Mining Pi Network ($PI) pioneered the “tap-to-mine” model, allowing users to mine coins directly from their smartphones by simply logging in and tapping daily. Now trading near $0.266, Gemini outlines a scenario where Pi could rally to $5.20 before year-end, a 20× increase. With the team actively developing the ecosystem, several upcoming milestones could reinforce this bullish case. The network has been steadily rolling out updates, moving from version 19 to 23, with a possible mainnet launch ahead, developments that could act as strong price drivers. Since debuting in February 2025, Pi has been highly volatile, including a 171% surge in May. Its RSI has dropped to 30, suggesting undervaluation and room for a rebound, which means for believers, the best possible time to buy in is now. Retesting February’s $2.99 high is an ambitious but plausible target. Even if that doesn’t materialize, crypto’s historical October strength could still propel Pi toward the $1 mark by November, lining it up nicely for a festive bull run. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Gemini AI Predicts Up to 4× Upside in Bullish Conditions Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , launched in 2020, has positioned itself as Dogecoin’s fiercest rival, now boasting a $7.4 billion market cap. Trading around $0.00001242 after a 2% rise overnight, SHIB is moving broadly in line with the collective crypto space, although its high market cap limits it from enjoying the same success across the broader meme coin space, which rose 8.5% overnight to $81.7 billion in total value. Technically, SHIB has already broken out of both a falling wedge and a bullish flag this year. Clearing $0.000025 by November could set the stage for Gemini’s projection of $0.000032–$0.00005 by year-end, a 4× gain from current levels. SHIB’s RSI is currently at 51, reflecting a buy-in that is gathering pace as the rest of the crypto market lights green candles today. Beyond its meme coin roots, SHIB has expanded utility through Shibarium, its Layer-2 blockchain supporting fast, low-cost transactions, dApps, and added privacy, helping it stand apart from competing meme tokens. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Volatility Meme Coin Side Bet Beyond its main calls, Gemini has also flagged rising interest in Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a speculative meme coin positioning itself as Dogecoin’s “amped-up cousin.” It appeals to traders hunting high-risk, small-cap plays alongside community-driven hype. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap project, Maxi Doge embraces meme culture and volatility. Since its launch, it has already raised $2.6 million within weeks. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI emphasizes grassroots growth, leaning on Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading contests, and future partnerships. Out of its 150.24 billion total supply, 25% is dedicated to a “Maxi Fund” for marketing and collaborations. Staking is already live, offering up to 127% APY, though yields will taper as more users join. Currently, presale tokens are available at $0.00026, with prices rising incrementally in future rounds. Investors can purchase directly through the Maxi Doge website using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

At its current price of $119,000, Bitcoin is just 4% under its record high (ATH) of $124,128 from August. At the same time, its dominance is slipping as attention shifts to high-performing altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have set fresh ATHs over the past year. This renewed momentum stems from two major policy moves out of Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. legislation providing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Shortly afterward, the SEC introduced Project Crypto , a sweeping initiative to modernize securities rules for the digital age. With optimism surging, XRP, Solana, and Cardano are emerging as strong contenders for accumulation ahead of what could be the next major bull cycle. Ripple ($XRP): Global Payments Leader and 2025’s Top Altcoin XRP ($XRP) surged to an all-time high of $3.65 on July 18 following the GENIUS Act’s approval, surpassing its prior 2018 peak of $3.40. It has since cooled to around $2.98, marking an 18% pullback from its top. The token’s appeal lies in its efficiency as a fast, low-cost cross-border payments network, positioning it as a credible alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Its reputation has been strengthened by endorsements from organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and growing adoption among U.S. financial firms. Ripple’s influence on policy was underscored when CEO Brad Garlinghouse participated in a White House crypto strategy roundtable earlier this year. The introduction of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, shows its ambitions to capture part of the rapidly growing stablecoin market. Momentum was crucially boosted after a 2023 court ruling clarified that retail sales of XRP were not securities, marking a crucial win in its longstanding battle with the SEC and freeing its price to hit multi-year highs. Over the last 12 months, XRP has surged 404%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 94% advance. Following its summer rally, it consolidated near $3 before dipping seasonally in September. Currently, XRP’s RSI is trending upward from 45 yesterday to around 54 as of this writing, indicating investors are rapidly buying back in. Although rate cuts and the greenlight for the first spot XRP ETF failed to deliver an immediate breakout, likely because markets had already priced them in, the presence of multiple bullish flag formations and a wave of pending ETF rulings in mid-October could propel XRP toward $6 or beyond. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Chief Challenger and This Week’s Breakout Large-Cap Solana ($SOL) continues to shine as one of the most scalable and cost-efficient blockchains. Its market cap now exceeds $123 billion, with more than $12.27 billion in total value locked (TVL) per DeFiLlama, underscoring its strength in DeFi adoption. Investor buzz is building around potential U.S. approval of Solana spot ETFs next month, which could attract institutional money in the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have. After bottoming at $100 in April, SOL has rebounded strongly to $226.50. Technical analysts spotted cup-and-handle patterns throughout August and September, signaling bullish momentum. Its 12% rise in seven days makes Solana the fastest growing among the top fifteen projects this week. With regulatory clarity improving, Solana is well-positioned to benefit. Its RSI is at 55 and climbing, and the price has converged with its 30-day moving average after spending a few days trading beneath it, indicating strong consolidation. Support levels hold around $150, with major resistance near $250; breaking that could set up a fresh rally. Revisiting its previous ATH of $293.31, or even stretching toward $400, looks feasible before the close of 2025. Cardano ($ADA): The Eco-Friendly Smart Contract Platform Targeting 2026 Growth Cardano ($ADA) remains among the most resilient altcoins, with 2025 showing it still holds investor confidence. Over the past year, ADA has climbed 144%, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Solana. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano focuses on sustainability and scientific rigor, employing a Proof-of-Stake consensus model and peer-reviewed research. Its design even influenced Ethereum’s own roadmap. With a market cap of $31.1 billion, ADA would need to triple to catch up with Solana and seriously rival Ethereum’s dominance. Trading near $0.8533, ADA notched an 8.4% gain over the week. Supportive macroeconomic and political developments could send it toward $1.50 this fall and potentially back to its $3.09 ATH by year-end. However, even if US regulators don’t deliver, sustained growth at this pace would at least help it to hit $2. Technically, ADA formed a bullish falling wedge between December and April. This is typically a precursor to a substantial breakout, but it has yet to materialize for Cardano. Key resistance stands near $1.15, with a strong support base in the $0.85–$0.90 range. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Meme Flavoured Bitcoin Layer-2 and One of 2025’s Best Crypto Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the year’s standout presales, designed to pair Bitcoin’s security with Layer-2 scalability while tapping into meme culture and community-driven governance. The project’s goal is to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities by offering faster transactions, smart contract support, and decentralized governance. So far, its presale has raised over $19.8 million, with analysts predicting potential 10× or greater returns after launch. HYPER is built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), allowing ultra-low-cost smart contracts and a Canonical Bridge for instant Bitcoin transfers, dApps, meme tokens, and payments. A recent security audit by Coinsult found no vulnerabilities, further boosting trust among investors. The native HYPER token fuels the ecosystem through staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early buyers can currently earn up to 60% APY in staking rewards, while also gaining voting power once governance becomes active.

What is SB 2850 and why did Ted Cruz block it? SB 2850 is a Senate privacy bill intended to curb data brokers from selling sensitive personal information. Senator Ted Cruz objected, saying the bill as written could impede law enforcement access to critical data and needs refinement to protect public safety while limiting broad data exposure. How does SB 2851 differ from SB 2850?

Texas Senator Ted Cruz objected to Senate Bill 2850 , a bipartisan proposal by Senator Ron Wyden to restrict data brokers from selling sensitive personal information broadly to the public. Cruz said the bill needed refinement to preserve law enforcement tools used to locate convicted and suspected violent offenders. The vote drew attention because Cruz was the lone senator to formally object on Wednesday. He clarified he supports expanding privacy protections broadly where practicable, but said the current text risks unintended public-safety consequences. Wyden introduced SB 2850 to curb the sale of names, home addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive data that can be bought by “anyone with a credit card.” Wyden argued the data fuels stalking, targeted violence, and doxxing. Cruz also blocked a narrower follow-up, SB 2851 , intended to protect federal lawmakers, state officials and staff, and survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. He cited the same concerns and offered to work with Wyden to find language that balances privacy and investigatory needs. Source: Freedom of the Press Privacy debates intensified in the wake of several high-profile attacks. Recent calls to expand protections followed the fatal home attack on former Minnesota Representative Melissa Hortman in June. The FBI believes the alleged assailant located Hortman’s address through data broker records. Members of the crypto community have also been targeted. A public database managed by Bitcoiner Jameson Lopp lists over 50 attacks on people or families holding crypto in 2025, many involving perpetrators using online data to find victims’ homes. How could Congress refine these bills to protect privacy and safety? Lawmakers can refine privacy bills by including narrowly tailored law-enforcement exceptions, strict audit and warrant requirements, and defined categories of protected data. Senator Cruz signaled willingness to collaborate on language that preserves investigative access while reducing mass data exposure. Comparison: SB 2850 vs SB 2851 Feature SB 2850 (Broad) SB 2851 (Narrow) Scope All Americans’ data Lawmakers, officials, and certain survivors Primary aim Limit data broker sales to public Extend protections for specific high-risk groups Law enforcement carve-outs Not explicit enough per objection Also deemed insufficient by objector Frequently Asked Questions Why did Ted Cruz block SB 2850? Cruz blocked SB 2850 because he believes the bill, as drafted, may restrict law enforcement access to data used in locating violent offenders and protecting children. He called for clearer, practicable exceptions and offered to work on revisions. Will blocking SB 2850 stop privacy reform in Congress? Blocking the bill delays immediate enactment but does not end reform momentum.

Conclusion Senate debate over SB 2850 and SB 2851 highlights the challenge of protecting Americans from data-broker exposure while preserving investigative tools. COINOTAG will monitor negotiations as Senators pursue precise language to secure privacy without compromising public safety.

The banking network is now testing blockchain-based payments with over 30 major institutions across 16 countries. While this may seem like competition, it actually validates Ripple’s early lead in the space. Swift announces new blockchain-based ledger with 30+ banks. At Sibos, Javier Perez-Tasso, Swift CEO, revealed plans to build a blockchain-based shared ledger to enable instant, 24/7 cross-border payments.

With several spot XRP ETF applications approaching key deadlines between October 18 and 25, 2025 , bullish momentum continues to build for XRP. XRP Price Prediction: RSI Sends Buy Signal After $2.70 Support Bounce XRP has gone up by 6% in the past 7 days as the crypto market has started to recover from its latest pullback. Macroeconomic conditions support a bullish XRP price prediction , with the Federal Reserve widely expected to deliver a second rate cut this month. XRP has just bounced off key support at $2.70 , while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has flashed a fresh buy signal – crossing above both the mid-line and its 14-day moving average. If momentum continues building, XRP could quickly retest the $3.40 resistance. A confirmed breakout above that level may trigger a rally toward $5 , representing a 66% upside in the near term. While there may be uncertainty around XRP’s long-term outlook, early-stage presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are gaining traction. By combining Solana-level speed with Bitcoin’s security, it could be one of the cycle’s most promising plays. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Brings Solana-Level Transaction Speeds to Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces the first Bitcoin Layer 2, designed to fix BTC’s biggest flaws – slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability. While Bitcoin remains the world’s most recognized cryptocurrency, its network still handles only about 7 transactions per second. Solana, on the other hand, can process up to 65,000. The difference is massive. Bitcoin Hyper aims to close that gap by integrating Solana’s technology into a low-latency Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. This unlocks faster transactions, lower fees, and support for smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps—all secured by Bitcoin’s robust network. Early buyers have a chance to secure $HYPER at the lowest price before the next presale stage kicks in. To buy $HYPER, simply connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ) on the Bitcoin Hyper official website . You can either swap crypto (USDT, ETH, etc.) or use a bank card to invest. Buy $HYPER Here.

Bitcoin’s dominance has surged above 52% heading into October 2025, reinforcing its position as the anchor asset while capital rotation into altcoins slows. For many analysts, this “final rotation” phase historically precedes a new surge in altcoin activity once Bitcoin consolidates at elevated levels. Yet even as Bitcoin’s dominance rises, attention is shifting toward the meme coin sector, where Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue their high-stakes rivalry. Alongside these giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a fast-rising contender , backed by viral community momentum and early investor confidence that position it as a fresh challenger in the meme coin landscape. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin Holds Its Ground Dogecoin remains the dominant force in the meme coin market, trading near $0.24–$0.25 . Despite volatility across broader markets, DOGE has sustained one of the strongest community and liquidity bases in crypto. Large holders have been accumulating aggressively, with whale addresses adding over 680 million DOGE in September alone . DOGE Tradingview Technically, analysts highlight $0.25 as the key breakout level. A clean move above this zone could open the door toward $0.28 in the short term , with ETF speculation and network upgrade discussions adding fuel to the bullish thesis. With a market cap hovering around $30 billion , DOGE is still the most liquid meme coin, offering institutional players and retail investors alike the security of scale. Shiba Inu: Innovation Amid Volatility Shiba Inu, priced near $0.000012 , has faced choppier price action compared to Dogecoin. However, the SHIB ecosystem has been actively working to differentiate itself through governance upgrades and new features. The community has rolled out DAO election frameworks and announced plans for an AI-assisted stablecoin slated for 2026. SHIB TradingView Despite recent struggles with burn rate efficiency and technical support levels, whales continue to signal confidence, purchasing over $1.6 million worth of SHIB in the past month. Analysts argue this underlying demand, paired with long-term innovation, positions SHIB as a credible rival despite short-term volatility. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Meme Coin Disruptor While Bitcoin dominance crosses 52% and the meme coin rivalry between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu intensifies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing early buyers eager for exponential returns . Already over $15M in raised funds, its community-driven momentum is pushing it into the spotlight as the best new meme coin play for 2025. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE’S distinction comes from its viral community energy with scarcity-driven mechanics. Its model echoes Bitcoin’s ethos of limited supply while also imitating Ethereum’s programmability features. This combination drives traders searching for the next disruptive meme coin beyond DOGE and SHIB. Analysts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s positioning within the meme coin sector gives it a unique opportunity to capture retail excitement just as Bitcoin’s dominance begins to plateau. With whale activity already showing signs of accumulation and its global community expanding rapidly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the most-watched contender for 2025. Final Thoughts: A Market Poised for Rotation Bitcoin’s dominance above 52% sets the tone for October 2025, but it is the meme coin sector that is providing some of the most dynamic storylines. Dogecoin’s entrenched liquidity, Shiba Inu’s ongoing ecosystem innovations, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive rise combine to form a market narrative that could define the next stage of altcoin rotation. For investors, the lesson is clear: while Bitcoin continues to anchor portfolios, the battle for meme coin leadership — and the rise of new entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE — offers one of the most exciting opportunities heading into 2026.

52586431,596020,1759446021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52586431.jpeg,Analyst Shares ‘Realistic’ XRP Price Prediction For 2025 – It’s In The Double-Digits,https://bitcoinist.com/realistic-xrp-price-prediction/,"The crypto market is full of bold claims, but one analyst is sharing a view that he calls both realistic and possible for the XRP price. The popular crypto commentator’s focus is on XRP and what its price might look like in 2025. At the center of his outlook is the idea that the right mix of factors could send the XRP price to much higher levels than it has seen in years. Jake Claver Predicts XRP Price Could Reach $10–$13 By Year-End The respected voice in the crypto community recently gave his thoughts on where XRP might be heading. In a video shared on X, Claver explained that clear market signals unfolding in the months ahead could drive XRP to a price between $10 and $13 by the end of this year. Claver’s main reason for this prediction is the expected approval of XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). According to him, once these funds are approved, they could bring in fresh streams of money and open new demand, helping XRP finally move into double-digit prices. Claver stated that October will be a key month, as the SEC may decide on the ETFs during that time. Institutional demand would start flowing in, and this added momentum could give the XRP price the strong push it needs to reach this forecasted $10–$13 price range. ETFs And Other Catalysts May Push It Even Higher While Claver sees ETFs as the main driver, he does not stop there. He explained that other factors could help XRP climb beyond the $13 mark, with possible highs reaching $20 or even $25 if conditions turn out to be more favorable than expected. Claver says the future looks promising for the XRP price because blockchain technology continues to improve. As XRP becomes more useful in everyday life, it will naturally attract more attention and demand from everyday traders, as well as institutions such as banks and investment firms that are beginning to enter the market. If blockchain upgrades continue, adoption increases, and institutions stay active in the market, XRP could realistically hit the $10–$13 range. Claver also noted that XRP’s journey isn’t just about reaching the price range. Investors watching both retail trends and institutional moves may find new opportunities as the market evolves. According to Claver, these trends make XRP a token worth following closely in the coming months. With the broader market involvement, he believes XRP could create more momentum, and if the trend continues, the token may climb to higher price levels in the months ahead. If everything aligns, the ETFs, technological progress, and rising adoption, then the XRP price has a real chance of moving significantly higher. His outlook is that a price of $10 to $13 is a reasonable and realistic target, but he does not rule out even more ambitious levels.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 23:00:21

However, fresh data from Binance shows that BTC’s gains barely outweigh the risks posed by the digital asset’s volatility. Bitcoin Maintaining A Risk-Reward Balance According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, latest data from Binance – the world’s leading cryptocurrency trading platform in terms of liquidity – suggests that BTC is currently maintaining a risk-reward balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Dynamics Shift As Binance Premium Signals Aggressive Longs Specifically, the Sharpe-like ratio on Binance currently stands at 0.18, a figure very close to neutral territory. To explain, a Sharpe-like ratio measures how much return an investment generates relative to the risk it takes, similar to the Sharpe ratio but often using adjusted benchmarks or risk measures. When the Sharpe-like ratio is above 0.5, investing in Bitcoin becomes attractive since the potential returns outweigh the risks. On the contrary, a negative reading of the ratio discourages investors from taking risks, since volatility exceeds returns. During 2024, when the cryptocurrency market was largely weak and volatile, the Sharpe-like ratio spent most of the time in the negative territory. In contrast, the ratio reached elevated levels, signaling a strong uptrend, at the beginning of 2025. Currently, the Bitcoin market is trading between the two extremes – the market is neither dangerous nor in a powerful uptrend. Notably, the market appears to be in a phase of equilibrium and accumulation, as it trades close to $119,000. Arab Chain added: The latest figures show that the 30-day average return stands at just 0.26%, highlighting that the market is not delivering outsized gains; investors entering now are likely to see only modest profits relative to risk. Meanwhile, 30-day volatility is around 1.37%, which indicates a natural, moderate level of price fluctuation – not excessively calm but not alarmingly unstable either. BTC Needs A Catalyst For Next Leg Up The CryptoQuant analyst added that the BTC market is currently awaiting a bullish catalyst or strong inflows to extend its uptrend. However, if the Sharpe-like ratio falls below zero again, then a period of price correction may follow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Momentum Indicator: Why 600,000 Transactions Threshold Matters Most On the flipside, the ratio sustaining above 0.5 for several days – coupled with a price breakout above the $120,000 to $122,000 range on healthy volume – would suggest a fresh upward trend for the top cryptocurrency by market cap. Recent on-chain data hints toward a potential rally setup for BTC. Notably, the short-term holder (STH) spent output profit ratio (SOPR) recently recovered slightly to 0.995. That said, Bitcoin must defend the important $90,000 support level to avoid entering a new bear market. At press time, BTC trades at $118,788, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

The token has been trading in the $2.90-3.00 range in recent days, showing resilience after months of consolidation. With momentum building across the market, many analysts believe XRP could be preparing for another push higher. Investor optimism isn’t limited to XRP alone. The broader market rebound has renewed attention toward high-upside opportunities, particularly in presale tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has been attracting speculation of exponential returns as investors look for the next breakout star. ETF approval anticipation Much of the current excitement around XRP stems from ongoing discussions about crypto ETF approvals. While Bitcoin ETFs have already made headlines with strong inflows, attention has turned to whether regulators will extend the same access to other major cryptocurrencies. An XRP ETF would be a game-changer, opening the door for large-scale institutional inflows and significantly boosting liquidity. Analysts argue that the very anticipation of ETF approval could provide fuel for XRP’s price in the coming weeks. Even without a formal announcement, the speculation alone has helped drive demand. Historically, markets tend to price in expectations before events, meaning XRP could see another leg up simply on the buzz surrounding potential approvals. Technical outlook for XRP From a technical perspective, XRP has managed to hold key support above $2.9, which analysts view as a bullish foundation. Resistance sits around $3.05, and a clean breakout above this range could set the stage for a run toward $4 or higher. Market observers note that XRP’s price structure has been tightening, with reduced volatility signaling an impending breakout. If ETF speculation coincides with this technical setup, traders believe a significant upward move could materialize quickly. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the 22,000% speculation While XRP dominates headlines, many retail investors are chasing more speculative plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is being touted as one of the boldest presale stories of 2025. Analysts have floated projections of up to 22,000% ROI if momentum continues and the token achieves broad adoption after listings. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its asymmetric profile: low entry cost with massive upside potential. Unlike XRP, which already carries a multi-billion-dollar valuation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still at the earliest stage of its journey, leaving room for exponential growth. Its rapid fundraising, surging community numbers, and comparisons to early breakout tokens have fueled a wave of demand from investors seeking the next moonshot. Comparing risk and reward The contrast between XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights the spectrum of investor strategies in 2025. XRP is seen as a relatively safer large-cap play, benefiting from institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and the potential ETF narrative. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, represents high-risk, high-reward speculation, where even small allocations could lead to outsized returns if the project delivers. Many traders are choosing to hold a mix of both: anchoring their portfolios with XRP for stability while using MAGACOIN FINANCE as a speculative hedge capable of generating life-changing gains. Conclusion XRP’s outlook remains closely tied to the ETF approval narrative. As speculation builds, the token’s steady trading near $3 suggests that buyers are positioning ahead of potential catalysts. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention for its staggering 22,000% ROI projections, making it one of the most talked-about presale tokens of the year. For investors, the choice between XRP’s institutional upside and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s speculative promise reflects the dual nature of today’s crypto market – one eye on stability, the other on exponential growth.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.3801 Market Cap $611.57M Trading Volume $9.95M Circulating Supply 1.612B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.3822 24-hour Low $0.3684 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.67% 50-Day SMA $0.3898 14-Day RSI 47.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.3966 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Flow is testing $0.38 resistance with bullish momentum backing the move. The daily MACD is nearly turning positive, and volume supports the breakout. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the daily timeframe for October 2, Flow is trading at $0.379, sitting just under the mid-Bollinger resistance at $0.380. The recent rebound off the lower band at $0.325 shows strength, and the MACD has nearly reached the zero line, suggesting momentum is shifting bullish. Daily volume has also picked up, with $1.08M in activity backing this push. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView If price secures a daily close above $0.380, Flow could extend toward $0.435, which aligns with the upper Bollinger band. However, rejection here risks a retest of $0.360, with deeper support remaining at $0.325. Traders looking for entry can consider accumulation at $0.372–$0.375, while the main profit zones lie between $0.405 and $0.435. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, Flow recently surged from $0.355 to $0.383 before stalling just under resistance at $0.380. The Alligator lines are widening upward, confirming the short-term bullish structure. The RSI sits at 67, just below overbought, showing strong buying interest but hinting that a short-term cooldown may occur. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Immediate support lies at $0.373–$0.368, where the moving averages are stacking. Holding this zone keeps the momentum intact, while a break below could drag the price back toward $0.363. If Flow pushes through $0.383, upside targets shift to $0.395–$0.400, which would align with the daily breakout attempt. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3769 BUY SMA 5 $0.3633 BUY SMA 10 $0.3572 BUY SMA 21 $0.3807 SELL SMA 50 $0.3898 SELL SMA 100 $0.3812 SELL SMA 200 $0.3966 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3812 SELL EMA 5 $0.3895 SELL EMA 10 $0.3941 SELL EMA 21 $0.3926 SELL EMA 50 $0.3872 SELL EMA 100 $0.3892 SELL EMA 200 $0.4270 SELL What to expect from Flow? Flow has entered a bullish phase after bouncing from $0.325, but the $0.38–$0.40 zone remains the main resistance barrier. Breaking above it could drive a move toward $0.435, while rejection risks a pullback to $0.368–$0.360 before another attempt higher. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow Flow is seeing a big rise in activity after LayerZero integration, with transactions up over 600%. It continues to support major consumer apps like NBA Top Shot while improving its developer tools through Flow EVM and protocol upgrades. Flow Blockchain just posted one of its strongest quarters yet, blending consumer-scale adoption with surging DeFi momentum.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-reveals-xrp-net-flows-battleline-heres-the-implication/,"XRP community member and game designer Chad Steingraber has outlined what he considers the two most critical factors influencing XRP’s price: capital flows and the pace at which they occur. His comments arrive at a time when XRP is struggling to maintain upward momentum following a decline below $3. After falling under this psychological level, XRP managed to hold support around $2.60 before rebounding slightly. According to Steingraber, recent exchange data highlights $2.68 as a significant threshold, where outflows have continued to exceed inflows. Despite this, he argued that XRP’s ability to remain stable at this level suggests the market may be forming a sustainable price floor. So Chad as ETFs roll out, inflows will invariably outpace outflows. At least initially correct? — JohnnyPicks (@JohnPicksStocks) September 27, 2025 The Role of Net Flows and Velocity In a recent exchange with traders on social media, Steingraber stressed that net flows alone do not fully explain price action. While net flows indicate whether more capital is entering or leaving, the rate and intensity of these movements, what he terms velocity, are equally important. For example, he noted that a rapid inflow of $1 billion within a day would likely create substantial upward pressure on price. By contrast, the same amount spread across an extended period might generate little impact. This distinction underscores why some assets react strongly to sudden bursts of buying, while others show muted price changes despite consistent inflows. Steingraber emphasized that both the direction of flows and the speed at which they occur must be considered when analyzing potential price movements. In his view, the balance between outflows and inflows, combined with how quickly capital shifts occur, will be decisive for XRP in the coming months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Anticipation of XRP ETFs His analysis comes as the market awaits regulatory decisions on several proposed XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Firms including Grayscale, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have applications pending with U.S. regulators, with rulings expected this October. Franklin Templeton is scheduled for a decision the following month. Recent reporting from journalist Eleanor Terrett confirmed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked ETF issuers for XRP and other digital assets to withdraw earlier filings due to new listing standards. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas clarified that the revised framework was anticipated and makes previous filings redundant. Although the exact launch timeline remains uncertain, industry observers consider approvals highly likely under the updated process. Optimism surrounding these products centers on expectations that they will attract significant institutional capital. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg recently suggested that XRP ETFs could draw as much as $5 billion in inflows during their first month of trading. Should such projections hold, Steingraber’s focus on the velocity of capital movements could prove highly relevant in determining how XRP reacts to a surge in institutional participation.

Repeating correction cycles have historically preceded major Bitcoin rallies. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $675M inflows over three days, signaling growing institutional adoption. Exchange reserves are at their lowest since 2018, limiting tradable supply and supporting upward pressure. Bitcoin price nears $118,643 with ETF inflows and shrinking exchange reserves pointing to a potential rise to $180,000—read COINOTAG’s analysis and projections. What is driving Bitcoin price toward $180,000? Bitcoin price is being driven by a mix of repeating historical correction patterns, strong spot ETF inflows, and declining exchange reserves that reduce circulating supply. These combined technical and fundamental signals increase the probability of continued upside momentum toward the $180,000 target. How have historical corrections shaped previous Bitcoin rallies? Chart studies show three prior correction-to-rally sequences where retracements of roughly 23–33% preceded multi-hundred percent advances. Technical momentum indicators, such as MACD crossovers and rising histograms, historically confirmed entries for sustained rallies. Bitcoin nears $118,643 as historical correction cycles, ETF inflows, and shrinking exchange reserves project a potential rise toward $180,000. Bitcoin’s historical corrections repeatedly fueled rallies, with the current cycle projecting a path toward $180,000. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $675M inflows in three days, boosting institutional support for BTC’s rally. Exchange reserves hit lowest since 2018, showing reduced supply and supporting Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Bitcoin’s path to $180,000 is being traced through a repeating cycle of corrections followed by sharp rallies. Chart analysis shows past retracements have acted as launchpads for more substantial upward moves. At the time of writing, Bitcoin traded near $118,643 with upward momentum fueled by institutional and retail participation. Why do repeating patterns matter for Bitcoin’s outlook? Repeating patterns matter because they indicate market participants responding to similar liquidity and sentiment dynamics across cycles. When corrections compress supply and technical indicators align, subsequent rallies can accelerate as FOMO and institutional buy-ins amplify price moves. How do ETF inflows and corporate purchases influence market strength? Spot ETF inflows and large corporate purchases add durable demand. Data shows spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows exceeding $675 million across three days, which reduces float available to retail sellers and supports higher prices. Japan-based Metaplanet increased holdings by 5,268 BTC (roughly $615 million), bringing its total to 30,823 BTC valued at approximately $3.33 billion. Large corporate accumulation narrows supply on exchanges and can materially change market depth. What role do exchange reserves play in price dynamics? Exchange reserves at multi-year lows mean fewer BTC are available for immediate sale. Historically, low on-exchange supply correlates with upward price pressure as demand outpaces available liquidity. Bitcoin’s Path to $180,000 History shows a repeating pattern: -23% → +200% -33% → +120% -31% → +150% Every major correction has been the launchpad for the next explosive leg up. If the cycle continues, Bitcoin could be eyeing $180,000+ next. pic.twitter.com/VVBCx70FIx — CryptoELlTES (@CryptooELITES) October 1, 2025 This repeating cycle demonstrates a structure where declines create conditions for higher growth. The current trajectory places Bitcoin above $116,000 with projections suggesting a possible rise toward $180,000. Analysts note that, if the pattern continues, the next major leg up could mirror earlier expansions. Source: AshCrypto (X) Technical indicators cited by Ash Crypto show a MACD line crossing above the signal line and positive histogram bars, suggesting strengthening momentum. These signals, combined with decreasing exchange reserves and institutional flows, underpin the bullish thesis without relying on speculation. How should traders and investors interpret these signals? Use a risk-managed approach: recognize historical patterns but confirm with momentum indicators and liquidity metrics. Institutional inflows and low exchange reserves are supportive, but volatility remains high and position sizing is critical. Frequently Asked Questions Can Bitcoin realistically reach $180,000 in the current cycle? Yes. Historical correction-to-rally patterns, significant spot ETF inflows of $675M over three days, and exchange reserves at 2018 lows create conditions that have previously preceded similar price expansions. Market confirmation comes from sustained inflows and technical momentum. What indicators confirm a valid breakout toward $180,000? Confirmations include sustained ETF inflows, continued decline in on-exchange reserves, MACD bullish crossovers, and rising trading volumes during advances. Multiple signals together reduce the chance of a false breakout. Key Takeaways Historical patterns : Past correction cycles have preceded large rallies and remain relevant to current expectations. Institutional demand : Spot ETF inflows and corporate purchases are reducing available supply and supporting price discovery. Liquidity squeeze : Exchange reserves at multi-year lows create upward pressure when demand increases; manage risk accordingly. Conclusion COINOTAG analysis finds that Bitcoin’s short-term outlook is constructive as historical correction cycles, $675M in spot ETF inflows, and collapsing exchange reserves align to support further gains toward $180,000. Monitor inflows, on-exchange supply, and momentum indicators for confirmation and manage positions with disciplined risk controls. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-path-to-180k"" }, ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Nears $118,643 as ETF Inflows and Low Exchange Reserves Point to $180,000"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-26.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T10:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T10:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin nears $118,643 as historical correction cycles, ETF inflows, and shrinking exchange reserves project a potential rise toward $180,000.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can Bitcoin realistically reach $180,000 in the current cycle?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

These three alts have also posted impressive gains, yet they may have only started rallying, with a wave of crypto ETFs set to hit the market very soon. The launch of such ETFs will boost demand and volumes massively, with the likes of XRP, Pepe and Dogecoin set to rally hard as 2025 reaches its conclusion. We provide each of these coins with price predictions, unpacking their technicals while also using their fundamentals to provide a forecast of where they could go soon. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – 24-Hour Gains Market Beginning of End-of-Year Rally XRP has risen to $2.98 today, providing a 1.5% gain in 24 hours and a 5.5% increase in a week. The altcoin also happens to be one of the best-performing major tokens over the last 12 months, during which it has posted a 404% return. Yet things are likely to get even better for the third-biggest cryptocurrency, not least because numerous XRP ETFs are likely to launch by the end of the year. This will boost demand for the token massively, as we’ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs over the past year or so. Also bullish is the fact that Ripple is one of the fastest-growing firms in crypto, having signed new partnerships , made acquisitions and expanded into new territories this year. Source: TradingView This makes for a very positive crypto price prediction for XRP, which we can see from its chart is bouncing from an oversold position. With its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) having been at mostly negative levels since August, now may be the time for XRP to rebound and rally once again. Combined with the launch of ETFs, this could push the XRP price up to $3.50 by the end of October, while it could even top $5 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Pepe ($PEPE) – Whale Buys Signal Incoming Push for New Record Highs Pepe has jumped to $0.0000059996 today, which means that it’s up by 4% in 24 hours and by 6.5% in the past week. The meme token is up by only 4% in the past year, which may be disappointing in relation to other coins, but this arguably indicates that it’s due a big leap. It may not be waiting on ETFs like other major alts, but PEPE continues to be a meme token of choice for whales, who have continued to accumulate the token in recent weeks. For instance, one whale bought 1.5 trillion PEPE only a few weeks ago , while another is sitting on a long PEPE position worth $18.5 million . This popularity bodes well for the end-of-year bull rally the market may witness, with PEPE’s chart today also showing the coin rebounding from undervalued positions. Source: TradingView We also see that PEPE could break out of the pennant it has been trading within since mid-July, and if it can decisively break through the $0.000010 barrier then a full-blown rally may develop. Combined with market-wide bullishness that could follow a wave of ETF launches, the PEPE price could reach $0.0000150 in the next few weeks, before closing the year at around $0.000050. Crypto Price Prediction: Dogecoin ($DOGE) – ETFs and Institutions Will Push Meme Token to New Highs by December Dogecoin is another token that has performed very well today, with its climb to $0.2563 representing a healthy 5.5% increase in 24 hours, as well as a 10% increase in a week. DOGE is therefore carrying some promising momentum right now, which has been building over the past couple of weeks, after the launch of the REX-Osprey Doge ETF . And what’s bullish is that Grayscale, Bitwise and 21Shares are all close to launching their own DOGE ETFs, something which could boost institutional interest in the token even further. Looking at the token’s chart today, we see that now may be a very good time to buy the token, just as it starts a run towards higher levels. Source: TradingView Its primary technical indicators show that it has or is about to move out of an oversold position, while it also has plenty of space to rise before it risks any overbuying. Based on this, the crypto price prediction for DOGE is very positive, with the coin likely to pass $0.35 by the of October, before beating its ATH of $0.7316 in December. $1.5 Million and Counting: Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENDOE Creates Buzz During Presale Some traders looking to diversify their holdings may be interested in considering presale coins, which can rally strongly when they list for the first time. This is particularly the case if they’ve had a big sale and then gain some significant listings, with one of the most interesting presale coins right now being ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . Just as the legends predicted… A Virtual Mine-to-Earn platform in the palm of your hand. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/tOsvFJMgo4 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 1, 2025 PEPENODE has now raised over $1.5 million in its sale, which has been running for only a few weeks. This indicates its potential for growth in the future, and one of the main reasons why it looks promising is because it offers a novel use case. It bills itself as the market’s first mine-to-earn token, providing users with the chance to build their virtual mining rigs and earn rewards in popular meme coins (e.g. Pepe, Fartcoin). Holders can build their mining rigs by spending PEPENODE on additional virtual mining nodes, with more nodes equalling greater rewards. This should drive demand for PEPENODE, which holders can also stake for regular rewards. While the coin’s sale will end in the next few weeks, investors can still join by going to the PEPENODE website . The token is currently selling at $0.0010831, although this price will rise again tomorrow. Buy PEPENODE Here.

ETHZilla holds 102,000+ ETH and focuses on L2 yield strategies. ETHZilla converts treasury cash flows into additional Ether and L2 investments to amplify returns. Ethereum network shows $158 billion in stablecoin transactions (data source: DefiLlama, plain text). ETHZilla Ethereum treasury leads a corporate Ether pivot; learn how the firm deploys ETH to L2s for higher yield and long-term growth — read more now. What is ETHZilla Ethereum treasury? ETHZilla Ethereum treasury is a corporate treasury model where a formerly biotech public company holds significant Ether reserves and actively deploys capital into layer-2 protocols. The strategy prioritizes yield generation, infrastructure support, and long-term value capture driven by stablecoin activity and remittance flows. How does ETHZilla plan to generate higher yield than staking? ETHZilla reinvests cash flows from Ether holdings into a mix of L2 protocols and structured yield products. This includes liquidity provision, protocol partnerships, and staged investments designed to capture fees and incentive emissions while providing capital to emerging Layer-2 networks. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""ETHZilla shifts corporate treasury to Ether, targets L2 yields"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999d1c-68cc-71ec-94c7-21fdc2fa2a8a.webp""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""ETHZilla pivoted from biotech to an Ether-focused treasury, holding 102,000+ ETH and deploying capital to layer-2 protocols for higher yield and infrastructure growth.""} ETHZilla’s chief executive moved the public company into Ether reserves to capitalize on remittance flows and stablecoin activity, aiming to deploy assets into layer-2 protocols for higher returns than staking. ETHZilla CEO McAndrew Rudisill says the company pivoted to Ether after identifying opportunities in global remittances and stablecoin-led liquidity. The firm rebranded from Life Sciences Corp to ETHZilla Corporation and now ranks among the largest public Ethereum treasuries. Rudisill frames Ethereum as a primary conduit for global dollar-denominated value transmission, with layer-2 networks offering practical on-ramps for traditional finance applications. Since pivoting into Ether, ETHZilla Corporation has acquired over 102,000 tokens for its treasury. Source: StrategicEtherReserve Why is ETHZilla focused on layer-2 protocols? ETHZilla intends to scale value by deploying Ether into L2s that interface with traditional finance activities, such as structured credit and settlement rails. Layer-2s can offer higher APRs via incentives and transaction fee capture compared to passive staking. Rudisill emphasizes that investing in L2s simultaneously funds network growth and positions ETHZilla to earn protocol-level returns while expanding Ethereum’s utility for real-world assets. How large is ETHZilla’s Ether holding and how does it compare? ETHZilla holds over 102,000 ETH, placing it among the top public Ether treasuries. By comparison, the largest public treasury holds approximately 2.65 million ETH with a stated strategic target to control a meaningful share of supply. Source: ETHZilla The firm’s approach blends reserve accumulation with active deployment: selling a portion of ETH for operational capital, then reinvesting to buy more Ether and fund L2 initiatives — a compounding treasury model. When could ETHZilla’s strategy impact Ether price? Rudisill projects that Ether could rise substantially if stablecoin growth and L2 adoption tighten base-layer capacity. He notes price resistance levels and believes a breakout above intermediate thresholds could accelerate inflows and valuation expansion. Market context: Ether traded near $4,148 and has oscillated between $3,846 and $4,226 over the prior week, per CoinGecko (plain text mention). What broader market signals support ETHZilla’s thesis? Key on-chain indicators include high stablecoin transaction volume on Ethereum — reported at $158 billion by DefiLlama (plain text mention) — and growing corporate treasuries accumulating ETH. These signals suggest increasing utility and demand for settlement and liquidity on Ethereum. Frequently Asked Questions How does ETHZilla differ from a staking-only treasury? ETHZilla blends reserve holdings with active L2 deployments and business-building. Unlike staking-only treasuries, it pursues protocol partnerships and revenue-generating L2 products to achieve higher, diversified returns. Is ETHZilla’s pivot regulatory-dependent? Regulatory frameworks such as stablecoin legislation influence market adoption but ETHZilla’s strategy focuses on technology-led utility and treasury economics rather than short-term regulatory outcomes. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How does ETHZilla generate yield beyond staking?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""ETHZilla deploys Ether into layer-2 protocols, liquidity and incentive programs to capture fees and emissions, aiming for returns that exceed standard staking yields."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why is ETHZilla accumulating Ether?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The company views Ether as both a reserve asset and infrastructure stake, enabling deployments into L2s and real-world asset applications tied to global remittances and stablecoin use."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How ETHZilla deploys Ether to generate L2 yield"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step overview of ETHZilla’s approach to converting Ether reserves into L2 yield and infrastructure investments."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Accumulate Ether reserves"", ""text"": ""Acquire Ether to build a significant treasury base for deployment and to support network alignment."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Allocate capital to L2 protocols"", ""text"": ""Select L2 networks with credible teams and incentives; provide liquidity and structured funding."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Reinvest returns"", ""text"": ""Convert yield and operational cash flows back into Ether and additional L2 allocations to compound treasury growth."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Maintain treasury risk controls"", ""text"": ""Implement diversification, smart-contract audits, and governance oversight to manage counterparty and protocol risk."" } ]} Key Takeaways Strategic pivot : ETHZilla transitioned from biotech to an Ether-focused corporate treasury. L2-first deployment : The company targets layer-2 protocols to generate higher yields than staking. Market context : Stablecoin transaction volume and remittance flows are core demand drivers supporting ETHZilla’s thesis. Since its pivot into crypto, ETHZilla stock has registered a 44% gain year-to-date.

52588533,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-vs-stocks-which-is-the-better-investment-after-us-government-shutdown/,1759449480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52588533.jpeg,Crypto Vs. Stocks: Which Is The Better Investment After US Government Shutdown,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-vs-stocks-which-is-the-better-investment-after-us-government-shutdown/,"The U.S. government shutdown has cast a long shadow across financial markets, with delays in economic data and uncertainty in fiscal policy unnerving traditional investors. Stock markets have historically reacted negatively to such events, reflecting concerns about growth, spending, and debt sustainability. This time, however, crypto has emerged as a surprising safe haven for many. While equities waver, Bitcoin and leading altcoins have held firm, reinforcing the idea that digital assets can serve as an alternative hedge during institutional uncertainty. The difference between crypto and stocks is very important for regular investors who are deciding where to invest money after the shutdown. Stocks come with rules, dividends, and clear earnings, but they depend a lot on government stability and the overall economy. Crypto, however, gives people decentralization, worldwide access, and the chance for very high returns, but it also has more ups and downs. The discussion is no longer just about guessing versus traditional methods. It is about whether investors trust the old systems enough to depend on them when governments fail, or if they prefer the freedom of decentralized assets. This tension is now affecting how portfolios are built, with speculative projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE getting attention as investors look beyond the news. Stocks: Stability with Constraints The traditional investment has always incorporated stocks. They provide exposure to profit- and money-generating companies and they are protected by legislation and regulation. They are not as risky as crypto in normal economic times, offering regular income in the form of dividend payments. These characteristics continue to matter significantly for large investors. Yet they are by no means insulated against systemic risks. The shut down throws a spotlight on how much they rely on the functioning of government, fiscal policy, and global economic stability. Late releases in data hamper decision-making, political impasses can push uncertainty deep into equity prices, and for some, the attractiveness of equities rests on their predictability that falters when the institution that governs becomes a volatility source. Crypto: Independence And Asymmetry Crypto works outside these limits. Decentralized networks are not affected by government shutdowns, and money moves around the world at all hours. Bitcoin has become a safe choice against weakness in institutions, while altcoins offer chances to see new ideas and stories. For everyday investors, the outlook is in unequal opportunities: small amounts of money can earn much more than what stocks usually provide. Volatility is the trade-off. Sharp drops in crypto can unnerve investors who are unready, but big gains that are characteristic in this space can be a direct byproduct of such slumps. Under political instability, the self-governance of crypto becomes an asset, further bolstering an argument that it has a place in every modern investment portfolio. MAGACOIN FINANCE As The Speculative Edge The government shutdown has reignited debates about whether stocks or crypto offer stronger returns. Analysts point out that within crypto, presales often create the most dramatic wealth outcomes, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is the current name on everyone’s lips. It combines meme-driven branding with structured scarcity, echoing how DOGE and SHIB once turned small bets into fortunes. Analysts frame it as a generational wealth candidate , especially when balanced against traditional equities where gains are capped. While stocks may recover steadily, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being described as the kind of asymmetric bet that could change individual financial paths if momentum compounds. Portfolio Diversification Post-Shutdown The shutdown has shown how important it is to diversify. Depending only on stocks puts investors at risk from government actions, while putting everything into crypto can be very unstable. The strongest investment portfolios combine both types. Stocks provide steady income and regulation-backed confidence, while crypto provides independence and transformative upside. Adding speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE completes the mix, ensuring exposure across the risk spectrum. Analysts emphasize that such balance mirrors professional strategies. Institutions anchor in equities, expand into Bitcoin and Ethereum, and cautiously explore altcoins. Retail investors, however, often lean heavier into speculation. This divergence creates opportunities for those who manage to combine both approaches effectively. Conclusion The U.S. government shutdown has reignited the debate between crypto and stocks as investment vehicles. Stocks remain stable but tied to systemic risks, while crypto offers independence and asymmetric potential. For investors seeking both safety and growth, the best answer may not be one or the other, but both. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its audits, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and viral momentum, represents the speculative layer retail investors crave. As portfolios adapt to political dysfunction and market uncertainty, combining traditional equities, major cryptos, and presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE may prove to be the winning formula in the years ahead.

This growing enthusiasm stems from the perception of ETH as the epicenter of decentralized finance, tokenization and institutional adoption. As scaling solutions become available and interest from enterprises proliferates, Ethereum is viewed as critical infrastructure rather than a speculative investment. The projection is the result of both fundamental and technical analysis, anchored in developer, institutional, and investor fundamentals surrounding ETH and its potential. Even while Ethereum enjoys Institutional trust, retail traders are simply asking, Where can they find the exorbitant potential Ethereum no longer provides? Ethereum may still triple in value, but for retail investors used to tales of 25 or 50 times potential increases, this simply isn’t exhilarating. This discrepancy explains the hype surrounding speculative presales, as well as projects centered around memes. In Telegram channels and on X, one name overwhelmingly stands out, MAGACOIN FINANCE, regarded by retail communities as a cultural counterpart to Ethereum’s institutional seriousness. Why Analysts Target $5,000 For Ethereum There are many factors that will help Ethereum reach the $5,000 milestone. Ethereum is beginning to show its value beyond its native crypto uses, proof of which is the increase of tokenization pilots from large financial institutions. Scaling improvements across Layer 2 solutions are reducing transaction costs and expanding usability. And the steady inflow of developers ensures that Ethereum’s ecosystem remains the most vibrant in the industry. Chart watchers highlight that Ethereum’s resilience during recent volatility strengthens the bullish case. Every correction has been met with renewed accumulation, suggesting strong conviction among both retail and institutional investors. Combined with ETF demand, these factors create the foundation for a $5,000 target. Institutional Anchoring Vs. Retail Hunger Institutions are largely content with Ethereum’s steady trajectory. For them, 2× or 3× gains paired with credibility represent success. Retail investors, however, often crave exponential outcomes. They look for tokens capable of multiplying many times over in shorter periods. This difference in appetite fuels the divergence between where institutions allocate (Ethereum) and where retail speculates (presales, meme coins, and cultural tokens). Ethereum’s $5,000 target excites institutions, but retail traders often prefer to balance ETH exposure with bets on projects that feel more dynamic and culturally relevant. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Retail Buzz Ethereum’s $5,000 target has become a popular talking point, but retail investors are increasingly drawn to presales where returns can be far higher. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been generating buzz in forums and watchlists, with ROI models pointing to 1,500%–2,100% gains depending on how listings unfold. What makes it compelling is that it doesn’t compete with Ethereum but complements it, offering a high-reward play while ETH remains the infrastructure backbone. Traders are treating MAGACOIN FINANCE as the speculative echo to ETH’s institutional story. For those who see Ethereum as stable growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the opportunity to supercharge that thesis with pure ROI speculation. Retail Psychology And Cultural Momentum The buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE reflects a broader truth: retail investors thrive on cultural energy. Ethereum provides security, but meme-driven tokens provide excitement. Communities rally around tokens that feel alive, playful, and viral. That energy attracts capital, which then fuels the cycles of exponential growth retail investors seek. By combining legitimacy through audits with cultural stickiness, MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as one of the strongest retail narratives of 2025. The excitement isn’t just about price projections, it’s about belonging to a movement before it enters the mainstream. Balancing Portfolios In The Current Cycle The emergence of a $5,000 Ethereum prediction doesn’t diminish the importance of speculative plays. Smart investors structure portfolios to capture both sides: Ethereum as the stable institutional backbone, and projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as the speculative moonshots. This balance reduces downside risk while preserving access to transformative upside. Whales and retail alike are already blending such strategies. Capital anchored in Ethereum offers credibility, while smaller allocations into presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide optionality. In a cycle where narratives can change overnight, diversification across categories has become essential. Conclusion Ethereum’s $5,000 price target reflects confidence in its role as the backbone of digital finance. Its ecosystem growth, scaling solutions, and institutional adoption make it a clear long-term hold. Yet the retail conversation is broader. Investors want not only anchors like Ethereum but also speculative projects that can deliver exponential returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE , audited, scarcity-driven, and community-powered, fits that role. It embodies the retail buzz Ethereum cannot generate while providing the asymmetric potential institutions largely avoid. Together, Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE capture both sides of the current cycle, stability and speculation, credibility and culture.

After fueling the recent altcoin mini-season, the crucial ratio has stalled out completely, exhibiting 40 days of stagnation. With the main engine of the altcoin market now idling, the initial euphoria is fading, raising serious concerns about the stability and short-term future of nearly every asset outside of BTC. Is Ethereum Entering A Healthy Accumulation Phase? The powerful momentum behind altcoins has evaporated following the stagnation of the ETH/BTC ratio. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades has highlighted that after a monumental +150% run from its low against Bitcoin, ETH performance has completely stalled for the last 40 days. This pause immediately translates into palpable weakness across the board, with momentum-driven sentiment turning sour quickly as most altcoins start to retrace what they gained in the months prior. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Round 2? Analyst Forecasts Early October Rally Amid $4,200 Retest While altcoin traders prefer to see their tokens rally, the analyst views the current shift as a necessary and potentially healthy correction. He suggests that it’s beneficial that BTC is absorbing some of the bid and liquidity again as it works to pull the entire market out of its current slump consolidation. Daan Crypto Trades identifies the ETH/BTC ratio as being in “no man’s land” currently, adding that he would only regain interest in the pair if it moved back above the 0.041 level or a decisive retest of the 0.032 level. However, the expert concluded that whatever ETH does against BTC will remain the primary barometer for the overall health of the altcoin market and the BTC Dominance trend. Therefore, this key pair should be monitored closely. Reversal Signals Strengthen On The 4-Hour Chart Technical analyst GeoMetric is calling the end of the market slump, basing his bullish forecast on clear signals from his proprietary Gaussian Breakout screener. According to GeoMetric, BTC, ETH, and most Altcoins have all successfully broken out of their Gaussian channels on the 4H chart. The expert views this as a firm confirmation of a reversal, provided these assets can maintain their position above the mid-line of the channel. Related Reading: Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: ETH/BTC Ratio Climbs to Yearly Peak Amid Market Shift GeoMetric noted that BTC has flipped bullish on almost every major time frame except for the 3-day chart, which is the last holdout. Also, he has expressed his focus on the time frame for now. While considering this as a relief and great start to October overall, the market has finally turned the corner after a difficult week, characterized by liquidations, widespread capitulation, and generally terrible sentiment. He acknowledges the difficulty of maintaining a positive outlook when the market is collapsing. “As convinced as I was, it’s never easy bull posting amidst the FUD and asking everyone to hold the line, and it takes a lot out of me,” GeoMetric stated.

52586414,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85170,1759449607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Will Dethrone Bitcoin (BTC) By This Date Says Business Expert,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-will-dethrone-bitcoin-btc-by-this-date-says-business-expert/,"Cameron Scrubs, founder of Tradeship University, has added his voice to a growing group of market commentators making bold projections for XRP . In a recent post on X, Scrubs predicted that by the end of the decade, XRP will surpass both Bitcoin and Ethereum to become the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization. At present, XRP represents about 4.4% of the global crypto market, while Bitcoin dominates with nearly 60%. For XRP to achieve the scenario Scrubs describes, its share would need to expand dramatically, pushing it past the two largest digital assets within the next five years. Assessing the Feasibility The gap between XRP and Bitcoin remains substantial. Bitcoin currently holds a market capitalization exceeding $2.36 trillion, compared to XRP’s $177 billion. This $2.2 trillion difference highlights the steep climb XRP would face. Based on today’s figures, XRP would need to appreciate more than thirteen times its current value, trading at approximately $39, to reach parity with Bitcoin’s existing valuation. XRP Will Be #1 in terms of Market Cap by 2030 I’m leaving it all on the table. Bitcoin and Ethereum will be second to XRP. — Cameron Scrubs (@imcameronscrubs) October 1, 2025 However, this estimate assumes Bitcoin does not grow further, which many analysts believe is unrealistic. Several influential figures in the industry, including executives from Coinbase, Cardano, BitMEX, and Telegram, have suggested Bitcoin could approach $1 million by 2030. If those forecasts materialize, Bitcoin’s valuation could exceed $20 trillion. For XRP to match such a level, it would require a price above $335, a target that even many XRP supporters consider improbable within the decade. Scrubs’ optimism is not unique. XRP advocate Coach JV made a similar claim that XRP would eventually surpass Bitcoin. Still, other market voices urge caution. Influencer Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy, has argued that while XRP may see significant appreciation, Bitcoin’s dominance rests on its decentralized structure. In his view, XRP’s efficiency in transaction processing makes it an attractive asset, but Ripple’s large token holdings, estimated at more than 40% of supply, continue to raise centralization concerns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From Armstrong’s perspective, XRP could close the gap with Bitcoin but is unlikely to replace it at the top of the market. Instead, he sees XRP securing a stronger position by 2030 while Bitcoin maintains its lead. Possible Growth Drivers for XRP Despite skepticism, some industry watchers point to several factors that could drive XRP’s expansion in the coming years. Financial institutions and payment providers are already exploring XRP’s use in cross-border settlement, citing its transaction speeds of around seven seconds. Large-scale adoption in this area could provide meaningful demand for the asset. In addition, upcoming developments such as the anticipated Ripple initial public offering and the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by XRP are seen as potential catalysts for wider institutional interest. While Cameron Scrubs envisions XRP surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum by 2030, the data shows this outcome would be difficult. The enormous market cap gap, coupled with Bitcoin’s projected growth, makes such a shift unlikely within the next five years. However, developments such as institutional adoption, ETF approvals, and Ripple’s potential IPO could still elevate XRP’s role in the industry. Even if it does not become the number-one cryptocurrency, XRP has the potential to secure a far greater share of the market than it holds today.

52586434,595982,1759449641,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52586434.jpeg,$2B USDT Just Minted On Ethereum: Fresh Liquidity For Uptober?,https://bitcoinist.com/2b-usdt-minted-ethereum-fresh-liquidity-uptober/,"Ethereum continues to assert its dominance in the crypto market as another USDT mint bolsters its position as the leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. While Tron has long competed for stablecoin market share, Ethereum remains the chain with the highest USDT supply , now holding an impressive $78.5 billion worth of Tether onchain. This new mint underscores Ethereum’s critical role in the digital asset ecosystem. As the backbone for decentralized finance (DeFi), institutional flows, and exchange liquidity, the crypto giant consistently attracts stablecoin issuances that fuel both spot and derivatives markets. The growing supply also highlights its resilience as the network of choice for major issuers like Tether, despite higher transaction costs compared to other blockchains. The timing is especially important as the broader market transitions into a new phase. Bitcoin’s recent momentum has reignited optimism, and ETH appears to be following closely, supported by strong fundamentals. Analysts point out that stablecoin growth not only signals higher liquidity but also reinforces adoption across DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and tokenized assets. USDT Mint On Ethereum Sparks Uptober Hopes The market just received a major boost in liquidity after blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence reported that $2,000,000,000 USDT was minted on Ethereum. Large-scale mints of Tether are often interpreted as signals of incoming market activity, as they provide new liquidity that can flow into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Historically, similar events have preceded sharp price moves, as traders and institutions deploy stablecoin reserves into spot markets. Many analysts believe this fresh $2B injection could be the catalyst for the long-awaited “Uptober” rally. Uptober is a term widely used in the crypto community to describe Bitcoin and Ethereum’s strong seasonal performance in October. Data shows that October has historically delivered some of the best monthly returns for crypto, with multiple cycles marking the start of major bull runs during this period. Investors often anticipate this seasonal tailwind, creating a self-reinforcing momentum effect as capital enters the market. Ethereum’s role in this dynamic is crucial. As the primary chain for USDT issuance, Ethereum benefits directly from the increase in on-chain liquidity. Higher stablecoin balances on Ethereum often translate into greater activity across DeFi protocols, exchanges, and staking platforms, strengthening its position as the backbone of crypto adoption. If history repeats itself, this $2B USDT mint could mark the beginning of Uptober’s bullish phase—supporting not only Ethereum but the broader crypto market. Analysts will be watching closely to see how quickly this liquidity enters the system and whether it helps sustain upward momentum through October and beyond. Ethereum Pushes Toward $4,400 After Bounce Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $4,380 after staging a strong recovery from recent lows near $4,000. The daily chart shows ETH regaining momentum, with price breaking back above the 50-day moving average (blue) and testing the $4,400 resistance zone. This level is significant, as it marked repeated rejection points throughout September, and a decisive breakout could open the door to $4,600 and higher. The broader structure remains bullish. Ethereum continues to trade above the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) moving averages, which have acted as long-term support throughout 2024 and 2025. These moving averages reinforce the market’s upward bias, suggesting that the recent correction was more of a consolidation phase than the start of a broader reversal. Momentum indicators are also improving, with buyers stepping in aggressively after ETH briefly dipped below $4,100 last week. The sharp rebound suggests strong demand around that zone, and short-term traders will be watching whether $4,300 can now act as a support base.

Rome’s 2026 budget framework, signed off at an evening cabinet meeting, noted that the deficit would fall to 2.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) next year, maintaining the target set in April. “We are confirming the line of firm and prudent responsibility that takes into account the need to maintain public finance stability,” in compliance with European rules, Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said in a statement. The deficit is projected to further shrink to 2.6% in 2027, then to 2.3% in 2028, the government said on Thursday. Economic growth is expected to be modest, at 0.5% in 2025 and 0.7% in 2026, while public debt is forecasted to reach 136.4% of GDP by 2028. Exiting EU oversight could strengthen Meloni’s fiscal agenda Hitting the European Union’s 3% deficit ceiling this year could pave the way for Italy to exit the bloc’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), the EU’s monitoring system that flags countries with high deficits. Exiting the EDP would strengthen Premier Giorgia Meloni’s government’s fiscal position and give Italy room to increase defense spending, especially as it aims to meet NATO’s target of 5% of GDP for military outlays—a commitment underscored by US President Donald Trump. According to the finance ministry, the funds it has set aside for defense in the budget are conditional on leaving the EDP. Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti confirms that the new fiscal plan “confirms our firm and prudent approach.” The budget “takes into account the need to maintain public finances in compliance with the new European rules and the essential safeguards for the economic and social growth of workers and families,” he said in the statement. With cabinet approval secured, the focus now moves to parliament for ratification. Credit rating agencies may also respond, with S&P Global Ratings expected to provide an update next week and Moody’s Ratings in November. Fitch Ratings, meanwhile, issued its first upgrade for Italy since 2021 last month. The deficit figures form part of a broader 2026 budget plan aimed at delivering tax cuts for the middle class, supporting businesses that hire and invest, and assisting young families, all while maintaining a solid fiscal position. Since 2019, Italy hasn’t run a deficit at or below 3%. Hitting that level in 2025 — which nobody had predicted — contrasts markedly with France, where the deficit is set to remain above that limit for years to come amid ongoing political turmoil. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Italy had earlier criticized the EU’s fiscal rules, describing them as “old and outdated,” arguing they are unfair at a time when countries feel compelled to spend more on defense. Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, called the bloc’s current budget system “stupid and senseless” and noted it needed to be overhauled to give member states more leeway to boost military spending without fear of facing penalties. Investor confidence elevates Italy amid a fragile economic outlook Italy’s improved fiscal position is being pushed by considerably lower borrowing costs, partly fueled by investors’ enthusiasm for the unusual stability of her premiership and her government’s steady efforts at fiscal repair. Spreads between 10-year Italian bond yields and those of Germany stand near 80 basis points, less than a third of the level when Meloni assumed office in 2022. On the downside, the economy remains fragile, with the potential impact of US tariffs hard to calculate at this time. Italy is also hurt by the challenges experienced by the German economy, which is the country’s key trading partner. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Traders should watch $2,400 for buy-signal clusters and risk management opportunities. $4,700 is confirmed as a key resistance that halts Ethereum’s rallies. Sell signals cluster near $4,700 while buy signals appear at $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400 support zones. On-chain and chart-based indicators suggest a staged correction with potential rebounds at each support level. Ethereum resistance $4,700: watch for a pullback toward $3,300–$2,400; monitor signals at $2,400 for buys — read analysis and trade setup now. What is the $4,700 Ethereum resistance and why does it matter? Ethereum resistance at $4,700 is a repeated ceiling where upward momentum stalls, producing sell signals and shorter rallies. Traders treat this level as a decision point: a clean break could fuel continued gains, while sustained rejection raises the odds of a multi-step correction back to lower supports. How could Ethereum retrace toward $2,400 support? Price action shows staged downside targets. First support sits near $3,300, followed by $2,700, with $2,400 acting as a structural floor. Historical rebounds and current buy-signal clusters often emerge near these zones, suggesting a wave-like decline rather than a single collapse. Chart-based analysis and commentary from crypto analyst Ali Charts indicate this pathway as a plausible corrective scenario. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Ethereum Battles Tough $4,700 Resistance; Traders Eye Possible Pullback to $2,400"", ""description"": ""Ethereum resistance $4,700 may trigger a corrective move toward $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400.

Sell signals cluster near resistance while buy signals emerge at critical support levels. Ethereum could see a stepwise correction toward $3,300, $2,700, and eventually $2,400. Market snapshot: Ethereum is trading below the $4,700 ceiling at approximately $4,169. Mixed short-term momentum and recurring rejections place importance on lower support levels as potential stabilization points. Why has $4,700 held as a ceiling? Repeated attempts to clear $4,700 have failed, producing short-lived rallies followed by stronger selling. The level attracts liquidity and stop clusters, making it a focal point for both profit-taking and short entries. Technical signals near this band show increased selling pressure in recent sessions. What do key support levels tell traders? Support zones near $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400 have historically absorbed selling and produced rebound attempts. On-chain metrics and order flow typically concentrate buy orders around these bands. Traders can use these supports for staged entries and to measure the severity of any correction. How likely is a corrective phase and what could it look like? The current formation points to a corrective path rather than an immediate crash. Expect a wave-like descent with interim bounces around each support. A realistic path is a pullback to $3,300, a deeper move to $2,700, and a final test near $2,400 if selling momentum continues. Expert commentary and charting from market analysts (notably Ali Charts as a named analyst source) highlight the $2,400 scenario as plausible if the $4,700 ceiling persists. This view is data-driven and based on technical patterns and past support behavior. Is it crazy to think Ethereum $ETH could drop to $2,400? pic.twitter.com/nBpoDYwd4g — Ali (@ali_charts) September 30, 2025 Traders should prioritize risk controls: define stops, scale positions, and avoid assuming that a support test will automatically produce a full recovery. Use confirmations such as bullish reversal candlesticks, rising volume, or renewed on-chain accumulation before increasing exposure. Frequently Asked Questions Could Ethereum retest $2,400 within weeks? Short-term timing is uncertain, but the price path and resistance behavior make a retest plausible within a multi-week corrective phase if selling continues without a decisive breakout above $4,700. What indicators best confirm a bottom near $2,400? Confirmed bottoms typically show clustered buy volume, on-chain accumulation, diminishing sell pressure, and bullish reversal patterns on daily charts. Multiple indicators aligning increase confidence in a durable support. Key Takeaways $4,700 resistance : Acts as the current ceiling; failure to break increases correction odds. Staged supports : $3,300, $2,700, $2,400 are logical targets for pullbacks and potential entries. Trade management : Use confirmations and risk controls; watch signal clusters at support for buying opportunities. Conclusion Ethereum is confronting a decisive resistance at $4,700 that could trigger a stepwise correction toward $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400. Monitor technical and on-chain signals closely and employ disciplined risk management.

In 2025, three names dominate the conversation: BullZilla, the presale memetic engine rewriting tokenomics; Litecoin, the veteran altcoin that has weathered every cycle; and TRON, the decentralized infrastructure powering countless applications. Together, they represent three very different paths toward growth, speculation, stability, and scalability, yet all share a place in the hunt for extraordinary returns. The core tension lies in which route offers superior upside versus safety. At the heart of this analysis is the notion that BullZilla may be among the best presales with 100x potential 2025, a bold claim rooted in its tokenomics, incentives, and momentum. BullZilla: An Engine Built for Surprise BullZilla ($BZIL) commands attention by design. It is aggressively paced, marrying hype and mechanism. The presale is in Phase A of Stage 5 and has already raised over $760,000. The project boasts more than 2,400 token holders and 29 billion tokens sold. The current price in this stage is $0.00011241. Early participants enjoy an ROI of 1,854 percent already. If the listing target reaches $0.00527, the projected ROI from Stage 5A to listing surpasses 4,589 percent. That blend of metrics catapults BullZilla into most “best presales with 100x potential 2025” conversations. What truly reshapes incentives is the Mutation Mechanism. Whenever $100,000 is raised or 48 hours pass, the price increases. That structure forces participation, discourages waiting, and embeds upward momentum into the system. It is a central reason that many regard $BZIL among the best presales with 100x potential 2025. Every incremental investment matters, every delay risks missing a step. The Roarblood Vault further intensifies community engagement. It funnels referral rewards and loyalty bonuses through on‑chain logic, making every user a stakeholder in growth. That kind of design is why BullZilla is hailed among new crypto presale gems, early stage investments, and altcoins with hype. It’s not just virality for virality’s sake, it is engineered demand. Within presales this month or those curating an early presale watchlist, $BZIL stands out. A $1,000 position today converts into 8.8 million $BZIL tokens. With a forecasted 5.92 percent surge entering Stage 5B, time is pressing. That urgency, encoded by its mechanism, keeps BullZilla in lists of best presales with 100x potential 2025. For devs, analysts, and meme lovers alike, $BZIL is a living experiment in how tokenomics can warp behavior. No presale is risk‑free. Volatility, contract audits, liquidity challenges, or regulatory shifts could upend everything. Yet the structure here leans into possibility. In the narrative of 2025’s presale scene, BullZilla arguably belongs at the top of the best presales with 100x potential 2025 ladder. Litecoin: The Steady Baseline Litecoin trades today at $111.33, backed by its robust track record. It has survived countless cycles and continues to serve as a testing ground for payment infrastructure and technical experimentation. For those studying blockchain systems, LTC offers lessons in UTXO design, network upgrades, and durability. Litecoin rarely appears in lists of best presales with 100x potential 2025 because its profile is fundamentally different. It is not selling novelty or extreme upside. It offers relative stability in a high‑volatility domain. Analysts tend to view LTC as a control asset, a benchmark to test strategies against more speculative plays. From the perspective of those curating early stage portfolios or scouting next big altcoin candidates, Litecoin is not often the hero. Yet it remains a reference point for what “mature altcoin” means. Its role isn’t to compete with presales, but to provide contrast, stability, and long view continuity in markets swayed by hype. TRON: Ecosystem Power with Real Utility TRON’s price sits at $0.3412 today, supported by an active ecosystem of DApps, token protocols, and stablecoin activity. It is not a speculative gimmick; it is infrastructure. Developers build here because of scalable throughput, staking economics, and lower transaction costs. Users transact because of affordability. That makes TRON appealing to those following altcoins with strong demand. Though it doesn’t appear on presale rankings, TRON’s influence is felt across many projects that launch on it. In effect, TRON is a foundation layer for many memes, tokens, and protocols chasing high ROI outcomes. While TRON itself isn’t a presale, it underwrites many that aim to be among the best presales with 100x potential 2025. In comparisons of growth potential, TRON sits somewhere between stable maturity and speculative inflection. It is not chasing 100x in a month, but it creates pathways for tokens that aim to do just that. It also offers a measure of security, given its long presence and existing demand. Closing Reflection For Best Presales with 100x Potential 2025 In the race for 2025 dominance, Bull Zilla, Litecoin, and TRON offer three roads. The most hyped road leads to $BZIL, where mechanics and momentum weld together to create one of the most talked about projects in the best presales with 100x potential 2025 conversation. The steady road is Litecoin, proving that resilience and infrastructure still earn lanes. The infrastructural path belongs to TRON, powering many tokens behind the scenes and enabling the ecosystems that will host the next wave of innovations. Readers who watch, analyze, or build in crypto should track $BZIL closely. If it delivers on promises, it may validate many assumptions about how future presales are structured. But one must always balance zeal with caution. None of this is guaranteed. Knowledge, timing, and conviction matter more than dreams. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) FAQS for Best Presales with 100x Potential What drives BullZilla’s price jumps? The Mutation Mechanism triggers price increases when funding thresholds or time windows are met, forcing a stepwise price path upward. How safe is Litecoin as an asset? Litecoin enjoys longevity, broad exchange support, and a steady track record. Its risk is lower than many speculative tokens, though upside tends to be more moderate. Does TRON still attract new development? Yes. TRON’s scalability, staking model, and cost structure continue to draw projects seeking efficient deployment. Is it realistic for $BZIL to achieve 100x? If market conditions, listing price, and adoption align, the ROI math supports it. But that outcome depends on execution and timing. Glossary Mutation Mechanism: algorithm that escalates presale price by milestones or time windows Roarblood Vault: referral and loyalty rewards system embedded in BullZilla’s contract Token holders: individuals currently owning the presale token Presale stage: discrete phase in token sale with pricing rules Liquidity risk: possibility that token cannot be sold due to low demand or market constraints Vesting: release schedule for tokens held by team or investors Summary This article compares BullZilla, Litecoin, and TRON across risk, design, and upside. It emphasizes BullZilla’s tokenomic innovations like the Mutation Mechanism and Roarblood Vault, placing it firmly among the best presales with 100x potential 2025. Litecoin offers stability and historical continuity while TRON serves as an infrastructure and ecosystem host. By contrasting each, the reader gains insight into how speculative opportunity, durable assets, and platform support interplay in crypto’s evolving narrative.

Now, the same level of hype and investor attention is forming around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , except this time there is far more to the fervor than speculation. While SHIB’s runaway success was built on meme potential and community strength, Mutuum Finance is going down a different path as a utility-driven DeFi project with real-world use cases and the possibility of long-term growth. More than 55% of phase 6 of its presale has been sold out and the tokens are available for purchase at $0.035. The project has gained more than 16,700 holders and $16.7 million in presale commitments already. Mutuum Finance journey to SHIB’s early days is making it a serious coin for the next breakout story. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Sees Renewed Accumulation as Supply Drops Signal Potential Rally Shiba Inu (SHIB) is experiencing renewed investor interest as exchange reserves fall to 84.55 trillion tokens, $998M, the lowest since 2023, according to on-chain data. The trend indicates a shift towards self-custody and staking, which reduces available supply and traditionally sets the stage for accumulation waves. Analysts note that SHIB has now hit a key accumulation zone, and with price action trading near $0.000011, a breakthrough above its descending resistance trendline can spark an “Uptober” rally. While SHIB’s momentum is more rooted in community hype than anything fundamental, it highlights the kind of incredible investor interest that can be marshaled by early-stage crypto projects, a trend also unfolding in utility-driven altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which matches the same degree of excitement with genuine DeFi function and real-yield potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Numbers Point to Healthy Investor Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sees records shattered in its Stage 6 presale, and tokens are now priced at $0.035, a rise of 16.17% from the previous round. Investor demand remains robust, with over 16,700 users and over $16.7 million invested thus far, reflecting increased confidence in the project’s long-term outlook and vision. Mutuum Finance is offering a $100,000 giveaway to early adopters. There will be ten winners who will receive individual $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, and the project’s vision is thus to deliver long-term value and enable growth in the area of community building. Enhanced Security and Risk Management Security is Mutuum Finance’s top priority. To that end, the platform established a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to incentivize developers and security researchers to stress test and provide bug reports. Bugs are prioritized on a four-tier severity level: critical, major, minor, and low, to provide full assurance against potential threats. Mutuum Finance is a risk-weighted Loan-to-Value (LTV) protocol that assigns enough collateral to every asset according to its risk level, thereby a more stable and balanced lending process. During periods of market volatility, the protocol has a buffer reserve mechanism, with excess reserves on riskier assets as extra collateral. Dynamic liquidation ratios and real-time LTV are established dynamically to respond to prevailing market conditions in order to enable the protocol to successfully thwart volatility. Multipliers on reserves are graduated from 10% for less risky assets to 35% for more risky asset classes, adding another level of systemic insurance. Efficiency is also of paramount importance to Mutuum Finance. Collateral is optimized to create maximum borrowing capacity and correlated assets are utilized to render lending and borrowing efficiency ideal. These architectures provide low insolvency risks with a stable, sustainable DeFi protocol. Is Mutuum Finance the Next Shiba Inu? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a utility-driven DeFi alternative to early Shiba Inu (SHIB), with more than $16.7 million raised, 16,700+ holders, and over 55% of Phase 6 presale sold at $0.035. Combining dual lending, dynamic LTV control, and robust security with real-world DeFi use case utility ensures that MUTM offers early investors exposure to high-upside potential growth.

52588284,595967,1759453210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52588284.jpeg,Market Strategist: What You Should Expect For The XRP Next Leg,https://bitcoinist.com/what-to-expect-for-xrp-next-leg/,"XRP has been stuck under $3 for much of the past two weeks and is struggling to build the kind of momentum traders have been waiting for, alongside the rest of the crypto market. That picture has started to change in the past day, as the price began climbing back toward $3. This shift comes as market commentators are revealing different bullish technical setups, with one of the loudest voices being Altcoin Gordon, who believes the next move for XRP won’t just be higher, but it will be fast and aggressive. Next XRP Move Will Be Fast And Aggressive Altcoin Gordon, who has built a reputation for bold commentary on the crypto market, issued an important call for crypto traders on the social media platform X. The analyst didn’t hesitate with words on his post, noting that XRP’s next move is going to be fast and aggressive. According to him, the best course of action now is to be “either positioned BEFORE it happens, or begin for an entry once it does.” Gordon’s perspective is rooted in how the altcoin has been trading inside a descending triangle on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. This structure has become evident considering that the XRP price has bounced off the same support level about three times since early August. Particularly, the chart setup Gordon points to shows the asset holding a key support around $2.70 multiple times. The structure suggests pressure is building, and once the upper resistance trendline gives way, the breakout could come with speed. According to Gordon’s projection on the daily chart, the first stop is breaking above the resistance trendline currently around $3. However, the real acceleration would likely push XRP to $3.6 and above to new all-time highs. Longer-Term Signals Point Toward Bigger Gains Gordon’s focus is on the immediate breakout, but his outlook gains weight when combined with longer-term projections from other analysts. For instance, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto drew attention to XRP’s performance on the three-month candlestick chart, noting that the coin has flipped green for the first time since 2017. Such signal coincided with the start of the major uptrend in 2017 that pushed the token price to unprecedented price levels at the time. If history repeats itself, its price could be on the verge of something much larger than just a rally to $3 or $3.6. Mikybull’s analysis predicts that the XRP price could reach anywhere between $5 and $15 on the macro uptrend. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading at $2.98, having increased by about 4.8% in the past 24 hours. CoinCodex’s algorithm also predicts that XRP will reach above $4 within the next six months, specifically a $4.20 price target. This projection was shared by the official CoinCodex account in a direct response to Altcoin Gordon’s post on X.",XRP|Altcoin Gordon|CoinCodex|Mikybull Crypto|ripple|Upper Resistance Trendline|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 01:00:10

Bullish Patterns and Global Adoption Spark Fresh October Optimism,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/can-dogecoin-hit-1-bullish-patterns-and-global-adoption-spark-fresh-october-optimism/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has started October with renewed strength, riding a wave of bullish technical patterns and increasing global adoption that continue to boost optimism among traders and long-term holders alike. Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Top? Top Trader Warns Of Brutal $98,000 Liquidity Sweep As momentum grows, analysts are closely monitoring key resistance levels around $0.33 and higher as DOGE shows signs of consolidating for its next big move. The technical outlook is supported by on-chain signals and open interest inflows, indicating that market participants are gearing up for further upside. DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Golden Cross Formation and Technical Strength On multiple timeframes, Dogecoin is completing a Golden Cross pattern, a bullish signal that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term one. Historically, such setups have preceded major rallies in both DOGE and the wider altcoin market. Currently, DOGE trades near $0.258, after defending support at $0.25, where the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement aligns with the point of control. Analysts, including Cas Abbe and Trader Tardigrade, have highlighted rising momentum. The MACD histogram has turned green on the 12-hour chart, suggesting strengthening buying pressure. A breakout above the $0.33 resistance zone could open the door to $0.37, a potential 60% rally from current levels. Market structure also shows consistent higher lows, reinforcing demand even during short-term pullbacks. Adoption Expands Beyond Speculation Beyond technical indicators, Dogecoin’s adoption story is becoming a strong driver. Buenos Aires recently approved DOGE for tax payments, marking a step toward real-world use of cryptocurrencies. This follows earlier efforts by businesses and institutions exploring Dogecoin for payments, adding legitimacy beyond its meme roots. Meanwhile, futures market data shows bullish sentiment. Open interest in Dogecoin derivatives increased nearly 3% in the last 24 hours, with more than $3.9 billion in DOGE locked in. Exchanges like Gate, Binance, and Bybit lead with billions of dollars wagered, reflecting growing trader confidence. $1 Dogecoin (DOGE) Target Within Sight? Short-term targets for Dogecoin remain centered on $0.30 and $0.34, but analysts are also considering longer-term prospects. According to one projection, DOGE’s consolidation pattern on weekly charts could serve as the basis for a parabolic rally toward $1 by 2026. This scenario would mean over 330% gains from current levels, aligning with Dogecoin’s history of explosive, community-driven surges. For now, DOGE needs to stay above the $0.22 support and break through the $0.33 barrier.

Institutional momentum includes ETF requests from asset managers and increased ADA reserve listings by institutions. Coinbase cbADA reserves surge 462% to 9.56M ADA; learn what this means for Cardano holders and institutional interest—read the proof-of-reserve update now. Coinbase’s growing cbADA token reserves reflect increasing institutional interest in Cardano, signaling positive trends for ADA’s future. Coinbase’s cbADA reserve grew by 462% over the past four months, highlighting strong adoption and demand for Cardano-based DeFi tokens. Cardano’s expansion into DeFi, supported by Coinbase’s cbADA token, is driving significant institutional interest and exposure for ADA holders. Institutional confidence in Cardano is rising, with asset managers seeking Cardano-based ETFs and the token’s inclusion in reserve discussions. Coinbase recently updated its cbADA proof of reserve, showing a marked growth in its holdings of the Cardano-backed token. As of the latest report, Coinbase holds 9,563,462 ADA , valued at approximately $8.2 million . This reserve supports its 1:1 backing policy for the cbADA token, with the total supply at 9,530,418 . The updated figures represent a 462% increase in the cbADA reserve in four months, demonstrating notable momentum for Cardano on the exchange. What are Coinbase cbADA reserves and why do they matter? Coinbase cbADA reserves are ADA tokens held by Coinbase to back its cbADA wrapped token 1:1, ensuring redeemability and supporting DeFi access for ADA holders. The reserve size matters because larger, audited reserves increase confidence in the cbADA peg and broaden institutional exposure to Cardano. How did cbADA supply and holdings change since launch? The cbADA token launched in June with an initial supply of 1.7 million tokens. Coinbase’s updated proof shows supply and backing have converged, with holdings now at 9,563,462 ADA and supply at 9,530,418 cbADA. The reserve climb—462% over four months—reflects inflows and minting activity tied to demand for wrapped ADA in DeFi. Why is this surge important for Cardano institutional interest? Rising cbADA reserves are a direct signal of institutional and large-scale user activity. Asset managers publicizing interest in Cardano-based ETFs and formal reserve listings by institutional entities further strengthen ADA’s institutional narrative. These developments increase ADA liquidity and may encourage broader adoption by financial firms exploring alternative large-cap tokens. Which DeFi uses drive cbADA demand? cbADA enables ADA holders to access Ethereum-compatible DeFi services such as Aave, Uniswap, and Compound on Base and other EVM chains. Increased usage for lending, staking derivatives, and liquidity provisioning has coincided with Coinbase’s reserve growth, supporting practical demand beyond speculative holding. How to interpret Coinbase’s proof-of-reserve data? Read proof-of-reserve numbers as a transparency metric: verify the wallet totals against publicly reported supplies and exchange disclosures. Coinbase’s 1:1 backing claim is meaningful when audited reserve snapshots align with circulating cbADA. Persistent reserve increases suggest sustained inflows rather than short-term arbitrage.

Elon Musk has faced legal scrutiny from regulators in both the U.S. and the UK over the management of his companies. In the latest development, a U.S. judge has rejected his request to move an SEC lawsuit from Washington, D.C., to Texas. SEC’s case against Musk A federal judge has rejected Elon Musk’s attempt to transfer a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit to Texas, keeping the high-stakes case in Washington, D.C. U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan ruled Thursday that Musk failed to show sufficient grounds to move the case away from Washington. He also insisted that the billionaire maintains a broad presence across states and abroad, even though Musk spends much of his time in Texas, where Tesla and SpaceX have their headquarters. “The Court takes Mr. Musk’s convenience seriously, but it also notes that Mr. Musk has considerable means and spends at least forty percent of his time outside his chosen forum,” Sooknanan wrote. “Indeed, although Mr. Musk may have ‘rarely’ traveled to this District in recent months, Mr. Musk’s brief itself indicates that he has spent substantial time here this year.” The SEC lawsuit started in January 2025, more than two years after Musk acquired Twitter, now rebranded as X, for $44B. The regulator is looking to prove that the SpaceX founder violated disclosure rules when he quietly stacked more than 5% of Twitter’s stock in early 2022 before going public with his stake and subsequent takeover. Federal securities law requires investors to file a special disclosure within ten days of surpassing a 5% threshold in a publicly traded company. According to the SEC, Musk delayed filing the paperwork, which allowed him to buy additional shares at lower prices and deprived other investors of material information. The SEC claims that the timing of Musk’s stake disclosure in April 2022, after he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder , cost other shareholders over $150M. “Musk’s conduct undermined the transparency and fairness of the securities markets,” the SEC argued in its filings. “The violation is clear, and the consequences for shareholders were significant.” Musk’s legal team, however, has dismissed the suit as baseless and politically motivated. In August, they filed a motion to dismiss, calling the case “a waste of this court’s time and taxpayer resources.” The attorneys are insisting that Musk’s actions caused no meaningful harm and that the SEC is pursuing a personal vendetta against him. SEC refuses to concede home-field advantage In addition to challenging the lawsuit’s validity, Musk asked for the case to be relocated to Texas, where he has moved much of his business empire. His lawyers argued that forcing him to fight the SEC in Washington, the agency’s home turf, would be unfair. “Forcing Mr. Musk to litigate in this district would merely perpetuate and compound the harm from the SEC’s years-long campaign against him,” Musk’s attorneys wrote in their motion. The judge was not persuaded. Sooknanan emphasized that Musk’s wealth and global travel schedule demolish his claims of inconvenience. She also noted that Washington, D.C., is the logical venue since the SEC is headquartered there and much of the agency’s work on the case has been conducted in the capital. The ruling keeps the case in the same district where Musk has previously sparred with regulators and also ensures that the proceedings remain close to the SEC’s leadership and legal staff, who have clashed with Musk multiple times over the past decade. Keeping the case in Washington may provide a procedural advantage for the SEC and expedite a resolution.

If approved, this would expand its crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investors’ optimism is reflected in the LDO price rising above 7%. As per the official document, it is registered as a statutory trust, with the agent being the CSC Delaware Trust Company. The move is a significant step towards offering staked Ethereum products to all categories of investors. VanEck advances toward launching Ethereum staking ETF The initial step for most ETFs is typically a filing in the state of Delaware, followed by approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration does not guarantee approval . Still, it suggests that VanEck is interested in offering additional cryptocurrency products. The establishment of the first Ethereum staking ETF has already shown how demand for such products can accelerate investor interest in ETH. The company already oversees spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The two have attracted significant inflows since their launch, by linking the new offering to Lido’s staked Ethereum, VanEck targets to capitalize on the growing investor interest in yield-generating digital assets. VanEck brings liquid Ethereum staking to institutional investors Staked Ethereum refers to coins locked within the Ethereum network to validate transactions. Currently, the ideal platform for this is Lido, due to the liquidity it provides to users. Otherwise, they would have had their funds frozen. Investors may also earn staking rewards in Ethereum investing and trading. By incorporating this model into an ETF wrapper, large investors can capitalize on staking returns without needing to understand the inner workings of blockchain technology. Institutional adoption of crypto products accelerates following the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs. The filing is part of VanEck’s possible attempt to stay ahead of rivals such as BlackRock and Fidelity, which may also consider staking-related investment vehicles. Favourable trust laws have made Delaware the primary jurisdiction for registering new funds due to its favorable trust laws. Most statutory trusts begin here before advancing toward SEC evaluation. The regulatory watchdog recently approved the listing of Grayscale Ethereum ETFs, marking a significant milestone in the rapid evolution of the regulatory landscape for such products. The appointment of CSC Delaware Trust Company as the registered agent follows a standard structure used by major asset managers. The announcement also influenced the Lido DAO (LDO) token, which, according to TradingView, has risen 16.25% over the past week and 53.78% over the past six months.

The financial vehicle is designed to cement Europe’s position in one of the most competitive areas of deep tech. The fund, launched by Copenhagen-based 55 North, has already secured a first close of €134 million and aims to become the world’s largest dedicated vehicle for quantum investments. The initiative marks one of the most ambitious attempts yet by a European nation to bridge the gap between world-class research and commercial breakthroughs in quantum computing, sensing and communications. The Danish government and Novo have combined in funding tech 55 North’s target fund will invest across quantum computing , sensing, communications and enabling components. “When these technologies come to fruition, they could be transformative for some of the areas we care deeply about,” Soren Moller, managing partner for seed investments at Novo Holdings, said , reflecting the foundation’s interest in applications for life sciences and planetary health. The move follows earlier, related investments where the foundation and the government jointly committed to an Nvidia-powered AI supercomputer last year. Earlier this summer, they agreed to co-fund a Microsoft-powered quantum computer , named Magne, which will be made available to industry and researchers. The Magne machine , to be built with Microsoft and Atom Computing and operated by a new entity, QuNorth, is expected to begin work by early 2027. Lab breakthroughs turn into investable companies Europe has long led in quantum science, and over the years, it has seen research coming out of the continent become investable technology firms; however, this progress isn’t moving at the pace observed in places like the US and China. 55 North’s founding team has already placed early bets in areas such as quantum hardware and cryogenics. Novo Holdings, on the other hand, is known for its exploits in the pharmaceutical world. The foundation has pointed out that quantum-enabled simulation could materially accelerate drug discovery and complex molecular modelling. At the same time, Novo Nordisk has reason to invest and diversify as it faces mounting competitive pressures in the US obesity market and has announced substantial job reductions as it reorganizes under new leadership. Risks, geopolitics and the long game Quantum technology is still largely experimental and real-world applications are growing. However, the time it may take to yield major returns to investors may take years, if not decades. Denmark’s route of combining public backing with one of Europe’s most powerful foundations may be the way to go as funding deep technologies like this one are usually too risky for conventional venture capitalists. Analysts point out that quantum investment in the US is the highest, with companies such as IBM, Google and Amazon pouring billions into the field. China, meanwhile, has committed heavily to national programs. Europe’s challenge will include securing essential supply chains on top of scaling its startups and retaining talent. If successful, the fund could strengthen Europe’s role in quantum-enhanced pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and climate modeling. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

How did withdrawal of the 19b-4 affect the timeline? Canary withdrew the 19b-4 application on Sept. 25, 2025, after the SEC asked applicants to do so. That withdrawal may make the older 19b-4 clock irrelevant and refocus review on the S-1 registration statement. Industry analysts, including James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, note the change could alter established deadlines and approval expectations. Source: Eleanor Terrett The SEC’s silence raises two separate sources of delay: (1) a partial government shutdown that the agency says limits review capacity, and (2) implementation of new generic listing standards that could supersede 19b-4 timelines. Why could the government shutdown delay ETF approvals? The SEC posted an “Operation Plan” in August stating it would not review and approve registration applications during a shutdown. The agency has said it will continue limited operations and keep EDGAR online, but full review and acceleration of registration statements may be paused until staffing resumes. How large is the spot crypto ETF market and what’s at stake? Approvals for altcoin spot ETFs could broaden the US spot crypto ETF market, which investors value at roughly $75 billion. Since last year the US Bitcoin spot ETF has attracted $61.3 billion in inflows and Ether spot ETFs $13.4 billion, underscoring potential demand for additional products. Spot ETF inflows since launch Asset Inflows (USD) Bitcoin (BTC) $61.3 billion Ether (ETH) $13.4 billion When will applicants know if the new listing standards change timelines? The SEC’s new listing standards under Rule 6c-11 are intended to streamline approvals, but the agency has not publicly defined new effective dates for pending applications. Analysts argue the standards could reduce review times that previously ran up to 240 days, but exact timelines will depend on SEC guidance and staffing. What authoritative sources and commentary inform this update? Market commentary referenced includes Bloomberg ETF analysts and reporting by Eleanor Terrett. The SEC’s publicly posted “Operation Plan” and statements from SEC leadership provide the official framework for operations during a shutdown.

The SEC has said limited staffing will constrain reviews and approvals, but some critical systems like EDGAR remain operational. Full approval workflows for new registration statements may be delayed until staffing levels permit comprehensive review. How should investors respond to the Canary Litecoin ETF pause? Investors should monitor official issuer filings and SEC notices, diversify exposure appropriately, and treat timelines as fluid until the SEC provides definitive rulings or restores full review capacity. Key Takeaways SEC inaction : The SEC did not decide on the Canary Litecoin ETF by the original deadline, creating immediate uncertainty. Procedural shift : Withdrawal of 19b-4 filings moves emphasis to S-1 registration statements for approval. Operational risk : A government shutdown and limited SEC staff may delay approvals even as new listing standards aim to streamline future reviews. Conclusion The Canary Litecoin ETF decision remains pending after the SEC took no action by the original deadline, complicated by a requested 19b-4 withdrawal and a federal government shutdown. Market participants should monitor issuer S-1 filings, SEC guidance on Rule 6c-11, and official communications from COINOTAG for updates and next steps. pic.twitter.com/FmbMfWWaqe — Litecoin (@litecoin) October 2, 2025 Note: Bloomberg and analyst commentary, reporting by Eleanor Terrett, and SEC public filings inform this article.

Ethereum Makes Privacy A Priority In an October 1 post titled “Privacy Cluster Leadership Announcement,” EF said it is “organizing for scale and impact,” naming longtime ecosystem builder Igor Barinov as the coordinator of Privacy @ EF and Andy Guzman as the new coordinator of the PSE (Privacy & Scaling Explorations) team, succeeding Sam Richards. “Together, Igor and Andy will help ensure Ethereum’s privacy work is impactful, coherent, and accountable,” the Foundation wrote. The announcement reframes EF’s privacy mission as three concrete pillars—“Private Reads,” “Private Writes,” and “Private Proving”—that directly map to user and institutional needs. Private Reads targets surveillance-resistant querying, authentication, and browsing; Private Writes focuses on shielding actions such as payments, governance, and transfers; and Private Proving aims to make proofs “efficient, portable, and usable across contexts like identities, data portability, and client-side proving.” EF links these pillars to practical compliance and safety requirements, arguing they are “necessary for institutions to comply with data protection standards,” help individuals avoid metadata leaks, and “shield our private financial information.”The Foundation is explicit that privacy will no longer be treated as an abstract research track divorced from shipping software. “For Ethereum to become a foundation for civilizational infrastructure, privacy cannot be abstract research alone. It must be organized, resourced, and deployed at scale,” the post states—an unusually direct articulation of the program’s end goal and a signal that the cluster will be judged on delivery as much as on research output. The post closes with a blunt credo—“Privacy is normal, and Ethereum is for privacy”—and an open invitation for builders to connect with Barinov and Guzman and to explore a catalog of “700+ projects” in the on-chain privacy space. Barinov, best known for founding Blockscout, Gnosis Chain, and zkBob, brings a mix of infrastructure, open-source stewardship, and applied privacy product experience. Guzman, who has been with PSE/EF since 2022, moves from strategy and product leadership into the top operational role for PSE, which EF describes as spanning applied cryptography, research, and engineering. Substantively, the cluster model is designed to integrate ongoing work on privacy-preserving computation with Ethereum’s public verifiability guarantees. While the post does not enumerate specific deliverables or dates, its emphasis on “portable” and “usable” proving, institutional compliance, and metadata-minimizing reads implies a roadmap that extends beyond shielded transfers toward end-to-end private user journeys—identity, access, payments, and governance—compatible with L1/L2 designs and client-side proving patterns that have been maturing across the ecosystem.

Bitcoin Has Broken Past 0.5 SD MVRV Deviation Band In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where Bitcoin may be heading next based on the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands. This pricing model is based on the popular Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio, an indicator that compares the market cap of Bitcoin against its realized cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder RVT Nears Cycle Lows: A Healthy Reset? The former represents the value currently held by the BTC investors, while the latter is a measure of the value that they initially put in. As such, the MVRV Ratio basically represents the profit-loss balance of the overall network. When the value of the metric is greater than 1, it means the market cap is greater than the realized cap and the average investor is sitting on an unrealized gain. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the investors as a whole may be considered underwater. The MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands takes the mean of the MVRV Ratio and calculates standard deviations (SDs) from it. It then determines price levels that correspond to these standard deviations. Below is the chart for this Bitcoin pricing model shared by the analyst. As is visible in the graph, the mean of the MVRV Ratio is currently situated at $94,650 in the model. What this means is that if Bitcoin declines to this level, the MVRV Ratio would attain a value equal to its mean. During BTC’s recent decline, its price slipped below the +0.5 SD level of $116,700. With the latest recovery run, however, it has smashed past it. The next level on the model is the +1 SD, located at $138,800. Bitcoin has surged above this band twice in the current cycle so far, with a top following for the cryptocurrency shortly after each break. The explanation behind the trend could lie in the fact that investors become more likely to participate in profit-taking selloffs the higher their gains get. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Big Move? CryptoQuant Says These Alerts Are To Watch The MVRV Ratio being 1 SD above its mean corresponds to holder gains being notably higher than the norm. As such, it’s not surprising to see that BTC topped out shortly after crossing the threshold during both of the 2024 breakouts. It now remains to be seen whether this latest surge above the +0.5 SD level will lead Bitcoin to another retest of the +1 SD band, or if the run will fizzle out before it can happen. BTC Price Bitcoin has witnessed a recovery run of almost 7% over the last week that has taken its price to the $119,200 level.

Bullish Reversal For Ethereum Price Market expert Gert van Lagen took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his insights, suggesting that the Ethereum price is currently following a “textbook” expanding diagonal pattern on its biweekly chart. As seen in the expert’s chart below, this expanding diagonal pattern is characterized by a series of rising trend lines, indicating a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. Over the past month and a half, the Ethereum price has consolidated between $4,200 and $4,600, with a brief drop towards $3,800 on September 25th. This met significant demand, resulting in a swift recovery of the $4,000 support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Rally Towards All-Time Highs: Top Analysts Share Predictions By connecting the lower points of these downward movements—known as waves 2 and 4—with the upper points of waves 1, 3, and 5, a triangular or diagonal shape emerges. According to van Lagen’s analysis, this pattern signifies a shift in momentum for the Ethereum price from bearish to bullish, often leading to a significant upward breakout. Bitcoin (BTC) led the market recovery also approaching record levels above $120,000. Van Lagen noted that Ethereum’s Wave v is nearing completion, supported by a final corrective a-b-c wave. Specifically, Wave a has successfully broken above the crucial resistance level of $3,650, retested it for support in the b wave, and is now poised for the final impulse in wave c, aiming for an ambitious target range of $9,000 to $18,000. The Path Forward For ETH Adding to the optimistic sentiment, market analyst Mr. Wall Street has expressed a similarly bullish outlook, asserting that the Ethereum price is on track to reach its final price target for this cycle, estimated between $7,000 and $8,000. However, both analysts agree that Ethereum’s ability to surpass its previous record near the $5,000 mark will be pivotal as this level is expected to act as a significant resistance barrier should the current recovery continue. Related Reading: Rumble At The Core: How Tether Plans To Dominate The US Stablecoin Market Looking ahead, market analyst Michael van de Poppe has also weighed in, predicting that the coming weeks will see Bitcoin experience an upward bounce before undergoing a slight correction. Following this, he anticipates the Ethereum price will begin to gain momentum. “Given that the BTC pair is currently holding up well and has undergone a standard correction, I believe we will see Ethereum pick up steam in the near future,” van de Poppe stated.

Attendees and observers offered measured responses. Tory Green of io.net emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in coverage. Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin criticized deplatforming as a principle, while Cecilia Hsueh of MEXC noted that independent outlets often match crypto’s fast-moving culture better than traditional press. What are the main criticisms and safeguards to watch for? Critics warn projects tied to political figures may face conflicts of interest or promote personal advantages. Readers should look for audited smart contracts, clear governance, and published financial disclosures before engaging. Frequently Asked Questions Is World Liberty Financial regulated? Regulatory status was not detailed in public remarks at Token 2049. Prospective users should seek official disclosures and legal filings published by the project for clarity. Did deplatforming drive a broader crypto trend? Many in crypto view deplatforming and banking restrictions as catalysts for decentralized alternatives. The sector’s focus on self-custody and censorship resistance grew notably after high-profile platform removals in 2021. Key Takeaways Project purpose : World Liberty Financial is framed as an alternative media and finance vehicle responding to deplatforming and debanking. Industry view : Experts cited transparency and independent coverage as vital for credible crypto reporting. Due diligence : Investors should verify team credentials, contracts, audits, and disclosures before participation. Conclusion Donald Trump Jr.’s public remarks at Token 2049 positioned World Liberty Financial as a response to perceived mainstream media and banking exclusions, emphasizing alternate channels for communication and finance.

Fusaka upgrade: Ethereum scaling update that raises gas limits and enables lighter nodes; monitor Sepolia/Hoodi tests — read the deployment plan and market impact. What is the Fusaka upgrade? Fusaka upgrade is an Ethereum protocol enhancement designed to scale bandwidth and reduce costs by enabling lighter nodes to sample blob data and by increasing the protocol gas limit to roughly 150 million per block. It targets cheaper Layer‑2 transactions and greater throughput for tokenization use cases. How does Fusaka improve transaction throughput and node efficiency? Fusaka allows nodes to validate and sample data instead of storing full blob payloads, cutting storage requirements and bandwidth for node operators. The upgrade also raises gas limits to about 150M (from ~45M), which increases transactions per block and lets Layer‑2 networks push larger batches at lower per‑tx cost. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Fusaka upgrade: What’s next, how it scales Ethereum and market reaction"", ""description"": ""Fusaka upgrade: Ethereum scaling update that raises gas limits and enables lighter nodes; monitor Sepolia/Hoodi tests and market impact."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T10:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T14:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-141704.png"" ], ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/fusaka-upgrade-2025"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When will Fusaka reach mainnet?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Fusaka passed Holesky tests on October 1 and will move to Sepolia and Hoodi testnets; mainnet deployment is targeted for early December if testing finds no blocking issues."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How does Fusaka affect Layer‑2 transaction costs?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""By increasing gas limits and enabling lighter node data sampling, Fusaka allows Layer‑2 systems to submit larger, denser batches, lowering per‑transaction costs on L2 rollups and optimistic systems."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to follow Fusaka testing on Sepolia and Hoodi"", ""description"": ""Simple steps for node operators and developers to monitor Fusaka testnet progress and prepare for mainnet."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm repository and client builds"", ""text"": ""Pull the official client releases and build the supported clients locally or use CI artifacts to run testnet nodes."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Join Sepolia/Hoodi testnets"", ""text"": ""Launch nodes on Sepolia and Hoodi configurations, enable blob sampling features, and sync to the latest testnet tip to validate behavior."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Run transaction batches and measure gas"", ""text"": ""Submit L2‑style batch transactions to evaluate gas per batch, latency, and node resource usage; compare against pre‑Fusaka baselines."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Report issues and monitor updates"", ""text"": ""Log and report any consensus or resource regressions; follow official protocol team updates and iterate on client fixes."" } ]} Why did Ethereum prioritize Fusaka now? Ethereum is preparing for higher on‑chain activity tied to tokenization and internet capital markets narratives. Fusaka addresses bandwidth and cost constraints that limit Layer‑2 scaling, helping Ethereum remain competitive with faster chains in throughput-sensitive applications. On October 1, the Ethereum protocol team announced that Fusaka successfully passed the Holesky testnet validation suite. The next milestones are Sepolia and Hoodi testnets, with a conditional mainnet upgrade targeted for early December. How did markets react to Fusaka? ETH rallied roughly 5% after the Fusaka announcement window, driven in part by broader market moves. Short‑term futures metrics showed elevated speculative interest: ETH Open Interest rose ~4% in 24 hours compared with SOL +2% and BTC +3%. Source: TradingView (price chart) — Open Interest and intraday flows provided by public market data providers and exchange reports. What are the implementation risks and monitoring points? Key risks include client implementation bugs, consensus regressions, and unforeseen resource spikes for light nodes. Teams will monitor block propagation, reorg frequency, and memory/disk profiles on Sepolia/Hoodi. Any critical issues would delay mainnet rollout. Frequently Asked Questions Will Fusaka change ETH gas fees for everyday users? Fusaka should lower per‑tx costs for Layer‑2 users by enabling larger and more efficient rollup batches, but direct L1 gas fee volatility will still depend on demand and base fee dynamics. Can node operators run lighter nodes after Fusaka? Yes. Fusaka enables lighter node modes that sample blob data rather than storing full payloads, reducing storage and bandwidth requirements for node operators while maintaining strong validation guarantees. Key Takeaways Fusaka raises bandwidth : Enables data sampling and raises gas limits to ~150M to increase throughput. Testnet progression : Passed Holesky; next stops are Sepolia and Hoodi before a possible early December mainnet upgrade. Market impact : ETH saw short‑term speculative interest; futures Open Interest rose ~4% versus SOL +2% and BTC +3%. Conclusion Fusaka upgrade is a targeted scaling step for Ethereum that combines node efficiency and higher block gas capacity to reduce Layer‑2 costs and support tokenization growth.

This update was made public after an announcement on Thursday, October 2, revealing that Morpho intends to establish stablecoin lending markets on the Cronos blockchain, with the launch of the first vaults anticipated later this year. With this combination, users can deposit wrapped Ether or Bitcoin into Morpho vaults and utilize them as collateral to borrow stablecoins and earn yield. The Morpho lending protocol acts as a game-changer in blockchain technology Wrapped assets are tokens on one blockchain, such as Ethereum, that represent an asset from a different blockchain, like Bitcoin, at a 1:1 value. On Cronos, wrapped tokens like CDCETH and CDCBTC reflect ETH and BTC, enabling users to add value to the network and access DeFi lending markets without leaving the chain. Following these updates , Morpho’s co-founder and integration team lead, Merlin Egalite, said that they aim to provide a trusted user experience in the front, with DeFi infrastructure in the back. He further explained that the protocol will be directly combined into Crypto.com’s platforms, offering its lending features to all users. Morpho connects lenders and borrowers using platforms such as Aave and Compound. With its increased adoption, the protocol has been positioned as the second-largest DeFi lending protocol, with a total value locked of around $7.7 billion, according to reports from DefiLlama. For the accessibility of this protocol, Egalite mentioned that users based in the US will have the chance to access the protocol. He acknowledged that the Genesis Act hinders stablecoin issuers from directly paying reserve yields to holders. However, he stated that lending a stablecoin and earning yield is a different activity that does not depend on the issuer, so the restrictions do not affect it. In the meantime, the partnership between Morphos and Crypto.com was established just a few weeks after the DeFi lending protocol teamed up with the US crypto exchange Coinbase. Regarding its partnership with Morpho, Coinbase stated that it had integrated the Morpho lending protocol directly into its app, with the DeFi advisory firm Steakhouse Financial overseeing the vaults. Similar to the Crypto.com feature, users can lend USDC without leaving the platform to access other DeFi services or wallets. Banks raise concerns about stablecoin issuers’ plan to eliminate traditional banks Just days after the partnership announcements, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong revealed plans to build a full-fledged crypto “super app” designed to replace the need for traditional banks. Banks raised concerns about the plan and resisted this change. In August, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) and several US financial institutions penned a letter to Congress requesting that they close stablecoin loopholes. They contend these loopholes give stablecoin issuers a way to compete with banks without the appropriate oversight. The letter warns that if these concerns go unaddressed, as much as $6.6 trillion in deposits could flee the US banking system. On September 16, Coinbase responded to the banks’ claims in a blog post, calling them false and stating there is no proof that the growth of stablecoins has led to any deposit losses at local banks. The post mentioned, “The institutions now claiming ‘systemic risk’ are the same ones making tens of billions from card processing fees, which stablecoins could completely avoid.” Responding to the accusations, Coinbase issued a blog post on September 16, saying they were all false and that there is no evidence of any deposit loss at local banks due to stablecoin growth. The post noted that the organizations raising concerns about ‘systemic risk’ are the same ones that acquire tens of billions from card processing fees, which stablecoins could potentially eliminate.

These offerings typically range from basic $20 spells to advanced $73 “millionaire” rituals and include disclaimers that outcomes are for entertainment and not guaranteed. Sellers market rituals, oracle cards, and bespoke crypto spells on Etsy. Pricing often ranges from about $20 to $73 for premium “millionaire” spells. Many listings include entertainment-only disclaimers and vary widely in sales and reviews. Etsy crypto spells: understand claims, pricing, and safety—read COINOTAG’s concise guide now. What are Etsy crypto spells and how do sellers describe them? Etsy crypto spells are product listings where sellers advertise rituals, personalized manifestations, or oracle-card readings intended to influence financial luck in cryptocurrency markets. Listings commonly describe spiritual alignment, candle rituals, and customized intentions tied to a buyer’s crypto holdings while including disclaimers that results cannot be guaranteed. How common are these listings and who’s buying them? These offerings have proliferated on Etsy and social platforms this year. Some shops show modest sales, while long-standing sellers report thousands of transactions. One account advertising similar services reports more than 120,000 sales at roughly $18 per item, illustrating demand for metaphysical goods linked to finance and lifestyle. New trend: sellers on Etsy list spells, oracle cards and rituals that claim to boost cryptocurrency fortunes, promising alignment with market “prosperity” or bespoke crypto-focused manifestations. Listings vary in scope and price. A typical structure includes a basic ritual for about $20, an upgraded performance at $42, and a high-tier package dubbed a “millionaire spell” for roughly $73. Descriptions emphasize spiritual intent and personal energy alignment with market success, but many include explicit disclaimers framing the service as entertainment. Promotional image from the crypto spell listing. Source: Etsy Beyond spells, sellers advertise novel formats like “Bitcoin Oracle Cards” and coin-specific rituals—examples include a “Dogecoin wealth ritual” that pairs candles, crystals, and downloadable affirmations. Sellers often provide short videos or images to illustrate ritual components and the intended client experience. Social channels and forums note buyer reactions ranging from curiosity to satire. A Reddit post recounted a user paying for a ritual aimed at driving Bitcoin to a specific price target. Public reaction has been mixed, with some users mocking claims and others treating listings as playful or therapeutic alternatives to conventional financial advice. Bitcoin Oracle cards. Source: Etsy Why do these listings matter to buyers and regulators? They highlight the intersection of commerce, belief, and speculative finance. For consumers, the core issues are transparency, consumer protection, and financial literacy. For platforms, the question is enforcement of content rules that prohibit certain metaphysical services but still allow a wide range of spiritual goods. Buyers should note that many sellers include entertainment disclaimers and avoid specific time-bound promises. Reported metrics—sales volume and review averages—offer signals about a shop’s longevity but are not proof of efficacy for financial outcomes. Etsy Bitcoin price spell post on r/Bitcoin. Source: Reddit What should potential buyers consider before purchasing? Read listings thoroughly, check seller history and reviews, and treat claims about guaranteed market outcomes skeptically. Verify refund policies and be wary of any service that equates ritual work with financial returns. Approach such purchases as consumer-grade entertainment rather than investment advice.

Yes, selling spiritual or metaphysical goods is generally legal, but platforms may set policies restricting certain services. Listings that avoid explicit fraudulent promises typically remain available as consumer products. Can a ritual influence cryptocurrency markets? There is no empirical evidence that ritual work can change market prices. Market movements depend on economic, technological, and regulatory factors reported by established financial sources. Key Takeaways Claim vs. evidence : Ritual listings often claim financial benefits but lack verifiable proof. Consumer caution : Check reviews, seller history, and disclaimers before buying. Entertainment framing : Treat crypto spells as metaphysical or entertainment purchases, not investment advice. Conclusion Listings advertising Etsy crypto spells blend spiritual services with financial language to attract buyers. While some shops show high sales volume, claims of guaranteed crypto gains are unsupported and usually labeled as entertainment. Consumers should prioritize transparency and view these products as non-financial services.

What is XRP’s current technical outlook? XRP is holding a firm support zone around $2.70–$2.75 while consolidating near $2.90, positioning the market for a potential breakout above $3.00. Price action, volume, and a developing inverse head-and-shoulders pattern point to $3.00–$3.15 as the near-term target if buyers sustain momentum. How are technical levels defining XRP’s next targets? Support at $2.70 has been tested multiple times and has held, preventing a retest of the broader low near $2.62. Resistance is concentrated between $3.00 and $3.15, where repeated attempts have been rejected. An inverse head-and-shoulders pattern — with a neckline around $2.95 — projects $3.15 as an initial breakout target, then $3.30–$3.70 if momentum continues.

These metrics confirm steady market activity as buyers defend key levels. Source: KamranAsghar (X) Why does institutional activity matter for XRP price action? Institutional demand can provide sustained liquidity and large bid interest that amplifies technical breakouts. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has described altcoin ETF approvals as increasingly likely; seven XRP ETF applications are under SEC review with decision windows into mid-October 2025. Approval or constructive guidance could trigger sizeable inflows and push prices above immediate resistance. Separately, Japan’s SBI announced an institutional lending program for XRP aimed at supporting payment solutions at scale. Following the announcement, reported token lending and trading activity surged, with a 24-hour token volume spike to about 164.5 million tokens — more than double average levels — indicating increased on‑chain and OTC demand. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-support-consolidation"" }, ""headline"": ""XRP Holds $2.70 Support, Consolidates Near $2.90 as Analysts Eye $3.00–$3.15 Breakout"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-23.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""XRP is consolidating near $2.90 while holding $2.70 support; institutional demand and technical setups increase the odds of a breakout to $3.00–$3.15.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to Monitor XRP for a Breakout"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step guide to tracking technical signals, volume, and institutional catalysts that indicate an XRP breakout."", ""totalTime"": ""PT1H"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-support-consolidation#step1"", ""name"": ""Confirm support"", ""text"": ""Track $2.70–$2.75 support with repeated closes above the zone on four-hour and daily charts."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-support-consolidation#step2"", ""name"": ""Watch the neckline"", ""text"": ""Monitor the neckline near $2.95; a sustained close above $3.00 with volume confirms a higher-probability breakout."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-support-consolidation#step3"", ""name"": ""Measure volume and institutional flows"", ""text"": ""Look for rising daily volume and institutional announcements (ETF updates, lending programs) to validate breakout strength."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is XRP likely to break above $3.00 soon?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""XRP is positioned to test $3.00–$3.15 if support at $2.70 holds and volume increases.

Approvals typically lead to increased institutional flows and liquidity, which can produce rapid price appreciation. Market reaction depends on size and speed of inflows and prevailing macro conditions. How should traders use volume with XRP technicals? Use volume as confirmation: rising daily and intraday volume on a break above $3.00 validates buyer conviction. Low volume breakouts carry a higher risk of failure. Key Takeaways Support holds : $2.70–$2.75 is the critical support zone to defend the bullish outlook. Near-term target : $3.00–$3.15 is the immediate resistance to watch, with $3.30–$3.70 as secondary objectives. Institutional catalysts : ETF reviews and institutional lending (e.g., SBI’s program) are key liquidity drivers to monitor. Conclusion In summary, XRP is consolidating above a defined $2.70 support and eyeing a breakout near $3.00–$3.15. Technical patterns, volume, and institutional developments combine to create a favorable setup; traders should monitor price action and ETF review updates closely for confirmation and next steps.",Guides|News|AUCTION|XRP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-03 02:55:30

The cryptocurrency gained 4% in 24 hours, breaking through resistance at $117,500 and pressing against the symbolic $120,000 mark. At this level, Bitcoin’s market capitalization rose to $2.37 trillion, surpassing Amazon’s value, while the broader crypto market swelled to $4.16 trillion. The rally spilled into altcoins, with Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin climbing 5–6% in sympathy. Analysts point to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts as a key driver. Softer U.S. labor data has fueled speculation that policymakers may ease monetary conditions later this month, boosting Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainty.

CME Plans 24/7 Futures by 2026 Adding to the optimism, the CME Group announced plans to launch 24/7 trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and options by early 2026, pending regulatory approval. Currently, CME halts crypto futures trading over weekends, a mismatch with global markets that operate 24/7. The shift is designed to meet growing institutional demand for continuous risk management. Tim McCourt, CME’s global head of equities and alternative products, said the move should enhance market efficiency, reduce arbitrage gaps, and strengthen liquidity.

Institutional adoption has long been a catalyst for Bitcoin price growth. By aligning with the 24/7 nature of digital assets, CME could accelerate that trend and provide fresh liquidity for both spot and derivatives markets. Sweden Weighs Bitcoin Reserve, Bearish Pattern Emerges Meanwhile, Sweden is considering joining the ranks of nations exploring Bitcoin reserves. Lawmakers Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez have proposed a national reserve built from seized Bitcoin, arguing it would protect the country from inflation and geopolitical risks. The idea aligns with broader international discussions, with the U.S. also examining Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset. A national Bitcoin reserve in Sweden could set a precedent across Europe, reinforcing the asset’s credibility and potentially sparking new institutional inflows. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview From a technical perspective , however, caution remains warranted. Bitcoin’s current rally is forming a Bearish Butterfly pattern, with the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) projected between $128,000 and $130,000. While momentum remains bullish in the short term, this harmonic structure warns of potential selling pressure at higher levels. Support levels : $117,000, $113,500, $106,900 Resistance targets : $124,600, $128,000–$130,000 (PRZ) A clean breakout above $124,600 could pave the way toward the PRZ, but overbought RSI conditions suggest the risk of a pullback increases the closer Bitcoin gets to $130,000. A failure to hold $117,000 could expose deeper supports at $113,500 and $106,900. Bitcoin is forming a Bearish Butterfly pattern. Resistance: $124.6K, PRZ $128K–$130K Support: $117K / $113.5K / $106.9K Momentum looks bullish short term, but caution: risk of reversal grows as price nears the PRZ. #BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/C4r5rWUm5B — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 3, 2025 For traders, the outlook is clear: Uptober momentum is strong, institutional demand is rising, and global policy shifts are supportive.

Blockchain sleuths flagged the movement, and on-chain traces show funds leaving addresses that start with “0x40d7” and “bc1qx0a2k.” The assets included Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. As of this report, the money has not been recovered. Suspected Lazarus Group Connections According to blockchain analysts, the transfers followed a clear path: the stolen coins moved through five instant exchanges before being sent into Tornado Cash, the crypto mixer that US authorities sanctioned in 2022. Based on reports , the same set of tactics — wallet fingerprints, timing, and routing — match other intrusions linked to the Lazarus Group, the state-linked cyber unit from the DPRK. A US court’s decision earlier this year to lift some restrictions around mixers has raised fresh concerns that these tools can be reused to hide large thefts. Infiltration Schemes And Fake Profiles Investigations have shown the threat is not only technical but social. Reports have disclosed that operatives created dozens of fake identities, bought Social Security numbers, and posed as blockchain developers on platforms such as Upwork and LinkedIn. Evidence posted on August 13 linked one such fake-developer wallet to a $680,000 exploit of the project Favrr in June 2025. The methods range from phishing and fake job offers to bribery and contractor infiltration, giving attackers ways to penetrate projects from the inside. A Growing Trail Of Stolen Crypto Based on compiled forensics data, North Korean-linked groups stole more than $1.3 billion across 47 incidents in 2024. That figure jumped higher in 2025, with estimates putting thefts at about $2.2 billion in the first half of the year alone. Malware campaigns have also been used. In June, Cisco Talos documented “PylangGhost,” a campaign that used bogus coding tests and interview sites to deliver malware. That malware targeted over 80 browser extensions and popular wallets like MetaMask and Phantom. Law enforcement has made some moves: US agents seized $7.7 million tied to covert networks, and the FBI dismantled front companies such as Blocknovas LLC and Softglide LLC. The $21 million breach underscores how exposed even major firms remain to state-backed hacking campaigns. For now, the case stands as another warning: Japanese crypto firm SBI lost $21 million in suspected North Korean cyberattack.

The event has rattled traditional markets, with traders bracing for delays in economic data releases and broader uncertainty about fiscal stability. For cryptocurrencies, however, the shutdown is proving to be a unique catalyst. Investors are increasingly drawn to digital assets as a hedge against dysfunction in traditional governance, where monetary policy and budgetary battles continue to dominate headlines. Bitcoin, the market’s benchmark, has held steady during the initial wave of uncertainty, reinforcing its role as a safe-haven digital asset. Yet the real conversation among traders is about altcoins, which historically outperform during periods of disruption. With U.S. economic data delayed and institutional investors seeking diversification, altcoins are attracting renewed interest. Analysts argue that the shutdown creates a window for fresh capital to flow into projects with strong narratives and active ecosystems. Among them, three tokens stand out right now: Ethereum for institutional adoption, Solana for high-beta growth, and MAGACOIN FINANCE for speculative momentum that resonates with retail communities. Ethereum As The Institutional Anchor Ethereum remains the most obvious choice for investors navigating uncertainty. As the backbone of decentralized finance and tokenization pilots, ETH is gaining traction among institutions searching for digital asset exposure beyond Bitcoin. Even as traditional markets wobble, Ethereum’s credibility provides confidence that its long-term trajectory remains intact. Analysts highlight that ETH staking and ETF demand are creating structural support, ensuring steady inflows during periods of volatility. The shutdown may even enhance Ethereum’s appeal, as delays in traditional financial reporting push more institutions toward on-chain data sources, where Ethereum dominates. This credibility makes ETH the first altcoin to watch in the current environment. Solana As The High-Beta Growth Play For investors willing to embrace volatility, Solana offers the opposite profile. Known for its speed, low fees, and cultural relevance through NFTs and meme tokens, Solana thrives in high-beta environments. The token often outperforms during bullish phases, and analysts argue that its developer momentum continues to support long-term growth. Solana’s pullbacks can be sharp, but they also create entry points for traders seeking higher multiples. During a government shutdown, when risk appetite shifts and investors look for assets with rapid upside, Solana is often one of the first beneficiaries. Its strong community ensures that momentum can return quickly once sentiment flips. The U.S. government shutdown has shifted investor attention toward hedge-like assets, but traders chasing outperformance are also adding presales to their lists. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being ranked among the top altcoins to watch now, with multiplier estimates reaching 63x in optimistic projections . Unlike mid-caps that depend on broader macro recovery, presales are fueled by urgency and narrative traction, both of which MAGACOIN FINANCE commands. Its branding has carved out a niche that resonates during periods of uncertainty, a reminder that speculative plays often thrive when traditional confidence falters. For those looking to diversify while Washington deadlocks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being cited as one of the speculative top three worth considering now. Retail Psychology During Market Disruptions The shutdown highlights a recurring theme in crypto markets: retail investors thrive in environments where traditional systems falter. For many, government dysfunction reinforces the case for decentralized alternatives. Retail portfolios often rotate toward presales and meme coins during such events, seeking opportunities that feel disconnected from institutional fragility. This psychology explains the buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Ethereum and Solana anchor strategies, retail communities are looking for tokens that can transform small allocations into extraordinary multiples. Presales capture this spirit, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the flagship name in the current wave of speculation. Diversifying For The Next Phase For investors balancing safety and upside, combining Ethereum, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE creates a diversified approach. Ethereum provides credibility, Solana delivers growth, and MAGACOIN FINANCE offers speculative firepower. Together, they represent three categories of opportunity, institutional anchor, high-beta layer 1, and retail-driven presale. Analysts stress that this kind of balance is essential during uncertain times. While no one can predict the exact impact of the shutdown, history shows that crypto markets thrive when traditional systems falter. Positioning now ensures exposure when momentum returns. Conclusion The U.S. government shutdown has added another layer of uncertainty to global markets, but for crypto investors, it has opened a window of opportunity. Ethereum, with its institutional adoption, remains the anchor altcoin. Solana, with its high-beta growth potential, offers rapid upside. And MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its audits, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and viral community, provides the speculative excitement retail investors seek. Together, these three tokens embody the strategies investors can use to navigate disruption: stability, growth, and speculation. As the shutdown drags on, attention will likely intensify on assets that can thrive independently of traditional systems, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as one of the most compelling speculative contenders of this cycle.

Related Reading: Fast And Furious: XRP’s Next Rally Predicted To Shock Markets According to Coinglass data, BTC rose about 2.50% in the last 24 hours, and is up 8% over the last seven days. Trading activity and inflows are being watched closely as traders size up the next move. Institutional Flows Drive Momentum Data shows the top crypto asset registered a second straight day of strong inflows, putting $430 million into Bitcoin spot ETFs. That kind of demand helps explain why Bitcoin’s market value has jumped from $870 billion to $2.34 trillion this year. Analysts say that steady institutional buying has been a key engine behind the rally, and continued flows could keep momentum alive. $BTC/usdt DAILY$BTC breaking out of LTF consolidation @ $115k within the HTF ascending channel we’ve been in all of 2025 $130k is the ultimate breakout point and could lead to the cycle blow off top 🎯 pic.twitter.com/1J9rSc7BJO — Satoshi Flipper (@SatoshiFlipper) October 1, 2025 Price Levels And Targets In Focus Resistance zones are being tested. Near-term hurdles sit at $118,500 and $119,800, with a close target at $120k if buyers stay in control. Analyst Satoshi Flipper pointed out that BTC appears to have built a base above the $115,000 area and is holding a higher time frame structure, adding that a long-term breakout aim sits near $130,000. Buyers extended the climb past $118k, and that move is being cited as a sign that demand remains present above current levels. On-Chain Signals And Volatility According to Coinglass, trading volume rose 12% to nearly $95 billion for the day, while Open Interest increased 4.46% to $84 billion. The OI weighted funding rate came in at 0.0050%. Liquidations show the market can still move quickly: $157.08 million in positions were wiped in the past day, with shorts accounting for $136 million and longs $20 million. A bullish MACD crossover has been confirmed on some timeframes, and the RSI sits at 58% — levels that suggest more room to climb but not runaway overheated conditions. Seasonal Patterns Add To The Optimism Based on reports and past data, October has a history of strong performance — “Uptober” shows an average gain of 20%. September registered a 5% rise, and the third quarter closed with 6% according to Coinglass. The fourth quarter’s average return has historically been large, at 78%, which is why some market participants are optimistic heading into the final months of the year. Buyers remain active, but the path up may not be smooth. A clear push above $120,000 would be a useful signal that new highs might follow, while a stumble into the liquidity clusters could force a quick pullback.

The new case adds to a long list of Meta’s regulatory and legal challenges in Europe after a court in the Netherlands ordered the company to overhaul its algorithm system. Meta Platforms has been ordered by a Dutch court to change how Facebook and Instagram present content to users, ruling that the company’s reliance on profiling and its design practices violate European Union digital regulations. Meta has just two weeks to comply with the judgment. Dutch court instructs Meta to overhaul its algorithm The District Court in Amsterdam found that both Facebook and Instagram fail to provide Dutch users with simple, direct options to access a timeline free from algorithmic profiling. Under the current design, users who select a chronological or non-profiled feed get their preference reset to a default “recommended” timeline whenever they close the app or website. The Amsterdam court concluded that it found a prohibited “dark pattern” amounting to a manipulative design tactic that nudges users toward less privacy-protective choices. According to the ruling, such practices undermine the right to freedom of information guaranteed under European law. “People in the Netherlands are not sufficiently able to make free and autonomous choices about the use of profiled recommendation systems,” the court stated , directing attention to the upcoming Dutch general election on October 29 and hammering on the importance of preserving genuine user choice. Meta must now provide a “direct and simple” mechanism for users to opt out of a personalized timeline and ensure that those preferences remain in place across sessions. If the company fails to comply within two weeks, it could face further legal and regulatory penalties. Meta plans to contest Meta has said it will continue to argue that it has already made substantial adjustments to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA). The Zuckerberg-led tech giant highlighted changes that allow users to access a chronological feed and claimed it had properly informed users in the Netherlands about those tools. A Meta spokesperson warned that the ruling risks undermining the EU’s unified digital regulatory framework. “The issue is a matter for the European Commission and regulators at the European level, not for courts in individual countries,” the spokesperson said. “Proceedings like this threaten the digital single market and the harmonized regulatory regime that should underpin it.” Meta also stressed that it had been proactive in aligning its platforms with the DSA, which came into force earlier this year. The law requires large platforms to provide transparency on how algorithms work, give users alternatives to profiling-based feeds, and avoid manipulative interface designs. The case was brought forward by Bits of Freedom, a Dutch digital rights organization. The group has long campaigned against algorithm-driven platforms that it argues erode users’ ability to control what they see online. “This ruling makes it clear that Meta must respect user preferences,” Maartje Knaap, the spokesperson for the group, said. “It is unacceptable that a few American tech billionaires can determine how we view the world.” The organization said that the judgment is a crucial step in reinforcing the goals of the DSA, particularly its focus on protecting citizens from coercive design practices. The Netherlands is preparing for a general election later this month, and regulators and courts across Europe are acutely aware of the role social media platforms play in shaping political debate. By requiring a persistent chronological feed option, the court aims to reduce algorithmic influence on voter exposure to political content. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

LDO broke out of a long-term descending channel, confirming trend reversal. Trading volume spiked into late September, validating the breakout and buyer interest. Market cap rose from ~$925M to ~$1.075B, the first move above $1B since mid‑2023. Lido DAO breakout: LDO rallies toward $2 with rising volume and >$1B market cap — technical analysis, key levels, and trading insights to guide your next move. Lido DAO breaks free from years of decline, sparking a fresh rally—could $2 be just around the corner? LDO breaks out of a long-term descending channel, hinting at the end of a prolonged bearish cycle. Bullish flag formation confirms buyer momentum, with trading volume rising sharply into September’s close. Market cap surges from $925M to $1.075B, signaling renewed investor confidence and strong inflows. Lido DAO is making a solid comeback after a long downtrend. With rising volume and steady price gains, LDO now looks ready to target the $2 level in the near-term trading sessions. What is the Lido DAO breakout and can LDO reach $2? Lido DAO breakout refers to LDO moving above a descending channel that contained the token for over two years. The breakout, backed by rising volume and a market cap reclaim above $1 billion, sets a technical path for a potential test of $2 if momentum and market conditions persist. How did LDO break out of its descending channel? LDO escaped a descending channel that ran from early 2023 through mid-2025 after price pushed above the upper trendline in mid‑2025. The move was validated by a surge in trading volume and a subsequent bullish flag breakout in late September. Short-term pullbacks were shallow, and the market-cap jump from ~$925M to ~$1.075B confirms renewed inflows. $Ldo #Ldo Getting Ready For Massive Rally pic.twitter.com/6c2l7FrpxZ — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) September 30, 2025 In mid-2025 the price finally surged above the upper trendline, signaling a breakout many traders expected. What made this move notable was the strong volume backing it, a typical sign that momentum was shifting from sellers to buyers. LDO formed a downward-sloping flag after the downtrend, which is a classic bullish continuation pattern. Late September’s break above this flag confirmed buyers controlled short-term price action. Source: CoinGecko Why does volume confirmation matter for this breakout? Volume shows the conviction behind price moves. LDO’s late-September volume spike coincided with price gains, indicating institutional or large retail participation rather than a thin-market pump. Volume sustained through the breakout day, which reduces the likelihood of a false breakout. Between September 24 and 26, LDO briefly dipped from $1.13 to just below $1.05. From September 27, the token recovered steadily, rising above $1.10 by the 29th and gaining near 10% on September 30 to about $1.20. At the same time, LDO’s market cap rose from approximately $925 million on September 26 to roughly $1.075 billion by September 30. This was the first time since mid‑2023 that market capitalization surpassed $1 billion, a psychological and technical marker that can attract renewed investor interest. Frequently Asked Questions What technical levels should traders watch for LDO? Watch the $1.20–$1.30 range as near-term support after the breakout. Immediate resistance sits near $1.50, with a larger target at $2 if momentum holds. Use rising volume and market breadth as confirmation signals. How soon could LDO test $2? If buyers maintain volume and the broader crypto market remains constructive, LDO could test $2 within several sessions to a few weeks. Persistent weakness in the market or volume drying up would make a $2 test less likely in the short term. Key Takeaways Breakout confirmed : LDO cleared a long-term descending channel with volume validation. Market-cap recovery : Market cap surpassed $1B, reflecting renewed investor confidence. Watch volume : Sustained volume is the key driver for a successful push toward $2. Conclusion Lido DAO’s recent breakout marks a clear change in market structure for LDO . The move above a two‑year descending channel, supported by rising volume and a market-cap rebound, sets up a plausible run toward $2 if macro conditions remain favorable. Monitor volume and market breadth closely and review official data sources such as CoinGecko for live metrics.

The move followed a quick rebound earlier in the week. After an intraday dip to $114,000 on Oct. 1, Bitcoin recovered to trade near $118,700 to $118,900 by Oct. 2, with highs reaching $119,500. The market leaned into seasonality, with Bitcoin posting average October gains of 14.4% since 2013. Broader crypto joined the advance. Ether rose 3.2% to $4,536. XRP added 1.8% to $3.04, while Solana gained 4.2% to $233.80. The total market value climbed about 2% to $4.2 trillion.

Even the US government shutdown that began at the start of the month, the first since 2018-2019, which furloughed over 90% of SEC staff and left the CFTC operating with skeleton crews of 5-6%, hasn’t derailed momentum, showing how resilient Bitcoin has become of late.” “Far from being a speculative outlier, Bitcoin continues to show its ability to defy the odds and assert itself as a digital asset with staying power. For long-term investors, the trend is clear, Bitcoin’s strength is structural, not seasonal.” Market veterans describe Uptober as a self-reinforcing mix of calendar flows and risk appetite. As funds rotate for year-end, liquidity improves and volatility often skews higher, which has historically favored upside in Bitcoin. BTC is looking amazing- but is this rally sustainable? With BTC reaching historical highs and massively overextended on this week's incredible Uptober rally, are there signs and signals pointing to a correction- or a gravity-defying continuation to $124k and beyond… pic.twitter.com/ro6WYJ0knu — Aaron Dishner (@MooninPapa) October 3, 2025 Derivatives Activity Builds As Uptober Momentum Extends Derivatives desks pointed to brisk activity around key round numbers, while spot volumes improved into the close. The tone echoed prior Octobers when momentum, once established, tended to persist for days. Regulatory uncertainty still looms, yet the immediate market read signalled resilience. Traders tracked headlines and monitored the pace of approvals and guidance, even as staffing at US agencies thinned during the shutdown. Przemysław Kral, CEO of zondacrypto, said: “The US government shutdown, now a reality, can damage the crypto industry by disrupting the SEC and CFTC, which are vital to global digital asset markets.” He warned that reduced staffing could slow innovation and dent investor confidence, with delays to guidance, approvals and enforcement. Work on items such as the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act may slip, and open questions around the Anti-CBDC Act could linger, weakening trust. Federal payment hiccups could nudge users toward stablecoins, and an underpowered SEC may also slow crypto ETF decisions. All of this could “offer industry leaders a chance to lobby for clearer, faster rules in post-shutdown budget talks,” he said. For now, momentum sets the tone. If Uptober follows its usual script, traders will watch whether $120,000 holds as support, while fund flows and macro cues steer the next leg.

Near Protocol’s AI delegates evolve from advisory chatbots to individual “digital twins” that cast votes aligned with member values. AI delegates learn user behavior to automate DAO voting Rollout is staged: advisory chatbots → group delegates → one delegate per member Participation averages 15–25% in many DAOs; delegates aim to improve representation AI delegates Near Protocol DAO: learn preferences, vote on behalf of members, reduce voter apathy — read how to prepare your account for delegate options. What are AI delegates for Near Protocol DAO? AI delegates are software agents developed for the Near Protocol DAO to represent member preferences in governance votes. They analyze user inputs and historical behavior to recommend or cast votes, aiming to improve low participation and make governance decisions faster and more consistent. When the AI delegates rollout, it will be done in stages, with early models similar to chatbots, then representing large groups, and finally, each DAO member. The Near Foundation is developing artificial intelligence-powered delegates to address low voter participation in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The goal is to turn routine governance decisions into near-instant computations by using agents that know member preferences. Lane Rettig, a researcher at the Near Foundation specializing in AI and governance, told plain text press that the AI-powered governance overhaul is still in development. The Near Foundation oversees the layer-1 Near Protocol. Lane Rettig explained the AI-powered governance overhaul in development for Near Protocol’s DAO. Source: Cointelegraph (plain text) How will AI delegates be trained on user behavior? Delegates are trained by combining explicit user inputs, voting history, and public messages on community channels. This includes interview-style onboarding, past vote records, and contextual signals from social platforms to model political and funding preferences. Near intends to use a verifiable training approach that provides cryptographic proof of training cycles and inputs to maintain alignment and transparency. Industry data shows adoption of AI agents in crypto has accelerated: investment manager VanEck estimated over 10,000 agents by end-2024 and forecasted significant growth into 2025. Why will a human remain in the loop? Near’s researchers emphasize a hybrid approach: AI can handle routine proposals, but humans will retain final authority on critical decisions like fund allocations or major strategy shifts. This preserves accountability and reduces the risk of catastrophic errors from autonomous agents. Rettig stated that delegates can nudge users and recommend votes, but certain categories of proposals require human judgment to “pull the trigger.” This hybrid model aims to balance efficiency with responsibility. When will the rollout happen and what stages are planned? Rollout is planned in stages: early agents will function like chatbots providing context and draft votes, then agents will represent groups with shared preferences, and finally one agent per individual member may be offered. Each stage prioritizes safety, transparency, and verifiable training records. Near’s main DAO already uses a sentiment and summarization tool called Pulse to surface important content and community trends. Early delegate models will have limited agency and focus on improving information flow and voter engagement before broader autonomy is allowed. What risks and safeguards are being discussed? Key risks include misaligned agent behavior, security vulnerabilities, and concentration of influence. Safeguards proposed include verifiable training logs, human-in-the-loop gating for critical votes, and phased deployment with monitoring. Experts recommend auditability and cryptographic proofs of training data to preserve trust. Platforms and researchers such as OpenAI and industry asset managers have highlighted both the potential and the security challenges of AI agents in decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions How do AI delegates improve DAO participation? AI delegates automate routine voting by representing member preferences and nudging informed participation, helping convert low-engagement members into represented votes and increasing effective turnout. Can delegates vote without user approval? Near’s stated approach favors human oversight; early phases emphasize advisory roles and explicit consent for automated voting, especially on high-impact proposals. Are delegate training methods auditable? The Near team plans verifiable training records that provide cryptographic proof of model inputs and training cycles to maintain alignment and enable audits. Key Takeaways AI delegates : Automate representation by learning member preferences and recommending or casting votes. Phased rollout : Starts with advisory tools, proceeds to group delegates, then individual digital twins. Human oversight : Critical decisions remain human-controlled; verifiable training and audits are planned. Conclusion The Near Foundation’s AI delegate initiative aims to reduce voter apathy and streamline DAO governance by using trained agents that reflect member preferences. With phased deployment, verifiable training, and human oversight, the project balances automation with accountability. Watch for staged releases and governance updates as the system matures. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/near-ai-delegates-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Near Protocol develops AI delegates to boost DAO participation"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199a819-89fd-7125-93a2-0fe8517a7d57""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""AI delegates for Near Protocol DAO learn member preferences to automate or recommend votes, aiming to reduce voter apathy and speed governance decisions.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How will AI delegates be trained?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Delegates are trained using user interviews, voting histories, and public community signals; Near plans verifiable training records to ensure alignment and transparency."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will humans remain in control of important votes?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

This brought strong advantages in terms of NAV anchoring and liquidity (bid/ask spread) compared to the past. But it still remains far too uncompetitive in terms of TER, even compared to Grayscale’s own solutions, such as ETH. September was negative, but I remain positive regarding “Uptober,” especially with the shutdown event. However, participating in a bullish market with the break of a 2.5% TER will fuel the performance price gap versus peers. Do you know Grayscale’s reason for 'Why ETHE ?' “First to trade, long operating history, expert sponsor.” Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? And I have to admit that, even if it’s a marketing catchphrase, I do recognize Grayscale as the first entity that really tried to connect traditional finance with the crypto market (for better or worse). It did it with Bitcoin, through GBTC, and then with Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE). But if you are now asking me: ""are we really sure that to participate in ETH-USD, at this stage, ETHE is still the best solution?"" My opinion is no. And now I’ll explain why. But what is ETHE? ETHE is really, for many, a “historical relic” and personally, it brings back “good” memories for me. Calling them “good” is, of course, a bit of an exaggeration, especially considering that it used to be traded OTC and had no creation or redemption program. ETHE - Fund profile (Seeking Alpha) Then, from July 23, 2024, a continuous creation/redemption program became active, and the shares are now tradable at NAV through Authorized Participants. Today it is no longer inefficient : now there's a very small premium (also a sign of demand support), and a negligible bid/ask spread of 0.03% (30 day median). Clearly, this is a sign of excellent liquidity after the uplisting. ETHE - Liquidity Grade (Seeking Alpha) But caution First of all, the ETF label is (in my opinion) a bit misleading, since in reality ETHE does not enjoy the typical protections of a ’40 Act ETF (it does not have the same safeguards as traditional ETFs). In fact, the update, while bringing operational efficiency, left aside some aspects that, in my view, make it less competitive compared to the new solutions on the market: and the first one worth considering is without a doubt the TER, equal to 2.50%. ETHE - Expense Grade (Seeking Alpha) Starting from the premise that both before and after the update, ETHE presented itself as a solution to replicate the spot price of Ethereum net of expenses, one more reflection is needed: if, to cover expenses, the Trust periodically sells ETH, each share progressively represents less Ether over time, this will feed the price gap compared to newly issued ETFs (in a marked way). Competition With the “green light” from the SEC, new ETFs have come, and while ETHE AUM remains all-time high (4.43B), I cannot help but note that Grayscale “houses in-house” another ((REAL)) ETF, which is much more convenient: ETH (which I’ve rated already here ). ETHE - ETH: profile (Seeking Alpha) Well, a solution still from Grayscale, but with a distinctive trait that in the long term will bring an advantage in terms of performance and replicability of the underlying: lower fees, since ETH has an expense ratio of 0.15%. And I emphasize this discrepancy, also pointing out how, despite this clear difference, ETHE’s AUM is still greater than that of ETH. The switch October 2025 marks a trend reversal compared to September. In my opinion, this inversion finds its explanation in the U.S. government shutdown. Why? Well, because, from a certain point of view, while the government stops and there are fears that the Fed may have to move blindly, the blockchain, without a central authority, keeps working; this, in my view, communicates a very strong message, a difference we often forget: blockchain is decentralization. And this reinforces the bullish sentiment in the market. BTC-USD; ETH-USD-Chart (Seeking Alpha) Now, the question is this: could this be a good time for the switch? I won’t take a position on this choice, because I am not a tax advisor. But I know that running into taxation for a simple switch could act as a handbrake on the strong compounding that had been built up on ETHE after these rallies. But in my honest opinion, the same would also be true of remaining exposed to ETHE with a 2.5% fee. Risk Those who are not familiar with the underlying (ETH-USD) must know that ETH is more fragile than BTC: the reaction to sentiment shocks and institutional outflows is typically more violent. And this is a fact that always concerns me a lot, especially after a strong wave of rallies. It must be said that ETH has clearly outperformed BTC in 2025, and I have listed the reasons here. But these volume swings also make ETHE’s price action potentially less solid, amplifying the extent of any negative contraction in case of a sudden sentiment reversal. In this sense, technical study helps me. Here's what I notice: A signal of strength would come from the breakout of the 200-day MA on the 1D timeframe, where the price is currently sitting. A support signal has already occurred when the ETH-USD price reacted positively to the 30-point threshold on the 14-period RSI (1D). ETH-USD: Chart (Seeking Alpha) Conclusion To conclude, I remain bullish on ETHE’s underlying, but I think the market offers much more competitive solutions, and you don’t have to look far to find them: ETH itself, within Grayscale, provides the advantage of a more competitive TER, which in the long term will likely translate into outperformance. The decision to switch is personal, and I cannot replace anyone in this choice. Simply, I am a financial analyst, not a tax advisor. That said, I still keep an eye on key technical support levels, considering ETH’s perhaps “too strong” rise in 2025.",ETH|ETHE,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-03 03:59:43

It has jumped by over 60% from its lowest level in September, giving it a market capitalization of over $3.14 billion. Aster price jumps amid network growth Aster, a perpetual decentralized exchange backed by Changpeng Zhao, has come into the spotlight recently amid its ecosystem growth. This growth has pushed it to overtake Hyperliquid, a company that has long dominated the perpetual futures industry. One of its key numbers is that the total value locked in Aster’s network has gone parabolic this year. It recently jumped to a record high of $2.30 billion, up from a low of $370 million in September. Most importantly, the volume handled on Aster has been in a strong uptrend, and to some extent, looks unreal. The network handled a volume of under $10 billion in August. This number then jumped to $420 billion in September. It has now handled over $237 billion this month so far, and we are just three days in. The surge in volume has also led to a parabolic jump in network fees. Aster made over $136 million in fees in September, a big increase from the $2.37 million it handled in August. It has already made nearly $40 million in fees this month. If these numbers are accurate, then it means that Aster is the fastest-growing player in the crypto industry of all time. It also means that more Aster tokens will be burned as the team has committed to incinerating part of its fees. Meanwhile, more data shows that the Aster network’s futures open interest has jumped in the past few days. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the open interest soared to over $1.35 billion on Friday, up from $626 million on September 26. The rising futures open interest is a sign of its robust demand among traders. Traders in the futures market are also highly bullish on the Aster token as the weighted funding rate has remained in the green since its token-generation event. The other potential catalyst for the Aster price is the potential exchange listings. It is now listed on exchanges like Bybit, MEXC, KuCoin, and BingX. There are signs that it will soon be listed on Binance, the biggest exchange in the industry. Besides, CZ, its founder, is one of its advisors. It may also be listed by other popular exchanges like Coinbase and Upbit, which will boost its price substantially. Aster coin price technical analysis Aster token chart | Source: TradingView The four-hour chart shows that the Aster price bottomed at $1.5098 on October 1 and then bounced back as the Uptober rally started. It has now moved above the upper side of the descending channel. Aster token is also approaching the psychological level at $2. It has also moved above the 25-period exponential moving average. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising in the coming days as the Uptober rally continues.

Many analysts initially predicted that the market’s leading cryptocurrency would achieve a milestone of $200,000 this year. However, as time progresses, these forecasts are being adjusted, with some traders on crypto prediction platforms lowering their price targets. Despite this, the potential for new all-time highs (ATHs) still lingers for the remainder of the year. Historical Data Points To New Records In Q4 Recently, the Bitcoin price once again surged past the significant $120,000 threshold, a level that has acted as a major resistance barrier over the past months. However, a sustained weekly close above this mark could set the stage for Bitcoin to reach new heights. This price movement follows the release of softer private payrolls data, which has bolstered expectations for potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Related Reading: Here’s Why Analysts Are Predicting A Massive Shiba Inu Price Rally In October According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders now estimate a 99% probability of a quarter-point reduction on October 29, a noticeable increase from 86% just a week earlier. As such, analysts from the Motley Fool remain optimistic, suggesting that the Bitcoin price could still achieve a price target of $140,000 by early 2026. Historical data supports this optimism, as Bitcoin has consistently shown strong performance in the fourth quarter (Q4). Over the years from 2013 to 2024, the average Q4 return for Bitcoin has been an impressive 85%. Notably, in 2020, Bitcoin saw an increase of 168% in the final quarter, while in 2017, it skyrocketed by 215%. Even further back to 2013, Bitcoin posted an extraordinary return of 480%. Key Months For The Bitcoin Price Looking at the data, October and November have historically marked significant turning points for the Bitcoin price. November stands out as the most lucrative, with an average return of 46%, followed closely by October at 22%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Calm Is Over — ‘Every Time This Happened, Price Went Vertical,’ Says Analyst Current predictions from prediction markets suggest that traders are granting Bitcoin a 63% chance of reclaiming its previous all-time high of $125,000 by the year’s end. The likelihood of Bitcoin reaching $130,000 by early 2026 stands at 47%, while the chance of hitting $140,000 has been estimated at 32%. However, the window for achieving higher price levels is quickly closing, as evidenced by a mere 22% chance of reaching $150,000 this year and only a 5% chance of hitting $200,000. Despite the optimism, Motley Fool analysts have noted that market sentiment has soured since August.

52593906,596114,1759464034,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum Breaks Key Resistance: Will ETF Inflows Help ETH Sustain Above $4,300?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-breaks-key-resistance-etf-inflows-help-eth/,"Currently trading near $4,380, Ethereum (ETH) recently broke above the $4,400 resistance level, a move that has fueled renewed optimism among investors despite a minor pullback. The boost occurred as crypto ETF inflows increased, institutional interest grew, and market sentiment suggested a potential prolonged bullish trend. However, questions remain about whether ETH can maintain momentum above $4,300 without facing short-term corrections. ETF Inflows and Institutional Demand Fuel Ethereum’s Rally The recent surge coincides with a wave of capital flowing into Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds. According to SoSoValue , ETH spot ETFs saw over $80 million in net inflows, continuing their winning streak for three consecutive days. This momentum shows Ethereum’s increasing appeal as the second-largest cryptocurrency and a key layer for decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenization. In the U.S., October is being called “ETF Month,” with regulators expected to decide on several crypto ETFs, including those linked to Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. Meanwhile, regulators in Asian countries like Thailand are working on frameworks to grow the altcoin ETF market. As a result, Ethereum is widely regarded as one of the leading beneficiaries of these institutional products beyond Bitcoin. Technical Outlook: Bullish But Overbought Ethereum’s break above $4,300 also indicates a technical breakout, backed by a sharp increase in trading volumes. Spot volume surged to $7.17 billion, while futures trading jumped to $97.3 billion, with open interest rising nearly 2% to $59 billion. This suggests that both retail and institutional traders are actively buying ETH at current levels. On the charts, ETH’s price has moved away from its 30-day moving average around $4,380, strengthening the bullish outlook. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stays near 52, signaling ETH is in a bullish zone. Historically, this often leads to periods of consolidation or mild pullbacks as traders take profits. Immediate resistance is at $4,450–$4,500, with strong support near $4,330–$4,350. Can Ethereum Sustain Uptober Momentum? The rally shows a 9.1% weekly rise in ETH’s price, boosting its market cap to $531 billion. However, not all signs are consistently positive. Analysts warn that staking growth has stabilized at 36 million ETH, ETF inflows slowed earlier this year before this rebound, and stablecoin liquidity on exchanges has decreased. These risks highlight the potential for volatility even as optimism grows. Still, as long as ETH stays above $4,300, the trend favors the bulls. If ETF inflows continue and risk appetite remains stable, Ethereum could soon challenge higher resistance levels near $4,600, with the $5,000 milestone back in reach. For now, Ethereum’s break above $4,400 signals that institutions and traders are willing to make significant bets on Uptober’s rally.

Unity vulnerability permits in-process code injection into Android Unity games, risking mobile crypto wallets. Unity has privately distributed patches and a standalone tool to selected partners; wider guidance is pending public release. Affected projects date back to 2017; users should update apps, avoid sideloading, and segregate wallets to reduce exposure. Unity vulnerability risks mobile crypto wallets. Update Unity-based apps now, avoid sideloading, and isolate wallets—learn how to protect yourself. By COINOTAG • Published: 2025-10-03 • Updated: 2025-10-03 What is the Unity vulnerability affecting mobile crypto wallets? The Unity vulnerability is an in-process code injection flaw that lets third-party code execute inside Unity-built apps on Android, potentially enabling overlays, input capture, or screen scraping that can target mobile crypto wallets . Developers should apply Unity’s private patch immediately and roll out app updates. How widespread is the issue and which platforms are affected? Sources indicate the flaw affects Unity projects going back to 2017. While Android is primarily impacted, Windows, macOS and Linux also show varying exposure. Unity Technologies is distributing fixes privately to partners; public patch guidance is expected shortly. Harold Halibut: one of the latest games made with the Unity engine. Source: Unity Why can this vulnerability threaten mobile crypto wallets? Sources describe the exploit as enabling “in-process code injection.” Even without full device takeover, injected code can perform overlays, capture input, or scrape screens to harvest credentials or wallet seed phrases. That behavior can directly target wallet apps or any sensitive text displayed while games run, increasing the risk to keys and recovery phrases. How can users and developers protect against the Unity flaw? Follow these prioritized steps to reduce risk: Developers: apply Unity’s patch or standalone tool immediately and push updated builds to app stores. Users: update Unity-based games as patches are released; do not install apps from third-party stores or APK websites (avoid sideloading). Users: disable unnecessary overlays and accessibility services while gaming to limit input-capture vectors. Security practice: segregate crypto wallets on a separate device or account strictly for key storage and transactions. What did major platform providers say? Google (as reported to news sources) has acknowledged the issue, advising developers to update and stating Google Play will help expedite patched app releases. Unity has provided private fixes to partners and plans public guidance soon. These statements were reported by news sources and are presented here as plain-text references. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can injected code in Unity games steal crypto wallet seed phrases?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Main event and alleged policy shift lack independent verification. Allegation: removal of a 15% CAMT on unrealized Bitcoin gains could alter institutional treasury strategies. Verification absent as of publication; Bitcoin showed a 9.79% seven‑day surge while trading volume fell ~15% (CoinMarketCap). US Treasury Bitcoin tax claims remain unverified; no official removal of the 15% CAMT on unrealized gains reported. Read the verification update and analysis now. What is the alleged US Treasury Bitcoin tax change? US Treasury Bitcoin tax claims refer to an alleged adjustment removing a proposed 15% CAMT on unrealized Bitcoin gains. As of October 3, 2025, no official US Treasury release or government filing confirms such a policy change; reports originate from unverified statements and secondary accounts. How would removing a CAMT on unrealized Bitcoin gains affect institutions? Removing a 15% CAMT on unrealized gains would lower the immediate tax burden on firms holding large Bitcoin treasuries and could incentivize larger institutional allocations to crypto assets. That said, absent formal guidance from the US Treasury or confirmed company filings, any market repositioning is speculative. What are the current market signals and data cited? Latest market snapshot (CoinMarketCap, cited as plain text): Bitcoin $120,383.08, market cap $2.40 trillion, circulating supply 19,928,203 / 21,000,000, seven‑day +9.79%, 24‑hour volume -15.07%.

No. As of the update timestamp (2025-10-03T03:59:43Z), there is no official U.S. Department of the Treasury release or government filing confirming removal of the 15% CAMT on unrealized Bitcoin gains. Why do markets react before official confirmation? Markets price expectations and unverified reports rapidly. Short‑term volatility often follows rumors or influential figures’ comments; without official confirmation, reactions can reverse when facts are established. Key Takeaways Verification matters : No official Treasury confirmation of a CAMT removal exists as of October 3, 2025. Market impact is speculative : Bitcoin’s recent price rise coincided with the claim but is not proof of policy change. How to proceed : Wait for official Treasury releases and company filings before making material portfolio changes. Conclusion Reports of a US Treasury Bitcoin tax adjustment for unrealized gains remain unverified. Front‑loaded facts show no confirmed removal of a 15% CAMT; investors and institutions should rely on official Treasury statements, company filings, and authoritative market data before adjusting strategies.

Perp DEX market in flux Perpetual futures — or perps — are crypto derivatives that allow traders to speculate on prices without an expiry date. The decentralized platforms that host them, known as perp DEXes, have surged in popularity as traders move activity away from centralized exchanges (CEXes) such as Binance. Scott noted that perp DEXes have expanded from less than 2% of CEX perpetual trading volume in 2022 to more than 20% last month. Hyperliquid, which issues the HYPE token, has been a key driver of that growth. Still, recent shifts have raised questions. Hyperliquid’s share of perp DEX volume fell from 45% to just 8% in recent weeks, while Binance-affiliated rival Aster ballooned to more than $270 billion in weekly trades. Other upstarts such as Lighter and edgeX also posted triple-digit percentage gains in activity. Why Hyperliquid still stands out Scott argued that Hyperliquid’s fundamentals set it apart. The exchange continues to generate strong revenue, trading at what he described as a reasonable multiple compared to peers, with user stickiness reflected in open interest. “Unlike volume and revenue, which measure activity, open interest measures liquidity. It’s much stickier,” he wrote, noting Hyperliquid still commands about 62% of the perp DEX open interest market. Beyond trading, Scott highlighted expansion plans including the HyperEVM network, already hosting over 100 protocols and $2 billion in total value locked and USDH, a stablecoin backed by reserves held with BlackRock and Superstate. Another initiative, HIP-3, would allow builders to launch new perps markets by staking large amounts of HYPE, creating what Scott described as a “supply sink” for the token. Scott cautioned that his thesis would be invalidated if Hyperliquid’s open interest or revenue dropped materially, or if USDH failed to gain liquidity over the next year. But for now, he maintains Hyperliquid is better positioned than competitors running heavy incentive programs.",Markets|Hyperliquid|DeFi|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-03 04:20:33

Sustained growth in demand has historically served as one of the backdrops for price rallies to occur, Much of that expansion is being driven by whales and ETFs. Large-holder balances are rising at an annualized pace of 331,000 BTC, a stronger trend than the 255,000 BTC recorded in Q4 2024, the 238,000 BTC at the start of Q4 2020, and a sharp contrast to the 197,000 BTC contraction that marked the weaker market in 2021. ETFs could add another layer as the products bought 213,000 BTC in Q4 2024, a 71% jump in holdings, and may be positioned to increase allocations into year-end. For that demand to translate into another breakout, momentum on the price side is still critical. On-chain valuation puts the key threshold at the Trader’s Realized Price of $116,000. A decisive move above that level would mark the transition back into the “BULL” phase of the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator and could open up a valuation band of $160,000 to $200,000 for Q4. The indicator compares bitcoin’s current market price with several realized price metrics — the average cost basis of different groups of investors recorded on-chain. When spot price climbs above those levels, the model interprets it as a shift into the “bull” phase, reflecting rising momentum and profits across the holder base. When spot price falls below, it flags the “bear” phase, signaling stress and unrealized losses. Market conditions entering October look strikingly similar to last year. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index has held between 40 and 50 in recent days, levels that historically mark the edge of bullish conditions. In 2024, the index broke above 50 at the start of Q4, just before bitcoin surged from around $70,000 to $100,000.

Japan’s SBI lending rollout and a pending U.S. ETF decision cycle framed the move, with resistance capping at $3.10 after heavy prints. News Background XRP climbed 3% between Oct. 2, 04:00 and Oct. 3, 03:00, rising from $2.98 to $3.03. The rally followed SBI Holdings’ expansion of institutional XRP lending services, signaling Japan’s deepening crypto push. Meanwhile, Ripple CTO David Schwartz announced his departure after 13 years, and seven XRP ETF applications remain under SEC review, with the first decisions expected Oct. 18. Prediction markets now price approval odds above 99%, reinforcing speculative inflows. Price Action Summary XRP traded a $0.15 corridor (4.9% range) between $2.95 and $3.10. At 16:00, price spiked from $3.00 to $3.06 on 212.6M tokens — more than double the daily average. Resistance hardened at $3.10, where 129M in turnover capped upside. XRP consolidated between $3.00–$3.05, signaling accumulation above the $3.00 line. In the final hour, XRP dipped from $3.03 to $3.02 amid profit-taking, with a 2.35M spike at 03:55 showing institutional rebalancing. Technical Analysis Support is confirmed near $2.99–$3.00, with multiple defenses holding the level. Resistance remains defined at $3.10, where institutional sellers concentrated. The session carved a consolidation band above $3.00, suggesting professional accumulation. Volume-led breakout attempts validate institutional participation, though conviction remains tethered to a sustained close above $3.10 to unlock the next leg toward $3.20. What Traders Are Watching?

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Net Position Change Is Now Neutral In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about how the behavior of the Bitcoin long-term holders has changed recently. The “ long-term holders ” (LTHs) refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. Statistically, the longer a holder keeps their coins dormant on the blockchain, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the LTHs with their relatively long holding time are considered to be the diamond hands of the network. This can make the behavior of this cohort worth keeping an eye on, as shifts in it can have consequences for the cryptocurrency as a whole, considering their standing. There are many ways to keep track of LTH behavior, with one method being through the Net Position Change metric. This indicator measures, as its name implies, the monthly net change in the Bitcoin supply held by the LTHs as a whole. Below is the chart for the metric shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in its value over the past year. From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin LTH Net Position Change was positive during the first half of 2025, but a shift occurred in July as the indicator flipped into the negative. This implies supply started exiting the cohort. Something to keep in mind is that while selling from the group can instantly register on the chart, the same isn’t true for buying. When LTH supply rises, it doesn’t mean accumulation is happening in the present, but rather that some buying occurred 155 days ago and those coins have now been held for long enough to become a part of the group. The LTH distribution continued through August and September, but with the start of October, the Net Position Change has returned back to a neutral value, indicating coins being sold by the group are now being balanced out by tokens maturing past the 155-day cutoff. In other words, their net profit-taking has calmed down. As the report explains: This cooling supply pressure suggests that the recent phase of long-term holder profit-taking may be easing, potentially leaving ETFs and new inflows as more decisive drivers of market direction. The spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also seen a shift recently, as another chart cited by Glassnode shows. As displayed in the graph, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs switched to outflows in late September, but the netflow has once again turned green for these investment vehicles. The analytics firm notes: Should this renewed demand align with reduced LTH selling, ETFs could provide a stabilizing force, offering a more constructive foundation for price resilience and supporting the conditions needed for a sustainable advance. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $119,700, up almost 8% over the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|Bitcoin HODLers|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 05:00:28
52595790,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=831771,1759467628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52595790.jpeg,"Analyst Forecast Ethereum (ETH) Breakout To $6,900 As Price Retests Crucial Resistance",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-breakout-to-6900-price-retests-resistance/,"As the crypto market kicks off October with a remarkable recovery, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to turn the $4,500 level into support after nearly two weeks. Some analysts forecast that a breakout from this crucial area could set the stage for a massive 50% rally in Q4. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ‘Uptober’ Begins With $220 Retest – Is It Ready For Second ‘Expansion Wave’? Ethereum Retests Next Major Resistance Ethereum has bounced 17% from last week’s lows and is retesting the next crucial level to reclaim. The cryptocurrency started this week by recovering from the recent market correction, which sent its price to a multi-week low of $3,815. Since then, the King of Altcoins has reclaimed the mid-zone of its macro range and broken past a major sell wall located around the $4,200-$4,300 levels. Amid this performance, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted that the next two major resistance levels to reclaim before a new all-time high (ATH) are $4,500 and $4,750. Similarly, Ali Martinez detailed that the $4,505 area is “one of the most important resistance levels to watch for Ethereum,” according to the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric. A rejection from this major level could lead to a retest of the $4,250 support, and potentially risk a new price drop if ETH breaks below it. Previously, some analysts cautioned that losing this area could open the gates for a fresh breakdown toward the macro range lows. On the contrary, reclaiming the $4,500 resistance would set the base for a challenge of the macro range highs, around the $4,800 level, in the coming weeks. Market watcher Lluciano pointed out that ETH appears to be forming a triangle formation since early August. He suggested that breaking out of this pattern could kick off a rally toward a new high above the $5,000 barrier, affirming, “Q4 is here, ETH new wave is imminent.” Meanwhile, Titan of Crypto highlighted a weekly bull flag pattern forming on ETH’s chart. According to the analyst, a breakout from the formation’s upper boundary, around the $4,500 area, could send the price into a 50% rally toward the $6,900 mark. ETH’s Weekly Close Could ‘Turn It All Around’ After closing September above the $4,100 area, analyst Rekt Capital affirmed that Ethereum is potentially developing a Monthly Bull Flag within this macro range. He explained that the cryptocurrency must reclaim the $4,200 in the higher timeframes to continue building on the formation’s base. Notably, closing the month below this level technically means ETH’s price is positioning for a bearish retest despite the current bounce, the analyst detailed, as it represents the mid-zone of the macro range. Nonetheless, Rekt Capital considers that “even though the Monthly Close wasn’t very appealing, price just needs to Weekly Close above the $4.2k mid-range to turn it all around.” He noted that the cryptocurrency displayed a similar performance in late 2021 and this past July, weekly closing above this level and post-breakout retesting it as support. This technical sequence enabled the price to reclaim the $4,600 area and position itself for new highs.

As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,502, a 4.1% increase in the daily timeframe.

LINK > $20 support; a break above $29 targets $46.59. LINK is above its 7‑day SMA; reclaiming $22 could accelerate gains to $24–$25. UBS and Swift pilots using Chainlink’s CCIP may drive institutional tokenized fund flows. Chainlink price eyes a breakout to $47 as technicals and UBS/Swift pilots boost adoption — read key levels, risk points, and actionable trade steps. What is Chainlink’s breakout outlook and key price targets? Chainlink price is showing a bullish setup if it sustains above the critical $20 zone and overcomes resistance near $28–$30. Analysts track a near‑term target of ~$29.11 and a longer extension to ~$46.59 using Fibonacci extensions and an ascending channel projection. How do technical indicators support a potential LINK breakout? On multiple timeframes, LINK has defended the $20 support, which aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement (~$20.12). The 3‑day chart shows price within an ascending parallel channel; a bounce from the lower band points to a move into the channel mid/upper range. Key technical levels: 7‑day SMA reclaimed (bullish), resistance cluster at $28–$30, 1.272 Fib extension near $46.59. If LINK drops below $20.12, downside targets include $15 and $12 as risk scenarios. When could Chainlink reach $29 and $46.59 according to structure? Price momentum toward $29 depends on sustained buying above $22 and clearing the $28–$30 resistance. The $46.59 projection is a longer‑term target derived from the 1.272 Fibonacci extension and the channel top; timing depends on market breadth and institutional inflows from tokenized fund pilots. Chainlink eyes breakout to $47, fueled by supportive chart structure and pilot integrations with UBS and Swift that could accelerate tokenized fund flows and real‑world usage. LINK holds above $20; breaking $29 could target $46.59 per Fib/channel analysis. LINK is above its 7‑day SMA; reclaiming $22 may spark a run to $24–$25. Chainlink joins UBS and Swift pilots to enable tokenized fund operations, adding real‑world adoption catalysts. Chainlink (LINK) is trading near $21.41 and is carving a recovery after recent correction. Strong technical setups and pilot integrations with major financial players support a scenario where LINK could break resistance and attempt a multi‑week rally toward higher Fibonacci targets. Why does the $20 zone matter for LINK? The $20 region aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement at $20.12 and prior breakout support. Holding this zone keeps the bullish invalidation level intact. Traders often use this area as a stop/invalid point—loss below it increases risk of a deeper decline. What does the 3‑day chart reveal about momentum? On the 3‑day timeframe, LINK trades inside an ascending parallel channel. The most recent bounce from the lower band and move toward the mid‑channel shows buyers stepping in. A close above the channel midline and the $28–$30 resistance would strengthen the case for the 1.272 extension target. Source: Ali Charts Via X How significant are UBS and Swift pilots for Chainlink’s fundamentals? Fundamental catalysts now include Chainlink’s Cross‑Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) pilots with UBS and Swift to enable tokenized fund transactions on‑chain. These pilots are part of Singapore’s Project Guardian and aim to connect ISO 20022 Swift infrastructure with on‑chain settlement triggers. Institutional adoption could materially expand addressable demand given the global fund industry’s scale. Sources mentioned in reporting include CoinDesk and official pilot announcements from participating banks and consortia (plain text references). Frequently Asked Questions What are the immediate support and resistance levels for LINK? Immediate support sits around $20–$20.12 (0.786 Fib); resistance appears near $22 (trendline) and $28–$30 (channel/top). A clear break above $29 increases the probability of extension to ~$46.59. How can traders interpret the UBS/Swift integration for price action? UBS and Swift pilots introduce a structural adoption narrative: tokenized fund workflows triggered on‑chain can increase utility and institutional demand for oracle services like Chainlink’s CCIP. This fundamental shift can support medium‑term price appreciation if pilot volumes scale. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are Chainlink's key support and resistance levels?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key support: $20–$20.12 (0.786 Fib).

IRS guidance defers tax on unrealized crypto gains until disposal Strategy can maintain its BTC treasury without triggering Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax on uPnL Strategy holds 674,143 BTC (~$76.5B); unrealized gains exceed $25B, avoiding an estimated ~$3.75B CAMT bill for now Strategy Bitcoin tax clarity: IRS guidance defers tax on unrealized gains, enabling continued BTC treasury strategy — read the implications and next steps for firms. What is the IRS guidance on unrealized crypto gains? The IRS guidance states unrealized gains on crypto are not currently taxed until the asset is sold. This temporary directive lets firms report tax liabilities only when crypto holdings are disposed, creating breathing room for corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies and reducing forced sell pressure. Key Takeaways How does the latest tax guidance benefit Strategy? It allows Strategy to continue with its BTC holding plan without selling assets to cover taxes, preserving long-term treasury positioning. What’s next for crypto tax clarity in the U.S? The directive is temporary while Congress considers digital-asset tax rules; eventual codification could change the landscape for corporate holders. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) confirmed the IRS clarification provides immediate operational certainty for its corporate Bitcoin strategy. The firm’s treasury now faces no obligation to convert holdings to fiat solely for tax payment on unrealized gains under this temporary instruction. The company welcomed the guidance, noting that tax on realized gains remains unchanged while unrealized gains are not treated as current tax events under the directive. This reduces the near-term risk of large-scale sell-offs by firms with significant BTC positions. Source: X How does this change the CAMT treatment for corporate crypto? The temporary IRS directive removes unrealized profit inclusion for CAMT purposes until a sale occurs. Previously, the CAMT framework would have required firms to include unrealized gains and losses on crypto assets in taxable calculations, potentially generating sizable tax liabilities without cash realization. Under the guidance, tax obligations are triggered by disposals rather than mark-to-market accounting for crypto. If CAMT as previously interpreted had applied, Strategy’s unrealized profit—reported at more than $25 billion—could have created an estimated CAMT liability near $3.75 billion (roughly 15% of uPnL). Source: CryptoQuant What do market participants say? Community analysts suggested the guidance reduces near-term selling pressure and may encourage other U.S. firms to accumulate Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets. Commentators noted Strategy’s shares (MSTR) rallied roughly 16% following the guidance, reinforcing its historical relationship as leveraged exposure to BTC, which rose ~8.6% over the same recent trading period. At the same time, the policy is temporary and subject to legislative action. Congressional debates on crypto taxation continue, with proposals ranging from transactional exemptions to expanded reporting rules. Some lawmakers warned that broad exemptions could reduce federal revenue materially. Frequently Asked Questions Will Strategy owe taxes if it holds Bitcoin and does not sell? No. Under the temporary IRS guidance, unrealized gains on Bitcoin held by corporations are not treated as taxable events until the assets are sold. Could Congress change this guidance? Yes. The directive is temporary while Congress examines digital-asset taxation; any legislative change could alter tax treatment and require firms to reassess treasury strategies. Key Takeaways Immediate relief : IRS temporary guidance defers tax on unrealized crypto gains until disposal. Corporate impact : Strategy can avoid forced liquidation to pay CAMT on uPnL, preserving BTC treasury strategy. Watch Congress : Legislative action could codify or overturn temporary IRS treatment; firms should monitor developments and maintain tax-compliant records. Conclusion The IRS’s temporary clarification provides meaningful operational certainty for Strategy and similar corporate Bitcoin holders. Strategy Bitcoin tax clarity reduces short-term liquidation risk and supports continued accumulation, but stakeholders should track Congressional activity and official guidance for potential long-term changes. COINOTAG will monitor updates and report legislative developments. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""IRS Guidance Lets Strategy Hold Bitcoin Without Tax on Unrealized Gains"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-155741.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T15:57:41Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T15:57:41Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/strategy-bitcoin-tax-guidance"" }, ""articleBody"": ""The IRS issued temporary guidance stating unrealized gains on crypto assets are not taxed until the asset is sold, allowing Strategy to continue its corporate Bitcoin holding plan without liquidating to cover taxes.

The conversation was shared by JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), who highlighted the remarks for the cryptocurrency community, as Schwartz’s comments opened up discussion about alternatives to the U.S. dollar’s long-standing position. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! David Schwartz indirectly says that #XRP will become the world’s reserve currency! pic.twitter.com/WRpnqa0RJO — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 1, 2025 Shifting Views on the Dollar During the conversation, Schwartz said he believes it is “quite realistic that a lot of the world is just done with the dollar as the reserve currency.” He noted that while the U.S. has benefited from this role, other countries may not see it as sustainable in the long term. In his view, several large nations might attempt to put forward their own currencies , but most countries would not want to see their geopolitical rivals in control of such a system. Schwartz compared the situation to his earlier experiences with banks. He explained that while major institutions like Deutsche Bank or JPMorgan Chase could build systems for the industry, thousands of smaller banks resisted using them due to competitive disadvantages. He suggested that nations may follow similar logic and avoid adopting a system controlled by their strongest competitors. Considering Digital Assets Schwartz outlined what he described as a potential success scenario for digital assets. He argued that if the U.S. dollar loses its position, many countries may hesitate to back a national currency from a rival power. He said, “Maybe they could settle on a currency that nobody could control rather than one controlled by their most powerful geopolitical rival.” In this view, a neutral digital asset could present itself as an option. Schwartz emphasized that no single country would want to see its rival’s currency replace the dollar, and therefore, a shared alternative might gain support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP as the Best Candidate Schwartz explained that countries may ultimately seek a neutral asset rather than accepting another rival’s currency, describing it as avoiding “the old boss with a new boss.” Among digital assets, XRP stands out as the most practical choice. It is already designed to handle global liquidity , with proven speed, low transaction costs, and the ability to scale for institutional use. Unlike Bitcoin or other tokens, XRP has positioned itself directly for financial settlement and cross-border utility, aligning with what nations would require in a reserve asset. The clip shared by JackTheRippler has strengthened the belief among many that XRP’s neutrality, functionality, and established adoption make it the strongest candidate to replace the U.S. dollar’s dominance and become the global reserve currency .

52596609,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=826213,1759468395,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52596609.jpeg,New York lawmakers propose taxing crypto miners based on their electricity usage,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/new-york-eyes-crypto-mining-tax/,"Senator Liz Krueger of New York and Assemblymember Anna Kelles have introduced legislation that would impose additional taxes on cryptocurrency miners for the power they consume in their operations. At its core, the Senate Bill S8518 is framed around two key goals: tackling climate change and making energy more affordable. It suggests that the crypto miners’ taxes will be funneled to the state’s Energy Affordability programs that cut energy costs for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. Senator Kruger confirmed, “The bill ensures that the companies driving up New Yorkers’ electricity rates pay their fair share, while providing direct relief to families struggling with rising utility costs.” This development follows New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ decision to end his reelection campaign Sunday evening, closing a term defined by controversy and his reputation as one of the nation’s most outspoken crypto-friendly leaders. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan throughout his tenure, the self-proclaimed “Bitcoin Mayor” made digital assets central to his brand—taking part of his salary in Bitcoin, pushing to scrap the city’s BitLicense rules, and championing New York as the “crypto capital” of the world. He also backed efforts to integrate blockchain into city functions, from education to record-keeping. Miners using 100% clean energy will be exempt from the new taxes if approved Kruger noted that cryptocurrency mining has pushed up electricity costs across New York by approximately $79 million per year for households and $165 million for small businesses, necessitating the bill. The draft proposes a tiered excise tax, exempting companies that use 2.25 million kWh or less annually, while charging 2 cents per kWh for those using between 2.26 million and 5 million kWh. Additionally, mining operations using 5 to 10 million kWh annually would be taxed at 3 cents per kWh, those consuming up to 20 million kWh at 4 cents, and facilities exceeding 20 million kWh at 5 cents per kWh. Nonetheless, the bill carves out an exemption for facilities using 100% renewable power. However, only crypto miners are singled out in the bill, even though AI and other advanced computing already surpass Bitcoin mining in energy consumption. While the legislation doesn’t cover AI facilities, a press release acknowledged that the industry is growing rapidly and consuming increasing amounts of power. Unfortunately for the cryptocurrency mining industry, which already operates on thin margins, an added energy tax could squeeze profits further, forcing grid-dependent miners to relocate to states or countries with lower energy costs. Though Senator Kruger defended the bill, saying, “Cryptocurrency miners provide very little benefit to New York State or to the communities where they are located, but create significant costs and burdens on ratepayers, the electric grid, the local environment, and our shared climate. This bill will ensure that the costs of those negative impacts will no longer be foisted on everyone else.” New York still has crypto businesses applying for a BitLicense The bill’s introduction follows the lapse of the state’s two-year moratorium on fossil fuel–driven proof-of-work mining, which was enacted in 2022 by a 36–27 Senate vote and expired roughly a year ago. The moratorium had blocked new applications or permits for power plants that burn carbon-based fuels to supply behind-the-meter electricity for proof-of-work crypto mining. It marked the first attempt of a U.S. state to restrict the rights of private businesses to choose what they are allowed to dedicate computational resources towards. New York still requires any virtual currency business in the state to hold a BitLicense. While it may sound like a routine business permit, the process can take months or even years and cost more than $100,000, making it a significant barrier for startups and even established firms.

This expiry event is back to normal following last week’s epic end of third quarter event, so there is unlikely to be any impact on spot markets, which have gained this week. US labor market data remains weak, which puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve to reduce rates again this month, a bonus for risk-on assets such as crypto. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.1, meaning that there are slightly more short contracts expiring than longs, as the bulls regain composure. Max pain is around $115,000, according to Coinglass. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $120,000, which has reached $2.2 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There is also around $1.9 billion OI at $140,000, but $100,000 is a popular strike price for short sellers with $1.6 billion in OI. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is around $49 billion, which has fallen over the past week. Additionally, total Bitcoin futures OI currently stands at $86.5 billion, which is still close to record highs, according to Coinglass. Meanwhile, ETF expert Eric Balchunas observed that BlackRock’s IBIT has surpassed Coinbase’s Derbit platform as the largest venue for Bitcoin options. $IBIT has surpassed Coinbase’s Derbit platform as the largest venue for bitcoin options with $38b in open interest. I told y’all ETFs are no joke.. Fat crypto margins in trouble. Nice find by @sidharth_shukla pic.twitter.com/LUcnpW5g4I — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 2, 2025 Earlier this week, crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the group was “experiencing frustration with the current market conditions, describing it as extreme choppy price action that’s difficult to trade profitably.” However, this was before the current rally. In addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options, around 216,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $987 million, maximum pain at $4,200, and a put/call ratio of 0.93. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $13.5 billion, reports Coinglass. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $4.3 billion. Spot Market Outlook Crypto markets are ending the week in the green with total capitalization up 1.4% to near record highs of $4.23 trillion. Markets have had a solid week, gaining more than 10% since the same time last Friday. Bitcoin was still leading the charge, topping $121,000 very briefly in late trading on Thursday before retreating to $120,000 during Friday morning trading in Asia. The asset has made a solid 10% gain over the past week. Ethereum was also making progress , notching an intraday high just over $4,500 during Asian trading. ETH is now up 14% since the same time last week. Meanwhile, BNB was at an all-time high of just below $1,100 at the time of writing.

This integration aims to reduce costs and friction while supporting trials with major global banks. SWIFT will use Linea (Ethereum layer 2) for its blockchain payments ledger Linea is a zk‑EVM rollup with low fees and ~1.5 tx/sec per reported metrics Linea has $2.27B TVL and major banks including Bank of America and JPMorgan are in trials SWIFT Linea: SWIFT is building its blockchain payments ledger on Ethereum Layer 2 Linea—learn how 24/7 real-time settlements will cut costs and which banks are testing the rail. Consensys boss Joe Lubin confirmed SWIFT will leverage the Ethereum layer 2 Linea blockchain to build its crypto payments ledger, signaling deeper TradFi and DeFi integration. What is SWIFT building on Linea? SWIFT is building a blockchain payments settlement platform on the Ethereum layer 2 Linea blockchain. The platform is designed for real‑time, 24/7 bank settlement using Linea’s zk‑EVM rollup to lower fees and speed finality for interbank transfers. How will Linea enable SWIFT’s crypto payments? Linea leverages zk‑EVM rollup technology to batch transactions and settle on Ethereum’s base layer. It processes roughly 1.5 transactions per second with fees reported at about one‑fifteenth of mainnet Ethereum costs. Linea currently shows $2.27 billion in total value locked, per L2BEAT data. Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson with Joe Lubin and Neal Stephenson. Source: Cointelegraph (plain text) Consensys CEO Joe Lubin confirmed Linea’s selection during a TOKEN2049 conference fireside chat. SWIFT’s announcement invited more than 30 TradFi institutions to participate in building and trialing a 24/7 crypto payments rail. Which banks are participating in trials? Major global banks taking part in trials include Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Toronto‑Dominion Bank. SWIFT handles roughly $150 trillion in global payments annually via traditional rails, indicating broad potential scale if blockchain rails are adopted. Why does this matter to TradFi and DeFi? Linea’s model reduces counterparty risk and settlement delay by enabling near‑instant finality without legacy intermediaries. For banks, this means lower operational costs and fewer reconciliation errors. For DeFi and community builders, Linea opens pathways for user‑generated applications built on Ethereum’s trust layer. How will this compare to existing blockchain payment systems? Linea’s zk‑EVM approach competes with other bank‑oriented rails like the XRP Ledger by focusing on Ethereum compatibility, stronger smart contract tooling, and a growing developer ecosystem. Linea ranks fourth in TVL among Ethereum layer 2s behind Arbitrum One, Base Chain and OP Mainnet per L2BEAT. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is SWIFT building on the Linea blockchain?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Not immediately. Trials with major banks will determine performance and scalability. SWIFT’s annual payment footprint is around $150 trillion, so adoption would be phased and subject to regulatory and operational validation. How secure is Linea for bank settlements? Linea inherits Ethereum’s settlement security while using zk proofs to compress transaction data. Security depends on rollup design, validator economics, and ongoing audits. Independent security reviews and institutional testing are underway. Key Takeaways Linea selection: SWIFT will build its blockchain payments ledger on Ethereum layer 2 Linea, confirmed by Consensys CEO Joe Lubin. Performance & cost: Linea uses zk‑EVM rollups, with reported ~1.5 tx/sec and fees at roughly one‑fifteenth of Ethereum mainnet costs.

At the same time, US Senator Ted Cruz blocked a sweeping privacy bill that wanted to restrict data brokers from selling Americans’ personal information. He did this due to law enforcement concerns but left the door open to revisions. The privacy debate gained a lot of urgency in the crypto industry as well, after several high-profile attacks linked to leaked data. Energy Tax Puts Pressure on Crypto Mining New York State Senator Liz Krueger introduced new legislation that could reshape the crypto mining landscape in the Empire State. The proposed bill seeks to impose excise taxes on the energy that is consumed by crypto mining operations. The move was made amid rising concerns over the industry’s environmental impact and its reliance on high levels of electricity. The tax structure is tiered, starting with an exemption for miners using 2.25 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) or less annually. Those consuming between 2.26 million and 5 million kWh would face a tax of 2 cents per kWh, while consumption between 5 million and 10 million kWh would be taxed at 3 cents per kWh. Larger operators consuming up to 20 million kWh would see a 4-cent tax, and those exceeding 20 million kWh annually will be taxed at 5 cents per kWh. The proposed crypto mining tax legislation (Source: New York Senate ) Operations that rely on 100% renewable energy are exempt from the proposed levy, which will help with the state’s effort to incentivize clean energy use after the two-year moratorium on fossil fuel-powered mining, which expired in 2024. The bill also comes at a time when crypto mining is already grappling with razor-thin profit margins, rising costs, and increasing network difficulty. Electricity has always been the single most critical input for miners, and the proposed tax could push operators relying on grid power further into unprofitability. Some may be forced to relocate to more favorable jurisdictions without any added costs. Companies with the means to secure land and build facilities around renewable energy sources stand to gain a massive competitive edge, as they can bypass retail grid pricing and avoid the excise tax altogether. This widens the gap between well-capitalized mining giants and smaller operators who do not have access to cheap, sustainable energy. The economic pressures are already visible. In the first quarter of 2025, energy prices in New York averaged about $0.08 per kWh, which was a sharp rise that squeezed profit margins. TeraWulf, with a facility in upstate New York, reported that the doubling of energy costs relative to revenue contributed to a $61.4 million loss during the period. Median cost of mining 1 Bitcoin (Source: TheMinerMag ) At the same time, the median cost of mining a single Bitcoin surpassed $70,000 in the first quarter of 2025. This is according to data from TheMinerMag . Ted Cruz Blocks US Privacy Protections Push In another legislative move, US Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blocked a major privacy bill aimed at protecting Americans from the practices of data brokers. He argued that law enforcement still needs access to certain information and that the legislation requires further refinement. The bill, Senate Bill 2850 , was introduced by Democrat Senator Ron Wyden and seeks to restrict brokers from selling sensitive personal data, which can include addresses, financial information, and phone numbers, to virtually anyone willing to pay. Wyden argued that these practices enabled violence, stalking, and other crimes, and insisted that stronger protections are urgently needed. Bill 2850 Cruz is a longtime critic of government surveillance and central bank digital currencies, and was the only senator to oppose the measure, specifically due to concerns that restricting access to data could interfere with monitoring convicted sex offenders. He also blocked a narrower privacy bill that was introduced immediately after, which would have extended protections specifically to lawmakers, government staff, and survivors of sexual assault or domestic violence. However, Cruz said he was open to working with Wyden to improve the proposals, as Congress must avoid “doing nothing” while privacy concerns mount. The debate comes at a time when privacy and data security are hot-button issues both in Washington and in the cryptocurrency community. Limiting what data brokers can sell could also reduce the risk of data breaches, which still threaten individuals and institutions in the United States and abroad. The push for stronger protections gained some momentum after the June assassination of former Minnesota Representative Melissa Hortman , whose attacker is believed by the FBI to have obtained her home address through a data broker. The incident shed some light on the dangers of data exposure. The crypto community has also seen a surge in targeted attacks, with over 50 incidents of kidnappings and killings linked to leaked home addresses in 2025 alone. This is according to data compiled by Bitcoiner Jameson Lopp . Adding another layer to the discussion, Wyden confirmed on Wednesday that he is investigating Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital, over allegations of improper tax practices. Wyden claims Morehead misrepresented his residency status and used Puerto Rico’s tax system to avoid more than $100 million in US taxes, despite earning the bulk of his capital gains while based in California.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-03 05:30:00

The ChatGPT maker released a statement with emails, X posts, court filings, and opinionated articles to shun Elon Musk’s legal charges against it. According to the firm, the xAI head has no grounds to accuse OpenAI of trade secret theft, and this is one case among several attempts to slow down the company’s progress in the AI industry. “We will protect our employees and won’t be intimidated by his attempts to bully them,” the OpenAI newsroom wrote. OpenAI fights against Musk’s lawsuits OpenAI has rejected allegations that it had stolen employees or confidential information from Musk’s AI startup, xAI. The AI company also argued that the business structure change lawsuit, which has paused its plan to change from a non-profit to a for-profit organization, was just Elon’s way to generate headlines and not his legitimate grievances. “Elon’s nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit,” the company said. “He’s been spreading false information about us. We’re building the best-equipped nonprofit the world has ever seen; we’re not converting it away.” The firm accused Musk of abandoning OpenAI’s mission years ago, noting that he had once sought to merge the project with Tesla to give himself control over its direction. Elon’s never been about the mission. He’s always had his own agenda. He tried to seize control of OpenAI and merge it with Tesla as a for-profit – his own emails prove it. When he didn’t get his way, he stormed off. Elon is undoubtedly one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our… — OpenAI Newsroom (@OpenAINewsroom) April 9, 2025 According to OpenAI, when the company considered transitioning to a for-profit model in 2017, Tesla’s CEO reportedly demanded majority ownership, control of the board, and the chief executive role. When OpenAI resisted, citing the need to avoid any single person holding absolute control, Musk allegedly withheld funding he had promised to issue. Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, stepped in to cover employee salaries and keep the operation running. In early 2018, Musk forwarded emails suggesting Tesla could serve as OpenAI’s financial engine as the “only path” to compete with Google’s DeepMind. The emails showed Musk believed even Tesla’s resources gave it only a small chance of counterbalancing Google. “Even raising several hundred million won’t be enough. This needs billions per year immediately, or forget it,” one of the emails read . Motion to dismiss illegal hiring practices claims OpenAI has also filed a motion to dismiss Musk’s lawsuit on its hiring practices, propounding that it lawfully recruits top researchers, engineers, and developers from every part of the industry. “Unable to match OpenAI’s innovation, xAI has filed this groundless trade secret lawsuit,” the defense filing stated. “To be clear: OpenAI does not need or want anyone’s, much less xAI’s, trade secrets to achieve OpenAI’s mission.” The company accused Musk of attempting to intimidate staff and discourage those who would want to defect from his AI venture by turning legal action into a public relations weapon. Lawyers for OpenAI coined the complaint “lawfare” meant to overwhelm the company with lawsuits. In addition to trade secret claims, xAI has raised concerns over OpenAI’s collaboration with Apple, insisting that integrating ChatGPT into certain iPhone features constitutes anticompetitive conduct. OpenAI’s attorneys dismissed the argument, saying xAI had not shown any measurable harm that would require antitrust laws to step in. “xAI has not alleged any non-speculative harm rising directly out of ChatGPT’s integration as an option for certain features on certain iPhones. And certainly not the kind of unlawful harm targeted by antitrust law,” the attorneys noted. OpenAI surpasses SpaceX in valuation The legal battle comes at a time when OpenAI’s market value has reportedly crossed SpaceX, the rocket company Musk has spent two decades building. According to The New York Times, OpenAI completed a deal that allows current and former employees to sell shares at a $500 billion valuation. Roughly $6.6 billion worth of stock changed hands in the transaction, sources familiar with the matter said. Investors included Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price.

This concentration now equals about 3.2% of circulating Bitcoin supply and drives significant market influence. Strategy holds 640,031 BTC valued at $77.4 billion. That represents 3.2% of circulating Bitcoin and roughly 48% of corporate BTC treasuries. Strategy added 11,085 BTC in seven weeks; its most recent purchase was 196 BTC. Strategy Bitcoin treasury hits $77.4B with 640,031 BTC — analysis, comparisons, and expert context. Read key takeaways and implications now. What is Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury and how large is it? Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury is the firm’s corporate holding of BTC, currently totaling 640,031 BTC and valued at approximately $77.4 billion as of publication. This vault equals about 3.2% of circulating Bitcoin and surpasses the market cap of several major banks by headline comparison. How did Strategy build its Bitcoin holdings? Strategy accumulated BTC over years through recurring purchases and long-term holding policies. Michael Saylor noted the company started with a $0.25 billion position and absorbed early unrealized losses before reaching today’s valuation. Recent activity shows 11,085 BTC purchased in the last seven weeks, with a latest buy of 196 BTC. Source: Michael Saylor Why does Strategy’s treasury matter to markets and comparisons? Front-loaded holdings at this scale affect liquidity and public perception. A single entity holding 3.2% of circulating BTC concentrates supply, which can amplify price moves during sustained buying or selling. Strategy’s treasury now exceeds the market capitalization of multiple major banks and rivals the GDP of several small countries. A stash bigger than an entire nation’s GDP Strategy’s 640,031 BTC is roughly 48% of public and private corporate BTC treasuries. At current prices, the $77.4 billion valuation can be compared to national GDPs and major asset benchmarks for perspective. Comparative snapshot: Strategy vs peers and nations Entity BTC Held Approx. Value Strategy 640,031 BTC $77.4 billion MARA Holdings 52,477 BTC ~$6.3 billion El Salvador (nation-state) 6,338 BTC ~$762.5 million With $77.4 billion you could theoretically buy about 2,566,667 cars at $30,000 each or roughly 385,000 houses at $200,000 each. The holding is comparable to the annual GDPs of countries such as Uruguay, Sri Lanka, and Slovenia (national GDPs cited as public economic data). How does Strategy compare to nation-state and corporate treasuries? Public and private companies together hold about 1.32 million BTC, equal to 6.6% of total supply and an estimated $159 billion market value at current prices (BitcoinTreasuries.NET aggregated figures). Strategy alone accounts for nearly half of that corporate total. What does this concentration imply for corporate treasury risk? Large concentration raises both strategic advantages and risk exposure. Advantages include a long-term inflation hedge and balance-sheet diversification. Risks include market liquidity constraints, regulatory scrutiny, and concentrated counterparty perception. Expert commentary emphasizes prudent disclosure and robust treasury governance. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many bitcoins does Strategy hold?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Strategy holds 640,031 BTC, valued at about $77.4 billion at current market prices."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does Strategy hold more Bitcoin than some countries' GDP?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Is Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury publicly disclosed? Yes. Strategy has publicly reported its BTC holdings and periodic purchases. Michael Saylor has publicly commented on the company’s initial position and subsequent valuation growth. Key Takeaways Scale: Strategy holds 640,031 BTC, worth about $77.4B, representing a major corporate concentration of Bitcoin. Market impact: That stake equals ~3.2% of circulating supply and ~48% of corporate BTC treasuries, amplifying liquidity considerations. Comparative context: Strategy’s vault is comparable to the GDPs of several small nations and exceeds the market caps of multiple major banks. Conclusion Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury marks a defining moment in corporate crypto allocation. The $77.4 billion holding underscores how a single corporate treasury can shift comparative value metrics against banks and nations. Market participants should monitor liquidity implications, regulatory developments, and corporate disclosure for ongoing impact.

Analysts point to strong on-chain fundamentals, institutional accumulation, and ETF inflows. CryptoGoos called the current chart “the most bullish” they’ve seen, while other market commentators note reclaimed supports and defined upside targets at $4,500 and $4,750. Historical performance after similar accumulation events tends to show accelerated rallies, though past performance is not guaranteed. What role do ETF flows play in ETH price movement? ETF inflows increase demand from institutional and retail investors using regulated vehicles. Ethereum spot funds recorded $80.79 million in inflows, which complements direct accumulation by companies like BitMine and can support price discovery by adding persistent buying pressure into the market. Frequently Asked Questions How many ETH did BitMine buy and what are their total holdings? BitMine purchased 234,846 ETH (~$1 billion), increasing its total holdings to approximately 2.65 million ETH, valued at roughly $11 billion at recent prices. Did BitMine’s purchase affect BMNR stock? Yes. BMNR stock rose about 3.46% in pre-market trading to $54.10 following the announcement, reflecting investor interest in BitMine’s growing crypto treasury. Are ETF inflows significant for Ethereum’s price? Yes. U.S. spot Ethereum funds recorded $80.79 million in inflows, adding regulated demand that can support price momentum alongside direct institutional purchases. Key Takeaways Institutional accumulation matters : BitMine’s $1B buy materially reduced available ETH supply. Market reaction : ETH rose 5.39%, surpassing Bitcoin’s gains and lifting BMNR shares. Watch levels : $4,250 reclaimed support and analyst targets at $4,500–$4,750 guide short-term monitoring. Conclusion Ethereum price momentum reflects a mix of large-scale corporate accumulation, ETF inflows, and positive technicals. BitMine’s purchase and continued fund inflows improve demand-side fundamentals, while analysts set higher targets. Investors should monitor treasury disclosures, ETF flows, and support/resistance levels for signs of sustained trends. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Ethereum price rises 5.39% after BitMine's $1B purchase, boosting BMNR stock"", ""description"": ""Ethereum price surge after BitMine's $1B ETH purchase lifted ETH 5.39% to $4,389; BMNR stock rose and analysts set higher targets.

Kazuo, however, warned that global uncertainties may discourage firms from raising wages, leaving the timing of the central bank’s next rate hike unclear. Kazuo met with local business leaders in Osaka today to reiterate the BOJ’s commitment to keep raising interest rates if the economy and prices move in line with its forecasts. However, he refrained from offering any clear signal on whether the board would act at its next policy meeting later this month. The Yen weakens following Ueda’s remarks in Osaka Governor Kazuo Ueda revealed today that policymakers will monitor developments in the global economy, wage and price trends, and the impact of U.S. tariffs on Japan’s corporate profits before making their next decision. “If the baseline scenario for economic activity and prices outlined so far is realized, the bank, in accordance with improvement in economic activity and prices, will continue to raise the policy interest rate.” – Ueda Kazuo , BOJ Governor The Bank of Japan Governor emphasized risks surrounding Japan’s outlook, citing signs of weakness in the U.S. labor market and the potential pullback from higher American tariffs. According to Ueda, if uncertainty regarding overseas economies and trade policies remains high, firms may place stronger emphasis on cost-cutting and may weaken their efforts to reflect wage increases. He revealed that the future course of the U.S. economy and the conduct of monetary policy could significantly impact Japan’s economy and prices, prompting them to monitor the situation closely. Following Ueda’s remarks, the yen weakened by 0.35% to around 147.67 against the dollar at the time of publication. Akira Moroga, Chief Market Strategist at Aozora Bank, said that the governor’s dovish comments prompted the sell-off. Bloomberg report revealed that traders in the overnight swaps market see a 60% chance of a move at the October 29–30 meeting, up from about 22% in early September. However, some economists expect that a decision to change the rates could come later, in December, depending on incoming data. Shotaro Mori, senior economist at SBI Shinsei Bank, revealed that if the tariff impact intensifies, hard data on Japan’s third-quarter economic growth and corporate profits would be more decisive than Governor Ueda’s latest speech. Ueda says inflation is likely to increase, keeping the market guessing The Osaka address followed the release of the BOJ’s Tankan survey earlier this week. Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida stated that the survey indicates business sentiment remains at favorable levels, suggesting the economy is developing in line with the central bank’s projections. That is an essential condition for further tightening, though Ueda stopped short of signaling a clear path. At the September meeting, two members, Naoki Tamura and Hajime Takata, voted in favor of a rate hike, marking the first time under Ueda’s tenure that more than one member dissented. A dovish policymaker has also recently called for considering a shift sooner, reinforcing speculation that the bank is edging closer to its subsequent adjustment. Ueda addressed inflation issues directly, saying the underlying inflation, which excludes temporary or one-off factors, is likely to increase alongside actual price increases. His remarks marked a shift from the BOJ’s policy statement in September, which suggested underlying inflation would remain sluggish before gradually increasing. The governor also warned that prolonged rises in food prices could weigh on consumption and dampen broader inflationary momentum. Japan’s inflation has maintained above the BOJ’s 2% target for more than three years, but the central bank’s policies have been cautious. The BOJ ended its decade-long stimulus program last year and raised interest rates to 0.5% in January, marking its first hike in years. Ueda has since emphasized the importance of ensuring that price gains are backed by wage growth and robust domestic demand before tightening further.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-expert-to-xrp-holders-youre-being-tricked-heres-why/,"Levi Rietveld, the creator of Crypto Crusaders and an advocate for XRP, has issued a strong message to investors reacting to the latest U.S. government shutdown. Addressing cryptocurrency holders, he argued that selling XRP out of fear would be a costly mistake. According to Rietveld, the market’s behavior during prior shutdowns demonstrates resilience. He cited historical patterns showing that “with an 86% accuracy, 12 months later, the stock market and the crypto market actually closed higher.” In his view, the fear-driven decisions some investors consider today ignore established trends and the conditions currently shaping the financial landscape. XRP HOLDERS YOU’RE BEING TRICKED!! #XRP pic.twitter.com/kdIXz1aw2I — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 1, 2025 Historical Trends and Market Performance In the past, Government shutdowns have created short-term volatility, but the data often show a recovery over the following year. Rietveld emphasized that these shutdowns have rarely translated into lasting downturns for equities or digital assets. His remarks point to market history as a guide for interpreting present conditions, suggesting that panic selling would cut investors off from potential long-term gains. Alongside shutdown concerns, monetary policy remains another major factor. Rietveld referenced the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts . He expects multiple rate cuts before the end of the year. He views them as a critical driver for asset values, having recently set a $20 target for XRP , with multiple rate cuts playing a significant role in reaching that level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP and Market Recovery Patterns Rietveld’s focus on XRP reflects his continued advocacy for the asset, which has maintained a vocal community of supporters despite periods of market turbulence. He stressed that downturns tied to external events should not outweigh evidence of recovery patterns. He also pointed to tariffs as an example of how disruptive policies may initially weigh on prices but often lead to recoveries. Referring to that past environment, he described a V-shaped recovery that followed once markets found a bottom. His comparison suggests he sees similarities between those conditions and the pressures emerging from the current shutdown situation. For investors holding XRP or other cryptocurrencies, Rietveld’s comments serve as a call to remain patient. While short-term declines remain possible, his stance is that longer-term outcomes are shaped by established market behaviors and supportive financial policy shifts. He concluded that selling assets under present conditions risks missing an eventual rebound, and investors who panic can quickly lose out on significant profits .

Solana consolidates at $200–$220 with buyers defending key support. DeFi TVL on Solana is $12.264B and stablecoin liquidity is $14.371B, improving on-chain depth. Institutional staking plans for $500M in SOL and concentrated liquidations near $213–$219 could drive volatility. Solana price consolidates at $200–$220 after a $234 peak; see TVL, staking news, and short-term outlook — read the full update now. Solana consolidates between $200–$220 after peaking at $234, with rising DeFi TVL, $500M institutional staking, and projections toward $425. Solana (SOL) recently showed a strong bullish rally with a peak near $234 before facing heavy rejection and pulling back. The price is now consolidating between $200 and $220, with buyers attempting to defend key support as traders monitor the next market move. What is driving Solana’s current price consolidation? Solana price consolidation is driven by profit-taking after a $234 high, lower trading volume and growing on-chain fundamentals such as rising DeFi TVL and institutional staking plans. Short-term resistance sits near $220; a sustained move above that level could resume the prior uptrend. How significant is DeFi TVL and stablecoin liquidity for Solana’s outlook? On-chain metrics show Solana’s Total Value Locked at approximately $12.264 billion, with stablecoin liquidity near $14.371 billion. These figures indicate improving capital depth on the network, which can support larger on-chain activity and reduce short-term volatility during consolidation periods. Source mentions: DeFiLlama (TVL data), market on-chain analysts. $SOL recently showed a strong bullish rally with a peak near $234 before facing heavy rejection and pulling back. Now, the price is consolidating between $200–$220, where buyers are attempting to defend support — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru), October 1, 2025 The 4-hour chart shows smaller gains before a stronger bullish phase in early September that pushed prices above $240, followed by a rapid reversal in mid-September. Prices subsequently settled into the $200–$205 range and have traded between $200 and $220 since, with repeated rejections near $220. Lower volume suggests reduced volatility for now. How does institutional staking affect Solana’s market structure? Institutional interest is rising: VisionSys announced plans to acquire and stake $500 million in SOL using Marinade Finance as a partner. Marinade’s institutional lead, Scott Gralnick, highlighted security and liquidity for treasury staking programs. Institutional staking removes supply from exchanges, which can tighten available liquidity and support higher prices over time. Source: NekoZ(X) Derivatives positioning shows concentrated liquidation clusters between $213–$219, indicating a potential short squeeze if momentum returns. Chart analysts such as NekoZ note a strong move off recent lows with near-term resistance around $299 and extended upside scenarios toward $425 if bullish momentum persists into 2026. Derivatives mention: CoinGlass (liquidation data). Frequently Asked Questions Is Solana likely to break above $220 soon? Short-term probability favors consolidation; a breakout above $220 on increasing volume would raise the odds of a move toward $299, while a drop below $200 could deepen the correction. Watch volume and derivatives clusters for confirmation. How does institutional staking change SOL supply dynamics? Large-scale staking (e.g., a planned $500M stake) reduces liquid supply and can support higher prices over time if staking is locked long-term. Institutional treasury staking also signals confidence from large investors. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Solana likely to break above $220 soon?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A breakout above $220 requires increased volume; if confirmed, targets near $299 are possible.

On-chain strength : DeFi TVL ~ $12.264B and stablecoin liquidity ~ $14.371B support ecosystem growth. Institutional flows : A planned $500M institutional stake could reduce liquid supply and bolster long-term outlook. Conclusion Solana price remains range-bound at $200–$220, balanced between short-term technical resistances and improving on-chain fundamentals such as rising TVL and institutional staking interest. Traders should watch $220 and $200 for breakout or breakdown confirmation.

Laser, based in Switzerland, is in pre-consultation talks with Japan’s Financial Services Agency, according to Chief Executive Officer Jez Mohideen. Mohideen told Bloomberg that the application reflects the group’s confidence in the country’s digital asset ecosystem. Transaction Value Doubles As Investors Embrace Digital Assets In Japan Japan’s crypto trading market has expanded rapidly this year. Data from the Japan Virtual and Crypto assets Exchange Association showed that the value of transactions doubled to ¥33.7 trillion, or about $230b, in the first seven months alone. Nomura Holdings plans to expand in Japan’s digital-asset market through a subsidiary, as crypto trading in the country heats up https://t.co/vV6z8i9JTZ — Bloomberg (@business) October 3, 2025 Supportive policies abroad, particularly in the US, and anticipated changes at home such as tax cuts and new rules for crypto-focused funds have fueled the momentum. The move by Nomura comes as cryptocurrencies push further into mainstream financial services in Japan. Daiwa Securities, the country’s second-largest brokerage, announced this week that clients at its 181 retail branches can now use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral to borrow yen. Government Reforms On Tax And Rules Boost Market Participation In Japan Nomura unveiled Laser in 2022 to offer services ranging from asset management to venture capital. The unit secured a full crypto business license in Dubai in 2023 and set up a Japanese subsidiary the same year. If granted approval, Laser plans to provide broker-dealer services for both traditional financial institutions and crypto firms, including digital-asset exchanges operating in Japan. Industry observers say that younger investors and institutional players are increasingly turning to digital assets as part of their portfolios, particularly as the government moves to ease tax burdens and refine rules. Japan’s market has also drawn global attention for its pace of growth. In the 12 months to June 2025, the country recorded a 120% increase in on-chain value received , outpacing South Korea, India and Vietnam. The growth has been helped by reforms treating more tokens as investment instruments and the licensing of the first yen-backed stablecoin issuer. Global Institutions Eye Japan’s Fast Evolving Crypto Market Landscape Still, Laser’s performance has not been without challenges. Nomura reported a quarterly loss in Europe earlier this year, partly linked to what CFO Hiroyuki Moriuchi described as the unit’s “not very good” results. Mohideen had initially expected Laser to turn a profit within two years of its launch, though he later cautioned that breaking even might take longer. Even with those setbacks, the planned expansion into Japan signals Nomura’s intent to solidify its role in a market that is evolving quickly and attracting global financial institutions. For regulators, the arrival of new players such as Laser highlights the balancing act of fostering innovation while maintaining strict oversight.

Breakout above $112 triggered a rapid 10% gain in 24 hours. Sharpe Ratio rose to ~2.3, indicating improved risk-adjusted returns. Futures Open Interest climbed by about $100M to $703M, pointing to more leveraged positions. Litecoin price surge: LTC broke $112 and rallied 10% in 24h; Sharpe ratio 2.3 and OI +$100M. Read trade-ready analysis and next technical targets. What triggered Litecoin’s recent price surge? Litecoin price surge began after LTC cleared a persistent flag resistance near $112, producing a swift 10% advance in 24 hours. The breakout aligned with rising derivatives activity and an improving Sharpe Ratio, suggesting momentum driven by both spot buyers and leveraged futures positions. How significant is the Sharpe Ratio rise for Litecoin? Messari data shows LTC’s 30-day Sharpe Ratio climbed to about 2.3 at the time of reporting. A Sharpe Ratio above 2.0 historically signals strong returns relative to volatility. This improvement indicates that recent gains are producing better risk-adjusted performance, which can attract institutional and risk-aware traders. Key Takeaways Immediate catalyst : Breakout above $112 flag pushed LTC up ~10% in 24 hours. Risk-adjusted performance : Sharpe Ratio at ~2.3, suggesting stronger returns vs volatility. Derivatives activity : Open Interest surged by roughly $100M to $703M, showing increased leveraged exposure. Is this a repeat of Litecoin’s familiar cycle? Litecoin has a history of consolidating in flag-shaped ranges before staging decisive upside breaks. The current move follows that pattern, with technical momentum targeting the next resistance zone near $135. Traders should watch volume and on-chain metrics for confirmation rather than assuming automatic continuation. The market’s technical picture and on-chain signals align: breakout -> momentum -> elevated open interest. That sequence has repeated in prior LTC rallies. Source: TradingView How do Sharpe Ratio and Open Interest change the outlook? The rising Sharpe Ratio suggests more efficient returns, which can draw capital seeking favorable risk/return profiles. Concurrently, the $100M jump in futures Open Interest to $703M (Messari) shows fresh positions are being added. Higher open interest can amplify moves — positive if bulls hold, but it raises liquidation risk in sharp reversals. Source: Messari What does the Open Interest surge mean for traders? Open Interest rising by ~$100M to roughly $703M indicates traders are increasing exposure to LTC futures. That often precedes extended trends but also increases system-wide leverage. Risk management is essential: traders should monitor funding rates, position sizes, and key support levels. Source: Messari Rally or pause ahead? Technically, the breakout has shifted sentiment toward bulls, with a near-term target at about $135. However, short-term profit-taking or volatility-driven retracements are plausible given higher leverage in futures markets. Conservative traders should wait for retest confirmation of the $112 level or follow trend with defined stops. Frequently Asked Questions How much did Litecoin rally after breaking $112? Litecoin rallied roughly 10% in the 24 hours following the breakout above $112, driven by spot buy-side momentum and increased futures positioning. Is the Sharpe Ratio change meaningful for long-term investors? A Sharpe Ratio near 2.3 indicates improved short-term risk-adjusted returns. Long-term investors should combine this metric with on-chain trends and macro conditions before adjusting allocations. Does higher Open Interest guarantee continued upside? No. Higher Open Interest signals stronger participation and conviction but also more leverage. It can fuel trends but increases the potential for sharp moves if sentiment reverses. How to trade the current Litecoin setup? Confirm breakout: wait for a clear daily close above $112 with volume confirmation. Manage risk: set stop-loss near validated support and size positions relative to account risk. Monitor OI & funding: reduce exposure if Open Interest spikes without fundamental support. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much did Litecoin rally after breaking $112?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Litecoin rallied roughly 10% in the 24 hours following the breakout above $112, driven by spot momentum and increased futures positioning."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the Sharpe Ratio change meaningful for long-term investors?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A Sharpe Ratio near 2.3 shows improved short-term risk-adjusted returns; long-term investors should combine this with on-chain and macro analysis before reallocating."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does higher Open Interest guarantee continued upside?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Higher Open Interest reflects increased participation and leverage; it can support trends but also amplifies reversals if sentiment shifts."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Litecoin price surge: breakout above $112 lifts LTC — Sharpe ratio 2.3, OI +$100M"", ""description"": ""Litecoin broke a $112 flag, rallying 10% in 24 hours.

BNB Chain validators adopted a new minimum gas price of 0.05 gwei to lower transaction costs and speed confirmations. The BNB team has signaled further changes to block gas limits and architecture upgrades to support high throughput. Roadmap plans include increasing the BSC block gas limit from 100 million to 1 billion and, by 2026, pursuing an architecture capable of ~20,000 transactions per second with sub‑150 millisecond confirmations. Planned feature work includes native privacy functions, upgradable virtual machines and improved developer tools. Source: BNB Chain Which major upgrades already went live in 2025? Two major upgrades completed earlier in 2025: the Lorentz Hard Fork in April reduced block times and improved validator networking, and the Maxwell upgrade in June optimized block production and validator coordination. Both upgrades aimed to improve latency and network throughput.

Professional forecasts vary; Standard Chartered projected a peak around $1,275 for 2025 based on correlations with BTC and ETH. Market dynamics, macro factors and on‑chain demand will influence any further upside. Are token burns affecting BNB supply? Yes. Regular token burns reduce circulating supply over time, which can enhance scarcity. Combined with treasury accumulation and demand growth, burns can contribute to upward price pressure. What should users watch in BNB Chain metrics? Monitor TLV, active addresses, transaction volumes, and gas price adoption. Sudden changes in these metrics can signal shifts in demand, network congestion or improved utility after upgrades. Key Takeaways BNB price reached a new ATH : $1,111.90 after solid weekly gains and rising demand. On‑chain activity is expanding : TLV, active addresses and volume all show notable increases. Upgrades support growth : Recent Maxwell and Lorentz upgrades plus planned changes aim to boost throughput and lower costs. Conclusion BNB price strength reflects both demand dynamics—treasury buying and token burns—and rising BNB Chain activity. Network upgrades in 2025 improve capacity and user experience, potentially supporting further price resilience. Continue monitoring TLV, active addresses and upgrade adoption for forward signals.

The market is balanced and awaiting catalysts for a clear breakout above $120K–$122K.

Bitcoin trades near $119K with Binance data showing a neutral risk-reward balance, as markets await catalysts for the next rally. Binance data places Bitcoin’s Sharpe-like ratio at 0.18, reflecting neutral risk-reward conditions with neither strong rallies nor excessive dangers. The 30-day reference to Bitcoin is 0.26%, with volatility being 1.37, which reflects an equal (balanced) and moderately active market. A longer-run ratio of more than 0.5 and a price movement of over $120K-122K would indicate a new positive trend with increased trading volumes. Bitcoin maintains stability near $119,000 on Binance, with market data reflecting a balanced phase between risk and potential gains. What is Bitcoin’s current risk-reward balance? Bitcoin risk-reward balance is currently neutral, supported by a Binance-derived Sharpe-like ratio of 0.18. This reading indicates that recent returns only modestly compensate for volatility, while 30-day measures (0.26% return, 1.37 volatility) point to subdued momentum rather than clear directional pressure. How does the Sharpe-like ratio indicate market conditions? The Sharpe-like ratio compares returns to volatility to show if gains justify risk. Readings above 0.5 historically signal attractive risk-adjusted returns and potential momentum. A ratio near 0 or negative implies volatility outpacing returns and increases the likelihood of corrective phases. Binance and on-chain analytics providers (plain text mention: CryptoQuant) show the current 0.18 reading as evidence of equilibrium. Market participants often wait for a sustained rise in this ratio before increasing leverage or initiating larger accumulations. Source: CryptoQuant Why do 30-day returns and volatility matter? Front-loaded data shows the 30-day average return of 0.26% is modest, while volatility at 1.37 suggests measured price swings. Together, these metrics indicate an orderly market conducive to accumulation but lacking the conviction needed for a strong breakout. Investors use these short-term indicators to calibrate position size and risk. Low returns with moderate volatility often precede directional moves when new macro or on-chain catalysts arrive. When would a renewed rally be confirmed? A renewed rally would be signaled by a combination of sustained improvements: the Sharpe-like ratio rising above 0.5, 30-day returns increasing meaningfully, and Bitcoin pushing past $120,000–$122,000 with elevated trading volume. Those conditions historically mark the transition to bullish risk-adjusted environments. How to interpret these metrics in trading decisions? Traders should treat current readings as a watch-and-wait environment. Use these rules: Confirm ratio trend: look for multi-week rise toward 0.3–0.5. Monitor returns and volatility: rising returns with contained volatility are constructive. Validate with price and volume: breakout above $120K–$122K with healthy volume confirms trend. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the current Sharpe-like ratio for Bitcoin?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The current Binance-derived Sharpe-like ratio for Bitcoin is 0.18, indicating a neutral risk-reward environment where returns modestly compensate for volatility."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does Bitcoin need to pass $120K to confirm a rally?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A sustained move above $120,000–$122,000 combined with a Sharpe-like ratio above 0.5 and rising volume would be a strong confirmation of a renewed rally."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How reliable is the Sharpe-like ratio for Bitcoin? The Sharpe-like ratio is a widely used risk-adjusted performance measure. For Bitcoin, it provides a quick gauge of whether recent returns justify volatility; however, it should be used alongside volume, on-chain metrics, and macro signals for robust decisions. What should traders watch next? Traders should watch the trend in the Sharpe-like ratio, 30-day returns, volatility, and price action around $120K–$122K. A synchronized improvement across these metrics would increase confidence in a sustainable rally. Key Takeaways Neutral risk profile : Bitcoin’s Sharpe-like ratio at 0.18 signals equilibrium between risk and reward. Modest short-term returns : 30-day return is 0.26% with volatility at 1.37, favoring orderly accumulation. Rally confirmation criteria : A ratio >0.5, higher returns, and a breakout above $120K–$122K with volume would confirm a new upward phase. Conclusion Bitcoin remains in a balanced state near $119,000, with Binance-derived metrics pointing to neutral risk-reward conditions. Market participants should prioritize risk-adjusted indicators and volume to identify a genuine breakout.

Key Takeaways: The SEC missed its deadline on Canary’s spot Litecoin ETF, leaving the application in limbo. The agency is phasing out 19b-4 filings in favor of S-1s, adding confusion to ETF approval timelines. A possible government shutdown and shifting rules are delaying decisions on several altcoin ETF applications. The silence has added confusion to an already murky situation, as the crypto industry grapples with shifting ETF application procedures and the looming impact of a federal government shutdown. SEC Shifts Crypto ETF Filings Toward S-1, Phases Out 19b-4 Process Earlier this year, the SEC urged firms to withdraw their 19b-4 filings, the documents used for exchange rule changes, in favor of relying solely on S-1 registration statements. Canary complied, pulling its 19b-4 on September 25. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart and FOX reporter Eleanor Terrett noted that the traditional deadline tied to 19b-4 filings may now be irrelevant under the SEC’s evolving framework. But the regulatory uncertainty doesn’t end there. A shutdown of the federal government is complicating matters further. Although the SEC said it will continue limited operations during the shutdown, a contingency plan published in August stated it would halt the review and approval of new financial products. That includes registration statements and ETF filings. As I understand it, the shutdown could affect the $LTC ETF approval because the @SECGov still needs to sign off on the S-1 and the agency is operating on a skeleton crew. It’s unclear what remaining staff is working/what their priorities are at the moment. Since the generic… https://t.co/uD1uO9udtO — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) October 2, 2025 Whether the agency’s silence on Canary’s Litecoin ETF stems from the withdrawn filing or the shutdown remains unclear. The SEC has not provided public comment on the delay. Canary’s stalled application joins a growing list of altcoin-based ETF proposals seeking to expand the U.S. crypto ETF market. Alongside Litecoin, other filings include products based on Solana, XRP, Avalanche, Cardano, Chainlink, and Dogecoin. These would join the already launched Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which have collectively drawn over $74 billion in inflows. Despite the standstill, analysts remain optimistic. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas said this week that the SEC’s adoption of new listing standards under Rule 6c-11 may accelerate approvals. SEC Chair Paul Atkins added that these changes will streamline the process and lower barriers for investors. Solana ETF Filings Signal Institutional Momentum Last week, several top asset managers, including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise, have submitted updated S-1 filings for spot Solana ETFs, some with staking features. ETF analyst Nate Geraci expects the US SEC could approve them by mid-October , calling it a pivotal month for digital asset products. The filings follow the recent launch of the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange, which drew $12 million in first-day inflows. Analysts say Solana is quickly becoming the next altcoin favored by institutions, with strong inflows also reported in Europe-based Solana ETPs. Geraci and others believe the inclusion of staking language in these filings could pave the way for long-awaited spot Ethereum ETFs with staking capabilities. Meanwhile, Bitcoin exchange-traded products now hold over 1.47 million BTC , representing around 7% of the total supply, with U.S.-based ETFs dominating the landscape. BlackRock’s IBIT leads with 746,810 BTC, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at nearly 199,500 BTC, according to data from HODL15Capital.

52599068,https://cryptonews.com/?p=432538,1759473860,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52599068.jpeg,NY Senator Introduces Bill to Tax High-Consumption Crypto Miners in New York,https://cryptonews.com/news/ny-senator-introduces-bill-to-tax-high-consumption-crypto-miners-in-new-york/,"New York State Senator Liz Krueger has introduced a bill targeting crypto mining operations that consume large amounts of electricity, proposing a tiered excise tax based on annual energy usage. Key Takeaways: New York’s proposed bill would tax crypto miners up to 5 cents per kWh based on energy usage tiers. Mining operations using 100% renewable energy would be exempt from the tax. Rising energy costs and tighter margins may push miners to leave New York or shift to cleaner power sources. The bill, unveiled Wednesday , seeks to charge miners up to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) depending on their consumption levels. New York Bill Proposes Tiered Energy Tax on Crypto Miners Based on Usage Under the proposal, mining firms using less than 2.25 million kWh per year would be exempt. Those consuming between 2.26 and 5 million kWh would pay 2 cents per kWh, with higher tiers facing steeper charges: 3 cents up to 10 million kWh, 4 cents up to 20 million, and 5 cents for those exceeding that threshold. Miners powered entirely by renewable energy would be exempt. This echoes New York’s two-year moratorium on non-renewable-powered mining, which ended in 2024 and allowed clean-energy-based operations to continue. Krueger’s bill arrives at a time when mining costs are surging. The median cost to mine one Bitcoin topped $70,000 in Q2 2025, driven by increased network hashrate and difficulty, according to TheMinerMag. Energy costs in Q1 2025 averaged around $0.08 per kWh, double the revenue-to-cost ratio for firms like TeraWulf, which reported a $61.4 million loss for the period at its upstate New York facility. JUST IN: New York introduces anti-bitcoin mining bill that would tax proof-of-work mining pic.twitter.com/CWTjghW8EU — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) October 2, 2025 The tax could squeeze profit margins even further for miners relying on retail-priced grid electricity. Large operators with access to renewable infrastructure may be able to absorb the blow or sidestep the tax entirely, reinforcing their edge over smaller competitors. Electricity remains the single most critical cost in Bitcoin mining. With margins already thin, the proposed tax may accelerate an exodus of mining firms from New York to lower-cost jurisdictions, unless they transition to clean energy. The bill underscores New York’s ongoing scrutiny of crypto mining’s environmental footprint as lawmakers weigh economic incentives against sustainability goals. US Lawmaker Calls for National Security Probe Into China-Linked Bitcoin Mining Firms In September, Congressman Zachary Nunn asked the US Treasury to launch a national security review of Chinese firms Bitmain and Cango, citing concerns over their expanding presence in the US crypto mining sector. In a letter sent to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Nunn pointed to opaque ownership structures, potential state ties, and risks to national infrastructure as grounds for a Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) investigation. Bitmain, which dominates over 80% of the global Bitcoin mining hardware market, and Nasdaq-listed Cango have both denied any merger plans. Still, Nunn raised alarms over their growth strategies in the US, complex financing arrangements, and possible involvement in US energy infrastructure. His concerns follow a $300 million equipment deal between Bitmain’s US arm and a Trump-linked mining firm. Both companies have stated they comply with US laws and have no ties to foreign governments. However, Nunn argues that the scale of their influence and the sensitivity of energy and crypto markets demand closer scrutiny, warning that unchecked expansion could undermine US digital asset sovereignty.

After a year of alternating corrections and rebounds, traders are now positioning for the next major uptrend. Bitcoin’s dominance has provided a stable foundation, but the true excitement lies in the altcoin market, where higher multiples and stronger narratives often emerge during bull runs. Analysts argue that this cycle may be one of the most dynamic yet, as institutional adoption coincides with retail enthusiasm in ways not seen before. In this environment, altcoins with strong ecosystems, cultural momentum, or speculative potential are drawing attention. Investors are increasingly blending strategies: anchoring with established projects while also allocating to high-upside tokens capable of delivering exponential returns. The goal is not just to participate in the rally but to maximize exposure to the most promising stories. From Ethereum and Solana to emerging presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE , six altcoins are standing out as the ones to watch as markets prepare to ride the next bullish wave. Ethereum: The Institutional Standard Ethereum remains the most important altcoin for institutional adoption. Its dominance in decentralized finance, NFTs, and tokenization ensures steady inflows, while scaling solutions through Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism reduce congestion and costs. Ethereum’s recent role in tokenization pilots by major financial firms shows that it is increasingly treated not just as a cryptocurrency, but as digital infrastructure. Analysts highlight that ETF inflows have created a structural demand floor, which complements its strong developer base. For long-term investors, ETH provides reliability that meme tokens cannot. While it may not be the coin to deliver 50× gains, it anchors portfolios by ensuring exposure to the digital economy’s backbone. In every bullish phase, Ethereum has historically grown alongside Bitcoin, often outperforming in percentage terms once capital rotates into altcoins. Its blend of credibility and innovation secures its position as the first altcoin to watch in this mega bullish wave. Solana: The High-Beta Performer Solana continues to cement its reputation as one of the fastest and most culturally relevant blockchains. Its network supports high throughput at low cost, making it a favorite for NFT projects, DeFi protocols, and meme tokens. The ecosystem’s resilience has grown stronger after past outages, and recent developer activity shows Solana remains committed to scaling without sacrificing usability. For traders, its high-beta nature means Solana often amplifies the broader market trend, surging faster during rallies and correcting more sharply during pullbacks. The chain has also become a hub for retail-driven experiments, with meme coins like BONK demonstrating how cultural momentum can drive adoption. Solana’s combination of speed, affordability, and community-driven growth makes it one of the altcoins most likely to deliver 10× or greater returns in a bullish wave. Analysts believe that if institutional players expand exposure beyond Ethereum, Solana will be one of the first networks to benefit. XRP: The Regulatory Play XRP has long been defined by its regulatory battles, but with much of the uncertainty easing, its utility-driven narrative is returning to the forefront. As a token designed for cross-border payments and settlements, XRP occupies a unique niche in the crypto ecosystem. Partnerships with banks and payment providers have underscored its relevance, and with speculation about ETF products in play, investor confidence is growing. In the last week, XRP has consolidated near $2.80–$2.94, showing strength while many altcoins corrected. Analysts argue that this reflects whale accumulation and institutional optimism. The $3 level is a psychological barrier, and a clean breakout could push XRP into its strongest rally in years. For long-term investors, XRP is not just about speculation but also adoption — the possibility that its technology powers global payment rails. In a mega bullish wave, that dual narrative of utility and growth makes it a must-watch altcoin. Avalanche: The Scaling Contender Avalanche has positioned itself as one of the strongest scaling solutions in the market. Its subnet architecture allows enterprises and developers to create custom blockchains with unique rules, enabling experimentation without compromising performance. This flexibility has attracted partnerships in gaming, DeFi, and enterprise applications. Avalanche has also focused on sustainability, marketing itself as an environmentally conscious blockchain. For investors, AVAX offers exposure to real-world use cases that expand beyond speculation. Its ability to scale efficiently makes it attractive for developers seeking performance at lower costs than Ethereum’s mainnet. Analysts suggest that as blockchain adoption broadens, Avalanche could capture a significant share of institutional and enterprise flows. In previous cycles, AVAX has delivered strong rallies, and many believe it is poised to repeat this performance. With scalability as one of the biggest themes of the next decade, Avalanche’s role as a contender for mass adoption is clear. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Speculative Spark Analysts compiling lists of altcoins for the next bullish wave are including not just majors but presales with compelling ROI math. MAGACOIN FINANCE is consistently ranked in those lists, with return models suggesting 1,600%–2,200% ROI depending on exchange adoption. Its design rewards urgency, as each stage increases cost for new buyers, magnifying early participants’ upside. While ETH and SOL dominate institutional narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers retail traders a high-risk, high-reward way to amplify cycle participation. For those watching altcoin watchlists closely, it is being positioned not as a side note but as one of the standout names worth tracking. Cardano: The Patient Builder Cardano represents the long game in blockchain. Its peer-reviewed, academically rigorous approach means development has been slower, but it also ensures a secure and scalable foundation. Recent governance updates and interoperability efforts have positioned Cardano for renewed growth, particularly as decentralized applications continue to expand on its platform. Investors often see ADA as a counterbalance to high-beta tokens. While it may not capture the fastest rallies, its long-term approach provides stability. Analysts note that ADA often lags behind in early bull runs, only to rally strongly later when its ecosystem developments are recognized. For patient holders, Cardano offers a blend of sustainability, security, and eventual upside. In the context of a mega bullish wave, it is the altcoin for investors who want exposure to growth without the extreme volatility of more speculative projects. Conclusion As the crypto market prepares to ride a mega bullish wave, six altcoins stand out for different reasons. Ethereum offers institutional credibility, Solana delivers cultural and high-beta growth, XRP represents regulatory-driven adoption, Avalanche provides scalable enterprise solutions, Cardano ensures stability through governance, and MAGACOIN FINANCE injects speculative firepower with its viral community and scarcity-driven design. Together, these six altcoins create a balanced watchlist, offering investors exposure across the spectrum of stability, growth, and speculation. For portfolios seeking to maximize returns in the next major rally, blending anchors like Ethereum with speculative gems like MAGACOIN may prove to be the winning strategy.

52599930,596576,1759474851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52599930.jpeg,"US Senator Blasts Crypto’s Environmental Impact, Warns Of Impending Reckoning",https://bitcoinist.com/us-senator-blasts-crypto-environmental-impact/,"During a recent congressional hearing on climate change, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, member of the Democratic Party, delivered a message regarding the alleged environmental impact of crypto mining . He asserted that the industry is exacerbating climate issues and cautioned that a reckoning is on the horizon. Calls For Accountability In Crypto And AI In April, Senator Whitehouse, alongside fellow Democrat John Fetterman, introduced the Cloud Act, legislation aimed at establishing emissions standards for artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency mining facilities. The goal is to utilize the resulting revenues to help consumers lower their utility bills while investing in clean energy. Eleanor Terret reported on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that Whitehouse urged industry leaders to consider the implications of their actions on everyday electricity consumers. “Think about what you’re doing to regular consumers of electricity nearby,” he stated. Whitehouse also stressed on the importance of reflecting on the potential consequences of their choices, warning that they risk pushing society further down a troubling climate path. Senator Ron Wyden, the panel’s ranking member, expressed his gratitude to Whitehouse for his remarks, while Senator Marsha Blackburn dismissed Whitehouse’s statements as irrelevant. Attention Shifts To Clarity Act Whitehouse has been vocal about the alleged strain that energy-intensive data centers and crypto mining operations place on the power grid. He noted that these facilities contribute to rising electricity costs for consumers, hinder access to power for homes and businesses, and increase fossil fuel emissions. “The good news is that we don’t have to choose between leading the world on AI and leading the world on climate safety,” he remarked. He believes that technology and AI companies have the financial resources to invest in clean energy alternatives, thereby preventing further strain on local grids. The Clean Cloud Act aims to direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set emissions performance standards for data centers and crypto mining facilities with an installed IT power capacity exceeding 100 kilowatts. These standards would be based on regional grid emissions intensities and would decrease annually by 11%. The legislation also proposes penalties for emissions that exceed the set standards, starting at $20 per ton of CO2 equivalent, with annual adjustments for inflation. Despite the urgency expressed by Senator Whitehouse, progress on the Clean Cloud Act remains stalled as Congress shifts its focus to the Clarity Act. This market structure bill intends to clarify the regulatory landscape for digital assets by defining the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), categorizing digital assets, and establishing new protections for developers in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

Here's the Latest Giant Company to Overtake,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-rises-to-7th-place-in-global-asset-rankings-heres-the-latest-giant-company-to-overtake/,"Bitcoin has achieved another remarkable feat, with the cryptocurrency giant surpassing the $120,000 mark and pushing its market capitalization above $2.4 trillion, according to MarketCap data. Bitcoin Surpasses Amazon, Rising to 7th Place in Global Asset Rankings With this development, Bitcoin surpassed Amazon, which has a market value of $2.371 trillion, and rose to 7th place in the global asset rankings. Bitcoin, which gained 1.84% in the last 24 hours, is once again competing with traditional market giants. Silver is ahead of Bitcoin in the new rankings. This table reveals that Bitcoin's place in the financial system is gradually strengthening and the “digital gold” metaphor is gaining concrete basis for investors. According to experts, this rise is driven by increasing uncertainty in the global economy, interest rate cut signals from central banks, and demand for cryptocurrencies seeking protection from risk. It is also emphasized that the interest of institutional investors through ETFs has created a permanent momentum in Bitcoin's market value. Bitcoin's surpassing of a major tech company like Amazon has once again highlighted the competitiveness of crypto assets in traditional financial markets. Analysts predict that Bitcoin could surpass silver in the coming period, entering the top six assets. *This is not investment advice.

At the Circle Forum in Singapore, Yam Ki Chan, Circle’s Asia-Pacific Vice President, revealed that on-chain stablecoin activity reached $2.4 trillion in the 12 months to June 2025. The data highlights how quickly stablecoins are moving beyond niche crypto use and into mainstream financial and commercial systems. Circle @circle · Follow Asia has the highest adoption rate of stablecoins worldwide.At Circle Forum Singapore, we explored how APAC is embracing onchain finance, with $2.4 trillion of activity from June 2024 to June 2025.Yam Ki Chan, VP for APAC and Managing Director for Circle Singapore, expands on Watch on Twitter View replies 12:28 AM · Oct 3, 2025 199 Reply Copy link Read 21 replies Monthly transactions have soared, businesses across industries are integrating them, and regulators in Asia, the US, and even China are shaping policies that could redefine global money flows. Singapore and Hong Kong drive stablecoin activity Singapore and Hong Kong have become the second and third-largest stablecoin markets worldwide, behind only the US. The Singapore-China route has also grown into the busiest corridor for cross-border digital currency transactions, underscoring Singapore’s importance in regional flows. Circle strengthened its Asia presence with the opening of a Singapore office in May 2025. At the launch, Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, noted the rising demand for new forms of money, including privately issued stablecoins. Data shows the scale of this rise. Monthly corporate transactions jumped from less than $100 million in early 2023 to more than $3 billion by early 2025. Sectors like travel and luxury retail are already incorporating stablecoins into daily operations. Singapore’s Wetrip travel agency, Capella Hotels, and luxury reseller Ginza Xiaoma, known for Birkin bags, now accept payments in stablecoins, reflecting consumer adoption alongside institutional use. Retail payments and regulation boost growth Stablecoins are digital assets designed to mirror the value of fiat currencies or commodities like gold, reducing volatility compared with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Their ability to settle cross-border payments quickly and at lower costs has made them attractive for trade, retail, and financial services. Singapore’s consumer-facing use cases are a visible sign of this shift, with stablecoins now being used for booking travel, paying for accommodation, and purchasing high-end goods. Policymakers have responded with frameworks aimed at managing risk while supporting innovation. In August 2025, Hong Kong introduced a dedicated regulatory framework for stablecoins. In June, the US passed the GENIUS Act, establishing rules for issuance and oversight. Meanwhile, China, long restrictive on crypto trading, has taken small steps toward blockchain exploration. Shanghai launched a task force in July 2025 to examine how blockchain could aid international trade, signalling gradual policy flexibility. Global supply rises as integration deepens The global supply of circulating stablecoins reached an average of $225 billion by May 2025, marking a 63% increase compared to the year before. Monthly transaction volumes climbed to $625 billion, showing how deeply these digital assets are being integrated into finance. This expansion is tied not only to retail and institutional demand but also to clearer regulations across jurisdictions. The combination of large trading volumes and growing acceptance by businesses demonstrates that stablecoins are no longer confined to crypto exchanges or speculative trading. Instead, they are increasingly embedded in mainstream commercial activity. Asia-Pacific at the centre of digital money For Circle, Asia-Pacific is more than a growth market. The company views the region as a testing ground for the global transition to digital financial systems. Regulatory clarity and adoption in countries like Singapore and Hong Kong have created fertile ground for expansion. With $2.4 trillion in transactions, rising retail payments, and major policy developments across Asia, the region is now seen as a bellwether for the future of money. Stablecoins are being positioned not only as tools for crypto users but also as infrastructure for global finance, trade, and commerce.

At the same time, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as one of the most exciting new tokens, targeting $7 from just $0.11. With major listings, wallet beta testing, and a $250,000 Giveaway, Remittix is quickly winning over early believers. Ethereum Price Gains As Whales Build Positions Ethereum price is remaining stable following a tremendous breakout that has rejuvenated the market. ETH price today is $4,304, up 3.46% in the past 24 hours, with trading volume climbing 6.51% to $43.48 billion. This consistent increase supports the optimistic mood and gives momentum to the recent ETH price forecast that is set to reach highs in the long run. Over the past week, Ethereum price has risen 2.7%. This is a consistent climb that analysts see as a base for future gains. According to Ethereum news from top analysts, ETH successfully flipped the $4,000 resistance into support. Marzell Crypto noted that Ethereum’s breakout above $4,300 builds a stronger case for higher levels, while analyst BitBull suggested Ethereum could surge to $8,000–$10,000 if momentum holds. The key support remains at $4,261, and as long as ETH price stays above this zone, the bullish structure is intact. On-chain Ethereum news shows open interest up 2.88% to $57.02 billion, alongside a 13.86% jump in trading volume, reflecting surging investor confidence. With whales accumulating, Ethereum price prediction models continue to eye $10,000 in the next cycle, setting ETH up as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch heading into 2026. Ethereum Price Holds Strong But Remittix Sets The Stage For Next Wave Ethereum price continues to show long-term strength with analysts projecting ETH could climb as high as $10,000 by 2026. But while Ethereum remains a dominant force, investors are starting to notice Remittix (RTX) as the project is being tipped to mirror Ripple’s payments success and bring crypto into everyday use. Remittix is being branded “XRP 2.0” for its direct focus on bridging crypto with traditional banking, offering smooth cross-border transfers at low costs. Unlike Ethereum or Ripple, RTX is positioning itself directly for consumers, freelancers, and travelers fed up with hidden fees. Already raising more than $26.9 million, Remittix has crossed major milestones including a confirmed BitMart listing at $20M and an upcoming LBank listing at $22M. With CertiK verification and the Remittix Wallet beta now live, confidence in the project continues to build. $26.9M+ raised with strong investor backing BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing, with LBank next CertiK verification achieved, ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens 15% Referral Program launched with instant USDT rewards Add in the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway and a new referral program paying 15% in USDT daily, and the project is stacking momentum quickly.

His remarks, shared in a recent shareholder letter and explained by Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, have reignited debate over Ripple’s dominance in the cross-border payments space. Claver Highlights Garlinghouse’s Perspective In a video shared by Abs, host of Good Morning Crypto podcast, Jake Claver broke down Garlinghouse’s reaction for the XRP community. Claver explained that the Ripple chief views SWIFT’s prototype as more of a marketing strategy, particularly timed to generate buzz ahead of the Sibos conference. “While SWIFT is still talking about prototypes, Ripple has already built and deployed real digital asset infrastructure,” Claver noted, emphasizing the contrast between Ripple’s delivery and SWIFT’s experiments. His analysis echoed Garlinghouse’s confidence that Ripple’s head start positions it well ahead of legacy competitors.

He noted that while SWIFT was once a major competitor to Ripple , the industry has undergone significant changes since then. “It’s true in the early days we did view SWIFT as a major competitor, but the reality is in the time it’s taken for them to announce a prototype, we’ve been building robust digital asset infrastructure, expanding on our payments product to custody, stablecoins, and development on the XRPL and more with recent acquisitions.” Garlinghouse added that Ripple’s review of SWIFT’s announcement confirmed his view that it was “more like a marketing play in the lead-up to their annual conference, Sibos, rather than an actual meaningful product announcement.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple vs. SWIFT: Competing Paths The sharp difference in approach between Ripple and SWIFT is becoming increasingly evident. While SWIFT is still rolling out conceptual prototypes, Ripple has spent the last 13 years building and refining real-world blockchain solutions. Its progress includes the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, as well as ongoing development of the XRP Ledger ecosystem. This divergence highlights why Ripple is seen as an emerging leader in digital finance, offering tested solutions that financial institutions can already use. Meanwhile, SWIFT seems to have signaled its intentions rather than delivering practical tools. Community Reaction and Ripple’s Long-Term Vision The XRP community has rallied behind Garlinghouse’s candid response, viewing it as further evidence that Ripple is ahead of the curve. For many, the fact that SWIFT is only now experimenting with blockchain validates Ripple’s early strategy. Looking forward, Garlinghouse has made it clear that Ripple’s ambitions go far beyond payments . By expanding into custody, stablecoins, and XRPL-powered applications, Ripple is building a comprehensive digital finance infrastructure. With its long track record, established partnerships, and proven technology, Ripple is positioning itself not only to compete with SWIFT but to redefine the future of global finance.

Ether could now rally to a new all-time high amid growing whale demand for the cryptocurrency. Ether whales continue to accumulate ETH tokens Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is trading above $4,400 per coin after adding 2.5% to its value in the last 24 hours. The coin briefly reached the $4,500 mark a few hours ago but has since declined slightly to trade at $4,484. The positive performance comes as whales have increased their buying pressure in recent weeks, following Ether’s dip in price. Data obtained from CryptoQuant revealed that since September 18, whales (investors with a balance of 10K-100K ETH) have increased their collective holdings by 840k ETH. The whales continue to buy even during the dip, boosting confidence in Ether’s price discovery over the last two weeks. Additionally, accumulation addresses (wallets with no selling activity) added a record 5.6 million ETH to their balances in September. This implies that accumulation addresses have set a new monthly buying record for the third consecutive month despite Ether’s poor performance in recent weeks. Finally, institutional demand for Ether has returned following weeks of outflow. From Monday to Wednesday, US spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded net inflows of about $755.2 million. On the derivatives side, Ether’s Open Interest (OI) remains poor despite the price improvement over the past seven days. However, traders are becoming more active in the market, with a 280K ETH jump in the metric recorded on Thursday. Ether eyes a new all-time high after breaking the $4,500 resistance The ETH/USD 4-hour chart has switched bullish after Ether added 13% to its value over the last seven days. The coin recorded $129.9 million in futures liquidations over the past 24 hours, with short traders experiencing heavy losses. The short liquidations were a result of Ether crossing above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). By breaking above the $4,500 resistance level, Ether is setting up for further gains and could rally towards an all-time high. However, Ether must overcome the $4,835 resistance level before it can top the $5k psychological mark for the first time in its history. The MACD lines are above the neutral zone, suggesting a bullish run. The RSI of 74 also shows that ETH could enter the overbought region if the bullish trend continues. Ether’s momentum indicators need to remain bullish to allow it to rally to a new all-time high above $4,900. However, failure to top the $4,835 resistance level in the near term could see Ether retest the support and TLQ level created at $4,117. This support level will likely hold in the near term, unless the broader market switches bearish.

The initiative is part of Bitget’s partnership with UNICEF’s Game Changers Coalition and reflects CEO Gracy Chen’s ongoing commitment to using blockchain as a force for education, empowerment, and opportunity. For Gracy, who has become one of the most visible female leaders in the crypto industry, recently being nominated as one of the Top 50 Women in Web3 & AI , the hackathon is not just a platform for creativity but also a gateway for young people, especially girls in emerging economies, to gain access to Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) skills. In her view, blockchain and Web3 can become tools to break cycles of poverty by equipping youth with pathways into entrepreneurship, innovation, and financial independence. “Introducing children to digital skills at an early age is important to accelerate the growth of emerging tech and finance. Too often, access to tech education starts too late and excludes those with the most potential. Emerging technologies such as blockchain offer the tools needed for youth to become entrepreneurs, builders, and innovators on a global scale. We plan to tap into this potential and make the digital space more inclusive and empowering for the next generation of women leaders,” said Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget. As a strategic partner of the UNICEF Game Changers Coalition led by UNICEF Office of Innovation, Bitget Academy, the educational arm of Bitget, will help develop UNICEF’s first interactive, online and in-person blockchain training module based on video game creation skills development. Support from Bitget will help reach 300,000 people – including adolescent girls, parents, mentors, and teachers with blockchain skills across eight countries. This new chapter extends beyond education. Bitget has debuted its Lady Forward campaign, expanding into university partnerships, new internship programs, and the launch of a Female Leaders Program to connect women across the blockchain ecosystem, from developers and investors to entrepreneurs and policymakers. Gracy’s advocacy is reinforced through her role as a guest professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). There, she teaches a blockchain course designed for finance and mathematics students, blending academic rigor with case studies, real-world applications, and guest insights from top industry leaders. The classroom, blending the case method from Harvard Business School, pitching sessions, and guests’ discussions, becomes a platform for equipping the next generation with the skills to lead in a digital-first economy. As Blockchain4Her enters its “Lady Forward” era, Bitget is putting inclusion into practice through its collaboration with UNICEF. The collaboration with UNICEF builds on Bitget’s broader commitment to connect blockchain and Web3 technologies with initiatives that drive meaningful change that expands digital access, encourages creative learning, and equips young people in developing regions with the tools to thrive in the future global economy.

Analysts are tracking the asset closely, with current price movement signaling a potential breakout. Attention is on the $3.13 to $3.15 zone, which is viewed as a key area for a shift in momentum. Meanwhile, trading volume remains high, sitting at just under $7 billion. This supports growing market interest as XRP approaches a critical point. Chart Shows Breakout Zone Nearing Technical analyst Ali Martinez shared a 12-hour chart of XRP showing a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern is typically linked to consolidation before a strong move. XRP is now pushing toward the triangle’s upper boundary. $XRP looks set to break out of a triangle, with $3.60 as the target. pic.twitter.com/ldP7rMCCn4 — Ali (@ali_charts) October 2, 2025 Fibonacci levels were drawn from a recent high to low, placing the 0.618 level at $3.13. This aligns with trendline resistance and is being watched as a breakout confirmation level. If the asset holds above that zone, projected moves target $3.25, $3.40, and $3.6. Notably, the chart also outlines a possible pullback-and-retest structure before reaching higher levels. However, if the move fails, support sits lower around $2.85 and $2.71. A drop below that range would challenge the bullish case. Long-Term Setup Targets $4.804 Javon Marks shared a broader chart showing an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which has already broken above its neckline and has since retested it as support. XRP has moved higher from that area, signaling a possible continuation. The chart points to a target at $4.8, based on the height of the pattern projected from the breakout level. According to the post, “Prices could be early in a major run to meet it.” The structure remains active as long as the asset holds above the neckline. Source: Javon Marks/X Weekly Signals Show Strength Building Another chart from Dark Defender highlights XRP’s move above a long-term trendline and a breakout on the weekly RSI. The pattern shared suggests the start of a new wave, following what appears to be a completed correction. Targets are listed at $4.17, $6, and $10. These are based on Fibonacci extension levels.

52600689,https://invezz.com/?p=2909568,1759475484,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Solana price prediction: here’s why SOL is set to soar soon,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/03/solana-price-prediction-heres-why-sol-is-set-to-soar-soon/,"Solana price has been in a strong bull run this year and is now hovering near its highest level in 2025. SOL was trading at $230, down slightly from $253, which it hit in September. This article explores the top reasons why the Solana coin has more upside in the coming months. Solana price to benefit from SOL ETF approvals The first main catalyst is that Solana price will benefit from the potential approval of spot SOL ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This approval will likely happen as soon as next week, when the earliest window opens. The deadline of the Grayscale conversion is on October 11, while the others will be on the following week. Polymarket data shows that the odds that the agency will approve these ETFs have jumped to over 90%. The question now is whether spot Solana ETFs will have robust demand from investors. JPMorgan analysts predict that the approval will lead to over $6 billion in inflows in the first year. One measure on whether the funds will have demand is to consider the performance of the REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) , which has accumulated over $382 million in assets in the past few months. This ETF is even better than the funds that will be approved later this month because it offers a monthly staking return. Data compiled by StakingRewards shows that Solana has a staking return of about 7%. As such, this return will offset the 0.75% expense ratio. Solana Alpenglow upgrade is coming The other important catalyst that will boost the SOL price is that the developers will launch the Alpenglow upgrade testnet later this year ahead of the mainnet launch in 2025. The Alpenglow upgrade introduces new important features to the network. One of the most important ones is the boost in throughput, which will make it much faster than other comparable chains. For example, a recent testing showed that Solana was able to handle 107,000 transactions per second (TPS), up from the current 65,000. That speed will be much faster than other companies like Visa and Nasdaq. Solana will also replace the current Tower BFT consensus with the Votor consensus, which will have about 100 milliseconds finality. It is common for cryptocurrencies to jump ahead of a major network upgrade. SOL treasury strategy The other notable catalyst for the Solana price is that more companies are announcing their accumulation strategy. Data shows that there are now over 8.91 million SOL tokens held by these companies. Some of the biggest Solana holders are companies like Sharps Technology, DeFi Development Corp, Upexi, and Sol Strategies . These companies are seeking to replicate the strategy that MicroStrategy applied in its Bitcoin accumulation. The main benefit of their approach is that, unlike Bitcoin, these companies now earn a 7% return annually through the staking yield. SOL price technical analysis Solana price chart | Source: TradingView The daily timeframe chart shows that the Solana price has rebounded in the past few months, moving from a low of $94.95 to a $230. It has formed a broadening wedge pattern, which often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Solana remains above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It has moved above the strong pivot reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where it continues rising, with the next level to watch being the extreme overshoot level of the Murrey Math Lines at $275.

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon introduced the Protecting Americans from Doxing and Political Violence Act (Senate Bill 2850). Cruz, a known Bitcoin advocate, was the only U.S. senator to object to this bill. The recent block follows a recent proposal from Cruz aimed at establishing guidelines for artificial intelligence, especially regarding how businesses develop and launch new products. The bill would mandate the establishment of a federally managed AI testing environment, to which firms would apply for entry through the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Several lawmakers, including Cruz, are worried that excessive regulation may cause the U.S. to fall behind China in AI innovation. The proposed sandbox would enable firms to highlight burdensome rules and request exceptions. Cruz blocks privacy bills and raises concerns about police work Data brokers collect details like a person’s home address, contacts, and bank account information to sell them to the highest bidder or anyone willing to pay. The information can also become personal, including details about their children, such as the school they attend or the daily routes they take. Members of the crypto community have also been targeted for abductions. According to a database managed by Bitcoiner Jameson Lopp, there have been over 50 attacks on people or families holding crypto in 2025 alone. Those who support the bill in the Senate said this information is too dangerous to be sold because criminals, stalkers, or violent individuals could find and harm the target person. However, Cruz raised strong objections. According to him, the bill could also pose serious problems for law enforcement officers who need to access a wide range of information in the course of their duties. He said children and families could be in more danger if the bill were to become law in its current state because it could prevent police from tracking down convicted criminals. Cruz told other senators that they should not see his stance as an opposition to privacy because he is “interested in expanding the protection to as wide a universe as is feasible, as is practicable.” However, he feels that the bill’s current version is not yet ready and requires further refinement to strike a balance between protecting people from illegal data sales and providing law enforcement with the necessary tools to keep communities safe. Cruz also stopped a second and smaller bill that Wyden introduced immediately afterward. The Senate Bill 2851 was written to stop data brokers from selling the personal information of lawmakers, their families, their staff, and also survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. Wyden said these groups deserved protection immediately because they faced higher risks of harassment and violent attacks, but Cruz still rejected the bill. According to him, it still failed to address the larger problem of balancing privacy and the needs of law enforcement. Wyden pushes for stronger rules to protect Americans from data brokers Senator Ron Wyden spoke at length about why his bill is so important and used the killing of former Minnesota Representative Melissa Hortman as an example. Investigators believe her attacker purchased information from a data broker and used it to locate her home. Wyden said the Senate has a responsibility to stop this event from happening again. Wyden also pointed to the 50+ kidnappings and home invasions against individuals connected to crypto in 2025 alone. Most of the attackers found their victims by purchasing their personal information from data brokers. He said that criminals not only target wealthy businesspeople or politicians, but also ordinary citizens whose information has been sold. Privacy experts argue that criminals will always be able to buy what they need without strong laws to prevent them. The Protecting Americans from Doxing and Political Violence Act states that data brokers would no longer be allowed to sell or publish personal information. It also gives people the power to demand that their information be removed from websites or businesses within 72 hours and take legal action against any company that fails to comply.

52601027,https://nulltx.com/?p=152247,1759476353,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"BNB Chain Slashes Gas Fee: Cheaper, Faster, Stronger",https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-slashes-gas-fee-cheaper-faster-stronger/,"BNB Chain just made one of its boldest moves yet. Validators and builders have officially adopted a new minimum gas price of 0.05 Gwei. That means users can now process transactions at just $0.005 each. This shift positions BNB Smart Chain (BSC) as one of the most cost-efficient blockchains in crypto today. It is not just a technical tweak, it’s a fundamental change that will impact users, builders, and the entire ecosystem. Why the Gas Fee Cut Matters At 0.05 Gwei, BNB Chain unlocks cheaper and faster activity across its network. Users benefit immediately. Everyday transfers and trading on BNB Chain now cost next to nothing. That opens the door for more frequent transactions without worrying about fees eating into profits. Builders gain new freedom. Developers launching decentralized apps can scale without the cost barrier. From gaming to DeFi, the fee slash makes experimentation and growth far more accessible. The network grows stronger. Lower costs make BNB Chain more competitive against rivals like Ethereum and Solana. It reinforces its position as a leading blockchain ecosystem. The next step is clear: wallets, centralized exchanges (CEXs), and trading platforms must adopt the 0.05 Gwei standard to align with the network. Doing so ensures smooth onboarding and keeps BNB Chain the most attractive home for on-chain activity. BNB Chain confirms the update Today, all BNB Smart Chain (BSC) validators and builders have adopted the new minimum gas price of 0.05 Gwei and BSC is fully ready to accept transactions at this rate. That’s ~$0.005 per transaction, making BSC one of the most cost-efficient blockchains in crypto. What this… https://t.co/qEAHIUHVRI pic.twitter.com/56g86yHgWN — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 1, 2025 Binance Scale Powers the Ecosystem Behind the fee slash is a network supported by Binance’s massive scale. In Q3 alone, Binance recorded $14.8B in net inflows. To put that in perspective, the next 10 biggest exchanges combined brought in only $94M. That’s 158x smaller, a clear sign of where new capital is choosing to flow. Today, Binance supports over 290M users worldwide. Since launch, traders have exchanged more than $125T in assets on the platform, more than the total global GDP in 2025. Liquidity is another edge. With $31B in USDT and USDC reserves, Binance represents 59% of all stablecoin reserves on centralized exchanges. For builders and users, that means deep markets and fast settlement. Compliance and Security at the Core Leadership also comes from compliance. Binance holds 22 regulatory approvals, more than any other exchange. Over 1,280 professionals, 22% of its workforce, are dedicated to compliance. Add in strict STP rules, continuous monitoring, and globally recognized certifications like SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001, and it’s clear why both retail and institutions trust the platform. Security matches that standard. The exchange maintains a $1B+ SAFU fund to protect users. Real-time monitoring has stopped more than $10B in attempted fraud losses. Since inception, more than 7.5M users have been protected, and $230M in stolen assets have been frozen or recovered in collaboration with law enforcement. Innovation and Growth Programs Binance’s innovation engine continues to drive growth. Its Alpha program has listed 152 early-stage projects. Nearly half advanced to futures listings, while 15% made it to spot markets. Since March, Alpha averages $3.8B in daily trading volume with 1.2M unique users. Beyond listings, Binance has distributed $6.7B across 100+ airdrops, fueling community engagement. Wallet adoption is also expanding. More than 20M wallet users now enjoy integrated DeFi access directly from Binance. Crypto voices are already praising the move In Q3 alone, @binance recorded $14.8B in net inflows, while the next 10 biggest exchanges combined managed just $94M. That is about 158x smaller and highlights how strongly new capital continues to choose Binance. Scale is one of the biggest drivers. Today more than 290M users… pic.twitter.com/cBdIcw6KEI — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) October 2, 2025 Liquidity, Access, and User Rewards Binance supports 500+ coins and 1,500 trading pairs, all backed by one of the fastest engines in crypto. Its system can process 1.4M orders per second, ensuring smooth execution even in volatile markets. For users, that translates to real rewards. Binance Earn has paid out $5B in passive income. Binance Pay has processed $230B across 300M transactions, becoming a go-to payment gateway for crypto. And for $BNB holders, the perks keep stacking. From January 2024 to September 2025, simply holding 1 $BNB earned over $200 in rewards. These came through Launchpool, HODLer Airdrops, MegaDrop, and staking. That’s tangible value in addition to the broader growth of the BNB ecosystem. The 0.05 Gwei gas price cut is more than a technical update, it’s a statement. Users now enjoy faster and cheaper trading. Builders have room to innovate at scale. Binance and BNB Chain strengthen their position as the global benchmark for what an exchange and blockchain can deliver. The numbers confirm it. Binance leads in inflows, adoption, liquidity, compliance, security, and innovation. With gas fees now slashed, BNB Chain adds another reason for users and builders to stay. BNB is not just participating in the blockchain race, it’s setting the pace. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

But the market is also alive with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hype, whose Phase 6 presale has already surpassed 55% sold out, marking enormous demand before the forthcoming phase, which includes a cost increase. Compared to meme coins, Mutuum Finance has real utility through its twin lending ecosystem and is therefore a high-conviction option between retail and whale investors. With over 16,710 owners and $16.7 million raised in funds, the rapid sell-out is creating some desperation since early access before Phase 7 may mean some of the quickest-growing DeFi exposure in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Struggles with Key Support While Bulls Set Sights on Critical Resistance Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades at $0.00001182, right above a solid support point of an uptrend line at $0.00001180 and with bearish resistance nearby $0.00001360. For the bullish momentum to gain traction, SHIB needs to reclaim the 50-day and 100-day EMAs ($0.00001264–$0.00001286); breaking here could pave the way for $0.00001472. On the downside, a decline below $0.00001180 risks a test of lower levels in the region of $0.00001100. While the Parabolic SAR is currently showing a bear bias, a break through the EMA cluster could shortly turn sentiment bullish once again. Amidst such technicals, most investors are also seeking future projects with high utility and early-stage growth potential, where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining much interest. Dogecoin Catches Important Support In The Midst Of ETF Flows Dogecoin (DOGE) fell back recently with the rest of the market, testing an important support level on its daily chart that also aligns with the 100-day EMA and a historically significant Murrey Math Lines level. This area has already triggered double-digit bounces before, including June’s 100% bounce and September’s 50% rally, signaling that the bulls’ configuration still remains in play. More than $20 million of inflows have entered the Rex-Osprey DOJE ETF since inception, now signified by analysts as a key catalyst, with mainstream DOGE ETFs arriving in October potentially driving even stronger momentum. Technical charting, like a potential cup-and-handle development, indicates the goal at $1, a 338% increase, if DOGE can maintain above its trendline. Though the outlook for DOGE is alluring, others are more eager to go after ventures with more asymmetric positive aspects, looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as it rapidly gains pace and sells out its presale cycles ahead of schedule. Mutuum Finance Presale Smashes Records Mutuum Finance leads the way in decentralized finance with its presale, having gained over 16,710 investors and raised over $16.7 million to date. Already 55% subscribed at Phase 6, MUTM tokens cost $0.035 apiece. As an appreciation to early supporters, the team has dropped a $100,000 giveaway hoping to reward 10 winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens per winner. Committed to extending the frontiers of DeFi, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles to ensure secure settlement, exchange, and lending of USD-backed tokens against actively traded assets like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The company employs robust and accurate price data using fallback oracle safeguards, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages to ensure precision in all instances even in the instance of extraordinary market volatility. Committed to creating a safe and privacy-focused financial world, Mutuum Finance is introducing a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that depeg during bear markets, the new token is non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and designed to maintain price stability even during volatile markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Soars as Best DeFi Choice Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the limelight in early October 2025. Phase 6 presale is 55% sold out at $0.035 with 16,710+ holders and $16.7M raised. Its dual lending DeFi platform, stablecoin plans, and $100K giveaway position it as a high-upside alternative to SHIB and DOGE.

52600501,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=831892,1759476605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52600501.jpeg,Last Call Before Lift-Off? Dogecoin Coils For Crucial Breakout,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/last-call-before-lift-off-dogecoin-breakout/,"Dogecoin’s daily chart is coiling into a technically clean inflection, according to trader IncomeSharks, who posted a rising channel and an on-balance volume (OBV) wedge that together map a straightforward route to higher levels. “DOGE – Not a bad setup. Obvious channel and clear OBV wedge. Ideally OBV will break out before price,” the analyst wrote, sharing the chart that frames the current advance. Dogecoin Breakout Watch: $0.33 Trigger On Deck Price has been respecting a well-defined ascending channel that has governed trade since early summer. Multiple touches on both boundaries validate the structure: higher lows along the lower trendline from July through early October, and lower-high rejections against the upper rail through mid-July, late August, and late September. After a fresh rebound off the rising support area at the start of October, DOGE has pushed back into the channel’s mid-range, where it typically pauses before the next impulse. IncomeSharks’ path sketch envisions a brief consolidation or shallow pullback inside the channel, followed by a drive toward the ceiling. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Hit $1? Bullish Patterns and Global Adoption Spark Fresh October The destination is explicit on the chart. The upper boundary currently intersects in the low-to-mid $0.30s, and the drawing marks a breakout attempt between roughly $0.32 and $0.33. That zone represents confluence: it’s where the rising channel’s resistance comes into play and where late-September supply capped the prior thrust. A decisive daily close through that band would confirm a bullish channel breakout and leave the door open for a run towards the early December 2024 high at $0.4843. Volume dynamics are the tell to watch. The lower panel plots OBV, a cumulative measure of buy/sell pressure, compressed into a symmetrical wedge: a gently rising base since mid-July and a descending lid drawn off the July and September OBV peaks. This kind of narrowing range in OBV often precedes a directional expansion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Could Happen ‘In A Hurry,’ Analyst Warns IncomeSharks’ comment underscores that sequencing: an OBV breakout ahead of price would signal fresh accumulation and improve the odds that price follows with a push to the channel’s top. Conversely, failure of OBV at its wedge support would warn that the rebound lacks sponsorship, increasing the risk of another test of the lower channel line. Structurally, the setup is straightforward. As long as DOGE continues to hold the rising support that has defined the trend since July, the path of least resistance remains up within the channel. A clean OBV break of its wedge would strengthen that view. If bulls can then clear overhead supply and convert the $0.32–$0.33 band into support, the chart would confirm the breakout roadmap IncomeSharks outlined. If instead price loses the ascending base, the channel thesis would be invalidated and the market would likely revisit prior higher-low areas along the lower rail before attempting another trend leg. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.2559.

The digital asset has seen a 17.6% surge in the last 7 days, and is up by 100% for the last 12 months. CoinGlass data shows $396 million in positions were liquidated across the BNB market over the past 24 hours. There were $268 million in short liquidations and $127 million in long liquidations. U.S. government shutdown fuels BNB momentum ATH szn in full swing 🫡 1 BNB = $1111 pic.twitter.com/69l8eEPgY3 — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 3, 2025 BNB’s surge in price to ATHs echoes the broader crypto market gains as Uptober euphoria builds. The surge follows an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls that adds to a growing list of signals that the Fed may begin easing monetary policy sooner than expected. Official jobs data paused on Thursday due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Traders have leaned heavily on the weak ADP report, which showed a 32,000 job decline in September against expectations for a 50,000 gain. As the government shutdown halts official labor data, it leads to increased bets on rate cuts. The CME FedWatch tool shows there’s a 97.8% chance the Fed may cut interest rates by another 25 bps at the October 29 Fed meeting. The central bank also expects another rate cut before year-end during the December 10 Fed meeting. “Markets appear to have responded with relative stability in the first 24 hours following the U.S. government shutdown. It’s worth noting that during the last major shutdown in 2018-2019, which lasted 35 days, markets remained largely resilient, and we may see similar dynamics this time.” -Philipp Zentner, CEO and Founder of LIFI Protocol As the shutdown drags on and economic signals decline, investors appear to be turning to alternative assets, such as gold and cryptocurrencies like BNB. XYO co-founder Markus Levin argued that the market is entering one of Bitcoin’s historically most dynamic months and that traders should be prepared for volatility. BNB Chain reduces its gas fees Today, all BNB Smart Chain (BSC) validators and builders have adopted the new minimum gas price of 0.05 Gwei and BSC is fully ready to accept transactions at this rate. That’s ~$0.005 per transaction, making BSC one of the most cost-efficient blockchains in crypto. What this… https://t.co/qEAHIUHVRI pic.twitter.com/56g86yHgWN — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 1, 2025 BNB’s outperformance of the wider market was also fueled by token-specific catalysts. The asset reduced its minimum gas fees earlier this week from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei, making the network one of the cheapest among other blockchains. The proposal follows previous decisions in April 2024 to reduce the gas price from 3 Gwei to 1 Gwei, and again in May 2025 to lower it to 0.1 Gwei. Validators on the proposal also reduced block intervals from 750 milliseconds to 450 milliseconds. The validators are now proposing that gas fees should be reduced to ~$0.005 per transaction to make the virtual asset more competitive with chains like Solana and Base. BNB Chain validators also stated that APY remained stable above 0.5%, supported by higher trading activity and the digital asset’s price growth. They noted that trading is currently the dominant activity on BNB Chain – and gas fees matter most for traders. Validators proposed that the asset strive to have the lowest gas fees possible, as long as the staking APY remains above 0.5%. They stated that the initiative strikes a balance between network growth and validator rewards, ensuring long-term sustainability. The validators revealed that their goal is for gas fees to drop to $0.001 per transaction, representing a more than 90% reduction from past levels and aligning with the most competitive chains. The digital asset’s activity is dominated by trading-related transactions, surging from 20% at the start of 2025 to 67% by June. Kazakhstan’s state-backed Alem Crypto Fund also named BNB as its first investment asset. Kazakhstan’s government website revealed that it established the crypto reserve in partnership with Binance. The country did not specify the amount of BNB purchased to seed the fund and didn’t provide further details about potential other digital asset investments. The Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development established the Alem Crypto Fund, while the Qazaqstan Venture Group, under the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), manages the reserve.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-binances-native-token-bnb-reaches-all-time-high-here-are-the-details/,"BNB, the native token of the world's largest crypto exchange, broke a historic record, rising above $1,100, according to Binance market data. BNB Surpasses $1,100, Hits All-Time High The token gained 7.27% in the last 24 hours to trade at $1,108.17. This rise is attributed to BNB's strong use cases within the ecosystem and growing investor interest. This market volatility also impacted futures. According to Coinglass data, a total of $396 million worth of positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Of this, $268 million came from short positions and $127 million from long positions. This suggests that investors who leveraged their positions to counter sudden price fluctuations in the market experienced significant losses. BNB is used in a variety of ways within the Binance ecosystem, from trading fee discounts to staking and Launchpad participation. This new high for the token has bolstered optimism for the overall market, while also prompting calls among crypto investors to be wary of volatility. Experts say this rise in BNB is linked to signals of a general market recovery. However, high liquidation volumes suggest that sharp price fluctuations may continue. *This is not investment advice.

This is slightly lower than today's Wall Street and analyst consensus of strong buy. Future upside could come from macro demand for digital payment solutions and the increasing role of stablecoin. The company has proven itself so far to grow cash flow and generate profits while reducing long-term debt to $0. Though it is not a dividend payer, the company does reinvest into share buybacks. The risk of recession and its impact on payment volumes has been discussed. The Stock: A Global Name in Fintech And Payments On the heels of having gone to an AI-related conference recently, and planning to attend an innovation summit featuring fintech startups and topics in a few weeks, I think a sector to talk about today is fintech, and for this article I picked Payoneer ( PAYO ), a NYC-based fintech firm offering a ""payment infrastructure platform."" In my last coverage of this stock last December, I had a neutral view, and afterwards the share price did see a gain for a while, before diving downward again, as you can see in the chart below: PAYO - price since last rating (Seeking Alpha) What I initially liked about the firm was positive macro forecasts for payment gateway providers, as well as the company's lack of long-term debt at the time. Payoneer had some news this summer, as reported in PRnewswire , announcing a ""strategic partnership with programmable financial services company Stripe. The collaboration marks an expansion of Payoneer's Online Checkout offering for cross-border merchants looking to sell direct-to-consumer."" Although Payoneer has a portfolio of various solutions, one of them to use as an example is a way for freelance professionals to get paid by clients digitally: PAYO - freelance payment solutions (company website) My goal with today's article was to take a closer look at the fintech and payments sector, and the company's own metrics, as well as some peers, to determine whether my prior hold rating should be modified. The Thesis: Not Too Late To Bet On The Digital Payments Revolution Based on my research today, I'm calling this stock a buy, which is actually an upgrade from my prior hold rating, and this worksheet below summarizes what factors drove that score: PAYO - rating worksheet (author) My shortened thesis today is that this stock is uniquely positioned to serve macro-level demand for digital payment options expected to grow, with top-line growth indicators and an attractive balance sheet profile and strong upside forecasts. However, what kept it from being a strong buy is that its profit margins have been trailing some key peers, it is not a dividend payer, and we should consider competition from large payment names like PayPal. The Sector: Macro Trends Like AI, Digital, And Stablecoin Are Already Familiar to Payoneer Payoneer is an interesting case because it forges two sectors that I have quite some experience in, technology and financial, and the niche it falls into is transaction and payment processing services. In fact, some years before I began writing for Seeking Alpha, I was actually an IT analyst/contractor at financial firm Charles Schwab ( SCHW ), and since then I increasingly have been following both financials and tech. Some key peer comparables in this space I selected include: Block ( XYZ ) which is the parent behind Square and CashApp, PayPal ( PYPL ), and Western Union ( WU ), all of which deal in various payment transaction solutions. I'll use these comparables in a few sections of this article. The reality that this sector has had to adapt to is increasing trends towards digital and mobile payments. Data site Statista has said in July, for example, that: In a survey conducted between April 2024 and March 2025, some 17 percent of respondents in the United States stated that they had paid with their smartphone for everyday purchases in the past 12 months. Further, there is the increasing role played by Bitcoin and stablecoin payments in this industry. Speaking personally to fintech industry expert Roy Sheinfeld, the founder of Breez Technology , whose SDK (software development kit) allows developers to integrate self-custodial Lightning Network payments into their apps and services, here is some commentary he shared with me: In payments, the near-term shift is toward stablecoins, which already make cross-border commerce faster and cheaper on dollar-denominated rails. Longer term, Bitcoin could be even more disruptive, but that vision will take time. For companies like Payoneer, supporting stablecoin flows today while keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s trajectory is key to staying competitive. I think the few points I raised above point to a sector that could increasingly have to adapt to not just digital payments but also non-traditional currency, such as stablecoin or Bitcoin, so from an investor perspective, I think it could drive upside for those fintech brands who have already gotten ahead of that trend. For instance, fintech giant PayPal seems to have jumped on this new reality. Back in April, CNBC reported that ""PayPal launched PYUSD in 2023, making it the first major financial institution to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin,"" adding that they are also trying to entice customers as ""customers will earn an annual rewards rate of 3.7% beginning this summer. It will be paid in the PayPal USD stablecoin (PYUSD-USD) on their holdings of the same token."" Well, I went and tested it out, symbolically buying my first $1 in PayPal stablecoin, and sure enough, they do send those rewards regularly, and while this article is not meant to promote that as a payment method, it is a sign that the big players in this space are increasingly offering additional options and payment methods. The good news, for now at least, is that Payoneer is also looking to jump on this stablecoin bandwagon, and the fact that they are at least exploring it should add some upside potential to this stock. For instance, industry site Payments Dive reported last June that Payoneer CFO Bea Ordonez had some remarks on this topic: The company sees stablecoins as 'complementary' to its core business at the moment, Ordonez said, with some interest from its customers, but there are still some challenges left to solve in the space, particularly regarding the infrastructure necessary to utilize such assets as a payment rail at scale. In addition to payment trends, the fintech space could see upside from the increased role of artificial intelligence/AI. In its Top Fintech Trends For H2 2025, global consultancy KPMG said the following: There is expected to be significant growth in interest as it relates to the development and use of AI agents — particularly in areas like financial crime and fraud, operational processing, frontline enablement and regtech. Notable on that front is that Payoneer has already recognized that macro trend and is part of it, saying on its official company website: Payoneer is already using AI across a range of functions, including forecasting and modelling to identify new business areas for development. We also use AI to combat fraud, making every transaction more secure for our users, while at the same time improving our customer service to enhance the user experience. So, I think there is cause to be bullish on this sector as it seems to be one with the times and not just adapting but also leading the way towards how many people globally could be paying for goods and services in the future. Revenue Growth: Impressive Q2 Results Along With Positive Guidance For 2025 Now that we have some sense of trends in this sector, let's talk about what company-specific factors could impact top-line growth at Payoneer. After Q2 results announced in early August showed strong momentum and a +16% YoY revenue growth, the company had a positive forward view, saying, ""with a strong market position, differentiated assets, and a clear focus, we are confident in our strategy and are reinstating our 2025 guidance."" That should add some upside confidence to investors concerned about where the firm may be going. In addition, investors could see continued support of the share price, with the firm saying in Q2 commentary (pg 2) that ""we’re confident in our long-term opportunity and are announcing an increase to our share repurchase authorization to $300 million."" Besides potential for future revenue growth, I am also looking for a proven model of past revenue growth and, preferably, a diversification across global regions since this company is in the same sector as major peers like PayPal, which has long been global. We can see from Payoneer's Q2 presentation (p. 13) , that that is just the case with this company, a proven 3 year revenue CAGR across multiple regions of the world, but particularly notable has been Latin America (+31% CAGR). PAYO - rev growth by region (company presentation) Further, in this peer comparison below, Payoneer has an expected forward revenue growth of +10.5%, the best in this group, even beating PayPal: PAYO - rev growth v peers (Seeking Alpha) On a more granular level, a segment where Payoneer has proven itself as a strong revenue grower has been B2B (business to business), as we see in the table from the investor presentation (p. 24) , with the company boasting of +37% YoY growth in the B2B segment, or businesses paying each other: PAYO - b2b growth (investor presentation) I believe the multiple factors above are complementary to the macro factors discussed earlier, and the trend towards digital payments, so for these reasons I am bullish when it comes to revenue growth potential as well. Profit margins: Key Peers Beat On Margins, As OpEx Points To Rising Business Expenses Looking past top-line revenue, let's consider the topic of profit margins, especially since earnings numbers can influence investor decisions so much. This is where the rosy revenue story in the prior section becomes slightly less rosy. For instance, using a metric like the EBITDA margin to get a sense of the core business without use of depreciation, it is at only +15% yet the sector avg. is nearly +22%. Further, the net income margin is a mere +9.8%, while the sector avg is above +23%. On a more granular level, comparable data shows several peers are beating Payoneer on profit margins, causing some downside risk to this stock I think: PAYO - margins vs peers (Seeking Alpha) In addition, although the company has proven it can be profitable, its adjusted EBITDA margin has generally been on a downward trend, as the i nvestor presentation (p 23) shows: PAYO - adj ebitda margin trend (investor presentation) Although the company did not mention any specific drivers impacting this margin trend, what we can see from the income statement data on Seeking Alpha is that operating expenses (other, total) have been continually climbing from Dec. 2019 through the year ending Dec. 2024, pointing to a trend of a business that is increasingly costly to run: PAYO - opex trend (Seeking Alpha) For the reasons covered above, I am inclined to be in the neutral/hold range when it comes to this category, as I think margins can certainly impact earnings growth in comparison to similar peers. Cash Flow Trends: A Proven Cash Flow Grower, Reinvesting In Shares Rather Than Dividends We've talked about profits and margins, but another fundamental business metric is cash flow, so here we touch on some cashflow trends. For one thing, unlike many of the stocks I cover, this is not a dividend payer so that is one less cash obligation that the firm has to dish out, but also is not a great stock for those building a dividend income portfolio. So, if you are still reading, I assume you care about this stock for potential capital gains and not dividends, so along those lines I mentioned earlier that stock repurchases by the company can help support the share price. In fact, the company reported in Q2 commentary (pg 2) that they ""accelerated share repurchases to $33 million at a weighted average price of $6.80, nearly double the amount repurchased in the prior quarter."" An indicator of the cash flow from core business operations, the operating cash flow , has shown signs of growth so far, with data showing +22% YoY growth vs the sector avg at just +12%. I think this shows signs that Payoneer is a proven cash flow grower, which could help support further share repurchases and reinvestment in the company and growth via its innovation pipeline, rather than dividend payments. In fact, the company investor presentation (p 18) shows this trend nicely over the last few years: PAYO - operating cashflow growth (investor presentation) So, while the firm loses some points for not being a dividend payer, it is only fair to acknowledge the positive cash flow trends, commitment to share repurchases, and reinvestment in its business. For these reasons, I am in the low buy range when it comes to the category of cashflow trends. Balance Sheet: No Long Term Debt Adds Strength To the Risk Profile We have talked a lot about elements of the income and cash flow statements, but another fundamental area is the balance sheet and some risk elements to consider. On a positive note, when comparing debt-to-equity vs similar peers I selected in this sector, Payoneer has a D/E of just 0.05, the lowest in this peer group, and painting a picture of a low debt risk in relation to equity: Data by YCharts While that adds some strength to the upside story, as the firm heads towards 2026 in a much better debt position that some companies in this sector. We can see how this looks in its balance sheet , which has not had any long-term debt for a while: PAYO - LT Debt (Seeking Alpha) I did not find any major credit rating agencies covering this stock recently, so that would have been a nice added perspective to mention. I think it is worth being highly bullish in this category as it is a company with no long-term debt yet has a proven positive cash flow growth, so this means less cash will be spent on paying back debt and more can go towards future share buybacks and reinvestment into the company, or future acquisitions that drive company growth. Some readers may take an opposing view, however, saying that lack of corporate debt may be missing opportunities to finance growth. However, I think that makes more sense in environments with much lower interest rates than we've seen in the last few years, thereby waiting for cost of capital to come down. Valuation: A Case of High Fwd P/E and Cheap Share Price At the Same Time Let's take a moment to consider a valuation metric that is relevant to forward-looking investors. The fwd P/E (GAAP-based) is 25.69, which is around 82% higher than the sector average. The non-GAAP P/E is not too much different. At the same time, the fwd P/B is at 2.70, vs the sector average of 1.70. At first glance, this points to significant overvaluation on this stock, which could indicate a highly optimistic market view on Payoneer's future earnings. Interestingly, however, despite those metrics showing overvaluation, the price chart I pulled below shows the stock trading significantly below its 200-day SMA for a while now: Data by YCharts In addition, consensus estimates call for a -24% YoY EPS decline this year, but followed by a recovery in FY26 of +17.6%, and further growth of +23% in FY27. Because the fwd P/E can rise significantly if the earnings estimate falls (which causes a lower denominator in that ratio) then it seems that could be the case here, with the consensus having a negative EPS growth projection for this year. If one were to take the long-term view, though, this is an opportunity to buy a stock trading well below its average, which will see significant EPS growth in FY26 and FY27, if those forecasts come true. Because of declining EBITDA margins, and profit margins trailing some key peers, which I showed earlier, I am leaning in the neutral camp in this case. Future Price Target: A Future +31% Upside Expected Further To determine a future price target, and potential upside to the share price, I created the following table: PAYO - price targets (author) In this worksheet above, I determined my future price target is $6.17 (fwd P/E x consensus EPS estimate) which I then averaged with the Wall St consensus target of $9.81, to get an avg. price target of $7.99. This forecasts an upside of +31% vs Wednesday afternoon's share price. If you are curious why I use both my own and the Wall St consensus price targets, it is to present a more fair and balanced picture of price targets. Nevertheless, a forecast calling for 31% upside is certainly worth adding points to the bullish column. Because forecasts do not always come true, though, I want to reiterate that this is only one component of my holistic approach to rating this stock. Challenge To My Rating: Global Recessions Impacting Spending A potential challenge to my bullish call, not mentioned so far, could be something that could impact the volume of payments flowing through payment processors like Payoneer, a business that depends on high volumes of payments, and I think that could be a global recession that impacts both business and consumer spending volume in general. Because forecasts can vary, and could be ever-changing, I would point to some of the most recent forecasts from established sources. The last trading day of September proved to be quite a bullish one, and on the heels of that Reuters published some US recession probabilities from major financial institutions, indicating at most a 40% chance: US recession forecasts (Reuters) It is also worth considering what Deutsche Bank (DB) said a few days ago in a paper, suggesting that ""2025 will not be a year of rapid GDP growth: U.S. growth is forecast at a modest 2.0%, with the Eurozone lagging some way behind (0.9%) and Chinese growth (4.2%) well below recent historical averages."" So, what could mitigate recession risk for Payoneer is that it is indeed a global business, and as we see above, not every region might experience the same economic growth or slowdown. Conclusion: An Innovate, Future-Driven Business Fall is all about learning new things but also about change, and in the wake of learning much lately about AI and fintech, from the point of view of a future-minded analyst, it seems Payoneer is one of those stocks that is worth considering for a portfolio, in particular as the role of stablecoin and bitcoin becomes increasingly commonplace globally, on top of the existing momentum in standard digital payments tied to traditional currencies. As a business, it has proven it can grow cash flow, grow its top line in several global regions, and continue innovating with its recent partnership with Stripe. In conclusion, the case is strong to go long on Payoneer.",PAYO,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-03 07:51:36

Thai SEC To Widen ETF Lineup With New Rules On Wednesday, Thailand’s SEC Secretary-General, Pornanong Budsaratragoon, revealed that the regulatory agency is working to expand its crypto ETF plans beyond Bitcoin and include other digital assets in the coming months. In an interview with Bloomberg, the regulator stated that the SEC and other agencies are drafting new rules to allow local mutual funds and institutions to offer digital asset-based ETFs for the first time, with the rollout expected for early 2026. It’s worth noting that Thai investors can currently gain exposure to these products by investing in funds managed by licensed asset management companies that invest in overseas crypto ETFs. In June 2024, Thailand’s SEC officially approved One Asset Management to launch a fund-to-fund Bitcoin ETF, which allows institutional investors to gain exposure to BTC-based investment products listed overseas. In January, the Secretary-General unveiled that the regulatory agency was evaluating the listing of local spot Bitcoin ETFs to strengthen the country’s digital assets market, affirming the regulator’s intention to permit both individuals and institutions to invest in locally listed Bitcoin ETFs. “We have to adapt and ensure that our investors have more options in crypto assets with proper protection,” she explained at the time. The new rules would go beyond the current limitations and expand the potential ETF lineup to a broader basket of crypto assets. “Our possibility now is to broaden the criteria for the crypto such as a basket of cryptocurrencies,” Pornanong told Bloomberg. “We want to have broader supply of those crypto assets in the ETFs.” Thailand Continues Crypto Hub Efforts The Secretary-General also highlighted investors’ desire to diversify their portfolios and adopt digital assets as part of their investment strategies, especially among young people, noting that the agency’s main task is to “facilitate” that demand under a legal framework. Thai regulators have been accelerating their efforts to become a regional crypto hub, the report stated, developing multiple policies aimed at making tokenized products mainstream investment choices. Earlier this year, the SEC, alongside the Bank of Thailand (BOT), introduced a crypto sandbox in tourist areas to enhance the country’s appeal as a tech-savvy destination, promote innovation, and the use of digital assets to boost the economy and tourism industry. As reported by Bitcoinist, the TouristDigiPay sandbox, launched in August, aims to facilitate the conversion of digital assets into Thai Baht for the spending purposes of foreign visitors, allowing Bitcoin and digital assets as payment methods in tourist areas to drive adoption. Moreover, the regulatory agency has also proposed rule changes to provide crypto exchanges with flexibility while enhancing investor protection and oversight, allowing digital asset platforms to list their utility tokens or tokens issued by affiliated entities. Meanwhile, Thailand’s Deputy Finance Minister, Julapun Amornvivat, shared a plan to drop capital gains tax on digital assets for five years. The minister announced that, starting January 1, 2025, until December 31, 2029, investors who sell their assets through licensed crypto service providers won’t have to pay taxes on the profits.",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto ETF|crypto investment products|Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)|spot crypto ETFs|Thailand Cryptocurrency Regulation|Thailand SEC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 08:00:45

They recently unveiled a new algorithm called mevjrv12. Its key feature is a faster mempool scanning mechanism and more precise transaction processing within the network. Whereas the bot previously reacted to signals with a fraction of a second delay, mevjrv12 cuts this interval by almost half. With the release of the new algorithm, the Mevolaxy system has undergone a series of technical improvements. The bots now find profitable transactions faster and with less competition from other MEV bots. Additionally, an adaptive analysis module was introduced: mevjrv12 uses machine learning models to predict the network’s busiest periods and automatically adjusts the frequency of its operations. These updates have already impacted user earnings. For instance, the average yield for some pools has increased by 0.09–1% compared to the previous month. It is also important to note that the Mevolaxy team announced the launch of mevjrv12 at the TOKEN2049 conference in Singapore, where the project received significant attention from industry representatives and investors.

Dark Defender highlighted $3.33 and $3.66 as the next targets for XRP, with the second target sitting just above its all-time high . These figures represent levels where the price may encounter resistance as the wave continues. Should XRP extend beyond these points, the chart also leaves open the possibility of further growth. On the support side, the chart emphasizes $2.7 and $2.64 as zones of interest. The digital asset’s current wave is a corrective one, and the analysis suggests it could drop to $2.645, which aligns with the Fibonacci 50% retracement. Sitting below this level is the 23.6% level of $2.228, providing further reference points in the event of a pullback. However, investors have no reason to panic if the asset’s price falls, as these levels could serve as critical areas where buyers may step in and resume the broader bullish trend.

While XRP sits within a corrective final wave, the chart shows a larger Elliott Wave pattern , with XRP about to begin the third and most powerful wave of the entire cycle. If the asset experiences an explosive move to match this wave, the targets on the chart are $4.17 and $5.85, both aligning with the 261.8% Fibonacci level on different scales. The analysis also stated, “This wave can still extend into double digits,” showing that while shorter-term levels are mapped out, there remains an openness to larger potential moves depending on momentum. Acknowledging the current market climate, the analyst addressed the prevailing sentiment, saying, “I know everybody is bearish. I know the US Government can shut down tomorrow. I know.” Despite this, it’s factual that the technical picture suggests continuation, and he anticipates a bullish move for XRP in the short term.

Traders watch the 58% level for a technical trigger that may spark selective altcoin strength rather than a full-scale altseason. Bitcoin dominance at 58% is a make-or-break technical level that may precede an altcoin rotation. Analysts point to an ascending broadening wedge pattern; repeated support tests increase the probability of a downside resolution. Fundamentals and industry commentary (Token2049, Bitget COO) suggest any altcoin gains may be narrow and narrative-driven, not uniform across the market. Bitcoin dominance 58% testing support — monitor wedge breakdown for altcoin opportunities. Read analysis and next-step trade ideas. (COINOTAG) Bitcoin dominance tests 58 percent support as technical patterns and mixed fundamentals create debate over whether selective altcoins will benefit from a potential breakdown. Bitcoin dominance holds at a fragile 58 percent as chart structure and volume dynamics hint at a possible breakdown that could reallocate market share. While price patterns echo previous altseasons, executives at industry events argue that weak fundamentals limit broad-based rallies. Analyst Moustache highlights an ascending broadening wedge; Token2049 commentary and on-chain metrics show divergent signals. Bitcoin dominance now sits at a critical turning point that could determine whether capital rotates into altcoins. Technical analysis shared by analyst Moustache shows an ascending broadening wedge formed from early 2024 through late 2025, with dominance testing lower support near 58%. That pattern follows a run to nearly 65% dominance before a rounded top and subsequent selling pressure. Traders monitoring BTC dominance note that repeated tests of the lower boundary increase the chance of a downside resolution and a reallocation of market share to select altcoins. Source: Moustache “This ascending broadening wedge pattern ($BTC Dominance) is just waiting to crash to the downside,” Moustache wrote, noting the structure’s resemblance to setups that preceded altcoin strength in 2017 and 2021. A confirmed break below support would project a measured move lower and open windows for altcoin market share gains. What is Bitcoin dominance and why does 58% matter? Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market capitalization. When dominance sits near 58%, it signals a contested market balance where a technical breakdown can rapidly shift capital into altcoins, changing market narratives and risk profiles within days to weeks. How could a wedge breakdown trigger selective altcoin strength? The ascending broadening wedge shows progressively higher peaks and higher troughs, but multiple tests of the lower boundary reduce support reliability. If dominance breaks below 58%, capital historically flows into high-beta assets—primarily altcoins with clear narratives or strong on-chain activity—rather than evenly across the sector. The Wedge Breakdown Risk The wedge spans many months of price action, and the inset diagram used by the analyst mirrors classic technical resolutions where support ultimately gives way. Volume confirmation and decisive daily closes below support would strengthen the breakdown case. If dominance collapses beneath the wedge, technical measured targets suggest a sizable retracement in Bitcoin’s market share. That outcome typically benefits altcoins with robust narratives, liquidity, and recent development milestones rather than those lacking fundamentals. Diverging Market Views Notable industry voices at Token2049, including Bitget COO Vugar Usi Zade, caution that broad altseasons may be unlikely without substantive technological progress. He argued that market rotations are currently more narrative-driven and concentrated in specific sectors. Consequently, while technical patterns point to potential altcoin opportunities, on-chain metrics, developer activity, and adoption data remain critical filters to separate likely winners from weaker projects. Frequently Asked Questions Could a breakdown in Bitcoin dominance cause a full altseason? A confirmed breakdown increases the odds of altcoin strength, but a full altseason requires broad fundamental catalysts. Expect selective, narrative-led rallies instead of uniform gains across all altcoins. What indicators should traders watch around 58% dominance? Watch daily closes, volume spikes, on-chain flows, and stablecoin inflows. Combine technical signals with fundamentals like network activity and developer momentum to identify probable altcoin beneficiaries. Key Takeaways Critical level : Bitcoin dominance at ~58% is a decisive technical threshold. Pattern risk : An ascending broadening wedge increases the likelihood of a downside resolution if support fails. Selective opportunity : Any altcoin gains will likely be narrative-driven and concentrated, not uniformly distributed. Conclusion The market now tests a pivotal Bitcoin dominance level that could reallocate capital into altcoins if the wedge breaks.
