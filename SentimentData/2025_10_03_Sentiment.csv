Rebound confirmed at $0.22 support and 100‑day EMA Futures Open Interest rose to $4.23 billion, showing strong speculative positioning. Liquidity clusters above $0.25 and historical trendline bounces make $0.30 a key near‑term target. Dogecoin price rebounds off $0.22 support, reclaims key EMAs and shows bullish on‑chain signs toward $0.30. Read full technical breakdown and trade signals now. What caused Dogecoin’s rebound? Dogecoin price bounced after hitting the $0.22 support level that coincided with the 100‑day EMA, prompting buyers to step in. Short‑term momentum improved as DOGE reclaimed the 20‑day EMA (~$0.24) and the 50‑day EMA (~$0.23), triggering a rapid 9% intraday recovery and renewed upside interest. How do on‑chain metrics support the bullish case? CoinGlass data showed DOGE Futures Open Interest surged to $4.23 billion, indicating more capital and speculative exposure. Liquidity heatmaps reveal clusters above $0.25, which can act as magnets for price if momentum persists. Rising OI with liquidity above current price typically amplifies directional moves. Dogecoin [DOGE] bounced from a key technical level this week, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The memecoin dipped to $0.22 before recovering sharply and retesting a rising trendline support. Bulls defended the $0.22 zone, sparking a 9% daily gain that preserved the broader uptrend. The zone aligned with the 100‑day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), reinforcing its strength as support. After the rebound, DOGE crossed above the 20‑day EMA at approximately $0.24 and the 50‑day EMA near $0.23. That technical shift boosted confidence in a potential move toward the $0.30 resistance level. Source: TradingView DOGE on‑chain metrics: what do they show? Futures Open Interest surged to $4.23 billion, signaling increased leverage and participation in DOGE futures markets. That level of OI typically reflects higher speculative conviction and can precede sharper intraday moves. CoinGlass’ liquidation heatmaps show multiple liquidity pockets above $0.25. If buyers sustain momentum, those clusters may attract price up to near‑term resistance bands. Source: CoinGlass Liquidity patterns also supported upside potential. CoinGlass’ DOGE/USDT liquidation heatmap highlights multiple resistance clusters above $0.25 that can act as price magnets if momentum continues. Source: CoinGlass History repeats at trendline support — what does the past tell us? Dogecoin has previously produced sharp rallies after similar trendline rebounds. Early July and earlier this month saw rebounds from comparable trendlines that led to 15–20% rallies within days. Those historical moves make $0.30 a logical near‑term target, but traders should watch funding rates and profit‑taking risk, which can quickly reverse sentiment.

Near‑term upside targeting centers on $0.30 if momentum holds. Immediate resistance sits at $0.24–$0.25; a sustained break above those levels increases the likelihood of testing $0.30 in the coming days. How risky is trading DOGE after this rebound? Trading risk is elevated due to higher futures open interest and concentrated liquidity. Use position sizing, clear stop levels (below $0.22 support), and monitor funding rates to manage fast reversals. Key Takeaways Support held at $0.22 : The 100‑day EMA and trendline acted as reliable support, initiating a sharp rebound. On‑chain confirmation : Futures OI reached roughly $4.23B and liquidity clusters above $0.25 suggest upside targets near $0.30. Risk management : Watch funding rates and set stops below $0.22; profit‑taking can quickly shift short‑term bias. Conclusion Dogecoin has displayed a technically constructive rebound from the $0.22 zone, with short‑term EMAs and on‑chain metrics aligning to support a push toward $0.30. Traders should combine chart structure, Futures Open Interest and liquidity heatmaps when sizing positions.

Goolsbee stated that the shutdown would most directly impact federal employees by not receiving their salaries on time. He argued that without the release of economic data, the Fed would be “virtually blind” in its decision-making process. “Even if official unemployment data isn't available,” he said, “we will make decisions based on other indicators we have.” Related News: On-chain Data May Indicate a Significant Dump Risk for This Altcoin Goolsbee stated that various indicators indicate the labor market maintains a certain degree of stability, noting that current data indicates the unemployment rate remains stable. However, he emphasized the importance of avoiding hasty interest rate cuts, saying, “We should avoid lowering interest rates too soon.” Finally, Goolsbee said he hopes the shutdown ends soon and doesn't impact the broader economy. As of this writing, a 25 basis point cut is widely expected for the Fed's interest rate decision on October 29, 2025. US President Donald Trump, however, is calling for a more aggressive cut. *This is not investment advice.

The potential reversal comes under the new CEO, Salim Ramji, who previously worked at BlackRock and has spoken about the promise of cryptocurrency. Vanguard finds itself in an awkward position as the largest owner of Strategy stock, primarily through funds tracking the Nasdaq 100, despite adopting a skeptical tone about Bitcoin. A Vanguard spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company “ continuously evaluates our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment ,” although they declined to confirm whether crypto ETFs are imminent. Even if just 1% of Vanguard’s 50 million customers decided to invest in Bitcoin ETFs, that would represent 500,000 new investors entering the market.

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the firm registered the name iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF as a “ 33 Act spot product ,” positioning it as a sequel to its $87 billion IBIT. The $12.5 trillion asset manager’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are generating more than $260 million in annual revenue , with $218 million from Bitcoin products and $42 million from Ethereum. Including smaller crypto holdings, BlackRock’s total digital asset custody now exceeds $101 billion. BlackRock’s Ethereum fund recorded $512 million in net capital inflows last week, according to Farside Investors. The firm disclosed $14.1 billion in digital asset inflows in its second-quarter earnings report, making the category one of its fastest-growing product lines despite representing only 1% of total assets under management. Technical Analysis Points to $128K Target With Consolidation Risk Bitcoin’s weekly chart displays systematic consolidation zones followed by impulsive advances throughout 2023-2025, with current positioning at $120,953 placing the crypto at the upper boundary of what analysts label “Price Discovery Uptrend 3.” Source: X/@rektcapital Each consolidation phase has lasted several weeks to months before resolving with breakouts. The pattern reveals consistent behavior where Bitcoin establishes base-building periods within horizontal ranges before breaking higher into new price discovery phases. However, diminishing percentage gains between each uptrend phase suggest potentially slowing momentum, with moves from $70,000 to $120,000 representing approximately 71% gains compared to 75% gains in the previous phase. The simplified price structure shows even a key break-and-retest pattern around the $110,000 level. Source: X/Coinvo Bitcoin appears to have broken above resistance, pulled back to retest this level as support, and is now positioned for potential continuation higher. Technical evidence supports a potential advancement toward $128,000-$135,000. However, the extended nature of the move suggests that this would likely occur with increased volatility and deeper pullbacks. The key support level for maintaining a bullish structure appears at $110,000-$112,000, where previous resistance is expected to provide support. Failure to hold this zone could trigger retracement toward $103,000-$105,000 channel support, while sustained breaks above $128,000 would open the path toward $135,000-$140,000 before testing upper channel resistance near $173,000.

Solana has already seen added institutional action while it waits for prospective ETF approval, and regulatory go-ahead may trigger a robust leg higher and usher in billions of fresh inflows. But even considering SOL’s positioning, much of the market’s hype remains centered on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale project that’s sweeping the DeFi space off its feet. MUTM is now valued at a meager $0.035 in phase 6 of its presale. Mutuum Finance has already recorded over 16,700 holders and raised $16.7 million in pre-launch funds. With whales and retail traders both positioning for Q4, Mutuum Finance could be one of the best-upside altcoins heading into 2026. Can Solana (SOL) Reclaim $220 as Bulls Eye Key Technical Levels Solana (SOL) is flashing new strength after bouncing off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement near $193, a key technical level that has a tendency to be a launching pad for bull bounce-backs. Price action is currently heading towards a previously broken channel that will serve as near-term resistance, with investors carefully watching for potential short-term correction prior to the next decisive move. If momentum persists and market conditions remain favorable, reclaiming the $220 level seems quite within reach, pointing to a possible prolongation of SOL’s resurgence. As Solana gets back on its feet, investors also look for early-stage, high-potential coins that combine technical innovation with usability, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been a quick-emerging DeFi initiative attracting considerable buzz ahead of the next market cycle. Mutuum Finance Registers Robust Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still trendy in Phase 6 of presale, where it has seen more than 16,700 investors and more than $16.7 million. All this activity is evidence of the increasing faith in the long-term project vision and potential to build the future of decentralized finance. In their continuing commitment to security and transparency, Mutuum Finance partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Security engineers and developers are invited to find vulnerabilities in four levels of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low. This is just one part of Mutuum’s overall initiative to secure its infrastructure and gain the trust of its expanding community. Dynamic Interest Rates and Optimized Efficiency Mutuum Finance protocol is a real-time operating algorithmic floating interest rate system that dynamically reacts to liquidity levels. The borrow cost is lowered in times of high liquidity to incentivize lending and the inflow of new capital. The borrow cost increases when liquidity is low, thereby incentivizing new deposits and loan repayments. This self-regulating process discourages over-leveraging and promotes overall ecosystem equilibrium. Efficiency is augmented by collateral optimization, particularly for correlated assets. Well-collateralised positions have higher borrowing allowance and more favourable Loan-to-Value (LTV) margins, and reserve factors act as a buffer against market volatility. Volatile assets call for higher reserves to stem exposure to volatility, while less-volatile assets allow for higher borrowing with minimal liquidation risk. LTV margins and liquidation points are dynamically calibrated on the basis of each token’s own volatility profile, spreading the risk equitably across the platform. With its presale success, advanced risk management system, and unwavering commitment to security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming a stable and sustainable platform for long-term adoption, growth, and prosperity in decentralized finance. Pushing Ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to press forward, raising over $16.7 million from over 16,700 owners, with Phase 6 already over 55% sold at $0.035 per token. Whereas Solana (SOL) is poised to perhaps reach $220 in the wake of ETF rumors, MUTM rewards early birds with a high-potential DeFi trade through its dual lending protocol, variable interest rates, and robust security, including a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty program. Investors seeking exposure to a utility-driven, fast-growing altcoin should purchase MUTM tokens before presale is over.

ADA’s journey was always characterized by slow and careful advancement, prudent management, and research-driven innovation.l But slow and careful always have their shortcomings. It lays solid foundations while potentially lagging behind during seasons that privilege rapid progress and compelling narratives. Investors now wonder whether Cardano can reclaim its reputation of being a growth leader or remain forever shrouded by the shadow of ecosystems that progress faster. Right now, people are paying attention to new presales that do well because they are scarce, have community support, and are relevant. In retail areas on Telegram and X, excitement is growing for tokens that are not fully launched yet but are gaining attention. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to lead the discussion, making itself a strong candidate for presale with audits, fast growth, and a promise of high returns. The difference between Cardano’s slow decline and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s fast rise shows the two forces that are affecting the crypto market at this time. Cardano’s Slow Burn Cardano’s drop to $0.79 betrays some investor impatience. All its stress on peer-reviewed literature and academic rigor notwithstanding, its adoption timetable appears glacial compared with its rivals Solana and Ethereum. Its developers go on about its robust design, while its traders desire velocity and volume — its weakest points. The tension between ADA’s long-term promise and short-term patience simmers. The blockchain ecosystem keeps expanding through the form of governance upgrades and interoperability initiatives, but the market appears to be unsettled. The pullback reflects the broader volatility while also showing a sentiment that ADA failed to offer the breakout catalysts necessary to spark fresh rallies. The Emergence of Presale Narratives Whilst ADA consolidates, presales are getting all the attention. Early-stage token fans among retail investors will always be drawn to tokens that can send small allocations into overdrive. Presales provide one thing that majors don’t: the potential of exponential return that ground-floor access grants. Communities exist within this narrative. Speculation brews through Telegram channels, influencers shine a light on diverse initiatives, and money pours into tokens that will inevitably be “the next big thing.” Such vibrant energy separates itself from infrastructure projects, motivated not by thoughtful roadmaps but rather by an enduring outlook. MAGACOIN FINANCE As A Top Presale Contender Cardano’s slip under $0.80 highlights the difficulty of extracting large returns from established names. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining recognition as one of the top presale contenders, attracting both retail and whale discussions. Analysts suggest that early allocations could deliver 1,000%–1,400% ROI , given its structure and demand curve. The PATRIOT50X bonus code has added urgency for investors aiming to secure allocations before stages rise further. The contrast is sharp: ADA’s path to double requires billions in inflows, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s small cap base makes triple-digit ROI mathematically more accessible. This difference has fueled its momentum as the presale choice for those dissatisfied with Cardano’s pace. Whales And Retail Converge Whale tracking data indicates increased interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Big players are quietly positioning while retail groups offer ground-floor traction. Such alignment is uncommon — and potent. When whales and retails both get on board, tokens tend to explode dramatically. For traders managing their investments, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides something that ADA does not: quick results. While Cardano is a slow and steady investment, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors the excitement of possible big growth soon. Together, they show how investment portfolios can combine safety with risk. Changing Market Sentiment Cardano’s slow and steady approach is attractive to companies and individuals who plan long-term, but day traders want brighter horizons. The MAGACOIN FINANCE growth demonstrates how this desire appears. Investors don’t want to abandon good projects; they only want to invest in tokens that will rapidly multiply their funds. The outcome is a marketplace that caters to ADA for stability and research purposes and MAGACOIN FINANCE for future gains. The balance explains why MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the top choices during presales and why ADA is debated regarding its relevance during rapid adjustments. Conclusion Cardano’s drop to $0.79 reflects its struggle to maintain momentum in a market that rewards speed and excitement. Its academic foundation and careful governance remain valuable, but investors seeking rapid returns are rotating toward presales with viral growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its audits, scarcity-driven design, and strong community, has emerged as one of the top presale contenders of 2025. It represents the speculative spark that ADA currently lacks, offering retail and whales alike a chance to chase asymmetric upside. For portfolios, the lesson is clear: combine the long-term promise of projects like Cardano with the explosive potential of early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Why XRP Is Still The Better Option,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-is-still-the-better-option/,"SWIFT’s decision to test a blockchain prototype with Consensys (Ethereum) has stirred debate in the crypto space, raising concerns about whether XRP’s role in global finance may be under threat. While Ethereum may offer experimentation, a crypto analyst argues that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) already delivers enterprise-grade performance, compliance features, and real-world adoption that institutions rely on. SWIFT’s Blockchain Partnership Challenges XRP Position On Tuesday, September 30, crypto market expert Pumpius shared a thread on X social media, unveiling the recent collaboration between SWIFT and Consensys that has triggered panic in the market. Although the partnership is presented as an innovative step, Pumpius argues that it exposes a fundamental weakness within SWIFT. According to the analyst, SWIFT has traditionally depended on legacy financial rails and is now attempting to modernize by leveraging Ethereum-based solutions. However, Pumpius points out that Ethereum continues to struggle with scalability, high transaction fees , and centralization concerns. He argues that while SWIFT is aware its legacy rails are deteriorating, adopting a “band-aid fix” is no replacement for core infrastructure. Ripple, on the other hand, has already moved beyond the experimental stage. Pumpius notes that the XRPL is designed to process transactions within three to five seconds, at minimal cost, making it far superior in terms of speed and accessibility. Unlike Ethereum prototypes, the analyst stated that Ripple’s solutions are actively in use across international payment corridors, supported by partnerships with over 100 banks, regulators, and major payment providers. Another major challenge that debates SWIFT’s Ethereum venture is compliance. Pumpius explained that global financial systems demand robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) frameworks—areas where blockchain options often face limitations. He highlighted that Ripple addresses these challenges head-on with the integration of the DNA Protocol, a system enabling verifiable digital identities, zero-knowledge proof verification , and on-chain compliance mechanisms that satisfy regulators while preserving user privacy. Why XRP Holds The Long-Term Advantage Upon further review of Pumpius’ analysis, he highlights that XRP’s position is strengthened by fundamentals that remain significantly relevant to institutions. He mentioned that Ripple has gained legal clarity in the US following the resolution of the SEC lawsuit and is also aligned with ISO 20022 , the global standard for financial messaging. The analyst further pointed to Ripple’s growing momentum, highlighted by the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin with SBI and its ongoing applications for banking licenses. Against this backdrop, he emphasized that institutions do not chase hype but rather adopt infrastructures that reduce costs, boost efficiency, and ensure compliance with regulations. In his view, RippleNet and the XRP Ledger already meet all three requirements, which explains their growing global integration. Concluding his report, Pumpius calls SWIFT’s blockchain move a “desperation play,” framing it less as a threat and more as a sign that change is inevitable. He also described the effort as experimental, contrasting it with Ripple’s rollout of solutions while Consensys pushes Ethereum through lobbying efforts. To XRP investors , he stressed that they are holding an asset with the potential to reprice immediately once new financial rails are fully activated.",XRP|AML|Anti-Money Laundering|ConsensYs|ISO 20022|know-your-customer|KYC|Pumpius|ripple|RLUSD|stablecoin|SWIFT|US SEC|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 22:00:09

Related Reading: Galaxy’s Digital Bitcoin Sales Continue: 1,190 Bitcoin Moves To Binance After bouncing from a September low near $0.205, HBAR has formed constructive patterns, an Elliott Wave advance, a double bottom, and a 10-week descending wedge, that together suggest a bullish turn. With a final decision on a proposed HBAR spot ETF expected in November, traders are wondering if a clear break above $0.23–$0.24 could lead to the $0.30 level. ETF Season Puts HBAR in the Spotlight Macro tailwinds are strengthening, with the SEC expected to make decisions on numerous crypto ETF applications in October–November. Analysts believe that current listing standards improve the chances of approval. Hedera, which has been under review for a spot ETF since 2024, could benefit from an increase in approvals that would expand U.S. investor access. Additionally, Hedera’s reputation in the enterprise sector, governed by reputable council members and involved in real-world finance initiatives like SWIFT panels and public-sector pilots, supports positive sentiment and keeps HBAR relevant as institutions seek scalable, low-cost settlement solutions. Elliott Wave & Wedge Patterns Flag Upside Continuation On the daily chart, HBAR completed a double bottom at approximately $0.205 (on September 5 and 26), with a neckline around $0.255. Price action has since contracted into a falling wedge lasting over 10 weeks, often a sign of upcoming breakouts, while analysts view the move as Wave 2 within an Elliott Wave cycle that started with a 140% surge from late June to late July. A shift into Wave 3, typically the longest and most impulsive phase, would bring the year-to-date high of about $0.3065 into focus, with potential to challenge last November’s peak of around $0.40 if momentum broadens. Market internals are also improving, with a rising Chaikin Money Flow indicating steady net inflows. A move above $0.242–$0.248 could trigger approximately $32 million in short liquidations, fueling any upside breakout. HBAR's price trends upside on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview Hedera Key Levels to Watch: $0.22 Support, $0.30 Resistance, and $0.40 Target The near-term structure remains tight. Traders need a clear close above $0.230–$0.242 to confirm a wedge breakout; reaching $0.248 could trigger forced short exits, boosting gains. Breaking above $0.30 would confirm the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and support the Elliott Wave projection toward $0.3065, then $0.35–$0.40 as market breadth improves. Related Reading: No Accident: The Powerful Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Late-September Rally On the downside, $0.205 serves as the main invalidation level.

Government Shutdown To Drag On, Polymarket Bettors Predict According to the poll titled “When Will The Government Shutdown End,” 43% of participating bettors believe that October 15 is the earliest date the U.S. government shutdown will end. Meanwhile, 35% of Polymarket bettors believe that the shutdown will come to a close between October 10 and October 14. October 6 through October 9 trails behind at 20% of the vote, followed by October 3 and October 5 with just 3% of the vote. Congressional Deadlock Continues With No End In Sight News of the Polymarket poll’s latest figures comes just one day after the U.S. government officially entered a shutdown after both Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on government spending bills. The congressional deadlock continued on Thursday following a failed vote on Wednesday that would have effectively ended the shutdown, leaving no end in sight to the political dysfunction. “…The president has directed his cabinet, and the Office of Management and Budget is working with agencies across the board to identify where cuts can be made, and we believe layoffs are imminent,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an October 1 statement. Meanwhile, key players in the crypto sector have urged U.S. lawmakers to work together in a bid to keep key policy initiatives from stalling. On Wednesday, leading crypto trade group the Blockchain Association took to social media to push members of Congress to find common ground and keep their “foot on the gas.” 1/ Bipartisan momentum is building in Washington around digital asset policy.

The meme coin has reclaimed a key 5-month breakout setup from near invalidation, rising over 7% since the start of the month and showing no signs of slowing down. Derivatives traders are leaning into the move. Coinglass data shows open interest up 10% to $200 million, a level last seen during September’s rally. Shiba Inu open interest surges.

Still, it remains widely sidelined from major market narratives like TradFi. Its open interest lags behind rival PEPE’s $600 million, underscoring the underdog position SHIB carries into the quarter. Shib Price Prediction: SHIB Could Be the Sleeper Pick This early-month rebound affirms the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle forming since May, now nearing its apex as momentum indicators flip bullish. SHIB / USDT 1-day chart, symmetrical triangle sets focus on breakout move. Source: TradingView. The RSI has reclaimed the neutral line, signaling buyers are driving the move. The MACD histogram shows a similar potential trend shift, closing in on a golden cross above the signal line that could mark the start of a lasting mid-term uptrend. The key threshold for a Shiba Inu price breakout sits at $0.0000145, a stubborn resistance level that has capped upside since July. A successful flip of this level into support would confirm the breakout, setting sights on $0.000025 for a potential 90% surge from current levels. But if Shiba Inu manages to claim a bigger share of the market narrative, particularly through new SEC listing standards qualifying it for spot ETPs, demand could expand dramatically. In that case, the rally could extend toward $0.00005, a milestone that would represent a 300% gain. It Took SHIB 5 Months to Get Here – Here’s a More Strategic Play Breakouts are rare for a large altcoin like Shiba Inu.

Bill targets high-usage miners with tiered excise rates to fund energy assistance. Tax ranges: 2¢/kWh (2.25–5M kWh) to 5¢/kWh (above 20M kWh); sustainable-energy miners exempt. Research cited estimates $79M added annually for individuals and $165M for small businesses in statewide electricity costs. New York Bitcoin miner tax proposed to fund energy aid; learn how the tiered excise works and who is exempt. Read the bill summary and implications now. What is the New York Bitcoin miner tax proposal? New York Bitcoin miner tax is a proposed excise on proof-of-work crypto mining under Senate Bill S8518 that charges miners 2¢–5¢ per kilowatt-hour based on consumption tiers and directs proceeds to Energy Affordability Programs to reduce bills for low- and moderate-income households. How would the excise rates and tiers work? Senate Bill S8518 sets tiered rates by annual consumption: miners using 2.25–5M kWh pay 2¢/kWh, 5–10M kWh pay 3¢/kWh, 10–20M kWh pay 4¢/kWh, and consumption above 20M kWh pays 5¢/kWh. Operations using verified sustainable energy are exempt , incentivizing cleaner power use while raising funds for utility relief. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/new-york-bitcoin-miner-tax"" }, ""headline"": ""New York Proposes Excise Tax on Bitcoin Miners to Fund Energy Assistance"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""New York lawmakers propose an excise tax on proof-of-work miners under Senate Bill S8518; funds go to state Energy Affordability Programs to offset higher utility costs.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How the proposed excise tax on Bitcoin miners would be applied"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step outline of how Senate Bill S8518 would assess and allocate the excise tax on proof-of-work mining operations."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Measure annual electricity consumption"", ""text"": ""Regulators calculate a miner's annual kWh usage to determine the applicable tax tier."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Apply tiered excise rate"", ""text"": ""Apply 2¢/kWh, 3¢/kWh, 4¢/kWh or 5¢/kWh based on the consumption bracket defined in the bill."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Verify sustainable energy status"", ""text"": ""Exclude operations that demonstrate use of verified sustainable energy from the excise tax."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Allocate revenue"", ""text"": ""Direct collected funds to New York's Energy Affordability Programs for low- and moderate-income households."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Who introduced the bill to tax Bitcoin miners in New York?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Democratic Senator Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Anna Kelles introduced Senate Bill S8518 to impose an excise tax on proof-of-work crypto miners in New York."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which miners would be exempt from the proposed tax?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Mining operations that demonstrate use of sustainable energy would be exempt from the excise tax under the proposed bill."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How will the tax revenue be used?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Revenue from the excise would be directed to New York's Energy Affordability Programs to provide assistance to low- and moderate-income households and reduce utility burden."" } } ]} Why are lawmakers proposing a tax on proof-of-work miners? Lawmakers say high-power crypto mining increases statewide electricity demand and can push up utility costs for residents and small businesses. The bill references research estimating an additional $79 million annually in costs for individuals and $165 million for small businesses tied to cryptomining-related rate impacts. What are the fiscal and policy implications? The excise would create a direct revenue stream for energy assistance while encouraging miners to switch to sustainable power to avoid taxation. State regulators would need to implement measurement and verification protocols for energy consumption and renewable sourcing. The proposal follows New York’s historically stringent regulatory stance on crypto operations. Frequently Asked Questions How much would the tax cost a typical large mining operation? Tax liability depends on annual kWh use. For example, a facility consuming 15 million kWh would face 4¢/kWh, resulting in $600,000 in excise payments annually under the proposed rates. Will this bill affect AI or other high-performance computing centers? The bill focuses on proof-of-work crypto mining and does not impose the excise directly on AI data centers. A bill release noted broader growth in high-power computing but did not include AI-specific levies in the current text. Key Takeaways Tiered excise: Senate Bill S8518 proposes 2¢–5¢/kWh based on annual consumption brackets. Exemptions: Verified sustainable-energy mining operations would be exempt to encourage cleaner power. Revenue use: Proceeds would fund New York’s Energy Affordability Programs to reduce utility costs for vulnerable households. Conclusion New York’s proposed Bitcoin miner tax aims to make high-energy proof-of-work operations contribute to utility relief funds while promoting sustainable energy adoption. Stakeholders — from mining firms to state regulators — will watch for implementation details, verification standards, and the bill’s legislative progress.

Higher Highs and Upward Momentum Dogecoin established a sequence of higher highs from a low near $0.055 in October 2023 to peaks above $0.42 in March 2024. A subsequent peak above $0.38 in April 2025 continued that upward cadence. Current momentum indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index at roughly 55, indicate room for buyers to reassert control if volume aligns.

Yes. When megaphone formations are paired with rising volumes on breakouts and defended support levels, they can precede sustained rallies. Confirmation requires higher-than-average buying volume and macro stability. What indicators are most useful to track this setup? Volume, RSI, and moving averages are useful. Volume confirms breakouts, RSI gauges momentum (currently ~55), and moving averages help identify trend alignment and dynamic support. Key Takeaways Structure: Ascending megaphone with higher highs and lows supports a bullish view. Supports: $0.16 and $0.19 have been defended and validate the trendline. Actionable insight: Watch for volume-backed breakouts and RSI trends before committing to long positions. Conclusion This technical review of Dogecoin shows an ascending megaphone structure reinforced by defended supports and repeated accumulation cycles since 2023.

Morpho vaults on Cronos bring on-chain DeFi lending to Crypto.com users, with support for US users and vault launches expected this year. Crypto.com integrates Morpho on Cronos for stablecoin lending Users can deposit wrapped ETH/BTC (CDCETH/CDCBTC) and borrow stablecoins to earn yield via Morpho vaults. Morpho is the second-largest DeFi lending protocol with ~ $7.7B TVL (DeFiLlama); similar Coinbase integration reported yields up to 10.8%. Crypto.com Morpho lending on Cronos enables wrapped BTC/ETH deposits to borrow stablecoins and earn yield — learn how vaults work and what it means for stablecoin yields. Crypto.com is adding Morpho lending to Cronos, enabling wrapped BTC and ETH deposits as collateral to borrow stablecoins and capture DeFi yields via Morpho vaults. What is Crypto.com Morpho lending on Cronos? Crypto.com Morpho lending on Cronos is an integration that lets users deposit wrapped Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) tokens on the Cronos chain into Morpho-managed vaults to borrow stablecoins and earn yield. The feature embeds Morpho’s peer-to-peer lending overlays into Crypto.com’s platform for in-app DeFi access. How does Morpho’s stablecoin lending work on Cronos? Morpho matches lenders and borrowers on top of existing lending markets (e.g., Aave, Compound) and will open stablecoin lending markets on Cronos. Users deposit wrapped assets such as CDCETH and CDCBTC, then borrow stablecoins against them to earn yield from lending spreads and optimized routing. Industry data shows Morpho has grown rapidly, with a total value locked (TVL) of around $7.7 billion, per DeFiLlama. Coinbase’s similar integration cited potential yields up to 10.8% for on-chain USDC lending versus ~4.5% holding rewards on-platform. Total value locked on DeFi lending protocols. Source: DeFiLlama Why does wrapped crypto matter for Cronos lending? Wrapped tokens (CDCETH, CDCBTC) mirror value from their source chains and enable ETH/BTC liquidity to be used on Cronos without native chain transfers. This brings deeper collateral options to Cronos DeFi markets and expands on-chain lending capacity for Crypto.com users. Will US users have access to these vaults? Yes. Morpho’s co-founder confirmed the protocol will be accessible to US users. The Genius Act (July 2025) bans interest-bearing stablecoins but does not explicitly prevent exchanges or platforms from offering lending-derived yields, a distinction Morpho and Crypto.com cite to support access. Frequently Asked Questions Can I deposit wrapped ETH or BTC and earn yield on Crypto.com? Yes. Crypto.com’s Morpho integration will allow deposits of wrapped ETH and BTC (CDCETH/CDCBTC) into Morpho vaults on Cronos, enabling users to borrow stablecoins and capture lending yield while remaining on the platform. How much yield can users expect from Morpho vaults? Yields vary by market conditions. Industry integrations (Coinbase) reference potential on-chain lending yields up to 10.8% for USDC in some markets, while platform holding rewards can be lower (around 4.5%). Actual yields depend on supply/demand and onchain rates. Does the Genius Act prevent exchanges from offering these lending services? No. The Genius Act bans interest-bearing stablecoins but does not explicitly bar crypto platforms from offering lending services where users borrow or lend stablecoins. Legal interpretations may evolve, and platforms cite that lending is a distinct activity from stablecoin reserve yields. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/crypto-com-morpho-cronos"" }, ""headline"": ""Crypto.com Integrates Morpho Lending on Cronos to Enable Wrapped BTC/ETH Stablecoin Yields"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a664-5c45-7e93-a04d-e9c96d35cc82.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Crypto.com adds Morpho lending to Cronos, enabling wrapped BTC/ETH deposits to borrow stablecoins and earn yield through Morpho vaults accessible to US users.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can Crypto.com users lend wrapped assets via Morpho on Cronos?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

52583692,https://cryptonews.com/?p=431997,1759444200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52583692.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Today October 2 – XRP, Solana, Cardano",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-today-october-2-xrp-solana-cardano/,"Crypto is blazing green candles a second day in a row, and investors chasing opportunities in the booming $4.18 trillion crypto sector are asking one key question: which coins are the best to buy right now? At its current price of $119,000, Bitcoin is just 4% under its record high (ATH) of $124,128 from August. At the same time, its dominance is slipping as attention shifts to high-performing altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have set fresh ATHs over the past year. This renewed momentum stems from two major policy moves out of Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. legislation providing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Shortly afterward, the SEC introduced Project Crypto , a sweeping initiative to modernize securities rules for the digital age. With optimism surging, XRP, Solana, and Cardano are emerging as strong contenders for accumulation ahead of what could be the next major bull cycle. Ripple ($XRP): Global Payments Leader and 2025’s Top Altcoin XRP ($XRP) surged to an all-time high of $3.65 on July 18 following the GENIUS Act’s approval, surpassing its prior 2018 peak of $3.40. It has since cooled to around $2.98, marking an 18% pullback from its top. The token’s appeal lies in its efficiency as a fast, low-cost cross-border payments network, positioning it as a credible alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Its reputation has been strengthened by endorsements from organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and growing adoption among U.S. financial firms. Ripple’s influence on policy was underscored when CEO Brad Garlinghouse participated in a White House crypto strategy roundtable earlier this year. The introduction of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, shows its ambitions to capture part of the rapidly growing stablecoin market. Momentum was crucially boosted after a 2023 court ruling clarified that retail sales of XRP were not securities, marking a crucial win in its longstanding battle with the SEC and freeing its price to hit multi-year highs. Over the last 12 months, XRP has surged 404%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 94% advance. Following its summer rally, it consolidated near $3 before dipping seasonally in September. Currently, XRP’s RSI is trending upward from 45 yesterday to around 54 as of this writing, indicating investors are rapidly buying back in. Although rate cuts and the greenlight for the first spot XRP ETF failed to deliver an immediate breakout, likely because markets had already priced them in, the presence of multiple bullish flag formations and a wave of pending ETF rulings in mid-October could propel XRP toward $6 or beyond. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Chief Challenger and This Week’s Breakout Large-Cap Solana ($SOL) continues to shine as one of the most scalable and cost-efficient blockchains. Its market cap now exceeds $123 billion, with more than $12.27 billion in total value locked (TVL) per DeFiLlama, underscoring its strength in DeFi adoption. Investor buzz is building around potential U.S. approval of Solana spot ETFs next month, which could attract institutional money in the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have. After bottoming at $100 in April, SOL has rebounded strongly to $226.50. Technical analysts spotted cup-and-handle patterns throughout August and September, signaling bullish momentum. Its 12% rise in seven days makes Solana the fastest growing among the top fifteen projects this week. With regulatory clarity improving, Solana is well-positioned to benefit. Its RSI is at 55 and climbing, and the price has converged with its 30-day moving average after spending a few days trading beneath it, indicating strong consolidation. Support levels hold around $150, with major resistance near $250; breaking that could set up a fresh rally. Revisiting its previous ATH of $293.31, or even stretching toward $400, looks feasible before the close of 2025. Cardano ($ADA): The Eco-Friendly Smart Contract Platform Targeting 2026 Growth Cardano ($ADA) remains among the most resilient altcoins, with 2025 showing it still holds investor confidence. Over the past year, ADA has climbed 144%, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Solana. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano focuses on sustainability and scientific rigor, employing a Proof-of-Stake consensus model and peer-reviewed research. Its design even influenced Ethereum’s own roadmap. With a market cap of $31.1 billion, ADA would need to triple to catch up with Solana and seriously rival Ethereum’s dominance. Trading near $0.8533, ADA notched an 8.4% gain over the week. Supportive macroeconomic and political developments could send it toward $1.50 this fall and potentially back to its $3.09 ATH by year-end. However, even if US regulators don’t deliver, sustained growth at this pace would at least help it to hit $2. Technically, ADA formed a bullish falling wedge between December and April. This is typically a precursor to a substantial breakout, but it has yet to materialize for Cardano. Key resistance stands near $1.15, with a strong support base in the $0.85–$0.90 range. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Meme Flavoured Bitcoin Layer-2 and One of 2025’s Best Crypto Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the year’s standout presales, designed to pair Bitcoin’s security with Layer-2 scalability while tapping into meme culture and community-driven governance. The project’s goal is to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities by offering faster transactions, smart contract support, and decentralized governance. So far, its presale has raised over $19.8 million, with analysts predicting potential 10× or greater returns after launch. HYPER is built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), allowing ultra-low-cost smart contracts and a Canonical Bridge for instant Bitcoin transfers, dApps, meme tokens, and payments. A recent security audit by Coinsult found no vulnerabilities, further boosting trust among investors. The native HYPER token fuels the ecosystem through staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early buyers can currently earn up to 60% APY in staking rewards, while also gaining voting power once governance becomes active.

Bitcoin, the $2 trillion giant of the crypto sector, is currently trading about 4% under its record peak of $124,128. It climbed 2% overnight, matching the 2% uptick in overall crypto market capitalization, which now sits at $4.19 trillion. October, often dubbed “Uptober,” has historically been among Bitcoin’s strongest months, boosting the odds that new all-time highs are on the horizon for multiple leading assets. Meanwhile, U.S. policymakers are providing additional momentum. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first federal statute to clearly regulate stablecoins, mandating full reserve backing. Soon after, the SEC rolled out Project Crypto , a sweeping update aimed at aligning securities regulation with digital assets. With clearer guardrails forming, analysts suggest this next altcoin rally could eclipse the 2021 cycle. Should Gemini’s outlook hold, XRP, Pi Network, and Shiba Inu may lead the charge. XRP (Ripple): Gemini AI Forecasts Significant Surge to $5 Gemini’s models predict Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb up to $5 by late 2025, a roughly 68% surge from its current price of $2.98. XRP has already shown notable strength this year. On July 18, it spiked to $3.65, surpassing its 2018 high of $3.40, before sliding nearly 18% amid global political and economic headwinds. Ripple continues expanding its international payments network, gaining institutional traction. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund recognized XRP as an affordable remittance option for emerging markets. Source: Google’s Gemini It also scored a huge legal victory: the SEC abandoned its lawsuit in early 2025, following a 2023 court ruling that retail XRP sales were not securities. Gemini’s outlook suggests that breaking decisively above July’s high could set XRP on course for $5 by year-end, although other LLMs like ChatGPT posit a more aggressive bull-case run, potentially lifting it into the $7–$20 range. Over the last 12 months, XRP has surged 404%, quadrupling Bitcoin’s 94% gain and Ethereum’s 79% climb. Technical signals are also supportive, with three bullish flag formations this year pointing to possible strength in Q4. While recent Fed rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF failed to spark a breakout. Upcoming XRP ETF rulings in the middle of the month, together with new US crypto legislation by Christmas, could serve as powerful catalysts. Pi Network ($PI): Gemini AI Expects Explosive 20x Growth From Mobile Mining Pi Network ($PI) pioneered the “tap-to-mine” model, allowing users to mine coins directly from their smartphones by simply logging in and tapping daily. Now trading near $0.266, Gemini outlines a scenario where Pi could rally to $5.20 before year-end, a 20× increase. With the team actively developing the ecosystem, several upcoming milestones could reinforce this bullish case. The network has been steadily rolling out updates, moving from version 19 to 23, with a possible mainnet launch ahead, developments that could act as strong price drivers. Since debuting in February 2025, Pi has been highly volatile, including a 171% surge in May. Its RSI has dropped to 30, suggesting undervaluation and room for a rebound, which means for believers, the best possible time to buy in is now. Retesting February’s $2.99 high is an ambitious but plausible target. Even if that doesn’t materialize, crypto’s historical October strength could still propel Pi toward the $1 mark by November, lining it up nicely for a festive bull run. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Gemini AI Predicts Up to 4× Upside in Bullish Conditions Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , launched in 2020, has positioned itself as Dogecoin’s fiercest rival, now boasting a $7.4 billion market cap. Trading around $0.00001242 after a 2% rise overnight, SHIB is moving broadly in line with the collective crypto space, although its high market cap limits it from enjoying the same success across the broader meme coin space, which rose 8.5% overnight to $81.7 billion in total value. Technically, SHIB has already broken out of both a falling wedge and a bullish flag this year. Clearing $0.000025 by November could set the stage for Gemini’s projection of $0.000032–$0.00005 by year-end, a 4× gain from current levels. SHIB’s RSI is currently at 51, reflecting a buy-in that is gathering pace as the rest of the crypto market lights green candles today. Beyond its meme coin roots, SHIB has expanded utility through Shibarium, its Layer-2 blockchain supporting fast, low-cost transactions, dApps, and added privacy, helping it stand apart from competing meme tokens. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Volatility Meme Coin Side Bet Beyond its main calls, Gemini has also flagged rising interest in Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a speculative meme coin positioning itself as Dogecoin’s “amped-up cousin.” It appeals to traders hunting high-risk, small-cap plays alongside community-driven hype. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap project, Maxi Doge embraces meme culture and volatility. Since its launch, it has already raised $2.6 million within weeks. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI emphasizes grassroots growth, leaning on Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading contests, and future partnerships. Out of its 150.24 billion total supply, 25% is dedicated to a “Maxi Fund” for marketing and collaborations. Staking is already live, offering up to 127% APY, though yields will taper as more users join. Currently, presale tokens are available at $0.00026, with prices rising incrementally in future rounds. Investors can purchase directly through the Maxi Doge website using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

Ted Cruz blocked SB 2850 and SB 2851 to seek clearer law-enforcement carve-outs SB 2850 would restrict data brokers from selling sensitive personal data to the public.

What is SB 2850 and why did Ted Cruz block it? SB 2850 is a Senate privacy bill intended to curb data brokers from selling sensitive personal information. Senator Ted Cruz objected, saying the bill as written could impede law enforcement access to critical data and needs refinement to protect public safety while limiting broad data exposure. How does SB 2851 differ from SB 2850? SB 2851 is a narrower proposal that would extend protections primarily to federal lawmakers, state officials and staff, and survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz objected to Senate Bill 2850 , a bipartisan proposal by Senator Ron Wyden to restrict data brokers from selling sensitive personal information broadly to the public. Cruz said the bill needed refinement to preserve law enforcement tools used to locate convicted and suspected violent offenders. The vote drew attention because Cruz was the lone senator to formally object on Wednesday. He clarified he supports expanding privacy protections broadly where practicable, but said the current text risks unintended public-safety consequences. Wyden introduced SB 2850 to curb the sale of names, home addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive data that can be bought by “anyone with a credit card.” Wyden argued the data fuels stalking, targeted violence, and doxxing. Cruz also blocked a narrower follow-up, SB 2851 , intended to protect federal lawmakers, state officials and staff, and survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. He cited the same concerns and offered to work with Wyden to find language that balances privacy and investigatory needs. Source: Freedom of the Press Privacy debates intensified in the wake of several high-profile attacks. Recent calls to expand protections followed the fatal home attack on former Minnesota Representative Melissa Hortman in June. The FBI believes the alleged assailant located Hortman’s address through data broker records. Members of the crypto community have also been targeted. A public database managed by Bitcoiner Jameson Lopp lists over 50 attacks on people or families holding crypto in 2025, many involving perpetrators using online data to find victims’ homes. How could Congress refine these bills to protect privacy and safety? Lawmakers can refine privacy bills by including narrowly tailored law-enforcement exceptions, strict audit and warrant requirements, and defined categories of protected data. Senator Cruz signaled willingness to collaborate on language that preserves investigative access while reducing mass data exposure. Comparison: SB 2850 vs SB 2851 Feature SB 2850 (Broad) SB 2851 (Narrow) Scope All Americans’ data Lawmakers, officials, and certain survivors Primary aim Limit data broker sales to public Extend protections for specific high-risk groups Law enforcement carve-outs Not explicit enough per objection Also deemed insufficient by objector Frequently Asked Questions Why did Ted Cruz block SB 2850? Cruz blocked SB 2850 because he believes the bill, as drafted, may restrict law enforcement access to data used in locating violent offenders and protecting children. He called for clearer, practicable exceptions and offered to work on revisions. Will blocking SB 2850 stop privacy reform in Congress? Blocking the bill delays immediate enactment but does not end reform momentum.

Conclusion Senate debate over SB 2850 and SB 2851 highlights the challenge of protecting Americans from data-broker exposure while preserving investigative tools. COINOTAG will monitor negotiations as Senators pursue precise language to secure privacy without compromising public safety.

The banking network is now testing blockchain-based payments with over 30 major institutions across 16 countries. While this may seem like competition, it actually validates Ripple’s early lead in the space. Swift announces new blockchain-based ledger with 30+ banks. At Sibos, Javier Perez-Tasso, Swift CEO, revealed plans to build a blockchain-based shared ledger to enable instant, 24/7 cross-border payments.

With several spot XRP ETF applications approaching key deadlines between October 18 and 25, 2025 , bullish momentum continues to build for XRP. XRP Price Prediction: RSI Sends Buy Signal After $2.70 Support Bounce XRP has gone up by 6% in the past 7 days as the crypto market has started to recover from its latest pullback. Macroeconomic conditions support a bullish XRP price prediction , with the Federal Reserve widely expected to deliver a second rate cut this month. XRP has just bounced off key support at $2.70 , while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has flashed a fresh buy signal – crossing above both the mid-line and its 14-day moving average. If momentum continues building, XRP could quickly retest the $3.40 resistance. A confirmed breakout above that level may trigger a rally toward $5 , representing a 66% upside in the near term. While there may be uncertainty around XRP’s long-term outlook, early-stage presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are gaining traction. By combining Solana-level speed with Bitcoin’s security, it could be one of the cycle’s most promising plays. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Brings Solana-Level Transaction Speeds to Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces the first Bitcoin Layer 2, designed to fix BTC’s biggest flaws – slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability. While Bitcoin remains the world’s most recognized cryptocurrency, its network still handles only about 7 transactions per second. Solana, on the other hand, can process up to 65,000. The difference is massive. Bitcoin Hyper aims to close that gap by integrating Solana’s technology into a low-latency Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. This unlocks faster transactions, lower fees, and support for smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps—all secured by Bitcoin’s robust network. Early buyers have a chance to secure $HYPER at the lowest price before the next presale stage kicks in. To buy $HYPER, simply connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ) on the Bitcoin Hyper official website . You can either swap crypto (USDT, ETH, etc.) or use a bank card to invest. Buy $HYPER Here.

Bitcoin’s dominance has surged above 52% heading into October 2025, reinforcing its position as the anchor asset while capital rotation into altcoins slows. For many analysts, this “final rotation” phase historically precedes a new surge in altcoin activity once Bitcoin consolidates at elevated levels. Yet even as Bitcoin’s dominance rises, attention is shifting toward the meme coin sector, where Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue their high-stakes rivalry. Alongside these giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a fast-rising contender , backed by viral community momentum and early investor confidence that position it as a fresh challenger in the meme coin landscape. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin Holds Its Ground Dogecoin remains the dominant force in the meme coin market, trading near $0.24–$0.25 . Despite volatility across broader markets, DOGE has sustained one of the strongest community and liquidity bases in crypto. Large holders have been accumulating aggressively, with whale addresses adding over 680 million DOGE in September alone . DOGE Tradingview Technically, analysts highlight $0.25 as the key breakout level. A clean move above this zone could open the door toward $0.28 in the short term , with ETF speculation and network upgrade discussions adding fuel to the bullish thesis. With a market cap hovering around $30 billion , DOGE is still the most liquid meme coin, offering institutional players and retail investors alike the security of scale. Shiba Inu: Innovation Amid Volatility Shiba Inu, priced near $0.000012 , has faced choppier price action compared to Dogecoin. However, the SHIB ecosystem has been actively working to differentiate itself through governance upgrades and new features. The community has rolled out DAO election frameworks and announced plans for an AI-assisted stablecoin slated for 2026. SHIB TradingView Despite recent struggles with burn rate efficiency and technical support levels, whales continue to signal confidence, purchasing over $1.6 million worth of SHIB in the past month. Analysts argue this underlying demand, paired with long-term innovation, positions SHIB as a credible rival despite short-term volatility. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Meme Coin Disruptor While Bitcoin dominance crosses 52% and the meme coin rivalry between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu intensifies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing early buyers eager for exponential returns . Already over $15M in raised funds, its community-driven momentum is pushing it into the spotlight as the best new meme coin play for 2025. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE’S distinction comes from its viral community energy with scarcity-driven mechanics. Its model echoes Bitcoin’s ethos of limited supply while also imitating Ethereum’s programmability features. This combination drives traders searching for the next disruptive meme coin beyond DOGE and SHIB. Analysts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s positioning within the meme coin sector gives it a unique opportunity to capture retail excitement just as Bitcoin’s dominance begins to plateau. With whale activity already showing signs of accumulation and its global community expanding rapidly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the most-watched contender for 2025. Final Thoughts: A Market Poised for Rotation Bitcoin’s dominance above 52% sets the tone for October 2025, but it is the meme coin sector that is providing some of the most dynamic storylines. Dogecoin’s entrenched liquidity, Shiba Inu’s ongoing ecosystem innovations, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive rise combine to form a market narrative that could define the next stage of altcoin rotation. For investors, the lesson is clear: while Bitcoin continues to anchor portfolios, the battle for meme coin leadership — and the rise of new entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE — offers one of the most exciting opportunities heading into 2026.

52586431,596020,1759446021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52586431.jpeg,Analyst Shares ‘Realistic’ XRP Price Prediction For 2025 – It’s In The Double-Digits,https://bitcoinist.com/realistic-xrp-price-prediction/,"The crypto market is full of bold claims, but one analyst is sharing a view that he calls both realistic and possible for the XRP price. The popular crypto commentator’s focus is on XRP and what its price might look like in 2025. At the center of his outlook is the idea that the right mix of factors could send the XRP price to much higher levels than it has seen in years. Jake Claver Predicts XRP Price Could Reach $10–$13 By Year-End The respected voice in the crypto community recently gave his thoughts on where XRP might be heading. In a video shared on X, Claver explained that clear market signals unfolding in the months ahead could drive XRP to a price between $10 and $13 by the end of this year. Claver’s main reason for this prediction is the expected approval of XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). According to him, once these funds are approved, they could bring in fresh streams of money and open new demand, helping XRP finally move into double-digit prices. Claver stated that October will be a key month, as the SEC may decide on the ETFs during that time. Institutional demand would start flowing in, and this added momentum could give the XRP price the strong push it needs to reach this forecasted $10–$13 price range. ETFs And Other Catalysts May Push It Even Higher While Claver sees ETFs as the main driver, he does not stop there. He explained that other factors could help XRP climb beyond the $13 mark, with possible highs reaching $20 or even $25 if conditions turn out to be more favorable than expected. Claver says the future looks promising for the XRP price because blockchain technology continues to improve. As XRP becomes more useful in everyday life, it will naturally attract more attention and demand from everyday traders, as well as institutions such as banks and investment firms that are beginning to enter the market. If blockchain upgrades continue, adoption increases, and institutions stay active in the market, XRP could realistically hit the $10–$13 range. Claver also noted that XRP’s journey isn’t just about reaching the price range. Investors watching both retail trends and institutional moves may find new opportunities as the market evolves. According to Claver, these trends make XRP a token worth following closely in the coming months. With the broader market involvement, he believes XRP could create more momentum, and if the trend continues, the token may climb to higher price levels in the months ahead. If everything aligns, the ETFs, technological progress, and rising adoption, then the XRP price has a real chance of moving significantly higher. His outlook is that a price of $10 to $13 is a reasonable and realistic target, but he does not rule out even more ambitious levels.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 23:00:21

However, fresh data from Binance shows that BTC’s gains barely outweigh the risks posed by the digital asset’s volatility. Bitcoin Maintaining A Risk-Reward Balance According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, latest data from Binance – the world’s leading cryptocurrency trading platform in terms of liquidity – suggests that BTC is currently maintaining a risk-reward balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Dynamics Shift As Binance Premium Signals Aggressive Longs Specifically, the Sharpe-like ratio on Binance currently stands at 0.18, a figure very close to neutral territory. To explain, a Sharpe-like ratio measures how much return an investment generates relative to the risk it takes, similar to the Sharpe ratio but often using adjusted benchmarks or risk measures. When the Sharpe-like ratio is above 0.5, investing in Bitcoin becomes attractive since the potential returns outweigh the risks. On the contrary, a negative reading of the ratio discourages investors from taking risks, since volatility exceeds returns. During 2024, when the cryptocurrency market was largely weak and volatile, the Sharpe-like ratio spent most of the time in the negative territory. In contrast, the ratio reached elevated levels, signaling a strong uptrend, at the beginning of 2025. Currently, the Bitcoin market is trading between the two extremes – the market is neither dangerous nor in a powerful uptrend. Notably, the market appears to be in a phase of equilibrium and accumulation, as it trades close to $119,000. Arab Chain added: The latest figures show that the 30-day average return stands at just 0.26%, highlighting that the market is not delivering outsized gains; investors entering now are likely to see only modest profits relative to risk. Meanwhile, 30-day volatility is around 1.37%, which indicates a natural, moderate level of price fluctuation – not excessively calm but not alarmingly unstable either. BTC Needs A Catalyst For Next Leg Up The CryptoQuant analyst added that the BTC market is currently awaiting a bullish catalyst or strong inflows to extend its uptrend. However, if the Sharpe-like ratio falls below zero again, then a period of price correction may follow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Momentum Indicator: Why 600,000 Transactions Threshold Matters Most On the flipside, the ratio sustaining above 0.5 for several days – coupled with a price breakout above the $120,000 to $122,000 range on healthy volume – would suggest a fresh upward trend for the top cryptocurrency by market cap. Recent on-chain data hints toward a potential rally setup for BTC. Notably, the short-term holder (STH) spent output profit ratio (SOPR) recently recovered slightly to 0.995. That said, Bitcoin must defend the important $90,000 support level to avoid entering a new bear market. At press time, BTC trades at $118,788, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

The token has been trading in the $2.90-3.00 range in recent days, showing resilience after months of consolidation. With momentum building across the market, many analysts believe XRP could be preparing for another push higher. Investor optimism isn’t limited to XRP alone. The broader market rebound has renewed attention toward high-upside opportunities, particularly in presale tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has been attracting speculation of exponential returns as investors look for the next breakout star. ETF approval anticipation Much of the current excitement around XRP stems from ongoing discussions about crypto ETF approvals. While Bitcoin ETFs have already made headlines with strong inflows, attention has turned to whether regulators will extend the same access to other major cryptocurrencies. An XRP ETF would be a game-changer, opening the door for large-scale institutional inflows and significantly boosting liquidity. Analysts argue that the very anticipation of ETF approval could provide fuel for XRP’s price in the coming weeks. Even without a formal announcement, the speculation alone has helped drive demand. Historically, markets tend to price in expectations before events, meaning XRP could see another leg up simply on the buzz surrounding potential approvals. Technical outlook for XRP From a technical perspective, XRP has managed to hold key support above $2.9, which analysts view as a bullish foundation. Resistance sits around $3.05, and a clean breakout above this range could set the stage for a run toward $4 or higher. Market observers note that XRP’s price structure has been tightening, with reduced volatility signaling an impending breakout. If ETF speculation coincides with this technical setup, traders believe a significant upward move could materialize quickly. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the 22,000% speculation While XRP dominates headlines, many retail investors are chasing more speculative plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is being touted as one of the boldest presale stories of 2025. Analysts have floated projections of up to 22,000% ROI if momentum continues and the token achieves broad adoption after listings. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its asymmetric profile: low entry cost with massive upside potential. Unlike XRP, which already carries a multi-billion-dollar valuation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still at the earliest stage of its journey, leaving room for exponential growth. Its rapid fundraising, surging community numbers, and comparisons to early breakout tokens have fueled a wave of demand from investors seeking the next moonshot. Comparing risk and reward The contrast between XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights the spectrum of investor strategies in 2025. XRP is seen as a relatively safer large-cap play, benefiting from institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and the potential ETF narrative. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, represents high-risk, high-reward speculation, where even small allocations could lead to outsized returns if the project delivers. Many traders are choosing to hold a mix of both: anchoring their portfolios with XRP for stability while using MAGACOIN FINANCE as a speculative hedge capable of generating life-changing gains. Conclusion XRP’s outlook remains closely tied to the ETF approval narrative. As speculation builds, the token’s steady trading near $3 suggests that buyers are positioning ahead of potential catalysts. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention for its staggering 22,000% ROI projections, making it one of the most talked-about presale tokens of the year. For investors, the choice between XRP’s institutional upside and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s speculative promise reflects the dual nature of today’s crypto market – one eye on stability, the other on exponential growth.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.3801 Market Cap $611.57M Trading Volume $9.95M Circulating Supply 1.612B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.3822 24-hour Low $0.3684 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.67% 50-Day SMA $0.3898 14-Day RSI 47.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.3966 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Flow is testing $0.38 resistance with bullish momentum backing the move. The daily MACD is nearly turning positive, and volume supports the breakout. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the daily timeframe for October 2, Flow is trading at $0.379, sitting just under the mid-Bollinger resistance at $0.380. The recent rebound off the lower band at $0.325 shows strength, and the MACD has nearly reached the zero line, suggesting momentum is shifting bullish. Daily volume has also picked up, with $1.08M in activity backing this push. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView If price secures a daily close above $0.380, Flow could extend toward $0.435, which aligns with the upper Bollinger band. However, rejection here risks a retest of $0.360, with deeper support remaining at $0.325. Traders looking for entry can consider accumulation at $0.372–$0.375, while the main profit zones lie between $0.405 and $0.435. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, Flow recently surged from $0.355 to $0.383 before stalling just under resistance at $0.380. The Alligator lines are widening upward, confirming the short-term bullish structure. The RSI sits at 67, just below overbought, showing strong buying interest but hinting that a short-term cooldown may occur. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Immediate support lies at $0.373–$0.368, where the moving averages are stacking. Holding this zone keeps the momentum intact, while a break below could drag the price back toward $0.363. If Flow pushes through $0.383, upside targets shift to $0.395–$0.400, which would align with the daily breakout attempt. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3769 BUY SMA 5 $0.3633 BUY SMA 10 $0.3572 BUY SMA 21 $0.3807 SELL SMA 50 $0.3898 SELL SMA 100 $0.3812 SELL SMA 200 $0.3966 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3812 SELL EMA 5 $0.3895 SELL EMA 10 $0.3941 SELL EMA 21 $0.3926 SELL EMA 50 $0.3872 SELL EMA 100 $0.3892 SELL EMA 200 $0.4270 SELL What to expect from Flow? Flow has entered a bullish phase after bouncing from $0.325, but the $0.38–$0.40 zone remains the main resistance barrier. Breaking above it could drive a move toward $0.435, while rejection risks a pullback to $0.368–$0.360 before another attempt higher. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow Flow is seeing a big rise in activity after LayerZero integration, with transactions up over 600%. It continues to support major consumer apps like NBA Top Shot while improving its developer tools through Flow EVM and protocol upgrades. Flow Blockchain just posted one of its strongest quarters yet, blending consumer-scale adoption with surging DeFi momentum.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-reveals-xrp-net-flows-battleline-heres-the-implication/,"XRP community member and game designer Chad Steingraber has outlined what he considers the two most critical factors influencing XRP’s price: capital flows and the pace at which they occur. His comments arrive at a time when XRP is struggling to maintain upward momentum following a decline below $3. After falling under this psychological level, XRP managed to hold support around $2.60 before rebounding slightly. According to Steingraber, recent exchange data highlights $2.68 as a significant threshold, where outflows have continued to exceed inflows. Despite this, he argued that XRP’s ability to remain stable at this level suggests the market may be forming a sustainable price floor. So Chad as ETFs roll out, inflows will invariably outpace outflows. At least initially correct? — JohnnyPicks (@JohnPicksStocks) September 27, 2025 The Role of Net Flows and Velocity In a recent exchange with traders on social media, Steingraber stressed that net flows alone do not fully explain price action. While net flows indicate whether more capital is entering or leaving, the rate and intensity of these movements, what he terms velocity, are equally important. For example, he noted that a rapid inflow of $1 billion within a day would likely create substantial upward pressure on price. By contrast, the same amount spread across an extended period might generate little impact. This distinction underscores why some assets react strongly to sudden bursts of buying, while others show muted price changes despite consistent inflows. Steingraber emphasized that both the direction of flows and the speed at which they occur must be considered when analyzing potential price movements. In his view, the balance between outflows and inflows, combined with how quickly capital shifts occur, will be decisive for XRP in the coming months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Anticipation of XRP ETFs His analysis comes as the market awaits regulatory decisions on several proposed XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Firms including Grayscale, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have applications pending with U.S. regulators, with rulings expected this October. Franklin Templeton is scheduled for a decision the following month. Recent reporting from journalist Eleanor Terrett confirmed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked ETF issuers for XRP and other digital assets to withdraw earlier filings due to new listing standards. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas clarified that the revised framework was anticipated and makes previous filings redundant. Although the exact launch timeline remains uncertain, industry observers consider approvals highly likely under the updated process. Optimism surrounding these products centers on expectations that they will attract significant institutional capital. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg recently suggested that XRP ETFs could draw as much as $5 billion in inflows during their first month of trading. Should such projections hold, Steingraber’s focus on the velocity of capital movements could prove highly relevant in determining how XRP reacts to a surge in institutional participation.

Repeating correction cycles have historically preceded major Bitcoin rallies. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $675M inflows over three days, signaling growing institutional adoption. Exchange reserves are at their lowest since 2018, limiting tradable supply and supporting upward pressure. Bitcoin price nears $118,643 with ETF inflows and shrinking exchange reserves pointing to a potential rise to $180,000—read COINOTAG’s analysis and projections. What is driving Bitcoin price toward $180,000? Bitcoin price is being driven by a mix of repeating historical correction patterns, strong spot ETF inflows, and declining exchange reserves that reduce circulating supply. These combined technical and fundamental signals increase the probability of continued upside momentum toward the $180,000 target. How have historical corrections shaped previous Bitcoin rallies? Chart studies show three prior correction-to-rally sequences where retracements of roughly 23–33% preceded multi-hundred percent advances. Technical momentum indicators, such as MACD crossovers and rising histograms, historically confirmed entries for sustained rallies. Bitcoin nears $118,643 as historical correction cycles, ETF inflows, and shrinking exchange reserves project a potential rise toward $180,000. Bitcoin’s historical corrections repeatedly fueled rallies, with the current cycle projecting a path toward $180,000. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $675M inflows in three days, boosting institutional support for BTC’s rally. Exchange reserves hit lowest since 2018, showing reduced supply and supporting Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Bitcoin’s path to $180,000 is being traced through a repeating cycle of corrections followed by sharp rallies. Chart analysis shows past retracements have acted as launchpads for more substantial upward moves. At the time of writing, Bitcoin traded near $118,643 with upward momentum fueled by institutional and retail participation. Why do repeating patterns matter for Bitcoin’s outlook? Repeating patterns matter because they indicate market participants responding to similar liquidity and sentiment dynamics across cycles. When corrections compress supply and technical indicators align, subsequent rallies can accelerate as FOMO and institutional buy-ins amplify price moves. How do ETF inflows and corporate purchases influence market strength? Spot ETF inflows and large corporate purchases add durable demand. Data shows spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows exceeding $675 million across three days, which reduces float available to retail sellers and supports higher prices. Japan-based Metaplanet increased holdings by 5,268 BTC (roughly $615 million), bringing its total to 30,823 BTC valued at approximately $3.33 billion. Large corporate accumulation narrows supply on exchanges and can materially change market depth. What role do exchange reserves play in price dynamics? Exchange reserves at multi-year lows mean fewer BTC are available for immediate sale. Historically, low on-exchange supply correlates with upward price pressure as demand outpaces available liquidity. Bitcoin’s Path to $180,000 History shows a repeating pattern: -23% → +200% -33% → +120% -31% → +150% Every major correction has been the launchpad for the next explosive leg up. If the cycle continues, Bitcoin could be eyeing $180,000+ next. pic.twitter.com/VVBCx70FIx — CryptoELlTES (@CryptooELITES) October 1, 2025 This repeating cycle demonstrates a structure where declines create conditions for higher growth. The current trajectory places Bitcoin above $116,000 with projections suggesting a possible rise toward $180,000. Analysts note that, if the pattern continues, the next major leg up could mirror earlier expansions. Source: AshCrypto (X) Technical indicators cited by Ash Crypto show a MACD line crossing above the signal line and positive histogram bars, suggesting strengthening momentum. These signals, combined with decreasing exchange reserves and institutional flows, underpin the bullish thesis without relying on speculation. How should traders and investors interpret these signals? Use a risk-managed approach: recognize historical patterns but confirm with momentum indicators and liquidity metrics. Institutional inflows and low exchange reserves are supportive, but volatility remains high and position sizing is critical. Frequently Asked Questions Can Bitcoin realistically reach $180,000 in the current cycle? Yes. Historical correction-to-rally patterns, significant spot ETF inflows of $675M over three days, and exchange reserves at 2018 lows create conditions that have previously preceded similar price expansions. Market confirmation comes from sustained inflows and technical momentum. What indicators confirm a valid breakout toward $180,000? Confirmations include sustained ETF inflows, continued decline in on-exchange reserves, MACD bullish crossovers, and rising trading volumes during advances. Multiple signals together reduce the chance of a false breakout. Key Takeaways Historical patterns : Past correction cycles have preceded large rallies and remain relevant to current expectations. Institutional demand : Spot ETF inflows and corporate purchases are reducing available supply and supporting price discovery. Liquidity squeeze : Exchange reserves at multi-year lows create upward pressure when demand increases; manage risk accordingly. Conclusion COINOTAG analysis finds that Bitcoin’s short-term outlook is constructive as historical correction cycles, $675M in spot ETF inflows, and collapsing exchange reserves align to support further gains toward $180,000. Monitor inflows, on-exchange supply, and momentum indicators for confirmation and manage positions with disciplined risk controls. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-path-to-180k"" }, ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Nears $118,643 as ETF Inflows and Low Exchange Reserves Point to $180,000"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-26.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T10:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T10:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin nears $118,643 as historical correction cycles, ETF inflows, and shrinking exchange reserves project a potential rise toward $180,000.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can Bitcoin realistically reach $180,000 in the current cycle?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

These three alts have also posted impressive gains, yet they may have only started rallying, with a wave of crypto ETFs set to hit the market very soon. The launch of such ETFs will boost demand and volumes massively, with the likes of XRP, Pepe and Dogecoin set to rally hard as 2025 reaches its conclusion. We provide each of these coins with price predictions, unpacking their technicals while also using their fundamentals to provide a forecast of where they could go soon. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – 24-Hour Gains Market Beginning of End-of-Year Rally XRP has risen to $2.98 today, providing a 1.5% gain in 24 hours and a 5.5% increase in a week. The altcoin also happens to be one of the best-performing major tokens over the last 12 months, during which it has posted a 404% return. Yet things are likely to get even better for the third-biggest cryptocurrency, not least because numerous XRP ETFs are likely to launch by the end of the year. This will boost demand for the token massively, as we’ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs over the past year or so. Also bullish is the fact that Ripple is one of the fastest-growing firms in crypto, having signed new partnerships , made acquisitions and expanded into new territories this year. Source: TradingView This makes for a very positive crypto price prediction for XRP, which we can see from its chart is bouncing from an oversold position. With its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) having been at mostly negative levels since August, now may be the time for XRP to rebound and rally once again. Combined with the launch of ETFs, this could push the XRP price up to $3.50 by the end of October, while it could even top $5 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Pepe ($PEPE) – Whale Buys Signal Incoming Push for New Record Highs Pepe has jumped to $0.0000059996 today, which means that it’s up by 4% in 24 hours and by 6.5% in the past week. The meme token is up by only 4% in the past year, which may be disappointing in relation to other coins, but this arguably indicates that it’s due a big leap. It may not be waiting on ETFs like other major alts, but PEPE continues to be a meme token of choice for whales, who have continued to accumulate the token in recent weeks. For instance, one whale bought 1.5 trillion PEPE only a few weeks ago , while another is sitting on a long PEPE position worth $18.5 million . This popularity bodes well for the end-of-year bull rally the market may witness, with PEPE’s chart today also showing the coin rebounding from undervalued positions. Source: TradingView We also see that PEPE could break out of the pennant it has been trading within since mid-July, and if it can decisively break through the $0.000010 barrier then a full-blown rally may develop. Combined with market-wide bullishness that could follow a wave of ETF launches, the PEPE price could reach $0.0000150 in the next few weeks, before closing the year at around $0.000050. Crypto Price Prediction: Dogecoin ($DOGE) – ETFs and Institutions Will Push Meme Token to New Highs by December Dogecoin is another token that has performed very well today, with its climb to $0.2563 representing a healthy 5.5% increase in 24 hours, as well as a 10% increase in a week. DOGE is therefore carrying some promising momentum right now, which has been building over the past couple of weeks, after the launch of the REX-Osprey Doge ETF . And what’s bullish is that Grayscale, Bitwise and 21Shares are all close to launching their own DOGE ETFs, something which could boost institutional interest in the token even further. Looking at the token’s chart today, we see that now may be a very good time to buy the token, just as it starts a run towards higher levels. Source: TradingView Its primary technical indicators show that it has or is about to move out of an oversold position, while it also has plenty of space to rise before it risks any overbuying. Based on this, the crypto price prediction for DOGE is very positive, with the coin likely to pass $0.35 by the of October, before beating its ATH of $0.7316 in December. $1.5 Million and Counting: Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENDOE Creates Buzz During Presale Some traders looking to diversify their holdings may be interested in considering presale coins, which can rally strongly when they list for the first time. This is particularly the case if they’ve had a big sale and then gain some significant listings, with one of the most interesting presale coins right now being ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . Just as the legends predicted… A Virtual Mine-to-Earn platform in the palm of your hand. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/tOsvFJMgo4 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 1, 2025 PEPENODE has now raised over $1.5 million in its sale, which has been running for only a few weeks. This indicates its potential for growth in the future, and one of the main reasons why it looks promising is because it offers a novel use case. It bills itself as the market’s first mine-to-earn token, providing users with the chance to build their virtual mining rigs and earn rewards in popular meme coins (e.g. Pepe, Fartcoin). Holders can build their mining rigs by spending PEPENODE on additional virtual mining nodes, with more nodes equalling greater rewards. This should drive demand for PEPENODE, which holders can also stake for regular rewards. While the coin’s sale will end in the next few weeks, investors can still join by going to the PEPENODE website . The token is currently selling at $0.0010831, although this price will rise again tomorrow. Buy PEPENODE Here.

ETHZilla holds 102,000+ ETH and focuses on L2 yield strategies. ETHZilla converts treasury cash flows into additional Ether and L2 investments to amplify returns. Ethereum network shows $158 billion in stablecoin transactions (data source: DefiLlama, plain text). ETHZilla Ethereum treasury leads a corporate Ether pivot; learn how the firm deploys ETH to L2s for higher yield and long-term growth — read more now. What is ETHZilla Ethereum treasury? ETHZilla Ethereum treasury is a corporate treasury model where a formerly biotech public company holds significant Ether reserves and actively deploys capital into layer-2 protocols. The strategy prioritizes yield generation, infrastructure support, and long-term value capture driven by stablecoin activity and remittance flows. How does ETHZilla plan to generate higher yield than staking? ETHZilla reinvests cash flows from Ether holdings into a mix of L2 protocols and structured yield products. This includes liquidity provision, protocol partnerships, and staged investments designed to capture fees and incentive emissions while providing capital to emerging Layer-2 networks. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""ETHZilla shifts corporate treasury to Ether, targets L2 yields"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999d1c-68cc-71ec-94c7-21fdc2fa2a8a.webp""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""ETHZilla pivoted from biotech to an Ether-focused treasury, holding 102,000+ ETH and deploying capital to layer-2 protocols for higher yield and infrastructure growth.""} ETHZilla’s chief executive moved the public company into Ether reserves to capitalize on remittance flows and stablecoin activity, aiming to deploy assets into layer-2 protocols for higher returns than staking. ETHZilla CEO McAndrew Rudisill says the company pivoted to Ether after identifying opportunities in global remittances and stablecoin-led liquidity. The firm rebranded from Life Sciences Corp to ETHZilla Corporation and now ranks among the largest public Ethereum treasuries. Rudisill frames Ethereum as a primary conduit for global dollar-denominated value transmission, with layer-2 networks offering practical on-ramps for traditional finance applications. Since pivoting into Ether, ETHZilla Corporation has acquired over 102,000 tokens for its treasury. Source: StrategicEtherReserve Why is ETHZilla focused on layer-2 protocols? ETHZilla intends to scale value by deploying Ether into L2s that interface with traditional finance activities, such as structured credit and settlement rails. Layer-2s can offer higher APRs via incentives and transaction fee capture compared to passive staking. Rudisill emphasizes that investing in L2s simultaneously funds network growth and positions ETHZilla to earn protocol-level returns while expanding Ethereum’s utility for real-world assets. How large is ETHZilla’s Ether holding and how does it compare? ETHZilla holds over 102,000 ETH, placing it among the top public Ether treasuries. By comparison, the largest public treasury holds approximately 2.65 million ETH with a stated strategic target to control a meaningful share of supply. Source: ETHZilla The firm’s approach blends reserve accumulation with active deployment: selling a portion of ETH for operational capital, then reinvesting to buy more Ether and fund L2 initiatives — a compounding treasury model. When could ETHZilla’s strategy impact Ether price? Rudisill projects that Ether could rise substantially if stablecoin growth and L2 adoption tighten base-layer capacity. He notes price resistance levels and believes a breakout above intermediate thresholds could accelerate inflows and valuation expansion. Market context: Ether traded near $4,148 and has oscillated between $3,846 and $4,226 over the prior week, per CoinGecko (plain text mention). What broader market signals support ETHZilla’s thesis? Key on-chain indicators include high stablecoin transaction volume on Ethereum — reported at $158 billion by DefiLlama (plain text mention) — and growing corporate treasuries accumulating ETH. These signals suggest increasing utility and demand for settlement and liquidity on Ethereum. Frequently Asked Questions How does ETHZilla differ from a staking-only treasury? ETHZilla blends reserve holdings with active L2 deployments and business-building. Unlike staking-only treasuries, it pursues protocol partnerships and revenue-generating L2 products to achieve higher, diversified returns. Is ETHZilla’s pivot regulatory-dependent? Regulatory frameworks such as stablecoin legislation influence market adoption but ETHZilla’s strategy focuses on technology-led utility and treasury economics rather than short-term regulatory outcomes. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How does ETHZilla generate yield beyond staking?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""ETHZilla deploys Ether into layer-2 protocols, liquidity and incentive programs to capture fees and emissions, aiming for returns that exceed standard staking yields."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why is ETHZilla accumulating Ether?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The company views Ether as both a reserve asset and infrastructure stake, enabling deployments into L2s and real-world asset applications tied to global remittances and stablecoin use."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How ETHZilla deploys Ether to generate L2 yield"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step overview of ETHZilla’s approach to converting Ether reserves into L2 yield and infrastructure investments."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Accumulate Ether reserves"", ""text"": ""Acquire Ether to build a significant treasury base for deployment and to support network alignment."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Allocate capital to L2 protocols"", ""text"": ""Select L2 networks with credible teams and incentives; provide liquidity and structured funding."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Reinvest returns"", ""text"": ""Convert yield and operational cash flows back into Ether and additional L2 allocations to compound treasury growth."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Maintain treasury risk controls"", ""text"": ""Implement diversification, smart-contract audits, and governance oversight to manage counterparty and protocol risk."" } ]} Key Takeaways Strategic pivot : ETHZilla transitioned from biotech to an Ether-focused corporate treasury. L2-first deployment : The company targets layer-2 protocols to generate higher yields than staking. Market context : Stablecoin transaction volume and remittance flows are core demand drivers supporting ETHZilla’s thesis. Since its pivot into crypto, ETHZilla stock has registered a 44% gain year-to-date. Source: Google Finance Conclusion ETHZilla’s Ethereum treasury model pursues both reserve accumulation and active layer-2 investment to capture higher yields and support infrastructure growth. With stablecoin-driven transaction volume and enterprise interest rising, the strategy aims for sustainable, tech-aligned returns. Follow COINOTAG coverage for updates and analysis.

After fueling the recent altcoin mini-season, the crucial ratio has stalled out completely, exhibiting 40 days of stagnation. With the main engine of the altcoin market now idling, the initial euphoria is fading, raising serious concerns about the stability and short-term future of nearly every asset outside of BTC. Is Ethereum Entering A Healthy Accumulation Phase? The powerful momentum behind altcoins has evaporated following the stagnation of the ETH/BTC ratio. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades has highlighted that after a monumental +150% run from its low against Bitcoin, ETH performance has completely stalled for the last 40 days. This pause immediately translates into palpable weakness across the board, with momentum-driven sentiment turning sour quickly as most altcoins start to retrace what they gained in the months prior. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Round 2? Analyst Forecasts Early October Rally Amid $4,200 Retest While altcoin traders prefer to see their tokens rally, the analyst views the current shift as a necessary and potentially healthy correction. He suggests that it’s beneficial that BTC is absorbing some of the bid and liquidity again as it works to pull the entire market out of its current slump consolidation. Daan Crypto Trades identifies the ETH/BTC ratio as being in “no man’s land” currently, adding that he would only regain interest in the pair if it moved back above the 0.041 level or a decisive retest of the 0.032 level. However, the expert concluded that whatever ETH does against BTC will remain the primary barometer for the overall health of the altcoin market and the BTC Dominance trend. Therefore, this key pair should be monitored closely. Reversal Signals Strengthen On The 4-Hour Chart Technical analyst GeoMetric is calling the end of the market slump, basing his bullish forecast on clear signals from his proprietary Gaussian Breakout screener. According to GeoMetric, BTC, ETH, and most Altcoins have all successfully broken out of their Gaussian channels on the 4H chart. The expert views this as a firm confirmation of a reversal, provided these assets can maintain their position above the mid-line of the channel. Related Reading: Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: ETH/BTC Ratio Climbs to Yearly Peak Amid Market Shift GeoMetric noted that BTC has flipped bullish on almost every major time frame except for the 3-day chart, which is the last holdout. Also, he has expressed his focus on the time frame for now. While considering this as a relief and great start to October overall, the market has finally turned the corner after a difficult week, characterized by liquidations, widespread capitulation, and generally terrible sentiment. He acknowledges the difficulty of maintaining a positive outlook when the market is collapsing. “As convinced as I was, it’s never easy bull posting amidst the FUD and asking everyone to hold the line, and it takes a lot out of me,” GeoMetric stated.

In a recent post on X, Scrubs predicted that by the end of the decade, XRP will surpass both Bitcoin and Ethereum to become the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization. At present, XRP represents about 4.4% of the global crypto market, while Bitcoin dominates with nearly 60%. For XRP to achieve the scenario Scrubs describes, its share would need to expand dramatically, pushing it past the two largest digital assets within the next five years. Assessing the Feasibility The gap between XRP and Bitcoin remains substantial. Bitcoin currently holds a market capitalization exceeding $2.36 trillion, compared to XRP’s $177 billion. This $2.2 trillion difference highlights the steep climb XRP would face. Based on today’s figures, XRP would need to appreciate more than thirteen times its current value, trading at approximately $39, to reach parity with Bitcoin’s existing valuation. XRP Will Be #1 in terms of Market Cap by 2030 I’m leaving it all on the table. Bitcoin and Ethereum will be second to XRP. — Cameron Scrubs (@imcameronscrubs) October 1, 2025 However, this estimate assumes Bitcoin does not grow further, which many analysts believe is unrealistic. Several influential figures in the industry, including executives from Coinbase, Cardano, BitMEX, and Telegram, have suggested Bitcoin could approach $1 million by 2030. If those forecasts materialize, Bitcoin’s valuation could exceed $20 trillion. For XRP to match such a level, it would require a price above $335, a target that even many XRP supporters consider improbable within the decade. Scrubs’ optimism is not unique. XRP advocate Coach JV made a similar claim that XRP would eventually surpass Bitcoin. Still, other market voices urge caution. Influencer Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy, has argued that while XRP may see significant appreciation, Bitcoin’s dominance rests on its decentralized structure. In his view, XRP’s efficiency in transaction processing makes it an attractive asset, but Ripple’s large token holdings, estimated at more than 40% of supply, continue to raise centralization concerns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From Armstrong’s perspective, XRP could close the gap with Bitcoin but is unlikely to replace it at the top of the market. Instead, he sees XRP securing a stronger position by 2030 while Bitcoin maintains its lead. Possible Growth Drivers for XRP Despite skepticism, some industry watchers point to several factors that could drive XRP’s expansion in the coming years. Financial institutions and payment providers are already exploring XRP’s use in cross-border settlement, citing its transaction speeds of around seven seconds. Large-scale adoption in this area could provide meaningful demand for the asset. In addition, upcoming developments such as the anticipated Ripple initial public offering and the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by XRP are seen as potential catalysts for wider institutional interest. While Cameron Scrubs envisions XRP surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum by 2030, the data shows this outcome would be difficult. The enormous market cap gap, coupled with Bitcoin’s projected growth, makes such a shift unlikely within the next five years. However, developments such as institutional adoption, ETF approvals, and Ripple’s potential IPO could still elevate XRP’s role in the industry. Even if it does not become the number-one cryptocurrency, XRP has the potential to secure a far greater share of the market than it holds today.

52586434,595982,1759449641,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52586434.jpeg,$2B USDT Just Minted On Ethereum: Fresh Liquidity For Uptober?,https://bitcoinist.com/2b-usdt-minted-ethereum-fresh-liquidity-uptober/,"Ethereum continues to assert its dominance in the crypto market as another USDT mint bolsters its position as the leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. While Tron has long competed for stablecoin market share, Ethereum remains the chain with the highest USDT supply , now holding an impressive $78.5 billion worth of Tether onchain. This new mint underscores Ethereum’s critical role in the digital asset ecosystem. As the backbone for decentralized finance (DeFi), institutional flows, and exchange liquidity, the crypto giant consistently attracts stablecoin issuances that fuel both spot and derivatives markets. The growing supply also highlights its resilience as the network of choice for major issuers like Tether, despite higher transaction costs compared to other blockchains. The timing is especially important as the broader market transitions into a new phase. Bitcoin’s recent momentum has reignited optimism, and ETH appears to be following closely, supported by strong fundamentals. Analysts point out that stablecoin growth not only signals higher liquidity but also reinforces adoption across DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and tokenized assets. USDT Mint On Ethereum Sparks Uptober Hopes The market just received a major boost in liquidity after blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence reported that $2,000,000,000 USDT was minted on Ethereum. Large-scale mints of Tether are often interpreted as signals of incoming market activity, as they provide new liquidity that can flow into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Historically, similar events have preceded sharp price moves, as traders and institutions deploy stablecoin reserves into spot markets. Many analysts believe this fresh $2B injection could be the catalyst for the long-awaited “Uptober” rally. Uptober is a term widely used in the crypto community to describe Bitcoin and Ethereum’s strong seasonal performance in October. Data shows that October has historically delivered some of the best monthly returns for crypto, with multiple cycles marking the start of major bull runs during this period. Investors often anticipate this seasonal tailwind, creating a self-reinforcing momentum effect as capital enters the market. Ethereum’s role in this dynamic is crucial. As the primary chain for USDT issuance, Ethereum benefits directly from the increase in on-chain liquidity. Higher stablecoin balances on Ethereum often translate into greater activity across DeFi protocols, exchanges, and staking platforms, strengthening its position as the backbone of crypto adoption. If history repeats itself, this $2B USDT mint could mark the beginning of Uptober’s bullish phase—supporting not only Ethereum but the broader crypto market. Analysts will be watching closely to see how quickly this liquidity enters the system and whether it helps sustain upward momentum through October and beyond. Ethereum Pushes Toward $4,400 After Bounce Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $4,380 after staging a strong recovery from recent lows near $4,000. The daily chart shows ETH regaining momentum, with price breaking back above the 50-day moving average (blue) and testing the $4,400 resistance zone. This level is significant, as it marked repeated rejection points throughout September, and a decisive breakout could open the door to $4,600 and higher. The broader structure remains bullish. Ethereum continues to trade above the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) moving averages, which have acted as long-term support throughout 2024 and 2025. These moving averages reinforce the market’s upward bias, suggesting that the recent correction was more of a consolidation phase than the start of a broader reversal. Momentum indicators are also improving, with buyers stepping in aggressively after ETH briefly dipped below $4,100 last week. The sharp rebound suggests strong demand around that zone, and short-term traders will be watching whether $4,300 can now act as a support base.

Rome’s 2026 budget framework, signed off at an evening cabinet meeting, noted that the deficit would fall to 2.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) next year, maintaining the target set in April. “We are confirming the line of firm and prudent responsibility that takes into account the need to maintain public finance stability,” in compliance with European rules, Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said in a statement. The deficit is projected to further shrink to 2.6% in 2027, then to 2.3% in 2028, the government said on Thursday. Economic growth is expected to be modest, at 0.5% in 2025 and 0.7% in 2026, while public debt is forecasted to reach 136.4% of GDP by 2028. Exiting EU oversight could strengthen Meloni’s fiscal agenda Hitting the European Union’s 3% deficit ceiling this year could pave the way for Italy to exit the bloc’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), the EU’s monitoring system that flags countries with high deficits. Exiting the EDP would strengthen Premier Giorgia Meloni’s government’s fiscal position and give Italy room to increase defense spending, especially as it aims to meet NATO’s target of 5% of GDP for military outlays—a commitment underscored by US President Donald Trump. According to the finance ministry, the funds it has set aside for defense in the budget are conditional on leaving the EDP. Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti confirms that the new fiscal plan “confirms our firm and prudent approach.” The budget “takes into account the need to maintain public finances in compliance with the new European rules and the essential safeguards for the economic and social growth of workers and families,” he said in the statement. With cabinet approval secured, the focus now moves to parliament for ratification. Credit rating agencies may also respond, with S&P Global Ratings expected to provide an update next week and Moody’s Ratings in November. Fitch Ratings, meanwhile, issued its first upgrade for Italy since 2021 last month. The deficit figures form part of a broader 2026 budget plan aimed at delivering tax cuts for the middle class, supporting businesses that hire and invest, and assisting young families, all while maintaining a solid fiscal position. Since 2019, Italy hasn’t run a deficit at or below 3%. Hitting that level in 2025 — which nobody had predicted — contrasts markedly with France, where the deficit is set to remain above that limit for years to come amid ongoing political turmoil. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Italy had earlier criticized the EU’s fiscal rules, describing them as “old and outdated,” arguing they are unfair at a time when countries feel compelled to spend more on defense. Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, called the bloc’s current budget system “stupid and senseless” and noted it needed to be overhauled to give member states more leeway to boost military spending without fear of facing penalties. Investor confidence elevates Italy amid a fragile economic outlook Italy’s improved fiscal position is being pushed by considerably lower borrowing costs, partly fueled by investors’ enthusiasm for the unusual stability of her premiership and her government’s steady efforts at fiscal repair. Spreads between 10-year Italian bond yields and those of Germany stand near 80 basis points, less than a third of the level when Meloni assumed office in 2022. On the downside, the economy remains fragile, with the potential impact of US tariffs hard to calculate at this time. Italy is also hurt by the challenges experienced by the German economy, which is the country’s key trading partner.

Traders should watch $2,400 for buy-signal clusters and risk management opportunities. $4,700 is confirmed as a key resistance that halts Ethereum’s rallies. Sell signals cluster near $4,700 while buy signals appear at $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400 support zones. On-chain and chart-based indicators suggest a staged correction with potential rebounds at each support level. Ethereum resistance $4,700: watch for a pullback toward $3,300–$2,400; monitor signals at $2,400 for buys — read analysis and trade setup now. What is the $4,700 Ethereum resistance and why does it matter? Ethereum resistance at $4,700 is a repeated ceiling where upward momentum stalls, producing sell signals and shorter rallies. Traders treat this level as a decision point: a clean break could fuel continued gains, while sustained rejection raises the odds of a multi-step correction back to lower supports. How could Ethereum retrace toward $2,400 support? Price action shows staged downside targets. First support sits near $3,300, followed by $2,700, with $2,400 acting as a structural floor. Historical rebounds and current buy-signal clusters often emerge near these zones, suggesting a wave-like decline rather than a single collapse. Chart-based analysis and commentary from crypto analyst Ali Charts indicate this pathway as a plausible corrective scenario. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Ethereum Battles Tough $4,700 Resistance; Traders Eye Possible Pullback to $2,400"", ""description"": ""Ethereum resistance $4,700 may trigger a corrective move toward $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400.

Sell signals cluster near resistance while buy signals emerge at critical support levels. Ethereum could see a stepwise correction toward $3,300, $2,700, and eventually $2,400. Market snapshot: Ethereum is trading below the $4,700 ceiling at approximately $4,169. Mixed short-term momentum and recurring rejections place importance on lower support levels as potential stabilization points. Why has $4,700 held as a ceiling? Repeated attempts to clear $4,700 have failed, producing short-lived rallies followed by stronger selling. The level attracts liquidity and stop clusters, making it a focal point for both profit-taking and short entries. Technical signals near this band show increased selling pressure in recent sessions. What do key support levels tell traders? Support zones near $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400 have historically absorbed selling and produced rebound attempts. On-chain metrics and order flow typically concentrate buy orders around these bands. Traders can use these supports for staged entries and to measure the severity of any correction. How likely is a corrective phase and what could it look like? The current formation points to a corrective path rather than an immediate crash. Expect a wave-like descent with interim bounces around each support. A realistic path is a pullback to $3,300, a deeper move to $2,700, and a final test near $2,400 if selling momentum continues. Expert commentary and charting from market analysts (notably Ali Charts as a named analyst source) highlight the $2,400 scenario as plausible if the $4,700 ceiling persists. This view is data-driven and based on technical patterns and past support behavior. Is it crazy to think Ethereum $ETH could drop to $2,400? pic.twitter.com/nBpoDYwd4g — Ali (@ali_charts) September 30, 2025 Traders should prioritize risk controls: define stops, scale positions, and avoid assuming that a support test will automatically produce a full recovery. Use confirmations such as bullish reversal candlesticks, rising volume, or renewed on-chain accumulation before increasing exposure. Frequently Asked Questions Could Ethereum retest $2,400 within weeks? Short-term timing is uncertain, but the price path and resistance behavior make a retest plausible within a multi-week corrective phase if selling continues without a decisive breakout above $4,700. What indicators best confirm a bottom near $2,400? Confirmed bottoms typically show clustered buy volume, on-chain accumulation, diminishing sell pressure, and bullish reversal patterns on daily charts. Multiple indicators aligning increase confidence in a durable support. Key Takeaways $4,700 resistance : Acts as the current ceiling; failure to break increases correction odds. Staged supports : $3,300, $2,700, $2,400 are logical targets for pullbacks and potential entries. Trade management : Use confirmations and risk controls; watch signal clusters at support for buying opportunities. Conclusion Ethereum is confronting a decisive resistance at $4,700 that could trigger a stepwise correction toward $3,300, $2,700 and $2,400. Monitor technical and on-chain signals closely and employ disciplined risk management.

52587829,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85161,1759452334,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"TRON Holds $0.34, Litecoin Secures Its Legacy, While BullZilla’s 4589% ROI Explodes – Best Presale with 100x Potential 2025",https://timestabloid.com/tron-holds-0-34-litecoin-secures-its-legacy-while-bullzillas-4589/,"Best presales with 100x potential are rare, but when they appear, they capture the full attention of investors and builders alike. In 2025, three names dominate the conversation: BullZilla, the presale memetic engine rewriting tokenomics; Litecoin, the veteran altcoin that has weathered every cycle; and TRON, the decentralized infrastructure powering countless applications. Together, they represent three very different paths toward growth, speculation, stability, and scalability, yet all share a place in the hunt for extraordinary returns. The core tension lies in which route offers superior upside versus safety. At the heart of this analysis is the notion that BullZilla may be among the best presales with 100x potential 2025, a bold claim rooted in its tokenomics, incentives, and momentum. BullZilla: An Engine Built for Surprise BullZilla ($BZIL) commands attention by design. It is aggressively paced, marrying hype and mechanism. The presale is in Phase A of Stage 5 and has already raised over $760,000. The project boasts more than 2,400 token holders and 29 billion tokens sold. The current price in this stage is $0.00011241. Early participants enjoy an ROI of 1,854 percent already. If the listing target reaches $0.00527, the projected ROI from Stage 5A to listing surpasses 4,589 percent. That blend of metrics catapults BullZilla into most “best presales with 100x potential 2025” conversations. What truly reshapes incentives is the Mutation Mechanism. Whenever $100,000 is raised or 48 hours pass, the price increases. That structure forces participation, discourages waiting, and embeds upward momentum into the system. It is a central reason that many regard $BZIL among the best presales with 100x potential 2025. Every incremental investment matters, every delay risks missing a step. The Roarblood Vault further intensifies community engagement. It funnels referral rewards and loyalty bonuses through on‑chain logic, making every user a stakeholder in growth. That kind of design is why BullZilla is hailed among new crypto presale gems, early stage investments, and altcoins with hype. It’s not just virality for virality’s sake, it is engineered demand. Within presales this month or those curating an early presale watchlist, $BZIL stands out. A $1,000 position today converts into 8.8 million $BZIL tokens. With a forecasted 5.92 percent surge entering Stage 5B, time is pressing. That urgency, encoded by its mechanism, keeps BullZilla in lists of best presales with 100x potential 2025. For devs, analysts, and meme lovers alike, $BZIL is a living experiment in how tokenomics can warp behavior. No presale is risk‑free. Volatility, contract audits, liquidity challenges, or regulatory shifts could upend everything. Yet the structure here leans into possibility. In the narrative of 2025’s presale scene, BullZilla arguably belongs at the top of the best presales with 100x potential 2025 ladder. Litecoin: The Steady Baseline Litecoin trades today at $111.33, backed by its robust track record. It has survived countless cycles and continues to serve as a testing ground for payment infrastructure and technical experimentation. For those studying blockchain systems, LTC offers lessons in UTXO design, network upgrades, and durability. Litecoin rarely appears in lists of best presales with 100x potential 2025 because its profile is fundamentally different. It is not selling novelty or extreme upside. It offers relative stability in a high‑volatility domain. Analysts tend to view LTC as a control asset, a benchmark to test strategies against more speculative plays. From the perspective of those curating early stage portfolios or scouting next big altcoin candidates, Litecoin is not often the hero. Yet it remains a reference point for what “mature altcoin” means. Its role isn’t to compete with presales, but to provide contrast, stability, and long view continuity in markets swayed by hype. TRON: Ecosystem Power with Real Utility TRON’s price sits at $0.3412 today, supported by an active ecosystem of DApps, token protocols, and stablecoin activity. It is not a speculative gimmick; it is infrastructure. Developers build here because of scalable throughput, staking economics, and lower transaction costs. Users transact because of affordability. That makes TRON appealing to those following altcoins with strong demand. Though it doesn’t appear on presale rankings, TRON’s influence is felt across many projects that launch on it. In effect, TRON is a foundation layer for many memes, tokens, and protocols chasing high ROI outcomes. While TRON itself isn’t a presale, it underwrites many that aim to be among the best presales with 100x potential 2025. In comparisons of growth potential, TRON sits somewhere between stable maturity and speculative inflection. It is not chasing 100x in a month, but it creates pathways for tokens that aim to do just that. It also offers a measure of security, given its long presence and existing demand. Closing Reflection For Best Presales with 100x Potential 2025 In the race for 2025 dominance, Bull Zilla, Litecoin, and TRON offer three roads. The most hyped road leads to $BZIL, where mechanics and momentum weld together to create one of the most talked about projects in the best presales with 100x potential 2025 conversation. The steady road is Litecoin, proving that resilience and infrastructure still earn lanes. The infrastructural path belongs to TRON, powering many tokens behind the scenes and enabling the ecosystems that will host the next wave of innovations. Readers who watch, analyze, or build in crypto should track $BZIL closely. If it delivers on promises, it may validate many assumptions about how future presales are structured. But one must always balance zeal with caution. None of this is guaranteed. Knowledge, timing, and conviction matter more than dreams. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) FAQS for Best Presales with 100x Potential What drives BullZilla’s price jumps? The Mutation Mechanism triggers price increases when funding thresholds or time windows are met, forcing a stepwise price path upward. How safe is Litecoin as an asset? Litecoin enjoys longevity, broad exchange support, and a steady track record. Its risk is lower than many speculative tokens, though upside tends to be more moderate. Does TRON still attract new development? Yes. TRON’s scalability, staking model, and cost structure continue to draw projects seeking efficient deployment. Is it realistic for $BZIL to achieve 100x? If market conditions, listing price, and adoption align, the ROI math supports it. But that outcome depends on execution and timing. Glossary Mutation Mechanism: algorithm that escalates presale price by milestones or time windows Roarblood Vault: referral and loyalty rewards system embedded in BullZilla’s contract Token holders: individuals currently owning the presale token Presale stage: discrete phase in token sale with pricing rules Liquidity risk: possibility that token cannot be sold due to low demand or market constraints Vesting: release schedule for tokens held by team or investors Summary This article compares BullZilla, Litecoin, and TRON across risk, design, and upside. It emphasizes BullZilla’s tokenomic innovations like the Mutation Mechanism and Roarblood Vault, placing it firmly among the best presales with 100x potential 2025. Litecoin offers stability and historical continuity while TRON serves as an infrastructure and ecosystem host. By contrasting each, the reader gains insight into how speculative opportunity, durable assets, and platform support interplay in crypto’s evolving narrative.
