As Solana continues to see high levels of ecosystem usage and network utilization, the stage is slowly being set for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . MUTM is priced at $0.035 in its fast-growing presale. Price appreciation of 14.3% is what the investors are going to anticipate in the next phase. Over $15.85 million has been raised as the presale keeps gaining momentum. Unlike the majority of the tokens surfing short-term waves of hype, Mutuum Finance is becoming a utility-focused choice with more value potential and therefore an increasingly better option for investors looking for more than price action alone. Solana Maintains Gains Near $234 As Speculation Persists Solana (SOL) is trading at $234.08 currently, holding its 24hr range around $234.42 to $248.19 as it illustrates the recent trend. The token has recorded strong seven-day gains of nearly 13%, far exceeding most of its peers, as it is supported by rising volume and institutional buying. Resistance is at $250-$260, and support appears to be at $220-$230, and thus these are significant levels for potential breakout or pullback. However, new DeFi crypto Mutuum Finance, is being considered by market watchers to have more upside potential, being still in presale. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Stage 6 and offering tokens for $0.035. Presale has been going on very fast, and investors have raised over $15.85 million. The project also looks forward to a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain for convenient payments and as a keeper of long-term value. Mutuum Finance is a dual-lending, multi-purpose DeFi platform that benefits borrowers and lenders alike. It provides the network to retail as well as institutional investors and makes it manipulative-proof and scalable. Mutuum Finance Protocol Overview MUTM rate of interest is a charged variable and well under liquidity management. Variable interest lending is market-based application: available capital will begin to lend at reduced fees, and shortfalls in liquidity indicate additional fees to allow loan repayment and new deposits. Borrowers can even access fixed rate lending for lending and for a better rate than variable and only for highly liquid collateral. Mutuum Finance’s long-term vision is consistent growth through staking rewards, token repurchases, and strategically timed exchange listings as a method of building up liquidity and real-world adoption. Early adoption is also being rewarded with $100,000 giveaway . The campaign has multiple points of entry throughout presale to foster a harmonious community dynamic. Risk and Asset Parameters Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has strong risk management platforms that continuously discover protocol security. The protocol is extremely effective at liquidating under-collateralized and over-lending over-collateralization. Mutuum Finance controls exposure through cascading Loan-to-Value ratios, liquidity limits, liquidation fees, and reserve factors hedging and securing the platform liquid in all market conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor interest as Solana (SOL) is moving near $234, being strong but restricted compared to MUTM’s future potential. Stage 6 presale tokens remain at $0.035, ahead of a 14.3% increase in Stage 7. The initiative already boasts $15.85M, demonstrating picking-up demand. With a USD-backed stablecoin, twin lending strategy, and strong risk management, MUTM is scalable and constructed with actual utility. Backed by a $100K giveaway and community-supported incentives, it offers life-changing ROI potential to investors. Purchase your tokens today before the next price surge.

While established players like Solana (SOL) have seen their days of exponential growth, a new contender is emerging that has analysts buzzing. Ruvi AI (RUVI) is seeing its daily token sales hit record numbers, bringing its path to a $1 valuation closer than ever and leading many experts to believe it can outperform established giants like Solana. This bullish outlook is fueled by a presale that is nothing short of historic. Ruvi AI has officially stormed past the $3.7 million fundraising mark, with daily sales figures now reaching record highs. A rapidly expanding global community, now surpassing 3,600 holders , has collectively purchased over 270 million RUVI tokens . This overwhelming demand signals that the market views Ruvi AI not just as a promising project, but as a genuine contender to deliver life-changing returns. Why Analysts Believe Ruvi AI Can Outperform Solana While Solana was a phenomenal success story, its massive market capitalization now limits its potential for another 100x return. For investors seeking the next wave of explosive growth, the focus has shifted to early-stage projects with strong fundamentals. Ruvi AI fits this profile perfectly. Its value is anchored in a revolutionary super app designed to serve the massive $104 billion creator economy , providing tangible utility that sets it apart from purely speculative assets. This focus on real-world application is what analysts believe gives Ruvi AI a higher performance ceiling than established coins. The project has also secured critical credibility markers that attract serious capital: a successful smart contract audit by CyberScope , which verifies its security and transparency, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , cementing its legitimacy as a top-tier project. The Super App Fueling the Path to $1 The engine behind Ruvi AI’s ambitious $1 valuation target is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will create a powerful and sustainable cycle of user adoption and token demand. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. The Clock Is Ticking: A 40% Price Increase Is on the Horizon The path to $1 is becoming shorter as the presale accelerates. Currently in Phase 3 , the RUVI token is priced at just $0.020 . However, with token sales hitting record numbers daily, this phase is expected to sell out rapidly. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a position. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize the potential of this early opportunity: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further incentivizes the community, adding to the project’s unstoppable momentum. The Opportunity to Outperform is Now As daily token sales continue to break records, the message from the market is clear. The opportunity to get in on a project with a credible path to a $1 valuation, and the potential to outperform established giants, is here. For investors looking to capture this cycle’s biggest gains, the time to act on Ruvi AI is now, before the next guaranteed price increase.

Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Rally Yet? Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025 According to reports, the remark came during a TV appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box, tied to the launch of American Bitcoin, the mining and treasury firm he helped start. Company Holdings And Strategy Based on public filings and company summaries, American Bitcoin has accumulated 2,443 BTC on its balance sheet. That stash has been valued in the low hundreds of millions of dollars at recent spot prices. The firm mixes large-scale mining with the goal of holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, which it says will help it grow both production and asset holdings over time. Eric Trump’s comments were direct. He told viewers that institutions are treating Bitcoin more like a store of value than a fringe idea, and he warned firms that resist blockchain adoption. The tone was strong at times, and the line about Bitcoin being a modern equivalent of gold was used to frame American Bitcoin’s role as both miner and holder. Eric Trump has said: bitcoin is modern-day gold — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) September 16, 2025 How The Company Went Public American Bitcoin moved toward a public listing via an all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining earlier this year, a deal that kept most of the original shareholders in control and positioned the new entity for a Nasdaq debut. Reports show that mining partner Hut 8 holds a large ownership stake, leaving the Trump family and other backers with a minority share. The listing brought fresh attention and capital to the firm as it began trading under the ticker ABTC. Market watchers say the firm’s public debut highlights two trends: mining companies are trying to grow by both producing and holding Bitcoin, and political ties are bringing more headlines to crypto firms. Some analysts point out that holding large amounts of Bitcoin on the balance sheet exposes a company to price swings, while supporters argue it aligns incentives between miners and investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Target $8,500 With Big Money Backing The Move – Details Reaction And Possible Risks Based on coverage of the launch, investors have reacted with both enthusiasm and caution. Supporters praise the prospect of a US-based miner that aims to be transparent and aggressive about building a reserve. Critics point to governance questions, possible conflicts tied to high-profile backers, and the usual risks of a volatile asset being held on corporate balance sheets. Eric Trump’s remark that Bitcoin has taken gold’s role in today’s world reflects both his belief in its value and American Bitcoin’s strategy of mining and holding. Whether that view sticks will depend on how investors and institutions respond in the months ahead.

51894333,583277,1758146437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51894333.jpeg,Is Bitcoin Treasury Hype Fading? Data Suggests So,https://bitcoinist.com/is-bitcoin-treasury-hype-fading-data-suggests-so/,"Bitcoin treasury companies have seen a record-breaking 2025 so far, but CryptoQuant data shows momentum has started to slow down. Bitcoin Treasuries May Be Observing A Slowdown In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has discussed how the latest trend is looking when it comes to Bitcoin corporate treasuries . Popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly Microstrategy), the treasury playbook refers to a model where a publicly listed entity buys and keeps BTC as a reserve asset on its balance sheet. The previous cycle saw this treasury strategy gain some steam, but things have gone up a notch this cycle as the success of Strategy has encouraged companies to go bolder. As the below chart shows, 2023 peaked at just 15 new treasury buyers of Bitcoin, but the number more than doubled to 38 in 2024. 2025 has only continued this trend of acceleration, with 89 companies already having added BTC to their balance sheets, when there are a few months left to go for the year. That said, while 2025 has certainly been impressive so far, granular data could show early signs that a shift may be underway. As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin treasury strategy hype saw an increase over the year, peaking at 21 new firms in July. In August, however, the number dropped to 15, and in the first half of September, so far, just one new company has employed this model. Based on the data, CryptoQuant concludes, “the slowdown has begun.” The cooldown in momentum is also evident in the stock charts of some of these firms. Examples of this include The Blockchain Group, which was sitting at +1,820% at its peak before seeing a decline to +443%, and Metaplanet , down to +55% from its +355% top. “Signs the hype is deflating as reality sets in,” notes the analytics firm. Though while signs have been there for a slowdown, the big buyers haven’t looked done accumulating Bitcoin yet. Strategy has regularly been buying and has added $19.3 billion to its reserves year-to-date. Similarly, Metaplanet has expanded its treasury by $1.92 billion. Today, Bitcoin treasury companies as a whole control more than 1 million tokens, equivalent to 5% of the entire BTC supply in circulation. Strategy alone makes up for 66% of this stack. BTC Price Bitcoin has furthered its recovery over the past day as its price has surged to $116,600.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Corporate Adoption|Bitcoin Treasury|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 22:00:37

51895328,https://cryptonews.com/?p=424601,1758148200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51895328.jpeg,"Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Shiba Inu and Pepe by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/perplexity-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-shiba-inu-and-pepe-by-the-end-of-20/,"Perplexity AI, a fast-growing ChatGPT rival, is turning heads with a bold market call: Perplexity predicts that XRP, Pepe, and Shiba Inu could deliver massive gains as crypto enters a high-momentum phase heading into the year-end rally. Momentum is already building. Bitcoin smashed through its previous all-time high last month, climbing to $124,128 before cooling slightly after a surprise jump in July inflation. Now, with the Federal Reserve officially cutting interest rates by 0.25% at today’s meeting , market sentiment has flipped firmly risk-on – a historically bullish trigger for altcoins and meme coins alike. On the policy front, President Trump’s GENIUS Act, signed earlier this summer, is the first U.S. law to regulate stablecoins and mandates full reserves for issuers. At the same time, the SEC launched Project Crypto – a sweeping initiative aimed at modernizing securities laws to better accommodate blockchain innovation. Taken together, these catalysts could set the stage for a new altcoin supercycle. If Perplexity’s forecasts hold true, XRP, Pepe, and Shiba Inu could be the biggest winners in the coming months. XRP (Ripple): Perplexity AI Predicts $10–$15, Suggesting 5× Upside Perplexity expects XRP ($XRP) to climb as high as $1 5 by late 2025, five times its current price of around $3.01. The token has already shown strong performance this year, peaking at $3.65 on July 18, above its previous ATH of $3.40 set seven years ago, before pulling back about 17%. Ripple continues to scale globally, earning recognition from the UN Capital Development Fund in 2024 as a viable tool for cross-border payments in developing regions. Its long-running clash with the SEC also ended earlier this year, when the regulator dropped its lawsuit, cementing the 2023 decision that XRP’s retail sales are not securities transactions, a milestone for the entire altcoin sector. Perplexity outlines a base target range of $3.30–$5.50, with bullish conditions potentially pushing XRP as high as $15, particularly if the Trump administration follows through on its crypto-friendly agenda or if the SEC approves spot XRP ETFs next month. Technical indicators also look supportive. XRP’s RSI has risen from 54, hinting at increased buying pressure that could propel it to $4 by October. Over the past year, XRP has gained 413%, far outshining Bitcoin’s 97% and Ethereum’s 94% growth spurts. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Perplexity Predicts Ethereum-Based Meme Coin Could See 8× Rally Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has maintained its position as Dogecoin’s closest rival, boasting a $7.6 billion market cap. Currently trading near $0.00001304 after a small 1% rise in the last day, SHIB has held up better than its sector. By contrast, the $80.2 billion meme coin sector collectively fell just 0.4% overnight. Technically, SHIB has broken out of both a falling wedge and a bull flag this year. A move above $0.000025 could confirm Perplexity’s bullish range of $0.00005–$0.00008 by year’s end, representing potential gains of 5× to 8×. Its RSI sits at 51 following recent sell-offs, but analysts expect momentum to return as inflation concerns ease. Beyond its meme appeal, Shiba Inu now powers Shibarium, its own Layer-2 network that facilitates fast, low-cost transactions and dApp support. Added privacy-focused features further distinguish it from rivals. Pepe ($PEPE): Non-Dog Meme Coin with 3–4× Upside Potential Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) rapidly rose into the top three meme tokens, holding a $4.6 billion market cap, making it the most valuable meme coin outside the “dog” category. This is largely thanks to the cultural clout it enjoys as a reference to Max Furie’s iconic webcomic Boy’s Club . Despite competition, Pepe’s liquidity and community backing have kept it relevant. Elon Musk has even hinted at holding Pepe alongside Dogecoin, jokingly referencing it on X. At $0.00001091, Pepe has over the last week gained 12%, outperforming iconic blue chip layer 1 cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and others. Breaking through resistance at $0.000018–$0.000022 could pave the way for a $0.00003 target by mid-autumn. In a more bullish environment, Perplexity predicts Pepe could reach $0.000035, about over 3× above current levels. Charts also show a descending wedge between November and March, historically a bullish formation. With clearer U.S. regulatory structures taking shape, Pepe could be poised for another leg up. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Riskier Spin on Dogecoin Outside Perplexity’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is gaining traction as a high-risk, high-reward meme play. It brands itself as Dogecoin’s ‘roided up degen cousin, appealing to traders looking for bigger volatility with more potential upside. While Dogecoin has matured into a large-cap token that increasingly moves in sync with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Maxi Doge is trying to capture the speculative energy of earlier meme rallies. The project has already raised nearly $2.2 million within weeks of launch. Built as an ERC-20 token, MAXI emphasizes community growth with active Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading contests, and collaboration plans. Out of 150.24 billion total tokens, 25% are reserved for a “Maxi Fund” to support marketing and partnerships. Staking is live with yields as high as 144% APY, though returns are expected to decline as participation grows.

The sprawling digital asset market has hovered near the $4 trillion mark for a while, even though Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $124,128 just last month. The enthusiasm isn’t limited to Bitcoin either. Significant capital continues to pour into leading altcoins and the best meme coins . Over the past year, numerous projects have reached record price levels, signaling that market appetite for crypto remains strong. Adding to this wave of optimism are two pivotal policy moves out of Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the country’s first complete regulatory framework for stablecoins. Second, the SEC rolled out Project Crypto, an initiative to modernize and clarify the application of securities law to digital assets. Amid this backdrop of rising confidence, let’s explore how tokens such as XRP, Pi Coin, and Solana are some of the best crypto to buy today. Ripple ($XRP): This World Leading Cross-Border Payments Token is One of the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) marked a new record at $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act was signed, surpassing its 2018 high of $3.40. Since then, the price has eased to about $3.01, around 17% below its peak. XRP stands out for its speed and low fees, offering a real alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Its legitimacy has been reinforced by acknowledgments from global institutions, including the UN Capital Development Fund and even the White House. CEO Brad Garlinghouse also joined a high-profile presidential crypto roundtable earlier this year. Momentum picked up in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that XRP’s retail sales did not breach securities laws, ending a long dispute with the SEC. Over the past year, XRP has gained 413%, making it more profitable than Bitcoin, which only posted 97% growth in the same period. July’s breakout demonstrated its strength, and despite a recent cooldown, the token has held steady even as broader crypto markets dipped slightly. Its RSI currently sits near 53, a neutral zone, suggesting traders are re-entering after last month’s inflation scare. With XRP hovering above its 30-day moving average of $2.90 and holding firm at the $3 psychological support level, the community is hopeful that the next push could see prices approaching $4 by October. Pi Network ($PI): Can the Mobile Mining Pioneer Retest Its Highs Before Summer Ends? Pi Network has shaken up traditional mining with its tap-to-mine system, which eliminates the need for expensive hardware and heavy energy consumption. By letting users earn tokens through its mobile app with simple daily interaction, Pi has made crypto more accessible to beginners. Since May, its RSI has stayed around or below 50, which indicates the asset was underperforming for most of the year. However, the development team is now implementing a phased rollout toward version 23, which could finally lead to a long-awaited mainnet launch. For long-term believers, this lull could represent a strategic buying window. A falling wedge pattern across its support and resistance lines throughout March points to a possible rebound. If sentiment improves, Pi may climb back above the dollar before winter. With its user-friendly interface and custom-built Layer 1 blockchain, Pi Network is positioning itself as a key player in the next wave of adoption. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Biggest Rival is the Best Performing Blue Chip Crypto This Month Solana ($SOL) continues to dominate as a high-speed, low-cost blockchain. Its market cap has climbed past $127 billion, with more than $12.5 billion , in total value locked (TVL) according to DeFiLlama, cementing its importance in the DeFi ecosystem. Speculation is mounting that Solana could soon receive approval for a spot ETF, following the footsteps of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such a move would attract institutional investors who prefer regulated pathways into crypto. After slipping to $100 in April, SOL has recovered to $235, gaining 30% over the past thirty days, outperforming both Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP, which only posted single digit percentage gains over the same period. With the SEC now actively shaping digital asset regulation, Solana could benefit further in the coming months. Its RSI is downtrending from 63, signaling a sell-off is potentially in swing that could further discount the price in the coming days.. Support holds strong around $150, while resistance lies at $200 and $250. Reclaiming its ATH of $293.31, or even pushing past $300, remains a real possibility before the end of 2025. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Bitcoin’s First Layer 2 and One of 2025’s Hottest Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has become one of 2025’s most talked-about presales. Marketed as Bitcoin’s first Layer 2 solution, it blends the viral energy of meme culture with rapid scaling and community-driven development. The project’s mission is to supercharge BTC with faster transactions, broader utility, and grassroots governance. The presale has already raised more than $16.4 million, with some analysts projecting potential post-launch gains exceeding 10×. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER enables lightning-fast smart contracts for Bitcoin while maintaining low fees. One of its standout innovations is the Canonical Bridge, which supports near-instant BTC transfers across its Layer 2 while enabling dApps, meme tokens, and payment solutions with minimal gas costs. A recent Coinsult audit found no issues, strengthening investor trust. HYPER tokens fuel staking, fees, and governance. Early presale buyers can earn up to 70% APY by staking their holdings, along with voting rights on future upgrades.

The Altcoin Season Index has risen well above the critical threshold of 75, reaching 78. This signal historically marks the start of powerful rallies in alternative assets. Bitcoin continues to hold steady, although investors are turning to projects that have big upside potential. As traders prepare for this cycle, they are rebalancing portfolios in order to capture safety and growth. Established giants provide stability, but presales promise explosive returns. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has risen to the top of the investor list in a short period. Analysts even project a staggering 1500% ROI before the end of Q4. Altcoin season confirmed with index explosion The Altcoin Season Index is a widely followed market index. It is a measure of how performing altcoins have compared with Bitcoin. When the index exceeds 75, it confirms the altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. Analyst BitBull stressed that the current reading of 78 marks the official beginning of altcoin season. Historically, these levels have preceded prolonged rallies of major and minor tokens. Traders are reallocating capital into altcoins in anticipation of faster and greater price action. Moreover, crypto analyst CryptoJack has highlighted the potential for day-to-day gains as high as 40%. Bitcoin’s stability makes room for speculative flows and allows altcoins to gain the attention of investors. With the decline of dominance, alternative assets are all set for amazing growth. The role of the golden cross Technical signals are adding to the bullish environment. Master of Crypto pointed out the formation of a golden cross in the altcoin market. This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average. Golden crosses have been a marker of explosive cycles. In both 2017 and 2021, the altcoins soared after this pattern. Some tokens went up by thousands of percent in a matter of weeks. With this signal flashing once again, altcoin revival confidence is gaining momentum. Traders take this as a green light to step up the exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE presale momentum As the altcoin season starts to make its way back, investors are starting to shift their strategy in order to get the most from it all! The Altcoin Index has recently shot up to 78/100, a huge revival in sentiment. This environment has traders rebalancing portfolios, mixing in established giants alongside high ROI. MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning out to be one of those great plays. Analysts continue to predict that MAGACOIN FINANCE is set to return up to 1500% before the end of Q4. This bold forecast is indicative of both its deflationary tokenomics as well as the market buzz growing around it. Investors are realizing that although blue-chip assets such as Ethereum and XRP offer stability, there are often other, smaller-cap tokens that have an outsized upside during bull cycles. Add in a scarcity-driven model fueled by a 12% transaction burn, and it’s easy to see why traders are betting big. For many, it signifies the sweet spot between resilient foundations and explosive growth potential. In a nutshell, though, MAGACOIN FINANCE is on the rise as the low-cap gem investors want for this cycle’s high-reward phase. Conclusion Altcoin Season Index crossing 78 has confirmed a revival of altseason. Analysts think the current signals the start of another strong run. With Bitcoin staying strong, altcoins are taking center stage once again. Technical indicators like the golden cross add further strength to the outlook, thereby adding to the bullish case. At the same time, presale opportunities are getting equal attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with massive ROI predictions. For investors, it is the balancing act of trust and explosive growth potential. As portfolios become more diversified, this mix of stability and high-risk, high-reward assets characterizes the cycle for 2025. Altcoin revival is here, and investors are positioning themselves early to make the most gains.

XMR could reach a maximum price of $1,190.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, Monero’s price may surge to $2,729.83. Monero (XMR) stands out in the cryptocurrency space for its strong focus on privacy and decentralization of transactions, making it one of the leading privacy focused cryptocurrencies.

Monero price has support and resistance at $280 and $300, respectively. The Monero price analysis for September 17 shows XMR has fallen back to the $290 level. Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR breaks down to $290 The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicates a mixed market sentiment as the altcoin observes an increase of more than 10% of its value in the last 30 days as XMR rose from the $270 price level to the $320 mark. However, after reaching the $320 mark, the mounting selling pressure caused a sharp crash to the $290 mark where the price trades at press time. XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView The indicators reflect the strong bullish price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show rising buying pressure. The MACD is bullish at 4.70 units and shows falling bullish momentum at the current price level. Moreover, the RSI was hovering above the overbought line trading but now returns to the mean level suggesting an immediate correction for XMR across the daily charts. The diverging Bollinger Bands suggest high volatility across the next few days. Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart shows that Monero observed strong bullish momentum until it reached the $325 level where it finds short-term resistance level and returned back to the $290 level. Currently, the bulls seek to hold the $290 resistance but with rising bearish pressure, price may continue to decline. XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView The RSI is at45.12, showing neutral trend position as XMR returns to the bottom line of the Bollinger Bands.

XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a great bullish as the price rapidly rose to the $320 mark. However, the price finds bearish pressure at the level causing a decline back to the $290 level. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to consolidate at the current level as the trend corrects. The price should be expected to trade below the $300 mark but is not expected to fall below $2750. On the other hand, a bearish breakout would mean a drop below the $250 level. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a great bullish as the price rapidly rose to the $320 mark. However, the price finds bearish pressure at the level causing a decline back to the $290 level. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges that could hinder significant growth . $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current Monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

51896365,583525,1758150024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51896365.jpeg,"Bitcoin ETFs See $2.3B Surge, Strongest Since July: What It Means For The Price Outlook",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-see-2-3b-surge-since-july-what-it-mean/,"Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are back in the spotlight after registering their strongest inflows since July. According to K33 Research, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $2.34 billion in net inflows last week, lifting combined holdings to 1.32 million BTC. This surge marks a decisive return of institutional demand, with ETFs surpassing their July peak and cementing their role as a critical driver of Bitcoin’s market performance. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) once again dominated activity, pulling in over $1 billion in inflows, while Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured $843 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB followed with nearly $182 million. Together, these three issuers absorbed more than $2 billion, reflecting the consolidation of investor confidence around the largest fund managers. Institutional Demand Pushes Bitcoin ETFs Higher Recent trends show that ETFs have become the main method for institutional and retail investors to gain regulated Bitcoin exposure. Analysts at Bitwise noted that inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded new BTC supply by almost nine times, creating a bullish supply-demand imbalance that enhances Bitcoin’s price outlook. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are struggling to keep pace. Reports show $62 million in weekly outflows, with Fidelity’s FETH and Bitwise’s ETHW leading the declines. This divergence suggests a market “re-rotation” from Ethereum back to Bitcoin, as traders prioritize BTC ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve rate decision. What It Means for BTC’s Price Outlook With net assets of Bitcoin ETFs now above $150 billion, equivalent to over 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market cap, these products are shaping BTC’s price trajectory more than ever before. Strong inflows typically translate into buying pressure, and if the trend continues, analysts believe ETFs could soon hold 10% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. However, volatility risks remain. While inflows signal bullish sentiment, upcoming macroeconomic events, particularly the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, could influence short-term market direction. A dovish Fed stance may push Bitcoin toward the $60,000–$65,000 resistance zone, while a hawkish outlook could test support near $55,000. Currently, the message is clear: institutional demand for Bitcoin is increasing, ETFs are spearheading the movement, and the inflows indicate growing confidence in BTC’s long-term value as both a store of wealth and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.

On-chain data from Santiment shows the Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) metric spiking to its highest level since July, signaling that many investors are cashing out profits. Related Reading: Solana DATs Will Outpace Bitcoin, Says Multicoin Capital Co-Founder This wave of profit-taking, while not a sign of structural weakness, has capped ADA’s recovery attempts. Analysts emphasize that defending the $0.87–$0.85 support range will be crucial to maintaining ADA’s broader bullish outlook. ADA's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Technical Outlook: Will ADA Break or Hold? From a technical perspective, Cardano (ADA) is struggling beneath the 50-EMA at $0.8819, with rejection near $0.923 forming a bearish engulfing candle. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 44, suggesting sellers still have room to push lower. If ADA loses support at $0.8528, the next downside levels are $0.8264 and $0.8033. However, reclaiming $0.8843 would be the first sign of strength, opening targets at $0.9018 and $0.9234. Traders are split: aggressive bears may short below $0.8528, while conservative bulls wait for a breakout above $0.90 to confirm momentum. Adoption News Offers Bullish Counterweight Despite short-term weakness, ADA’s fundamentals remain strong. Openbank, Europe’s largest digital bank under Santander, recently integrated Cardano for 2 million customers. This development has boosted the institutional adoption narrative, potentially providing a longer-term bullish catalyst. Caution dominates in the near term. On-chain data shows a $6.7 million net outflow from exchanges on September 17, reflecting investor hesitation. Analysts warn that unless inflows pick up, ADA may continue trading sideways or drift lower before staging its next rally. Cardano Bulls Eye $1, But Risks Remain For now, $0.87–$0.85 remains ADA’s battleground. A decisive break above $0.90 could reignite bullish momentum and put ADA back on track toward the psychological $1 level. Conversely, a breakdown below $0.85 risks exposing deeper support zones at $0.82 and $0.78. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bottom In?

The decision will enable exchanges to proceed with the listing of proposed ETFs by sidestepping the often-lengthy 19(b) rule filing process that can take up to 240 days and requires the SEC to actively approve or disapprove an ETF. Essentially, the process will be more streamlined than before. ETF Issuers will approach exchanges (Nasdaq, NYSE, CBOE) with a product idea and desire to list their ETF. If the proposed strategy (token or combination of tokens) of the issuers meets the generic listing standard, then the exchange can proceed with listing the ETF. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said the decision was aimed at reducing barriers to accessing digital asset products in regulated U.S. marketplaces. ""By approving these generic listing standards, we are ensuring that our capital markets remain the best place in the world to engage in the cutting-edge innovation of digital assets,"" SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said in a statement. Alongside the rule change, the agency signed off on the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which tracks the assets in the CoinDesk 5 Index and currently consists of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).

Big move for altcoin ETFs The SEC's listing standards could potentially open the way for a wave of spot-based altcoin ETFs that have been waiting for regulators' nod to enter the market. ""This is the crypto ETP framework we've been waiting for,"" James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an X post . ""Get ready for a wave of spot crypto ETP launches in coming weeks and months."" Echoing this sentiment, Kristin Smith, the President of Solana Policy Institute, said, ""We are incredibly encouraged by tonight's news: the SEC continues to promote the rule of law by setting clear rules of the road for US businesses and to take positive steps to allow American investors to safely access digital assets."" ""These new generic listing standards are a net-positive for U.S. investors, markets, and digital asset innovation. Excited for the next wave of crypto adoption!,"" she added.

The South Korean media outlet Seoul Finance reported that the firm has registered trademarks for the KSDC, KRW24, KRW365, KOSWON, and KORWON brands. The outlet wrote that KOSCOM wants to “proactively respond” to the imminent launch of the KRW stablecoin market in South Korea. KOSCOM Stablecoin Plans ‘in Full Swing’ KOSCOM (officially the Korea Securities Computing Corporation) provides comprehensive tech solutions and trading platforms to the South Korea’s financial securities and futures markets. The headquarters of KOSCOM in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Koscom.co.kr) It was co-founded by the central government and the Korea Exchange, the nation’s stock exchange. The latter remains KOSCOM’s largest shareholder. KOSCOM has also provided trading platform solutions for securities exchanges in several Southeast Asian nations. It has worked with stock markets in Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia. Experts expect the government to roll out new crypto regulations in the coming months. They believe Seoul will bundle these regulations with new rules for won-denominated stablecoins. Observers think that companies will be able to commercialize their offerings “in the mid- to long-term,” the media outlet wrote. KOSCOM has also expanded and reorganized its Future Business Division. It has launched a “Digital Asset Business Promotion Task Force,” which now reports directly to the firm’s CEO. This unit has launched a proof-of-concept (PoC) for stablecoin technology. It is also looking at ways the firm could use KRW stablecoins “as a means of payment during subscription and distribution processes.” It wants to use these coins to help it “boost payment convenience and stability,” the outlet wrote. Kim Wan-seong, the head of task force, said: “Stablecoins are emerging globally. They have become a new means of payment.

While his prediction set a specific path, the key development shaping market sentiment today came from Washington, where the U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed its highly anticipated policy adjustment. The Federal Open Market Committee voted to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, setting the federal funds range at 4.00% to 4.25%. This marks the first cut since December 2024, a move obviously expected by market participants with a 99.1% probability ahead of the meeting . It will pump for 2 weeks and then correct which is good and repeat till the end of the year and end of cycle — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 17, 2025 How the Cut Supports Risk Assets Like XRP Lower interest rates typically provide relief to financial markets by reducing borrowing costs and encouraging capital to move toward riskier assets. For cryptocurrencies, including XRP, the impact could be meaningful. Investors often seek alternative assets when policy turns accommodative, and digital currencies benefit from renewed liquidity . EGRAG CRYPTO also noted that this latest cut is not expected to be the only one. Fed officials signaled two more rate reductions before the end of 2025. If the Committee follows through, the environment will remain favorable for assets like XRP that stand to benefit from both macroeconomic easing and structural adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Forecast For the Coming Cycle When asked how the market would react following the Fed’s decision, EGRAG CRYPTO described a clear sequence he expects to see unfold. According to him, the market will “pump for 2 weeks and then correct,” a process he believes will repeat through the end of the year and into the cycle’s conclusion. His outlook suggests a pattern of short-term surges followed by resets, creating opportunities for active traders while aligning with the broader trend of monetary easing. The timing of his projection is particularly notable, as it aligns with the Fed’s own path of gradual cuts. If risky assets do follow the rhythm outlined in his forecast, XRP could see periods of accelerated momentum after each policy move before consolidating at new levels . That dynamic could prove decisive as institutional adoption continues to expand. Experts have set targets as high as $20 for XRP based on the rate cuts , and subsequent cuts could help the digital asset reach much higher levels, potentially closing the year in triple-digit levels.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Robinhood got all kinds of attention earlier this year when it claimed to be able to offer its retail users exposure to OpenAI’s growth story via tokenized shares backed by a special purpose vehicle. Counsel for OpenAI, has warned that these tokens do not constitute equity and claimed that the whole thing is unauthorized, which could potentially mean it could be a risky investment for the token holders. This gets at a bigger question of investor access. The hottest AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, remain firmly private, their growth captured by venture capital funds and strategic backers like Microsoft or Google. The institutional investors get it all, and retail investors are locked out, forced to either buy into Big Tech equities like Nvidia, or hope that structured products like SPVs deliver something resembling exposure. Enter Bittensor. In February 2024, the decentralized AI network rolled out its Dynamic TAO (dTAO) upgrade, which is aiming to turn staking into something closer to venture capital, where everyone gets a chance to have access to yield. Instead of passively validating the root subnet, TAO holders now allocate directly to subnets , each with its own on-chain AI startup, and receive “alpha” tokens in return. These tokens reflect the performance and demand of the subnet, and staking decisions determine which projects earn a share of the network’s emissions. It’s a simple market-driven incubator where value is rewarded only if it is created. ""The subnets form an ecosystem within an ecosystem, where performance and utility are rewarded, stacking opportunities both through staking returns and alpha token appreciation,"" explained ‘Zerobit’, CEO of Talisman, a wallet that’s part of the dTAO ecosystem, during a recent panel on AI at Taiwan Blockchain Week. Two subnets illustrate why this matters. Bridges (SN62) is a coding agent that has already outperformed Anthropic’s Claude 4 on SWE-Bench, an industry-standard test of code generation. In just weeks, decentralized miners competing for emissions pushed Bridges’ accuracy above 80% , surpassing what a heavily funded centralized tech company delivered with hundreds of millions in capital. Crucially, it achieved this while spending just tens of thousands of dollars on compute, leveraging Bittensor’s ecosystem of shared subnets and proving the thesis of decentralized AI holds water. Another one of those is Chutes (SN64), the network’s serverless compute backbone. Think of it as a decentralized AWS for AI workloads: It processes billions of tokens daily, scales models in seconds, and undercuts centralized providers by up to 85% on cost . Chutes also hosts DeepSeek’s large language models on HuggingFace, making it the largest decentralized provider of open-source inference at scale. For retail investors, it could provide a compelling alternative. SPVs offer synthetic claims on private companies, riddled with potential legal and liquidity risk. Subnet staking, by contrast, is permissionless, performance-based, with results that can be verified on-chain. ""Where most crypto projects lock growth behind insider deals, Bittensor’s dTAO opens investment access from day one, letting them ride the growth in the value of the alpha token,” explained Brad Fuller of Bittensor.ai , a subnet staking data portal, during the same panel at Taiwan Blockchain Week. “It’s an on-ramp for anyone to join the ownership class and share in AI’s growth.” The winners attract stake, grow emissions, and compound into stronger projects. With Anthropic and OpenAI still locked away from public markets, Bittensor could be one of the few ways for everyday investors to ride AI’s upside without waiting for Wall Street’s blessing. While TAO may not have the similar pull like flashy Big Tech equities, subnet staking is becoming easier through new wallets, and with heavyweights like DCG’s Barry Silbert circling the ecosystem – who has already called it a protocol as important as bitcoin – this could provide a potential opportunity for those who might go down the rabbit hole of alternative investment options within the AI sector. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin barely budged after the Fed’s quarter-point cut, holding at $116,851 as traders weighed Powell’s risk management framing against a cautious dot plot. ETH: Ethereum saw stronger follow-through, climbing to $4,603.60 with a 6% weekly gain, reflecting renewed appetite for higher-beta names amid expectations of back-to-back cuts in October and December. Gold: Deutsche Bank has lifted its 2026 gold forecast to $4,000/oz., citing strong central bank demand, a weaker dollar, and political uncertainty around the Fed’s independence, after gold’s 41% year-to-date surge past $3,700. S&P 500: The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% to 6,600.35 after the Fed’s expected rate cut, as Powell signaled it was not the start of an extended easing cycle.

Via its local arm, BitGo Europe, it can offer custody, staking, transfer, and trading. Institutional clients will also have an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk and several liquidity venues available. The extension expands BitGo’s current Markets-in-Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license to include trading and its custody, transfer, and staking services counterparts. Europe’s cryptocurrency revenue is expected to surpass $26 billion in 2025, as Germany is the biggest adopter country in the industry. Market tailwinds have supportive regulatory structures such as MiCA, growing convergence between crypto-native firms and traditional financial institutions, and deals that could lead to consolidation. Institutional interest in crypto surges amid regulatory clarity Institutional interest in crypto has been increasing, driven by better infrastructure and the launch of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), which have lent legitimacy to the space. Clarity of regulation in places like Europe and the United Arab Emirates, and possible reform of the U.S. market structure, have helped drive adoption. Some high-profile developments in institutional crypto this week include the planned U.S. debut of Bullish, a crypto exchange geared toward institutions, which is moving forward after securing a BitLicense and a Money Transmission License from the New York State Department of Financial Services. Meanwhile, StanChart’s venture capital arm unveiled plans for a $250 million digital asset fund in 2026. Annabelle Huang, co-founder of Altius Labs, says that the coming wave of institutional crypto adoption is ongoing as fintech firms, like Robinhood and Stripe, develop their own blockchains. As recently reported by Cryptopolitan , BitGo said it had confidentially filed for a U.S. listing, joining a wave of firms looking to capitalize on strong market momentum. The crypto sector’s climb to a $4-trillion market value has reignited interest in initial public offerings, with clearer regulation, corporate treasury adoption, and institutional inflows fueling a new wave of new listings. IPO window opens as crypto firms eye U.S. listings Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs, said that these are the best market conditions the crypto space has seen in years, and firms want to take advantage of that. “These startups know that the IPO window can shut unexpectedly, especially in a volatile space like crypto, so they’re looking to strike while the iron’s hot.” Established over ten years ago, BitGo is one of the largest crypto custody firms in the United States. It stores and protects digital assets for clients, which has gained importance as institutional interest in crypto grows. In mid-2023, the company raised $100 million, reaching a valuation of $1.75 billion. The sector’s rapid growth has triggered a wave of IPO activity, with crypto exchange Bullish recently revealing its IPO filings. Meanwhile, crypto asset manager Grayscale and digital exchange Gemini, founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, have also submitted confidential plans to go public. “Many crypto companies have matured. After over a decade, they’ve built stable client bases, some with SaaS-like margins and predictable cash flows,” said Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX.

With ETH holding strong above key support levels, its growing institutional demand and dominance in DeFi and staking, many believe the foundation for a new all-time high is already in place. What Could Derail Ethereum’s Path To A New ATH? In an X post, crypto investor CryptoELITES pointed out that Ethereum is still on track for a new all-time high. The ETH chart is exhibiting a similar pattern to previous cycles, bouncing off a bottom trendline. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Pullback Complete? ETH Set Eyes On 77% Breakout Run If the pattern holds, it implies that Ethereum has re-entered its main growth channel, the very setup that led to explosive rallies in prior cycles. As a result, the expert is confident and predicts that ETH could be headed for a new 2025 all-time high at the top. Emperor, a respected market analyst, has provided a detailed technical update on ETH price action. His analysis focuses on the key levels of support and resistance that are currently dictating the market’s direction, particularly following a period of consolidation. Emperor noted that after reaching its recent ATH, Ethereum’s price entered a phase of consolidation, trading within a specific range. A key resistance level had been holding the price down, but ETH eventually broke above it. However, a recent price move brought ETH back to this same resistance level for a bearish underside retest, which is a common technical event. According to the analysts, the retest confirmed the rejection, where the price did not successfully bounce off the level and has now returned to it. The focus is now on a key support and resistance level that previously acted as resistance during the consolidation. Meanwhile, the market is now looking to see if this level, with confirmation from trading volume, can turn into support. The Trigger For Full Expansion Ethereum has already done the heavy lifting this cycle by breaking above its key range highs around $4,100 and holding that level as support. Daan Crypto Trades, a crypto trader and investor, has revealed that the only remaining level is the 2021 all-time high, which ETH has briefly swept. However, it has not yet been able to go into full price discovery mode. Related Reading: Citi’s Ethereum Forecast: No New All-Time High Expected, Year-End Target At $4,300 Daan emphasizes the importance of the bulls holding the $4,000 to $4,100 level on higher timeframes. He noted that the wicks below are fine, as these can be a normal part of retesting a support level. However, closing below that point would be a bearish sign that could invalidate the current upward momentum. If ETH can clear $5,000 and sustain it, that’s the point where further expansion would begin. Until then, price action remains in the choppy phase.

51900390,583345,1758153656,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Analyst Uses AI To Show How High The XRP Price Will Be If XRP ETFs Are Approved,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-if-etfs-are-approved/,"Crypto analyst Rob Cunningham has used AI to calculate how high the XRP price could be if the XRP ETFs eventually launch. Based on the forecast, the altcoin could rally to as high as $50 solely based on inflows into these funds. How High The XRP Price Could Rise If XRP ETFs Are Approved In an X post , Rob predicted that the XRP price could rally to $50 in the extreme stress case based on the inflows into the XRP ETFs. He also mentioned that a conservative target would be between $8 and $12 within 12 months, while an “aggressive but plausible” target would be between $20 and $30. He revealed that these targets were based on ChatGPT’s forecast of how high the XRP price could rise solely on $17 billion in new ETF purchase demand over the next 12 months. The analyst broke down the framework with which this calculation was made. First, he noted that the float available is 5 billion XRP while the inflow assumption is $17 billion over 12 months. Furthermore, the starting XRP price is $3, and the total float market value is $15 billion. Based on this, Rob remarked that the new demand from the ETFs will exceed the entire float’s value in one year. He further explained that if a buyer commits $17 billion (the XRP ETFs in this case) to buying XRP at $3, then they could purchase 5.7 billion coins. Meanwhile, the float is capped at 5 billion, with the shortage triggering a repricing. The analyst added that the price will continue to rise until the available float satisfies the $17 billion demand. This is what led to the conservative target of $8 to the extreme stress case of $50 for the XRP price. Rob stated that ETFs don’t just absorb liquidity but that they institutionalize demand . With $17 billion committed and such a thin float, the analyst believes that researchers should view a double-digit XRP price (between $10 and $30) as a realistic equilibrium target. Rob added that there is further upside risk if retail and crypto treasuries refuse to sell. Another Parabolic Rally When FOMO Sets In Rob also provided a second scenario, in which XRP records a larger demand as FOMO sets in. He believes this FOMO will come from mainstream banks, RIAs, institutions, and retain investors as the XRP ETFs push the XRP price higher. He noted that the capital base will be larger than the $17 billion that ETFs are projected to bring when the broader financial system joins in. These financial institutions hold and manage trillions of dollars in assets. As such, Rob predicts that even 0.5% of allocation from these firms into XRP will dwarf the XRP ETF inflows . He added that $700 billion could flow into the altcoin from these institutions, which is way above the float of 5 billion coins. In line with this, the analyst asserted that $8 to $30 is likely for the XRP price without FOMO, while broad FOMO could lead to a rally to as high as $150. Lastly, he remarked that a systemic allocation could lead to a rally to as high as $500.",XRP|Altcoin|ChatGPT|fomo|ripple|Rob Cunningham|Spot XRP ETF|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 00:00:56

The image outlined the career of a senior Ripple executive and his prior experience at one of the world’s most influential central banks. This pairing offers an important perspective on Ripple’s positioning within global finance. Ripple Bank of England Documented. pic.twitter.com/pDCiyjyyRs — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 16, 2025 The Profile of Matthew Osborne The image displays a biography of Matthew Osborne, who currently serves as Policy Director for Europe at Ripple. His career trajectory highlights a strong foundation in financial regulation and innovation. Before joining Ripple, Osborne spent significant time at the Bank of England . The document states that he “previously worked at the Bank of England, where he led the payments policy team working on innovations such as stablecoins and distributed ledger technology.” This demonstrates that he was directly involved in shaping policy around technologies that overlap with Ripple’s areas of focus. His experience did not stop at one team. The biography further explains that Osborne held “a number of senior policy roles at the Bank of England and was seconded to NatWest Bank’s global treasury.” This shows depth and range in his involvement with financial institutions, particularly in areas linked to payments, treasury, and policy design. Why This Matters for Ripple and XRP The relevance of Osborne’s background to Ripple’s mission is significant. Ripple positions itself as a provider of XRP-powered digital asset infrastructure to businesses, emphasizing efficient cross-border settlement solutions . A leader in Europe who has previously guided policy efforts at one of the most influential central banks provides Ripple with a high level of credibility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Bank of England has previously explored Ripple’s Interledger Protocol for payments , and Osborne’s work on stablecoins and distributed ledger technology at the Bank of England overlaps with the company’s use of blockchain to facilitate payments and expand financial inclusion. The alignment between Osborne’s past responsibilities and his current role signals expertise that can help bridge the gap between traditional financial institutions and emerging digital asset solutions, and increase XRP’s adoption among these institutions . Having someone who has led a payments policy team at a central bank means Ripple can more effectively engage with regulators and policymakers, ensuring that its offerings are designed within the framework of well-considered regulation. Ripple’s strategy relies on combining innovative technology with regulatory alignment. Matthew Osborne’s career serves as a clear example of how the company is reinforcing its foundation to expand adoption and trust.

The decision, which came on Wednesday, had been widely expected by analysts and marked the second consecutive time policymakers had kept rates unchanged. The move is consistent with the bank’s cautious approach to inflation as they pledged to maintain the rate, a key gauge of short-term health in the economy, at a very low level for an extended period. They held out the possibility of ratcheting it up again should they sense inflationary pressures picking up. The statement underscored the bank’s desire to re-anchor overnight expectations and eventually bring inflation back to its 3% target. The head of the Brazilian central bank, Gabriel Galípolo, emphasized vigilance, adding that monetary policy is the key and first line of defense against inflation, which nobody should expect him to ease quickly. Inflation shows mixed signals Recent data show inflation is beginning to cool, with consumer prices rising 5.13% in the 12 months through August, the second consecutive month of slower gains. Falling electricity and food costs helped ease household expenses, but services inflation remains stubbornly high. Economists warn that consecutive upticks in headline inflation could still unmoor long-term expectations. But inflation remains well above the target, and service prices are still increasing. Economists worry that such back-to-back gains could contribute to long-term inflation expectations. In its survey, Banco de México forecasts inflation will reach 4.83% in 2025 and slow to 4.30% by 2026. Both levels remain above the bank’s target rate of 3 percent, so it has been gun-shy thus far in cutting rates too aggressively. The Brazilian real, which has gained about 5% since the last meeting, also helps curb importing costs. However, worldwide conditions, from commodities to shifts in policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve, jeopardize those plans. Economic growth loses steam Brazil’s economy remains a numbed mess over five months into tightened credit . And with the benchmark interest rate, the Selic, sitting at 15%, borrowing costs for companies and consumers are punishingly high. The effects are beginning to show up in critical economic data. The Brazilian central bank’s closely monitored IBC-Br index, a proxy for gross domestic product, was down 0.5% in July from the previous month. The drop was more than analysts had expected, and it was the third straight month of slowing. But economists said that it is a sign of the way they believe the sharp rate increases during the past year have been squeezing demand and investment. Credit-sensitive sectors like construction, retail, and small business also incur higher borrowing costs. Banks have said they see less demand for new loans, and companies say they are putting off growth plans. Household buying power has stalled, crimping consumer sentiment. Recent indications, however, show Brazil’s labor market has shown surprising resilience despite the drag. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.6 percent in July, the lowest since that indicator began being tracked by the national statistics agency. Wages for workers in the formal economy have been rising at a solid pace, fueled by services and agriculture. Workers’ pay has also surged, adding lift to domestic consumption. This resilience makes the job of the central bank trickier. A robust jobs market, strengthening wages underpinning households’ spending power, and the sales revenues to retail sales data published on Tuesday helped ensure inflationary pressures are still alive despite a broad slackening in overall growth. But if inflation turns out to be sticky, the central bank could be forced to hold rates high even longer, yet crowding out more growth.

However, attention is not only drawn to ETH. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a recent entrant into decentralized finance (DeFi), is drawing attention for its lending and borrowing protocol that offers real-world utility within an increasingly crowded market. Mutuum Finance is worth $0.035 in stage 6 of its presale. The protocol has crossed $15.85 million in funding raised and welcomed more than 16,340 holders. While Ethereum is creating a buzz with price targets, Mutuum Finance is creating a buzz independently as a high-growth project with retail and institutional attention. Ethereum Sees $10,000 Target as Momentum Builds Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $4,531.58 at the moment, with intraday highs of approximately $4,674.50 and intraday lows of $4,510.54. Although the crypto market has experienced volatility, ETH has been resilient with better investor sentiment, especially with risk asset flows being boosted by macroeconomic signals and interest rate expectations. Analysts projecting longer-term prices, such as $10,000, point towards ETH’s dominance in DeFi, increasing adoption of layer-2s, as well as continued network scaling. These factors suggest ETH may have potential for substantial returns, but its massive market cap and competitive landscape can constrain super-fast upside. On the other hand, newcomers like Mutuum Finance are being eyed by some as having more return potential under the same conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Stage 6 Mutuum Finance has already reached phase six of its presale, priced at $0.035 following a 16.17% rise from the previous stage. The market is witnessing record-breaking demand for the project as it has already reached more than 16,340 investors and surpassed $15.85 million. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduced a Bug Bounty Program worth $50,000 USDT for platform security. The bugs have been divided into four levels according to the tag critical, major, minor, and low. Collateralization of Mutuum Finance is capped by asset and differs based on the risk type an asset would take. It encompasses supply capping, collateral and borrowing capping. The protocol hedges the market risk by overcollateralizing the positions. The liquidators are also incentivized for unwinding the undercollateralized trades and thus risky positions are closed in real time. Risk tokens have very little collateral usage but the most correlated tokens are used to their fullest extent so that they can maximize their collateral. They are all used towards insolvency risk reduction in a way that no type of imbalance is created between lending and borrowing in the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to create an active user base with a $100,000 giveaway . Ten individuals will be awarded $10,000 MUTM tokens, rewarding their involvement in the project. Security Framework and Back-up Plan Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an LTV build risk-of-assets based with subjective collateral. Reserve factor added as fall-back and very bad market condition buffer. Reserved back more risk assets in an attempt to offer more security to the protocol and users. Ethereum (ETH) may be targeting $10,000, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investors’ attention with potential for more growth. Stage 6 presale tokens are worth $0.035, with 16,340+ token buyers and over $15.85M raised. With a $50K CertiK bug bounty, solid risk-managed lending habits, and a $100K community giveaway, MUTM delivers security, scalability, and community development. ETH may be the largest altcoin, but MUTM grants early investors a chance to be on a platform that is built to deliver outsized returns. Lock in your Stage 6 tokens today before the next price surge.

51900392,583526,1758157220,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51900392.jpeg,Sui Network Gains Wall Street Attention: Could Google Deal Push SUI Into The Top 10?,https://bitcoinist.com/sui-network-gain-wall-street-attention-could-google/,"Sui Network (SUI) has become one of the first launch partners for Google’s Agentic Payments Protocol (AP2). This open-source standard enables AI-driven agents to perform secure, programmable payments without human intervention. Developed by Mysten Labs, Sui’s Move-based architecture and zkLogin privacy solution made it a natural fit for Google’s initiative . AP2 is already supported by over 60 industry giants, including PayPal, Salesforce, and American Express, signaling its potential to become a cornerstone of automated commerce. By integrating privacy-first identity and programmable transactions, AP2 could improve how AI interacts with payments, from subscriptions and paywalls to real-world purchases, while positioning Sui at the heart of this technological shift. ETF Filings Signal Wall Street’s Growing Interest Adding to the momentum, several ETF issuers have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that include Sui. Among them is Tuttle Capital’s proposed “SUI Income Blast ETF,” designed to give both institutional and retail investors exposure to the token. This move follows a broader wave of crypto ETF filings across assets like Avalanche (AVAX) and Bonk (BONK) , highlighting Wall Street’s increasing appetite for altcoins. Analysts note that infrastructure-focused projects such as Sui and Avax have stronger chances of approval compared to riskier memecoin-linked products. If greenlit, a SUI ETF could channel significant liquidity into the network, bracing demand at a time when adoption of AI-driven payments is expected to accelerate. Price Outlook: Can SUI Break Into the Top 10? SUI currently trades around $3.58, marking steady gains since the Google announcement. Technical analysts point to historically tight Bollinger Bands, a pattern that preceded Sui’s 250% rally in December 2023 and a 404% surge in September 2024. If history repeats, SUI could see a 150–200% breakout, targeting prices between $6 and $8. Market watchers are also considering wider factors, including potential Bitcoin volatility, token unlocks, and regulatory scrutiny over AI-payment integrations. Nevertheless, the rise of Google’s AP2 partnership, ETF filings, and bullish technical signals indicates that Sui could ascend the ranks of major cryptocurrencies. If momentum persists, analysts believe Sui has a real chance of entering the top 10 digital assets by market capitalisation before 2026, boosting its position in AI-driven finance.

The discussion, shared by AllInCrypto (@RealAllinCrypto), centered on Teucrium’s approach to cryptocurrency funds, specifically the company’s 2x long daily XRP ETF, which launched earlier this year . An XRP Enthusiast at the Helm During the interview, Gilbertie confirmed his personal support for the digital asset, stating directly, “I’m an XRP enthusiast.” He explained that Teucrium had previously filed for Bitcoin products and maintained crypto interests, but XRP presented a distinct opportunity. The strategy focused on not holding the token itself but using derivatives to give investors the exposure and leverage they sought. Gilbertie emphasized that the product resonated immediately with the market. He described the launch by noting it was “a big hit immediately right out the door,” highlighting the appetite for leveraged access to XRP among investors. He revealed that he filed for the XRP ETF product immediately when the opportunity was available, and Gilbertie previously revealed that it was the most successful ETF debut in its history .

Instead, he drew attention to the industry shift as a whole. He argued that selecting the next successful cryptocurrency would be difficult, saying “picking the next coin is harder” than many believe. Rather than focusing on speculative picks, he suggested investors should pay attention to how blockchain technology transforms business operations. Ripple has emphasized its pursuit of adoption and utility over short-term price movements, and this approach aligns with Gilbertie’s push for transformative blockchain technology. Gilbertie described the landscape as a “sea change coming,” pointing to the importance of identifying the companies that will successfully adopt and implement cryptocurrency-related technologies. He stressed that success in this sector depends on recognizing utility and innovation rather than chasing names alone.

Gilbertie responded affirmatively without hesitation when asked if there would be an expansion of ETFs tied to companies operating in the cryptocurrency sector. This outlook reflects confidence that financial products linked to cryptocurrency infrastructure will continue to expand. The crypto market is currently anticipating multiple spot XRP ETF decisions in October , and with Teucrium’s XRP ETF already setting company records, institutional investment in the crypto space could explode once the SEC approves these products next month.

While many investors anticipate a strong fourth quarter, Citigroup has issued a tempered outlook, projecting ETH to close the year at $4,300. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Eyes 1,250% Surge To $3.5 – Here’s The Roadmap According to a Reuters report, Citi attributes Ethereum’s demand to the growing adoption of tokenization and stablecoins. However, the bank cautions that much of ETH’s recent price action may be fueled by market sentiment rather than fundamentals. The note highlighted, “Current prices are above activity estimates, potentially driven by buying pressure and excitement over use-cases.” ETH's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview ETF Flows and Diverging Analyst Predictions One of the main concerns weighing on Ethereum’s outlook is ETF activity. Citi expects ETH exchange-traded funds to attract weaker inflows compared to Bitcoin, a factor that could dampen bullish momentum. This comes after recent volatility in spot ETH funds, where inflows briefly returned following weeks of heavy outflows. Interestingly, not all institutions share Citi’s cautious stance. Standard Chartered raised its year-end Ethereum target to $7,500, citing the asset’s stronger position in digital treasuries and staking yields. BlackRock’s $363 million Ethereum purchase has further reinforced confidence in ETH’s long-term value. Ethereum (ETH)’s Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Ahead Citi laid out a range of possible outcomes for Ethereum. In a bullish case, ETH could climb to $6,400, driven by expanding institutional adoption and rising activity across decentralized applications. On the other hand, a bearish scenario projects a sharp drop to $2,200 if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or equity markets face a downturn. Meanwhile, digital asset bank Sygnum has painted a more optimistic picture, pointing to Ethereum upgrades, shrinking exchange reserves, and growing institutional interest as catalysts for a potential supply squeeze. If demand continues to rise under these conditions, ETH could retest its all-time highs faster than expected. Related Reading: Citi’s Ethereum Forecast: No New All-Time High Expected, Year-End Target At $4,300 Ethereum is trading near $4,500, about 8% below its record peak. With institutional demand picking up but ETF flows posing uncertainty, the coming months will be crucial in determining whether ETH leans closer to Citi’s conservative $4,300 call or accelerates toward the bullish $6,400 target.

This significant change paves the way for listing digital assets without individual approvals. The SEC’s decision, which is documented in its filing simplifying the process under Rule 6c-11, particularly relates to stock exchanges like NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX, and Nasdaq. Notably, this has greatly reduced the approval timeframe, which lasted several months. The SEC gives green light to the commodity-based trust’s new generic listing standards In a statement , Paul Atkins, t he US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman, mentioned that their principal aim in approving these general listing standards was to position their capital markets as the most preferred globally for the groundbreaking advancement of digital assets. The chairman further highlighted that this approval facilitates the listing process and reduces obstacles hindering the accessibility of digital asset products in America’s stable capital markets, encouraging innovation and improving investor options. This update was released at a time when applications for Solana , XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin spot ETFs are waiting for the SEC’s approval. Concerning this, the commission faces deadlines starting in October to decide on the situation, along with a few others. In the meantime, for one to be eligible for listing, a crypto spot ETF needs to have a commodity that either trades on a market related to the Intermarket Surveillance Group and has surveillance access, or is connected to a futures contract with an official market listing at a minimum of six months and a deal for sharing surveillance. Another option to qualify for listing is if another ETF already tracks the proposed ETF with no less than 40% exposure. Additionally, the securities regulator stated that it should be listed on a national securities exchange. It is worth noting that when an exchange intends to list and trade ETPs that do not follow the standards set for approved generic listing, it is required to file a rule submission with the SEC. Crypto Analysts such as ETF analyst James Seyffart have viewed this change as a game-changer in the crypto ecosystem. Seyffart stated that this is the kind of crypto ETP framework he has long awaited. Following this, he anticipated that any surge of crypto investment products would be introduced in the US soon. Despite being viewed as a game-changer, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has raised concerns about the new listing standards. Based on her argument, they might raise consumer safety issues by flooding the market with products not been carefully inspected for investor safety. The SEC approves REX-Osprey’s new altcoin exchange-traded funds Reports dated September 16 had highlighted that two new altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to XRP and Dogecoin were set to launch in the US this week. This action revealed that the SEC has recently become more accepting of crypto investment options. This announcement came after REX-Osprey, a fund issuer, informed the public that the REX-Osprey XRP ETF will be launched during the week. Trading under the ticker XRPR, these new US ETFs will be the first in history to grant investors direct accessibility to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The tremendous success followed REX and Osprey’s successful completion of the SEC’s 75-day review period, and they were expected to begin trading on Friday, September 19, if no delays arise. Interestingly, the product will be launched in a simple approval process, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, compared to the previous approval process, the Securities Act of 1933, used for spot Bitcoin ETFs. In contrast to products that directly own the actual asset, the 1940 Act approval process enables the fund to start on its own immediately, 75 days after filing. However, if the commission raises any concerns, this will not occur. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

On Wednesday, the companies announced a deal they described as opening a new chapter in digital commerce driven by artificial intelligence. The collaboration will integrate PayPal checkouts into multiple Google services, such as Google Cloud, Google Ads, and Google Play. PayPal will also handle card processing for Google’s enterprise offerings, so merchants and users can access new forms of payments across Google’s ecosystem. AI agents transform online shopping At the core of the PayPal–Google debate is an audacious new vision for shopping that enables bots to buy stuff on people’s behalf. This vision is supported by Google’s Agent Payments Protocol , or AP2, a framework system that defines the rules and protections of autonomous transactions. AP2 is designed to support AI agents in making decisions on behalf of consumers, while preventing them from falling victim to fraud and loss of control. It depends on “mandates”, digital authorizations that lay out what an AI assistant has the power to do. A mandate could limit weekly spending, authorize only certain purchases like groceries or travel, or require extra verification for high-value items. This way, even though agents act independently, users still retain full control over their money. With AP2 in place, AI agents would go far beyond today’s shopping assistants. Instead of simply scanning shelves, comparing prices, and predicting needs, they could take proactive action. For example, an agent might reorder household essentials before supplies run out, pick a shirt in the right size and style, or schedule a service appointment before the customer even realizes it’s needed. In more complex scenarios, agents could even manage subscriptions, handle investments, or direct funds into digital assets. PayPal’s role is to give AI agents a trusted platform, combining its global payments network and customer insights to strengthen security and personalize recommendations. Chriss said the integration added immediate weight to AP2 through PayPal’s large customer base and established reputation, a signal to merchants and shoppers that the system could be trusted. It also contributes to recognizing a new genre of commerce that we call “agentic commerce” at present. In models like this, humans act as a reference and handle boundary issues — they are expected to be the ones to specify their preferences. Meanwhile, AI bothers to take care of the pain in our neck, esp. browsing, comparing, and purchasing. Supporters say this could save time and eliminate friction, causing the shopping experience to become easier and less painful. But critics caution that it leaves unanswered questions about privacy, overreliance on automation in handling people’s money, and whether consumers might lose touch with how their money is spent. Partnership expands payment options For Google, the partnership is about faster and more reliable payment processing. For PayPal, it’s a way to entrench itself in the world’s largest online marketplaces. PayPal itself is also broadening its embrace of cryptocurrencies. The company envisions a future where AI-driven agents shop for and make payments on users’ behalf, using both fiat and digital currencies . PayPal chief executive Alex Chriss said the partnership was about building the future of commerce, adding that it would be both agentic and crypto-enabled. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the partnership brought together trust and innovation, noting that PayPal would use Google’s AI to deliver personalized, seamless customer experiences while relying on Google Cloud to drive innovation and business growth. AI startup Perplexity, only a few months ago, announced that PayPal would be its choice to fuel agentic commerce on its platform. These initiatives show that PayPal is trying to take a lead position in this new, AI-influenced shopping world. Analysts say the partnership could speed a broader shift in global e-commerce. Instead of shopping by browsing for, clicking on, and purchasing items themselves, consumers will soon be able to delegate the entire purchase journey to AI assistants.

The session was one of the starkest attempts yet to get lawmakers and the crypto industry in the same room to hammer out explicit, bipartisan rules for digital assets in the United States. Hoskinson congratulated Ripple’s representatives, XRP supporters, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) for their contributions in policy negotiations. He noted that Cardano was in full force at the conference and stressed that these conversations were productive and cooperative. Hoskinson said the meeting was fruitful, adding that the conversation went further than previous years, when crypto companies often felt sidelined from regulatory discussions. The founder said that the roundtable was a sign that lawmakers were starting to hear what the industry had to say. Business leaders push for regulatory clarity Hoskinson lauded Ripple and venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) for their active negotiation participation. The CLARITY Act is billed to clarify how digital assets are categorized, while providing transparent market structures and outlining duties for exchanges and issuers. For many, it is the best opportunity in years for the U.S. to move beyond piecemeal policies and toward a more far-reaching law. Recently, lawmakers even linked the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) bill to the CLARITY Act, which clearly indicated how legislators aimed to group together reform initiatives. To crypto enthusiasts worried about overregulating their investments, this move signals increasing political appetite for striking a balance between innovation and investor protection. Ripple’s presence was significant, considering that the company has had a protracted legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of XRP. The company has said that after years of courtroom battles, it is working to help develop clearer rules. A16Z’s move reflects its large financial interest in blockchain, Web3, and beyond, as regulatory choices could directly affect many of its initiatives. Cardano engages directly with regulators That Hoskinson was invited to the Washington round table is a sign that Cardano is serious about getting involved in shaping the future of crypto regulation in the United States. For a long time, digital asset projects have been sidelined in political discourse. Still, Hoskinson’s active participation indicates an initiative to engage policy­makers at the forefront rather than from behind. His update was also intended for Cardano’s supporters around the world. By verifying his participation in the discussions, Hoskinson gave ADA holders confidence that their ecosystem isn’t just building a blockchain; it’s also shaping policy that will impact the entire market. This two-pronged strategy, technology coupled with political work, makes Cardano a builder and a policy shaper. The roundtable also revealed the considerable support coalesced around the CLARITY Act. Eleanor Terrett, a former reporter for FOX Business who has closely tracked the discussions, confirmed that the room featured reps from some of the biggest names in crypto: Coinbase, Kraken, Circle, Paradigm, and Multicoin Capital. Their involvement illustrated high implications for exchanges, stablecoin issuers, venture capital funds, and blockchain projects. The meeting continued for over an hour and focused on the nuts and bolts of the market structure draft. They ranged from how tokens should be categorized, how exchanges would have to address compliance, and what kind of disclosures issuers would need to make. With so many perspectives at the table, lawmakers could listen to how regulatory language might affect real-world operations, from liquidity provision to user safety. Observers noted that this direct exchange between lawmakers and industry leaders was especially valuable. The crypto sector has long complained that U.S. regulators impose rules without understanding their impact on innovation. By inviting firms like Cardano into the conversation, policymakers gained insight into what works on the ground and what risks might emerge from poorly framed rules.

Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Target $8,500 With Big Money Backing The Move – Details Market moves and reports about talks with US law enforcement have fed the chatter, but legal limits remain a central part of the story. Profile Change Sparks Speculation Based on reports, CZ updated his X profile from “ex-@binance” back to “@binance,” a small public tweak that many traders and observers took as a hint he might reengage with the company he founded. The market reacted quickly. BNB, Binance’s native token, climbed and in some feeds was shown near $962.29 on September 17, 2025, as traders pushed prices higher amid the rumors. Binance In Talks With US Justice Department Reports say Binance is in discussions with the US Justice Department about whether to end the three-year compliance monitor that formed part of its 2023 settlement. If those talks succeed, the monitor could be removed earlier than planned. That 2023 deal included a roughly $4.3 billion settlement and conditions meant to strengthen Binance’s controls. Ending oversight sooner would not automatically mean CZ can resume a top executive job, but it would remove one major obstacle cited by industry watchers. Legal Limits Still In Place According to earlier reporting, CZ’s legal agreements tied to the settlement include limits on his ability to run or manage the exchange for a given period. Those restrictions are a hard constraint until they are changed by a court or by an enforcement agency. Because of that, a full operational comeback as chief executive looks unlikely unless formal legal steps are taken to alter the terms. That point has been made repeatedly by legal analysts in the crypto press. Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Rally Yet? Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025 Public Moves And Treasury Plans Based on reports, CZ has been talking publicly about building the BNB ecosystem and has floated plans tied to a BNB Treasury effort. Those moves are fueling the sense he is preparing to take on a bigger public role, even if it is not the same as running day-to-day operations. Some market watchers say the profile change could be symbolic — meant to reassure traders and investors — rather than the start of a formal return.

VivoPower Doubles Down On XRP The company’s digital-asset arm, Caret Digital, has secured bulk-purchase discounts for additional mining rigs and plans to expand operations, a move it says further improves its unit economics and lowers the effective cost basis of the tokens obtained via token swaps. “Mined tokens will be exchanged into XRP, delivering an effective 65% discount, based on current market prices,” the release states. The mechanics, as described by VivoPower, hinge on a dual-pronged treasury program: first, produce mined tokens through an expanded fleet acquired at negotiated bulk discounts; second, convert those mined tokens into XRP rather than buying it directly in the open market. In parallel, the company says it will continue to seek exposure to Ripple Labs’ equity as part of its strategy to secure XRP-linked assets “at the lowest average cost possible.” VivoPower did not publish a detailed formula for the “effective 65%” figure, but tied the claim to current prices and the economics of mining and procurement. The discount-driven swap strategy is part of a broader corporate transformation in which VivoPower describes itself as “the world’s first XRP-focused digital asset enterprise,” with a mandate to acquire, manage, and hold the token over the long term while supporting ecosystem-based infrastructure and real-world applications. The group operates two business units: Tembo, which develops electric utility vehicles and associated energy solutions, and Caret Digital, which is tasked with power-to-X initiatives including mining. Not Just Purchases VivoPower has layered other initiatives onto this treasury pivot . On September 2, the company announced a definitive agreement with Doppler Finance—a native yield platform backed by ReForge, DCG and other Ripple-affiliated entities—to deploy an initial $30 million of XRP in staged tranches. The program is positioned as a “regenerative loop,” with yields reinvested back into reserves to compound the treasury over time. “By harnessing Doppler Finance’s programmable infrastructure, we can put reserves to work while retaining XRP as our cornerstone treasury asset,” Executive Chairman and CEO Kevin Chin said in the statement. A week later, on September 8, VivoPower’s Tembo subsidiary said it would accept Ripple USD (RLUSD) for customer and partner payments—citing near-instant settlement and lower costs versus traditional cross-border bank transfers. The company framed RLUSD acceptance as both operationally pragmatic for its global footprint and strategically aligned with its treasury plan, noting RLUSD’s issuance on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Taken together, the mining-to-swap channel, the Doppler yield deployment, and RLUSD integration sketch a cohesive playbook: reduce the acquisition cost via mining and procurement discounts, generate yield on held tokens within an institutional framework, and deepen real-economy ties to the ecosystem through stablecoin-based payments. While the “up to 65%” effective discount claim is explicitly forward-looking and contingent on market conditions, VivoPower intends to load up on XRP—by producing and swapping rather than simply buying.

Squire was clear in his assessment of what such a development would mean, describing the potential effect as a “liquidity tsunami” that could put XRP in a position of strength. In the video, Marszalek outlined his perspective on the state of digital assets and the role of exchange-traded funds. He noted that certain altcoins with strong flows are likely to outperform in the coming years. Turning to XRP specifically, he referenced forecasts suggesting that a dedicated ETF could attract $8 billion of inflows next year. JUST IN: https://t.co/Tx1rvs5Mqa CEO Kris Marszalek predicts an XRP ETF could attract $8B inflows in its first year Liquidity tsunami incoming, $XRP is about to shine! pic.twitter.com/HNR7eizsHb — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 16, 2025 Significance of Forecasted Inflows The forecast of $8 billion in potential inflows is significant when measured against previous benchmarks in the industry. Large inflows of this kind would mark a substantial expansion of institutional access to XRP and potentially provide liquidity depth that could influence trading dynamics. Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg has also predicted that spot XRP ETFs could see inflows of $5 billion in the first month , suggesting even greater capital will come into the XRP market and a more positive impact on the digital asset’s price. These inflows would also represent a massive institutional interest in regulated XRP-related products and present a key point for market participants to watch as upcoming regulatory decisions unfold. ETF Decisions on the Horizon Attention now shifts to the coming months, with several spot XRP ETF applications scheduled for SEC decisions in October . Filings from companies including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital are expected to be addressed during the latter half of the month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Polymarket has set the odds of ETF approval at 94% and the community sees these decisions as pivotal for XRP’s next stage of market development, potentially opening the door for institutional participation at scale. The timing of these decisions gives weight to Marszalek’s forecast. The market remains attentive to how the SEC will respond to the applications and whether the projected inflows can materialize if approvals are granted. Experts have predicted double-digit targets for XRP after these investment products are approved, and market participants are eager to engage with them. For now, the conversation highlights both the anticipation around XRP’s regulatory moment and the role industry leaders see for the asset in shaping the next phase of crypto investment.

The decision, approved by 11 of 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reflects signs of slowing job growth, higher unemployment, and persistent inflation. This is the Fed’s fourth cut since late 2024, with two more expected before the end of 2025. President Donald Trump has repeatedly pressured the central bank for more aggressive action, even suggesting removing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Earlier this week, Trump said the Fed should cut “bigger than Powell had in mind.” Lower rates generally make traditional investments less attractive, pushing investors toward alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies . Analysts believe the extra liquidity could boost trading in Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and other tokens. However, market reactions may depend on how dovish or cautious the Fed’s outlook appears in its dot plot. Meanwhile, the Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, a crypto-friendly economist, to the Federal Reserve Board. He had pushed for a larger 50bps cut. The Fed also plans a conference next month to discuss stablecoin models and tokenization in finance.

The service lets users buy, sell and hold crypto inside their bank account, with trading available for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Polygon and Cardano. Based on reports , the bank plans to make the offering available in Spain within weeks and to roll it out to other EU countries later this year. Santander Expands Crypto Access The new feature is built into Openbank’s investment platform so customers do not need to move money to an outside exchange. According to the bank, users can trade coins from the same app where they manage other accounts. Openbank, Banco Santander’s online bank, has started offering retail crypto trading, the latest move by a major European lender into the asset class https://t.co/IcozNgW1at — Bloomberg (@business) September 16, 2025 The initial list includes five major tokens, chosen for liquidity and demand, while a broader menu of assets is expected in future updates. Trading Costs And Custody Rules Reports have disclosed the buy and sell fee is 1.49% per transaction, with a minimum charge of €one per operation. There are no custody fees for holding assets on the platform, the bank says. For casual investors who plan to buy and hold, that no-holding-fee model may be attractive. Heavy traders, though, may find the 1.49% cost higher than some dedicated crypto exchanges. Rollout Timeline And Limits Openbank’s launch began in Germany. Based on reports, Spain will follow in the coming weeks, and broader EU availability is planned later in the year. The bank has indicated that it will add additional cryptocurrencies in the future and potentially offer crypto-to-crypto conversion at some point. Currently, the service is all about fiat-to-crypto direct trades and a limited selection of well-known coins. Regulatory And Compliance Notes The product is covered under the European Markets in Crypto-Assets regime, or MiCA, which provides rules for crypto services within the EU. The bank will implement KYC and AML processes applicable to regulated financial institutions, reports add. That means customers can expect identity checks and standard anti-money-laundering controls when they sign up to trade. Why It Matters For Customers This move brings crypto trading into the mainstream banking app for retail users. Reports have disclosed that traditional banks adding crypto features can make it easier for everyday savers to try these assets without opening accounts on unfamiliar platforms. At the same time, the limited initial token list and the fee level mean serious crypto users might still prefer specialist exchanges for low fees or access to many smaller tokens.

Hype: Analyst Examines XRP Supply Shock Theory,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/facts-vs-hype-xrp-supply-shock-theory/,"Prominent analyst Cheeky Crypto (203,000 followers on YouTube) set out to verify a fast-spreading claim that XRP’s circulating supply could “vanish overnight,” and his conclusion is more nuanced than the headline suggests: nothing in the ledger disappears, but the amount of XRP that is truly liquid could be far smaller than most dashboards imply—small enough, in his view, to set the stage for an abrupt liquidity squeeze if demand spikes. XRP Supply Shock? The video opens with the host acknowledging his own skepticism—“I woke up to a rumor that XRP supply could vanish overnight. Sounds crazy, right?”—before committing to test the thesis rather than dismiss it. He frames the exercise as an attempt to reconcile a long-standing critique (“XRP’s supply is too large for high prices”) with a rival view taking hold among prominent community voices: that much of the supply counted as “circulating” is effectively unavailable to trade. His first step is a straightforward data check. Pulling public figures, he finds CoinMarketCap showing roughly 59.6 billion XRP as circulating, while XRPScan reports about 64.7 billion. The divergence prompts what becomes the video’s key methodological point: different sources count “circulating” differently. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Major XRP Warning: Last Chance To Get In As Accumulation Balloons As he explains it, the higher on-ledger number likely includes balances that aggregators exclude or treat as restricted, most notably Ripple’s programmatic escrow. He highlights that Ripple still “holds a chunk of XRP in escrow, about 35.3 billion XRP locked up across multiple wallets, with a nominal schedule of up to 1 billion released per month and unused portions commonly re-escrowed. Those coins exist and are accounted for on-ledger, but “they aren’t actually sitting on exchanges” and are not immediately available to buyers. In his words, “for all intents and purposes, that escrow stash is effectively off of the market.” From there, the analysis moves from headline “circulating supply” to the subtler concept of effective float. Beyond escrow, he argues that large strategic holders—banks, fintechs, or other whales—may sit on material balances without supplying order books. When you strip out escrow and these non-selling stashes, he says, “the effective circulating supply… is actually way smaller than the 59 or even 64 billion figure.” He cites community estimates in the “20 or 30 billion” range for what might be truly liquid at any given moment, while emphasizing that nobody has a precise number. That effective-float framing underpins the crux of his thesis: a potential supply shock if demand accelerates faster than fresh sell-side supply appears. “Price is a dance between supply and demand,” he says; if institutional or sovereign-scale users suddenly need XRP and “the market finds that there isn’t enough XRP readily available,” order books could thin out and prices could “shoot on up, sometimes violently.” His phrase “circulating supply could collapse overnight” is presented not as a claim that tokens are destroyed or removed from the ledger, but as a market-structure scenario in which available inventory to sell dries up quickly because holders won’t part with it. How Could The XRP Supply Shock Happen? On the demand side, he anchors the hypothetical to tokenization. He points to the “very early stages of something huge in finance”—on-chain tokenization of debt, stablecoins, CBDCs and even gold—and argues the XRP Ledger aims to be “the settlement layer” for those assets.He references Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s earlier comments about an XRPL pivot toward tokenized assets and notes that an institutional research shop (Bitwise) has framed XRP as a way to play the tokenization theme. In his construction, if “trillions of dollars in value” begin settling across XRPL rails, working inventories of XRP for bridging, liquidity and settlement could rise sharply, tightening effective float. Related Reading: XRP Bearish Signal: Whales Offload $486 Million In Asset To illustrate, he offers two analogies. First, the “concert tickets” model: you think there are 100,000 tickets (100B supply), but 50,000 are held by the promoter (escrow) and 30,000 by corporate buyers (whales), leaving only 20,000 for the public; if a million people want in, prices explode. Second, a comparison to Bitcoin’s halving: while XRP has no programmatic halving, he proposes that a sudden adoption wave could function like a de facto halving of available supply—“XRP’s version of a halving could actually be the adoption event.” He also updates the narrative context that long dogged XRP. Once derided for “too much supply,” he argues the script has “totally flipped.” He cites the current cycle’s optics—“XRP is sitting above $3 with a market cap north of around $180 billion”—as evidence that raw supply counts did not cap price as tightly as critics claimed, and as a backdrop for why a scarcity narrative is gaining traction. Still, he declines to publish targets or timelines, repeatedly stressing uncertainty and risk. “I’m not a financial adviser… cryptocurrencies are highly volatile,” he reminds viewers, adding that tokenization could take off “on some other platform,” unfold more slowly than enthusiasts expect, or fail to get to “sudden shock” scale. The verdict he offers is deliberately bound. The theory that “XRP supply could vanish overnight” is imprecise on its face; the ledger will not erase coins. But after examining dashboard methodologies, escrow mechanics and the behavior of large holders, he concludes that the effective float could be meaningfully smaller than headline supply figures, and that a fast-developing tokenization use case could, under the right conditions, stress that float. “Overnight is a dramatic way to put it,” he concedes. “The change could actually be very sudden when it comes.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.0198.

ETH is now showing positive signs and might attempt to clear the $4,680 resistance. Ethereum is now recovering higher above the $4,550 zone. The price is trading above $4,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $4,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it settles above $4,640 and $4,700. Ethereum Price Eyes Steady Increase Ethereum price extended losses below $4,550 before the bulls appeared, like Bitcoin . ETH price tested the $4,415 zone and recently started a recovery wave. The price climbed above the $4,500 and $4,520 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,765 swing high to the $4,416 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $4,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,635 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,765 swing high to the $4,416 low. The next key resistance is near the $4,680 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,720 level. A clear move above the $4,720 resistance might send the price toward the $4,750 resistance. An upside break above the $4,750 hurdle might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,850 resistance zone or even $4,880 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,680 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,580 level. The first major support sits near the $4,535 zone. A clear move below the $4,535 support might push the price toward the $4,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,420 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,350.

OFAC Sanctions Iranian Nationals According to the Tuesday press release , Iranian nationals Alireza Derakhshan and Arash Estaki Alivand “used a network of front companies in multiple foreign jurisdictions” to transfer the digital assets. OFAC alleges that Alivand and Derakhshan’s transfers also involved the sale of Iranian oil that benefited Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) and the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL). IRGC-QF and MODAFL then used the proceeds to support regional proxy terrorist organizations and strengthen their advanced weapons systems, including ballistic missiles. U.S. officials say the move targets shadow banking in the region, where illicit financial actors use overseas money laundering and digital assets to evade sanctions. “Iranian entities rely on shadow banking networks to evade sanctions and move millions through the international financial system,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we will continue to disrupt these key financial streams that fund Iran’s weapons programs and malign activities in the Middle East and beyond,” he continued. Dozens Designated In Shadow Banking Scandal Both Alivand and Derakhshan have been designated “for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of the IRGC-QF.” In addition to Alivand and Derakhshan, OFAC has sanctioned more than a dozen Hong Kong and United Arab Emirates-based entities and individuals tied to the network. According to the press release, the sanctioned entities may face civil or criminal penalties imposed as a result.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $853.93. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,280.9 to $1,387.64. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $309 Market cap $4.70B Trading volume (24-h) $453.41M Circulating supply 15.22M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $309.31 24-hour high $292.05 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.94% 50-day SMA $302.65 14-Day RSI 49.13 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 52 (Neutral) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $249.73 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE rebounded from $291 to $308 but stalled under $310 resistance. The daily trend remains weak, but the short-term momentum is improving. A break above $312 could fuel a push to $325. Aave 1-day price chart As of September 18, AAVE is trading around $308, clawing back after dipping to the lower Bollinger Band near $291. The bounce has brought AAVE back toward the mid-band resistance at $307.9, which is also lining up as a key price level. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The next ceiling is at the upper band around $324.7, but buyers have yet to show the conviction needed to challenge it. The MACD remains in bearish territory, an indication that the broader trend still leans downward, even as the immediate selling pressure fades. AAVE’s daily volume is steady at $38M, though not strong enough to confirm a full reversal just yet. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, AAVE has recovered from $292 to $309, cutting through short-term moving averages near $300. Momentum has improved, with the RSI climbing to 59, though it sits close to overbought territory and may cool if buying stalls. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Immediate resistance is stacked at $310–$312, while support has shifted up to $300. A failure to break higher would invite another pullback toward $295, but a clean move above $312 could open a path to $325. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $306.58 BUY SMA 5 $305.58 BUY SMA 10 $313.88 SELL SMA 21 $308.93 BUY SMA 50 $302.65 BUY SMA 100 $292.83 BUY SMA 200 $249.73 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $308.91 BUY EMA 5 $311.90 SELL EMA 10 $314.98 SELL EMA 21 $312.27 SELL EMA 50 $301.38 BUY EMA 100 $283.51 BUY EMA 200 $258.89 BUY AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is showing signs of recovery, but the rally is fragile. Bulls need to clear $310 convincingly to push further. If they succeed, price could build toward $325, but another rejection would leave the token stuck in its broader range and vulnerable to another dip. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. It’s AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken, and KuCoin also support AAVE. Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave has proven itself to be one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in DeFi over the years.

Here’s What Is Next,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-explains-xrp-cross-and-push-strategy-heres-what-is-next/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has shared an XRP-based thread titled “Cross and Push,” in which he explained step by step how he constructed his technical analysis and anticipated XRP’s recent moves. His approach centers on the concept of a “cross and push,” which refers to the bullish cross between moving averages followed by sustained upward momentum. According to Egrag, this cross was achieved between the 21 SMA and 100 SMA in early August, creating the conditions for a potential breakout scenario. He noted that the analysis began with identifying the descending channel on the four-hour timeframe and projecting how price action would behave along its upper edge. The idea of the “cross and push” was based on the expectation that once the moving averages aligned, XRP could retest and eventually break through the top boundary of this channel. #XRP Cross & Push ( What's Next): Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how I built my analysis and anticipated the upcoming move under the post Titled "" Cross & Push) Go through the thread and take a look! and get into the details and explore what’s likely to happen… pic.twitter.com/wTuisEjziF — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 16, 2025 Ascending Triangle and Measured Move Egrag outlined the presence of an ascending triangle structure and explained how it ties into his broader framework. He described this as part of the measured move that often follows such a formation, stressing that he had anticipated the setup before it was clearly visible. The retest of the breakout is occurring as expected, though he explained that due to the slope of the descending channel, the level of the retest is lower than the initial breakout. He underlined that this is normal technical behavior and does not invalidate the broader bullish thesis. In the process of building this outlook, Egrag emphasized how the 100 EMA and the upper edge of the channel were acting as important guides. These elements confirmed that the “cross and push” had indeed taken place and could serve as the foundation for the next phase of price action. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Critical Price Levels Ahead Egrag stated that he originally looked at $3.02 as a key level to hold, but it did not maintain support. He explained that the immediate objective is to secure a close above $3.02 as the first sign of renewed strength. From there, $3.07 becomes the next level to watch, with $3.13 identified as an important confirmation target. A move through these levels would strengthen the bullish case and validate the breakout from the channel. At the same time, Egrag acknowledged the possibility of a bearish cross if these conditions are not met. Under that scenario, XRP could retrace toward $2.65, a downside level he highlighted. He also noted that while some market participants are looking ahead to potential rate cuts, markets often respond in unexpected ways, which could influence XRP’s short-term direction. The central point of Egrag’s post is that the “cross and push” strategy has been successfully identified and that XRP is now at a decisive stage. Sustaining closes above $3.07 and $3.13 would confirm strength, while failure to achieve these levels could result in continued movement along the descending channel. His structured breakdown highlights both the progress already made and the conditions required for XRP to move higher .

Key Principles For UK Crypto Trading Platforms The FCA has recently published a consultation outlining minimum standards that could potentially waive four crucial principles for crypto asset trading platforms. These principles mandate that firms operate with integrity, exercise skill and diligence, prioritize customer interests, and ensure that the advice and discretionary decisions provided to customers are appropriate. David Geale, the FCA’s Executive Director of Payments and Digital Finance, emphasized the regulator’s intention to cultivate a sustainable and competitive crypto sector. He stated, “We want to balance innovation, market integrity, and trust.” While acknowledging that these proposals will not eliminate the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, Geale noted they would help firms establish common standards, offering consumers clearer expectations. In light of recent events, such as the $1.5 billion hack of Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit in February, the FCA is also advocating for stricter operational risk management protocols. Talks To Shape Future Regulatory Framework The FCA is also seeking feedback on whether the consumer duty—which mandates that firms prioritize their customers—should apply to digital asset firms. Additionally, discussions are underway regarding customer access to the Financial Ombudsman Service for potential compensation. Charles Kerrigan, a partner and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist at law firm CMS, suggested that it is likely the consumer duty will apply once crypto assets are integrated into the broader regulatory framework. Interestingly, digital asset adoption among the British public is on the rise, with recent government statistics indicating that approximately 12% of adults own or have owned currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), a significant increase from just 4% in 2021. The FCA’s proposals come after the UK signaled its intention to collaborate with the US on crypto. Recent discussions between UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have reportedly set the stage for a significant agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in the cryptocurrency sector. The meeting included representatives from major digital asset companies like Coinbase (COIN), Circle (CRCL), and Ripple, as well as US banking institutions such as Citigroup and Bank of America. The urgency of these discussions was prompted by a letter from crypto industry groups urging the UK government to prioritize digital assets and blockchain in any new trade arrangements with the US.

The tokens were moved off Binance, OKX, Coinbase and Bybit into wallets linked to the brokerage, reports have disclosed. Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Rally Yet? Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025 FalconX Withdrawals Raise Eyebrows Blockchain trackers flagged the transfers as significant because they happened across multiple venues in a short window. FalconX is the largest digital asset prime brokerage, the company’s website shows. Lookonchain and other analytics firms have flagged the pattern as consistent with institutional activity, where assets are moved into custody or cold storage rather than kept on exchange accounts ready for sale. Large withdrawals cut the pool of SOL sitting on exchanges. That matters because less exchange supply can tighten available coins for buyers, especially if demand holds or rises. Traders watch that metric closely. It is one of several data points that can change short-term odds for price swings. Looks like another institution is buying massive $SOL. In the past 8 hours, #FalconX has withdrawn 413,075 $SOL($98.4M) from #Binance, #OKX, #Coinbase, and #Bybit.https://t.co/BbJHB6YKtf pic.twitter.com/BibDGcoD3x — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 17, 2025 Analysts Note Caution On Attribution Based on reports, the wallets involved have been attributed to FalconX, a known institutional broker, but such labels are built from analysis of patterns, prior transfers, and public filings. What This Could Mean For Solana’s Price A withdrawal of roughly $98.4 million worth of SOL can add upward pressure if buyers keep coming. Less supply on exchanges tends to reduce immediate sell liquidity. If demand spikes, prices can react sharply. That said, price depends on many things: order book depth, macro drivers, derivatives flows and how other large holders behave. Market analysts tend to associate large exchange outflows with probable accumulation phases. For Solana, a move of this magnitude illustrates how institutional custody activity can affect views on short-term availability and supply. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Target $8,500 With Big Money Backing The Move – Details The scale and timing of FalconX’s activity guarantee that traders will be looking closely at order books over the next few days. Historical evidence also indicates that large withdrawals of tokens occasionally lead to heightened market activity. If transfers of this nature keep going ahead, Solana’s on-exchange liquidity profile may get tighter still, setting the stage for price to respond more rapidly to trading volume. In the meantime, attention is centered on how market demand compares to this diminished on-exchange supply.

The agreement aims to establish Da Nang as an international financial center by providing market liquidity and a secure financial infrastructure. The partnership follows previous talks between Bybit and Vietnam’s Ministry of Finance on regulatory sandboxes. Bybit has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Da Nang’s People’s Committee, Abu Dhabi Blockchain Center (ADBC), and Verichains Network Security Company. The partnership aims to establish Da Nang as an international financial and innovation center. Da Nang is one of Vietnam’s largest cities and a major economic zone. The MOU approves a blockchain sandbox in the city, allowing it to test progressive policies and international cooperation in digital assets. The parties will work together to support the city’s establishment as an international financial center (IFC). The collaboration aims to establish Da Nang as an international financial center From left to right: Mr. Abdulla Al Dhaheri, CEO of Abu Dhabi Blockchain Center; Helen Liu, Co-CEO, Bybit; Mr. Ho Ky Minh, Permanent Vice Chairman of the Da Nang People’s Committee; and Mr. Nguyen Le Thanh, Founder and CEO of Verichains Establishing Da Nang city as an international financial center has centered on three pillars: digital asset liquidity to connect Da Nang with global financial markets, ecosystem connectivity to link Vietnam and other leading financial hubs, and support for a risk-controlled environment for blockchain innovation. The agreement acts as a bridge between the national strategies and local implementations, ensuring the IFC model is adopted with minimal risk to the digital economy. The People’s Committee of Da Nang will provide the administrative ground for the other parties to operate. The parties will invest, open offices, and integrate their operations into the IFC. Bybit and its partners, on the other hand, will provide guidance on digital assets and blockchain policy, international best practices, and assist Da Nang in building a regulatory framework. Helen Liu, Co-CEO of Bybit, revealed that the agreement aligns with Vietnam’s momentum in digital transformation. “ Vietnam is an inspiring example of a nation embracing digital transformation, and we are honored to contribute to its journey. Bybit is committed to sharing our global expertise in blockchain and digital asset innovation to support Da Nang’s vision of becoming an IFC.” Helen Liu- Bybit Co-CEO She acknowledged that the partnership reflects their belief in building sustainable ecosystems with the governments, institutions, and trusted partners. In April, Bybit Co-founder Ben Zhou met with Nguyen Van Thang, the finance minister in Hanoi. The officials discussed the regulatory sandbox plan and other initiatives, including creating a safe, transparent, and innovative digital asset market. They also addressed pilot mechanisms for issuing and trading crypto assets under controlled environments. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements were proposed to enhance investor protection and financial security. Vietnam sets stage for 150,000 crypto startups by 2035 The latest partnership positions Bybit as a trusted long-term partner in Vietnam’s digital transformation. Da Nang now has the ground set to attract international investors, foster an innovation-friendly regulatory landscape, and connect with international financial systems. Cryptopolitan reported on KuCoin entering the Vietnamese market two weeks ago via a MOU with the Blockchain and Digital Assets Association (VBA) and 1Matrix Joint Stock Company. The KuCoin partnership aimed to push blockchain innovation, digital asset adoption, and improve regulatory compliance in the country. The partnership introduced pilot projects in payments, identity management, trading platforms, and risk management systems that are aligned with international standards. Damen Chen, Vice President of KuCoin, pointed out the youthful population of Vietnam, highlighting their tech-driven nature as a catalyst for blockchain adoption. Last week, Vietnam approved a five-year pilot programme for crypto trading. According to a Cryptopolitan report published last week, the programme requires all exchanges to be domestically owned and operate exclusively in the country, restricting crypto issuance to Vietnamese companies. The framework sets strict requirements for exchanges to prevent external entities from taking control of licensed platforms. The developments come ahead of Vietnam’s preparation to enforce its digital technology law in January 2026, which targets 150,000 crypto startups by 2035.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-18 04:02:33

The price is now showing positive signs and might gain pace if it clears the $3.120 zone. XRP price is moving higher from the $2.980 support zone. The price is now trading above $3.020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a rising channel with resistance at $3.070 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the price clears the $3.120 zone. XRP Price Attempts Fresh Increase XRP price extended losses below $3.00 before the bulls appeared, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price tested the $2.980 zone and recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $3.00 and $3.020 levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.185 swing high to the $2.957 low. Besides, there was a break above a rising channel with resistance at $3.070 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $3.080 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls protect the $3.050 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.10 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.185 swing high to the $2.957 low. The first major resistance is near the $3.120 level. A clear move above the $3.120 resistance might send the price toward the $3.20 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.2320 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $3.120 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.070 level. The next major support is near the $3.040 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $3.040 level, the price might continue to decline toward $3.00.

Exchange supply ratio falls to record lows, signaling reduced sell pressure compared to earlier market cycles. Binance ETH open interest drops an average 15%, aligning with spot price corrections near 11% recently. Ethereum Price Holds Within Range Ethereum (ETH) is trading at around $4,500 with a 24-hour trading volume of $32.4 billion. The asset has slipped slightly in the past day but is still up 4% over the week. Despite these moves, ETH remains locked in a range, with the all-time high near $4,900 forming the top and $4,000 acting as key support. The ETH/USDT 2-hour chart shows sideways action after the recent sweep of the ATH. Crypto Bully described ETH as “lacklustre since the ATH sweep,” adding that the market looks like a range “unless either of the levels is broken.” Meanwhile, the price has dropped under the Monday low and is moving closer to the monthly open, pointing to short-term weakness. Even so, the wider range stays intact while ETH trades above $4,000. Short-term levels, such as the weekly open and Monday high, continue to cap any upside. $ETH has been lacklustre since the ATH sweep Broadly in a range between the ATH and the $4k level, so you have to treat it like a range and look for buys at the lows and sell at the highs, no major development in my opinion unless either of the level is broken. Looking to… pic.twitter.com/lRnnKrZ68W — Crypto Bully (@BullyDCrypto) September 16, 2025 Crypto Bully also flagged $4,100 to $4,200 as an area of interest. The analyst warned that “invalidation is price acceptance below $4k; if that happens, we’re in for a deeper correction.” For now, conditions remain sideways, with no major breakout in sight. Long-Term Cycle Outlook CryptoELlTES shared a longer-term chart tracking Ethereum’s price history across cycles. The chart shows ETH hitting the top of a rising channel at the 2017 and 2021 peaks, while cycle lows formed along the lower boundary. Notably, ETH has recently rebounded from this lower boundary and moved back into the main channel. If the pattern repeats, ETH could be on track for a new ATH in 2025 near the top of the channel. That projection points to a possible range of $15,000 to $20,000, though this depends on whether the channel holds as it has in previous cycles. Source: CryptoELlTES/X Exchange Supply and Open Interest Trends On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that the share of ETH held on exchanges has been falling since 2020. The Exchange Supply Ratio has dropped from over 0.30 to about 0.14 this year. In past cycles, the ratio was much higher and lined up with market peaks. The current cycle is unfolding with the lowest levels on record, pointing to reduced supply on exchanges and more ETH in long-term storage. Source: CryptoQuant Derivatives data adds another layer. Binance ETH open interest (OI) has seen repeated drops over the last three months, averaging 15%. These moves in OI matched spot price corrections of around 11%. This shows that OI trends have been a useful signal for spotting local corrections.
