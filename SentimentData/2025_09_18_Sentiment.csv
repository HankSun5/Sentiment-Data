As Solana continues to see high levels of ecosystem usage and network utilization, the stage is slowly being set for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . MUTM is priced at $0.035 in its fast-growing presale. Price appreciation of 14.3% is what the investors are going to anticipate in the next phase. Over $15.85 million has been raised as the presale keeps gaining momentum. Unlike the majority of the tokens surfing short-term waves of hype, Mutuum Finance is becoming a utility-focused choice with more value potential and therefore an increasingly better option for investors looking for more than price action alone. Solana Maintains Gains Near $234 As Speculation Persists Solana (SOL) is trading at $234.08 currently, holding its 24hr range around $234.42 to $248.19 as it illustrates the recent trend. The token has recorded strong seven-day gains of nearly 13%, far exceeding most of its peers, as it is supported by rising volume and institutional buying. Resistance is at $250-$260, and support appears to be at $220-$230, and thus these are significant levels for potential breakout or pullback. However, new DeFi crypto Mutuum Finance, is being considered by market watchers to have more upside potential, being still in presale. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Stage 6 and offering tokens for $0.035. Presale has been going on very fast, and investors have raised over $15.85 million. The project also looks forward to a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain for convenient payments and as a keeper of long-term value. Mutuum Finance is a dual-lending, multi-purpose DeFi platform that benefits borrowers and lenders alike. It provides the network to retail as well as institutional investors and makes it manipulative-proof and scalable. Mutuum Finance Protocol Overview MUTM rate of interest is a charged variable and well under liquidity management. Variable interest lending is market-based application: available capital will begin to lend at reduced fees, and shortfalls in liquidity indicate additional fees to allow loan repayment and new deposits. Borrowers can even access fixed rate lending for lending and for a better rate than variable and only for highly liquid collateral. Mutuum Finance’s long-term vision is consistent growth through staking rewards, token repurchases, and strategically timed exchange listings as a method of building up liquidity and real-world adoption. Early adoption is also being rewarded with $100,000 giveaway . The campaign has multiple points of entry throughout presale to foster a harmonious community dynamic. Risk and Asset Parameters Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has strong risk management platforms that continuously discover protocol security. The protocol is extremely effective at liquidating under-collateralized and over-lending over-collateralization. Mutuum Finance controls exposure through cascading Loan-to-Value ratios, liquidity limits, liquidation fees, and reserve factors hedging and securing the platform liquid in all market conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor interest as Solana (SOL) is moving near $234, being strong but restricted compared to MUTM’s future potential. Stage 6 presale tokens remain at $0.035, ahead of a 14.3% increase in Stage 7. The initiative already boasts $15.85M, demonstrating picking-up demand. With a USD-backed stablecoin, twin lending strategy, and strong risk management, MUTM is scalable and constructed with actual utility. Backed by a $100K giveaway and community-supported incentives, it offers life-changing ROI potential to investors. Purchase your tokens today before the next price surge.

While established players like Solana (SOL) have seen their days of exponential growth, a new contender is emerging that has analysts buzzing. Ruvi AI (RUVI) is seeing its daily token sales hit record numbers, bringing its path to a $1 valuation closer than ever and leading many experts to believe it can outperform established giants like Solana. This bullish outlook is fueled by a presale that is nothing short of historic. Ruvi AI has officially stormed past the $3.7 million fundraising mark, with daily sales figures now reaching record highs. A rapidly expanding global community, now surpassing 3,600 holders , has collectively purchased over 270 million RUVI tokens . This overwhelming demand signals that the market views Ruvi AI not just as a promising project, but as a genuine contender to deliver life-changing returns. Why Analysts Believe Ruvi AI Can Outperform Solana While Solana was a phenomenal success story, its massive market capitalization now limits its potential for another 100x return. For investors seeking the next wave of explosive growth, the focus has shifted to early-stage projects with strong fundamentals. Ruvi AI fits this profile perfectly. Its value is anchored in a revolutionary super app designed to serve the massive $104 billion creator economy , providing tangible utility that sets it apart from purely speculative assets. This focus on real-world application is what analysts believe gives Ruvi AI a higher performance ceiling than established coins. The project has also secured critical credibility markers that attract serious capital: a successful smart contract audit by CyberScope , which verifies its security and transparency, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , cementing its legitimacy as a top-tier project. The Super App Fueling the Path to $1 The engine behind Ruvi AI’s ambitious $1 valuation target is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will create a powerful and sustainable cycle of user adoption and token demand. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. The Clock Is Ticking: A 40% Price Increase Is on the Horizon The path to $1 is becoming shorter as the presale accelerates. Currently in Phase 3 , the RUVI token is priced at just $0.020 . However, with token sales hitting record numbers daily, this phase is expected to sell out rapidly. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a position. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize the potential of this early opportunity: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further incentivizes the community, adding to the project’s unstoppable momentum. The Opportunity to Outperform is Now As daily token sales continue to break records, the message from the market is clear. The opportunity to get in on a project with a credible path to a $1 valuation, and the potential to outperform established giants, is here. For investors looking to capture this cycle’s biggest gains, the time to act on Ruvi AI is now, before the next guaranteed price increase.

Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Rally Yet? Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025 According to reports, the remark came during a TV appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box, tied to the launch of American Bitcoin, the mining and treasury firm he helped start. Company Holdings And Strategy Based on public filings and company summaries, American Bitcoin has accumulated 2,443 BTC on its balance sheet. That stash has been valued in the low hundreds of millions of dollars at recent spot prices. The firm mixes large-scale mining with the goal of holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, which it says will help it grow both production and asset holdings over time. Eric Trump’s comments were direct. He told viewers that institutions are treating Bitcoin more like a store of value than a fringe idea, and he warned firms that resist blockchain adoption. The tone was strong at times, and the line about Bitcoin being a modern equivalent of gold was used to frame American Bitcoin’s role as both miner and holder. Eric Trump has said: bitcoin is modern-day gold — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) September 16, 2025 How The Company Went Public American Bitcoin moved toward a public listing via an all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining earlier this year, a deal that kept most of the original shareholders in control and positioned the new entity for a Nasdaq debut. Reports show that mining partner Hut 8 holds a large ownership stake, leaving the Trump family and other backers with a minority share. The listing brought fresh attention and capital to the firm as it began trading under the ticker ABTC. Market watchers say the firm’s public debut highlights two trends: mining companies are trying to grow by both producing and holding Bitcoin, and political ties are bringing more headlines to crypto firms. Some analysts point out that holding large amounts of Bitcoin on the balance sheet exposes a company to price swings, while supporters argue it aligns incentives between miners and investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Target $8,500 With Big Money Backing The Move – Details Reaction And Possible Risks Based on coverage of the launch, investors have reacted with both enthusiasm and caution. Supporters praise the prospect of a US-based miner that aims to be transparent and aggressive about building a reserve. Critics point to governance questions, possible conflicts tied to high-profile backers, and the usual risks of a volatile asset being held on corporate balance sheets. Eric Trump’s remark that Bitcoin has taken gold’s role in today’s world reflects both his belief in its value and American Bitcoin’s strategy of mining and holding. Whether that view sticks will depend on how investors and institutions respond in the months ahead.

51894333,583277,1758146437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51894333.jpeg,Is Bitcoin Treasury Hype Fading? Data Suggests So,https://bitcoinist.com/is-bitcoin-treasury-hype-fading-data-suggests-so/,"Bitcoin treasury companies have seen a record-breaking 2025 so far, but CryptoQuant data shows momentum has started to slow down. Bitcoin Treasuries May Be Observing A Slowdown In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has discussed how the latest trend is looking when it comes to Bitcoin corporate treasuries . Popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly Microstrategy), the treasury playbook refers to a model where a publicly listed entity buys and keeps BTC as a reserve asset on its balance sheet. The previous cycle saw this treasury strategy gain some steam, but things have gone up a notch this cycle as the success of Strategy has encouraged companies to go bolder. As the below chart shows, 2023 peaked at just 15 new treasury buyers of Bitcoin, but the number more than doubled to 38 in 2024. 2025 has only continued this trend of acceleration, with 89 companies already having added BTC to their balance sheets, when there are a few months left to go for the year. That said, while 2025 has certainly been impressive so far, granular data could show early signs that a shift may be underway. As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin treasury strategy hype saw an increase over the year, peaking at 21 new firms in July. In August, however, the number dropped to 15, and in the first half of September, so far, just one new company has employed this model. Based on the data, CryptoQuant concludes, “the slowdown has begun.” The cooldown in momentum is also evident in the stock charts of some of these firms. Examples of this include The Blockchain Group, which was sitting at +1,820% at its peak before seeing a decline to +443%, and Metaplanet , down to +55% from its +355% top. “Signs the hype is deflating as reality sets in,” notes the analytics firm. Though while signs have been there for a slowdown, the big buyers haven’t looked done accumulating Bitcoin yet. Strategy has regularly been buying and has added $19.3 billion to its reserves year-to-date. Similarly, Metaplanet has expanded its treasury by $1.92 billion. Today, Bitcoin treasury companies as a whole control more than 1 million tokens, equivalent to 5% of the entire BTC supply in circulation. Strategy alone makes up for 66% of this stack. BTC Price Bitcoin has furthered its recovery over the past day as its price has surged to $116,600.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Corporate Adoption|Bitcoin Treasury|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-17 22:00:37

51895328,https://cryptonews.com/?p=424601,1758148200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51895328.jpeg,"Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Shiba Inu and Pepe by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/perplexity-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-shiba-inu-and-pepe-by-the-end-of-20/,"Perplexity AI, a fast-growing ChatGPT rival, is turning heads with a bold market call: Perplexity predicts that XRP, Pepe, and Shiba Inu could deliver massive gains as crypto enters a high-momentum phase heading into the year-end rally. Momentum is already building. Bitcoin smashed through its previous all-time high last month, climbing to $124,128 before cooling slightly after a surprise jump in July inflation. Now, with the Federal Reserve officially cutting interest rates by 0.25% at today’s meeting , market sentiment has flipped firmly risk-on – a historically bullish trigger for altcoins and meme coins alike. On the policy front, President Trump’s GENIUS Act, signed earlier this summer, is the first U.S. law to regulate stablecoins and mandates full reserves for issuers. At the same time, the SEC launched Project Crypto – a sweeping initiative aimed at modernizing securities laws to better accommodate blockchain innovation. Taken together, these catalysts could set the stage for a new altcoin supercycle. If Perplexity’s forecasts hold true, XRP, Pepe, and Shiba Inu could be the biggest winners in the coming months. XRP (Ripple): Perplexity AI Predicts $10–$15, Suggesting 5× Upside Perplexity expects XRP ($XRP) to climb as high as $1 5 by late 2025, five times its current price of around $3.01. The token has already shown strong performance this year, peaking at $3.65 on July 18, above its previous ATH of $3.40 set seven years ago, before pulling back about 17%. Ripple continues to scale globally, earning recognition from the UN Capital Development Fund in 2024 as a viable tool for cross-border payments in developing regions. Its long-running clash with the SEC also ended earlier this year, when the regulator dropped its lawsuit, cementing the 2023 decision that XRP’s retail sales are not securities transactions, a milestone for the entire altcoin sector. Perplexity outlines a base target range of $3.30–$5.50, with bullish conditions potentially pushing XRP as high as $15, particularly if the Trump administration follows through on its crypto-friendly agenda or if the SEC approves spot XRP ETFs next month. Technical indicators also look supportive. XRP’s RSI has risen from 54, hinting at increased buying pressure that could propel it to $4 by October. Over the past year, XRP has gained 413%, far outshining Bitcoin’s 97% and Ethereum’s 94% growth spurts. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Perplexity Predicts Ethereum-Based Meme Coin Could See 8× Rally Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has maintained its position as Dogecoin’s closest rival, boasting a $7.6 billion market cap. Currently trading near $0.00001304 after a small 1% rise in the last day, SHIB has held up better than its sector. By contrast, the $80.2 billion meme coin sector collectively fell just 0.4% overnight. Technically, SHIB has broken out of both a falling wedge and a bull flag this year. A move above $0.000025 could confirm Perplexity’s bullish range of $0.00005–$0.00008 by year’s end, representing potential gains of 5× to 8×. Its RSI sits at 51 following recent sell-offs, but analysts expect momentum to return as inflation concerns ease. Beyond its meme appeal, Shiba Inu now powers Shibarium, its own Layer-2 network that facilitates fast, low-cost transactions and dApp support. Added privacy-focused features further distinguish it from rivals. Pepe ($PEPE): Non-Dog Meme Coin with 3–4× Upside Potential Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) rapidly rose into the top three meme tokens, holding a $4.6 billion market cap, making it the most valuable meme coin outside the “dog” category. This is largely thanks to the cultural clout it enjoys as a reference to Max Furie’s iconic webcomic Boy’s Club . Despite competition, Pepe’s liquidity and community backing have kept it relevant. Elon Musk has even hinted at holding Pepe alongside Dogecoin, jokingly referencing it on X. At $0.00001091, Pepe has over the last week gained 12%, outperforming iconic blue chip layer 1 cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and others. Breaking through resistance at $0.000018–$0.000022 could pave the way for a $0.00003 target by mid-autumn. In a more bullish environment, Perplexity predicts Pepe could reach $0.000035, about over 3× above current levels. Charts also show a descending wedge between November and March, historically a bullish formation. With clearer U.S. regulatory structures taking shape, Pepe could be poised for another leg up. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Riskier Spin on Dogecoin Outside Perplexity’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is gaining traction as a high-risk, high-reward meme play. It brands itself as Dogecoin’s ‘roided up degen cousin, appealing to traders looking for bigger volatility with more potential upside. While Dogecoin has matured into a large-cap token that increasingly moves in sync with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Maxi Doge is trying to capture the speculative energy of earlier meme rallies. The project has already raised nearly $2.2 million within weeks of launch. Built as an ERC-20 token, MAXI emphasizes community growth with active Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading contests, and collaboration plans. Out of 150.24 billion total tokens, 25% are reserved for a “Maxi Fund” to support marketing and partnerships. Staking is live with yields as high as 144% APY, though returns are expected to decline as participation grows.

The sprawling digital asset market has hovered near the $4 trillion mark for a while, even though Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $124,128 just last month. The enthusiasm isn’t limited to Bitcoin either. Significant capital continues to pour into leading altcoins and the best meme coins . Over the past year, numerous projects have reached record price levels, signaling that market appetite for crypto remains strong. Adding to this wave of optimism are two pivotal policy moves out of Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the country’s first complete regulatory framework for stablecoins. Second, the SEC rolled out Project Crypto, an initiative to modernize and clarify the application of securities law to digital assets. Amid this backdrop of rising confidence, let’s explore how tokens such as XRP, Pi Coin, and Solana are some of the best crypto to buy today. Ripple ($XRP): This World Leading Cross-Border Payments Token is One of the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) marked a new record at $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act was signed, surpassing its 2018 high of $3.40. Since then, the price has eased to about $3.01, around 17% below its peak. XRP stands out for its speed and low fees, offering a real alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Its legitimacy has been reinforced by acknowledgments from global institutions, including the UN Capital Development Fund and even the White House. CEO Brad Garlinghouse also joined a high-profile presidential crypto roundtable earlier this year. Momentum picked up in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that XRP’s retail sales did not breach securities laws, ending a long dispute with the SEC. Over the past year, XRP has gained 413%, making it more profitable than Bitcoin, which only posted 97% growth in the same period. July’s breakout demonstrated its strength, and despite a recent cooldown, the token has held steady even as broader crypto markets dipped slightly. Its RSI currently sits near 53, a neutral zone, suggesting traders are re-entering after last month’s inflation scare. With XRP hovering above its 30-day moving average of $2.90 and holding firm at the $3 psychological support level, the community is hopeful that the next push could see prices approaching $4 by October. Pi Network ($PI): Can the Mobile Mining Pioneer Retest Its Highs Before Summer Ends? Pi Network has shaken up traditional mining with its tap-to-mine system, which eliminates the need for expensive hardware and heavy energy consumption. By letting users earn tokens through its mobile app with simple daily interaction, Pi has made crypto more accessible to beginners. Since May, its RSI has stayed around or below 50, which indicates the asset was underperforming for most of the year. However, the development team is now implementing a phased rollout toward version 23, which could finally lead to a long-awaited mainnet launch. For long-term believers, this lull could represent a strategic buying window. A falling wedge pattern across its support and resistance lines throughout March points to a possible rebound. If sentiment improves, Pi may climb back above the dollar before winter. With its user-friendly interface and custom-built Layer 1 blockchain, Pi Network is positioning itself as a key player in the next wave of adoption. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Biggest Rival is the Best Performing Blue Chip Crypto This Month Solana ($SOL) continues to dominate as a high-speed, low-cost blockchain. Its market cap has climbed past $127 billion, with more than $12.5 billion , in total value locked (TVL) according to DeFiLlama, cementing its importance in the DeFi ecosystem. Speculation is mounting that Solana could soon receive approval for a spot ETF, following the footsteps of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such a move would attract institutional investors who prefer regulated pathways into crypto. After slipping to $100 in April, SOL has recovered to $235, gaining 30% over the past thirty days, outperforming both Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP, which only posted single digit percentage gains over the same period. With the SEC now actively shaping digital asset regulation, Solana could benefit further in the coming months. Its RSI is downtrending from 63, signaling a sell-off is potentially in swing that could further discount the price in the coming days.. Support holds strong around $150, while resistance lies at $200 and $250. Reclaiming its ATH of $293.31, or even pushing past $300, remains a real possibility before the end of 2025. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Bitcoin’s First Layer 2 and One of 2025’s Hottest Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has become one of 2025’s most talked-about presales. Marketed as Bitcoin’s first Layer 2 solution, it blends the viral energy of meme culture with rapid scaling and community-driven development. The project’s mission is to supercharge BTC with faster transactions, broader utility, and grassroots governance. The presale has already raised more than $16.4 million, with some analysts projecting potential post-launch gains exceeding 10×. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER enables lightning-fast smart contracts for Bitcoin while maintaining low fees. One of its standout innovations is the Canonical Bridge, which supports near-instant BTC transfers across its Layer 2 while enabling dApps, meme tokens, and payment solutions with minimal gas costs. A recent Coinsult audit found no issues, strengthening investor trust. HYPER tokens fuel staking, fees, and governance. Early presale buyers can earn up to 70% APY by staking their holdings, along with voting rights on future upgrades.

Monero (XMR) stands out in the cryptocurrency space for its strong focus on privacy and decentralization of transactions, making it one of the leading privacy focused cryptocurrencies. This makes it a popular choice for privacy advocates and those prioritizing security. The Monero ecosystem constantly evolves, marked by significant milestones like enhanced protocol upgrades and growing adoption across various sectors, which underscore its utility. As Monero progresses, many wonder about its future price trajectory. Will its unique features drive significant value growth, as many traders speculate?

Monero price has support and resistance at $280 and $300, respectively. The Monero price analysis for September 17 shows XMR has fallen back to the $290 level. Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR breaks down to $290 The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicates a mixed market sentiment as the altcoin observes an increase of more than 10% of its value in the last 30 days as XMR rose from the $270 price level to the $320 mark. However, after reaching the $320 mark, the mounting selling pressure caused a sharp crash to the $290 mark where the price trades at press time. XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView The indicators reflect the strong bullish price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show rising buying pressure. The MACD is bullish at 4.70 units and shows falling bullish momentum at the current price level.

Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart shows that Monero observed strong bullish momentum until it reached the $325 level where it finds short-term resistance level and returned back to the $290 level. Currently, the bulls seek to hold the $290 resistance but with rising bearish pressure, price may continue to decline.

XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a great bullish as the price rapidly rose to the $320 mark. However, the price finds bearish pressure at the level causing a decline back to the $290 level. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to consolidate at the current level as the trend corrects. The price should be expected to trade below the $300 mark but is not expected to fall below $2750. On the other hand, a bearish breakout would mean a drop below the $250 level. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a great bullish as the price rapidly rose to the $320 mark. However, the price finds bearish pressure at the level causing a decline back to the $290 level. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges that could hinder significant growth . $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current Monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

The Altcoin Season Index has risen well above the critical threshold of 75, reaching 78. This signal historically marks the start of powerful rallies in alternative assets. Bitcoin continues to hold steady, although investors are turning to projects that have big upside potential. As traders prepare for this cycle, they are rebalancing portfolios in order to capture safety and growth. Established giants provide stability, but presales promise explosive returns. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has risen to the top of the investor list in a short period. Analysts even project a staggering 1500% ROI before the end of Q4. Altcoin season confirmed with index explosion The Altcoin Season Index is a widely followed market index. It is a measure of how performing altcoins have compared with Bitcoin. When the index exceeds 75, it confirms the altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. Analyst BitBull stressed that the current reading of 78 marks the official beginning of altcoin season. Historically, these levels have preceded prolonged rallies of major and minor tokens. Traders are reallocating capital into altcoins in anticipation of faster and greater price action. Moreover, crypto analyst CryptoJack has highlighted the potential for day-to-day gains as high as 40%. Bitcoin’s stability makes room for speculative flows and allows altcoins to gain the attention of investors. With the decline of dominance, alternative assets are all set for amazing growth. The role of the golden cross Technical signals are adding to the bullish environment. Master of Crypto pointed out the formation of a golden cross in the altcoin market. This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average. Golden crosses have been a marker of explosive cycles. In both 2017 and 2021, the altcoins soared after this pattern. Some tokens went up by thousands of percent in a matter of weeks. With this signal flashing once again, altcoin revival confidence is gaining momentum. Traders take this as a green light to step up the exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE presale momentum As the altcoin season starts to make its way back, investors are starting to shift their strategy in order to get the most from it all! The Altcoin Index has recently shot up to 78/100, a huge revival in sentiment. This environment has traders rebalancing portfolios, mixing in established giants alongside high ROI. MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning out to be one of those great plays. Analysts continue to predict that MAGACOIN FINANCE is set to return up to 1500% before the end of Q4. This bold forecast is indicative of both its deflationary tokenomics as well as the market buzz growing around it. Investors are realizing that although blue-chip assets such as Ethereum and XRP offer stability, there are often other, smaller-cap tokens that have an outsized upside during bull cycles. Add in a scarcity-driven model fueled by a 12% transaction burn, and it’s easy to see why traders are betting big. For many, it signifies the sweet spot between resilient foundations and explosive growth potential. In a nutshell, though, MAGACOIN FINANCE is on the rise as the low-cap gem investors want for this cycle’s high-reward phase. Conclusion Altcoin Season Index crossing 78 has confirmed a revival of altseason. Analysts think the current signals the start of another strong run. With Bitcoin staying strong, altcoins are taking center stage once again. Technical indicators like the golden cross add further strength to the outlook, thereby adding to the bullish case. At the same time, presale opportunities are getting equal attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with massive ROI predictions. For investors, it is the balancing act of trust and explosive growth potential. As portfolios become more diversified, this mix of stability and high-risk, high-reward assets characterizes the cycle for 2025. Altcoin revival is here, and investors are positioning themselves early to make the most gains.

51896365,583525,1758150024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51896365.jpeg,"Bitcoin ETFs See $2.3B Surge, Strongest Since July: What It Means For The Price Outlook",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-see-2-3b-surge-since-july-what-it-mean/,"Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are back in the spotlight after registering their strongest inflows since July. According to K33 Research, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $2.34 billion in net inflows last week, lifting combined holdings to 1.32 million BTC. This surge marks a decisive return of institutional demand, with ETFs surpassing their July peak and cementing their role as a critical driver of Bitcoin’s market performance. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) once again dominated activity, pulling in over $1 billion in inflows, while Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured $843 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB followed with nearly $182 million. Together, these three issuers absorbed more than $2 billion, reflecting the consolidation of investor confidence around the largest fund managers. Institutional Demand Pushes Bitcoin ETFs Higher Recent trends show that ETFs have become the main method for institutional and retail investors to gain regulated Bitcoin exposure. Analysts at Bitwise noted that inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded new BTC supply by almost nine times, creating a bullish supply-demand imbalance that enhances Bitcoin’s price outlook. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are struggling to keep pace. Reports show $62 million in weekly outflows, with Fidelity’s FETH and Bitwise’s ETHW leading the declines. This divergence suggests a market “re-rotation” from Ethereum back to Bitcoin, as traders prioritize BTC ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve rate decision. What It Means for BTC’s Price Outlook With net assets of Bitcoin ETFs now above $150 billion, equivalent to over 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market cap, these products are shaping BTC’s price trajectory more than ever before. Strong inflows typically translate into buying pressure, and if the trend continues, analysts believe ETFs could soon hold 10% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. However, volatility risks remain. While inflows signal bullish sentiment, upcoming macroeconomic events, particularly the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, could influence short-term market direction. A dovish Fed stance may push Bitcoin toward the $60,000–$65,000 resistance zone, while a hawkish outlook could test support near $55,000. Currently, the message is clear: institutional demand for Bitcoin is increasing, ETFs are spearheading the movement, and the inflows indicate growing confidence in BTC’s long-term value as both a store of wealth and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.

On-chain data from Santiment shows the Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) metric spiking to its highest level since July, signaling that many investors are cashing out profits. Related Reading: Solana DATs Will Outpace Bitcoin, Says Multicoin Capital Co-Founder This wave of profit-taking, while not a sign of structural weakness, has capped ADA’s recovery attempts. Analysts emphasize that defending the $0.87–$0.85 support range will be crucial to maintaining ADA’s broader bullish outlook. ADA's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Technical Outlook: Will ADA Break or Hold? From a technical perspective, Cardano (ADA) is struggling beneath the 50-EMA at $0.8819, with rejection near $0.923 forming a bearish engulfing candle. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 44, suggesting sellers still have room to push lower. If ADA loses support at $0.8528, the next downside levels are $0.8264 and $0.8033. However, reclaiming $0.8843 would be the first sign of strength, opening targets at $0.9018 and $0.9234. Traders are split: aggressive bears may short below $0.8528, while conservative bulls wait for a breakout above $0.90 to confirm momentum. Adoption News Offers Bullish Counterweight Despite short-term weakness, ADA’s fundamentals remain strong. Openbank, Europe’s largest digital bank under Santander, recently integrated Cardano for 2 million customers. This development has boosted the institutional adoption narrative, potentially providing a longer-term bullish catalyst. Caution dominates in the near term. On-chain data shows a $6.7 million net outflow from exchanges on September 17, reflecting investor hesitation. Analysts warn that unless inflows pick up, ADA may continue trading sideways or drift lower before staging its next rally. Cardano Bulls Eye $1, But Risks Remain For now, $0.87–$0.85 remains ADA’s battleground. A decisive break above $0.90 could reignite bullish momentum and put ADA back on track toward the psychological $1 level. Conversely, a breakdown below $0.85 risks exposing deeper support zones at $0.82 and $0.78. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bottom In?

The decision will enable exchanges to proceed with the listing of proposed ETFs by sidestepping the often-lengthy 19(b) rule filing process that can take up to 240 days and requires the SEC to actively approve or disapprove an ETF. Essentially, the process will be more streamlined than before. ETF Issuers will approach exchanges (Nasdaq, NYSE, CBOE) with a product idea and desire to list their ETF. If the proposed strategy (token or combination of tokens) of the issuers meets the generic listing standard, then the exchange can proceed with listing the ETF. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said the decision was aimed at reducing barriers to accessing digital asset products in regulated U.S. marketplaces. ""By approving these generic listing standards, we are ensuring that our capital markets remain the best place in the world to engage in the cutting-edge innovation of digital assets,"" SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said in a statement. Alongside the rule change, the agency signed off on the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which tracks the assets in the CoinDesk 5 Index and currently consists of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).

Big move for altcoin ETFs The SEC's listing standards could potentially open the way for a wave of spot-based altcoin ETFs that have been waiting for regulators' nod to enter the market. ""This is the crypto ETP framework we've been waiting for,"" James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an X post . ""Get ready for a wave of spot crypto ETP launches in coming weeks and months."" Echoing this sentiment, Kristin Smith, the President of Solana Policy Institute, said, ""We are incredibly encouraged by tonight's news: the SEC continues to promote the rule of law by setting clear rules of the road for US businesses and to take positive steps to allow American investors to safely access digital assets."" ""These new generic listing standards are a net-positive for U.S. investors, markets, and digital asset innovation. Excited for the next wave of crypto adoption!,"" she added.

The South Korean media outlet Seoul Finance reported that the firm has registered trademarks for the KSDC, KRW24, KRW365, KOSWON, and KORWON brands. The outlet wrote that KOSCOM wants to “proactively respond” to the imminent launch of the KRW stablecoin market in South Korea. KOSCOM Stablecoin Plans ‘in Full Swing’ KOSCOM (officially the Korea Securities Computing Corporation) provides comprehensive tech solutions and trading platforms to the South Korea’s financial securities and futures markets. The headquarters of KOSCOM in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Koscom.co.kr) It was co-founded by the central government and the Korea Exchange, the nation’s stock exchange. The latter remains KOSCOM’s largest shareholder. KOSCOM has also provided trading platform solutions for securities exchanges in several Southeast Asian nations. It has worked with stock markets in Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia. Experts expect the government to roll out new crypto regulations in the coming months. They believe Seoul will bundle these regulations with new rules for won-denominated stablecoins. Observers think that companies will be able to commercialize their offerings “in the mid- to long-term,” the media outlet wrote. KOSCOM has also expanded and reorganized its Future Business Division. It has launched a “Digital Asset Business Promotion Task Force,” which now reports directly to the firm’s CEO. This unit has launched a proof-of-concept (PoC) for stablecoin technology. It is also looking at ways the firm could use KRW stablecoins “as a means of payment during subscription and distribution processes.” It wants to use these coins to help it “boost payment convenience and stability,” the outlet wrote. Kim Wan-seong, the head of task force, said: “Stablecoins are emerging globally. They have become a new means of payment.

While his prediction set a specific path, the key development shaping market sentiment today came from Washington, where the U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed its highly anticipated policy adjustment. The Federal Open Market Committee voted to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, setting the federal funds range at 4.00% to 4.25%. This marks the first cut since December 2024, a move obviously expected by market participants with a 99.1% probability ahead of the meeting . It will pump for 2 weeks and then correct which is good and repeat till the end of the year and end of cycle — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 17, 2025 How the Cut Supports Risk Assets Like XRP Lower interest rates typically provide relief to financial markets by reducing borrowing costs and encouraging capital to move toward riskier assets. For cryptocurrencies, including XRP, the impact could be meaningful. Investors often seek alternative assets when policy turns accommodative, and digital currencies benefit from renewed liquidity . EGRAG CRYPTO also noted that this latest cut is not expected to be the only one. Fed officials signaled two more rate reductions before the end of 2025. If the Committee follows through, the environment will remain favorable for assets like XRP that stand to benefit from both macroeconomic easing and structural adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Forecast For the Coming Cycle When asked how the market would react following the Fed’s decision, EGRAG CRYPTO described a clear sequence he expects to see unfold. According to him, the market will “pump for 2 weeks and then correct,” a process he believes will repeat through the end of the year and into the cycle’s conclusion. His outlook suggests a pattern of short-term surges followed by resets, creating opportunities for active traders while aligning with the broader trend of monetary easing. The timing of his projection is particularly notable, as it aligns with the Fed’s own path of gradual cuts. If risky assets do follow the rhythm outlined in his forecast, XRP could see periods of accelerated momentum after each policy move before consolidating at new levels . That dynamic could prove decisive as institutional adoption continues to expand. Experts have set targets as high as $20 for XRP based on the rate cuts , and subsequent cuts could help the digital asset reach much higher levels, potentially closing the year in triple-digit levels.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Robinhood got all kinds of attention earlier this year when it claimed to be able to offer its retail users exposure to OpenAI’s growth story via tokenized shares backed by a special purpose vehicle. Counsel for OpenAI, has warned that these tokens do not constitute equity and claimed that the whole thing is unauthorized, which could potentially mean it could be a risky investment for the token holders. This gets at a bigger question of investor access. The hottest AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, remain firmly private, their growth captured by venture capital funds and strategic backers like Microsoft or Google. The institutional investors get it all, and retail investors are locked out, forced to either buy into Big Tech equities like Nvidia, or hope that structured products like SPVs deliver something resembling exposure. Enter Bittensor. In February 2024, the decentralized AI network rolled out its Dynamic TAO (dTAO) upgrade, which is aiming to turn staking into something closer to venture capital, where everyone gets a chance to have access to yield. Instead of passively validating the root subnet, TAO holders now allocate directly to subnets , each with its own on-chain AI startup, and receive “alpha” tokens in return. These tokens reflect the performance and demand of the subnet, and staking decisions determine which projects earn a share of the network’s emissions. It’s a simple market-driven incubator where value is rewarded only if it is created. ""The subnets form an ecosystem within an ecosystem, where performance and utility are rewarded, stacking opportunities both through staking returns and alpha token appreciation,"" explained ‘Zerobit’, CEO of Talisman, a wallet that’s part of the dTAO ecosystem, during a recent panel on AI at Taiwan Blockchain Week. Two subnets illustrate why this matters. Bridges (SN62) is a coding agent that has already outperformed Anthropic’s Claude 4 on SWE-Bench, an industry-standard test of code generation. In just weeks, decentralized miners competing for emissions pushed Bridges’ accuracy above 80% , surpassing what a heavily funded centralized tech company delivered with hundreds of millions in capital. Crucially, it achieved this while spending just tens of thousands of dollars on compute, leveraging Bittensor’s ecosystem of shared subnets and proving the thesis of decentralized AI holds water. Another one of those is Chutes (SN64), the network’s serverless compute backbone. Think of it as a decentralized AWS for AI workloads: It processes billions of tokens daily, scales models in seconds, and undercuts centralized providers by up to 85% on cost . Chutes also hosts DeepSeek’s large language models on HuggingFace, making it the largest decentralized provider of open-source inference at scale. For retail investors, it could provide a compelling alternative. SPVs offer synthetic claims on private companies, riddled with potential legal and liquidity risk. Subnet staking, by contrast, is permissionless, performance-based, with results that can be verified on-chain. ""Where most crypto projects lock growth behind insider deals, Bittensor’s dTAO opens investment access from day one, letting them ride the growth in the value of the alpha token,” explained Brad Fuller of Bittensor.ai , a subnet staking data portal, during the same panel at Taiwan Blockchain Week. “It’s an on-ramp for anyone to join the ownership class and share in AI’s growth.” The winners attract stake, grow emissions, and compound into stronger projects. With Anthropic and OpenAI still locked away from public markets, Bittensor could be one of the few ways for everyday investors to ride AI’s upside without waiting for Wall Street’s blessing. While TAO may not have the similar pull like flashy Big Tech equities, subnet staking is becoming easier through new wallets, and with heavyweights like DCG’s Barry Silbert circling the ecosystem – who has already called it a protocol as important as bitcoin – this could provide a potential opportunity for those who might go down the rabbit hole of alternative investment options within the AI sector. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin barely budged after the Fed’s quarter-point cut, holding at $116,851 as traders weighed Powell’s risk management framing against a cautious dot plot. ETH: Ethereum saw stronger follow-through, climbing to $4,603.60 with a 6% weekly gain, reflecting renewed appetite for higher-beta names amid expectations of back-to-back cuts in October and December. Gold: Deutsche Bank has lifted its 2026 gold forecast to $4,000/oz., citing strong central bank demand, a weaker dollar, and political uncertainty around the Fed’s independence, after gold’s 41% year-to-date surge past $3,700. S&P 500: The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% to 6,600.35 after the Fed’s expected rate cut, as Powell signaled it was not the start of an extended easing cycle.

Via its local arm, BitGo Europe, it can offer custody, staking, transfer, and trading. Institutional clients will also have an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk and several liquidity venues available. The extension expands BitGo’s current Markets-in-Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license to include trading and its custody, transfer, and staking services counterparts. Europe’s cryptocurrency revenue is expected to surpass $26 billion in 2025, as Germany is the biggest adopter country in the industry. Market tailwinds have supportive regulatory structures such as MiCA, growing convergence between crypto-native firms and traditional financial institutions, and deals that could lead to consolidation. Institutional interest in crypto surges amid regulatory clarity Institutional interest in crypto has been increasing, driven by better infrastructure and the launch of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), which have lent legitimacy to the space. Clarity of regulation in places like Europe and the United Arab Emirates, and possible reform of the U.S. market structure, have helped drive adoption. Some high-profile developments in institutional crypto this week include the planned U.S. debut of Bullish, a crypto exchange geared toward institutions, which is moving forward after securing a BitLicense and a Money Transmission License from the New York State Department of Financial Services. Meanwhile, StanChart’s venture capital arm unveiled plans for a $250 million digital asset fund in 2026. Annabelle Huang, co-founder of Altius Labs, says that the coming wave of institutional crypto adoption is ongoing as fintech firms, like Robinhood and Stripe, develop their own blockchains. As recently reported by Cryptopolitan , BitGo said it had confidentially filed for a U.S. listing, joining a wave of firms looking to capitalize on strong market momentum. The crypto sector’s climb to a $4-trillion market value has reignited interest in initial public offerings, with clearer regulation, corporate treasury adoption, and institutional inflows fueling a new wave of new listings. IPO window opens as crypto firms eye U.S. listings Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs, said that these are the best market conditions the crypto space has seen in years, and firms want to take advantage of that. “These startups know that the IPO window can shut unexpectedly, especially in a volatile space like crypto, so they’re looking to strike while the iron’s hot.” Established over ten years ago, BitGo is one of the largest crypto custody firms in the United States. It stores and protects digital assets for clients, which has gained importance as institutional interest in crypto grows. In mid-2023, the company raised $100 million, reaching a valuation of $1.75 billion. The sector’s rapid growth has triggered a wave of IPO activity, with crypto exchange Bullish recently revealing its IPO filings. Meanwhile, crypto asset manager Grayscale and digital exchange Gemini, founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, have also submitted confidential plans to go public. “Many crypto companies have matured. After over a decade, they’ve built stable client bases, some with SaaS-like margins and predictable cash flows,” said Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX.

With ETH holding strong above key support levels, its growing institutional demand and dominance in DeFi and staking, many believe the foundation for a new all-time high is already in place. What Could Derail Ethereum’s Path To A New ATH? In an X post, crypto investor CryptoELITES pointed out that Ethereum is still on track for a new all-time high. The ETH chart is exhibiting a similar pattern to previous cycles, bouncing off a bottom trendline. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Pullback Complete? ETH Set Eyes On 77% Breakout Run If the pattern holds, it implies that Ethereum has re-entered its main growth channel, the very setup that led to explosive rallies in prior cycles. As a result, the expert is confident and predicts that ETH could be headed for a new 2025 all-time high at the top. Emperor, a respected market analyst, has provided a detailed technical update on ETH price action. His analysis focuses on the key levels of support and resistance that are currently dictating the market’s direction, particularly following a period of consolidation. Emperor noted that after reaching its recent ATH, Ethereum’s price entered a phase of consolidation, trading within a specific range. A key resistance level had been holding the price down, but ETH eventually broke above it. However, a recent price move brought ETH back to this same resistance level for a bearish underside retest, which is a common technical event. According to the analysts, the retest confirmed the rejection, where the price did not successfully bounce off the level and has now returned to it. The focus is now on a key support and resistance level that previously acted as resistance during the consolidation. Meanwhile, the market is now looking to see if this level, with confirmation from trading volume, can turn into support. The Trigger For Full Expansion Ethereum has already done the heavy lifting this cycle by breaking above its key range highs around $4,100 and holding that level as support. Daan Crypto Trades, a crypto trader and investor, has revealed that the only remaining level is the 2021 all-time high, which ETH has briefly swept. However, it has not yet been able to go into full price discovery mode. Related Reading: Citi’s Ethereum Forecast: No New All-Time High Expected, Year-End Target At $4,300 Daan emphasizes the importance of the bulls holding the $4,000 to $4,100 level on higher timeframes. He noted that the wicks below are fine, as these can be a normal part of retesting a support level. However, closing below that point would be a bearish sign that could invalidate the current upward momentum. If ETH can clear $5,000 and sustain it, that’s the point where further expansion would begin. Until then, price action remains in the choppy phase.

51900390,583345,1758153656,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Analyst Uses AI To Show How High The XRP Price Will Be If XRP ETFs Are Approved,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-if-etfs-are-approved/,"Crypto analyst Rob Cunningham has used AI to calculate how high the XRP price could be if the XRP ETFs eventually launch. Based on the forecast, the altcoin could rally to as high as $50 solely based on inflows into these funds. How High The XRP Price Could Rise If XRP ETFs Are Approved In an X post , Rob predicted that the XRP price could rally to $50 in the extreme stress case based on the inflows into the XRP ETFs. He also mentioned that a conservative target would be between $8 and $12 within 12 months, while an “aggressive but plausible” target would be between $20 and $30. He revealed that these targets were based on ChatGPT’s forecast of how high the XRP price could rise solely on $17 billion in new ETF purchase demand over the next 12 months. The analyst broke down the framework with which this calculation was made. First, he noted that the float available is 5 billion XRP while the inflow assumption is $17 billion over 12 months. Furthermore, the starting XRP price is $3, and the total float market value is $15 billion. Based on this, Rob remarked that the new demand from the ETFs will exceed the entire float’s value in one year. He further explained that if a buyer commits $17 billion (the XRP ETFs in this case) to buying XRP at $3, then they could purchase 5.7 billion coins. Meanwhile, the float is capped at 5 billion, with the shortage triggering a repricing. The analyst added that the price will continue to rise until the available float satisfies the $17 billion demand. This is what led to the conservative target of $8 to the extreme stress case of $50 for the XRP price. Rob stated that ETFs don’t just absorb liquidity but that they institutionalize demand . With $17 billion committed and such a thin float, the analyst believes that researchers should view a double-digit XRP price (between $10 and $30) as a realistic equilibrium target. Rob added that there is further upside risk if retail and crypto treasuries refuse to sell. Another Parabolic Rally When FOMO Sets In Rob also provided a second scenario, in which XRP records a larger demand as FOMO sets in. He believes this FOMO will come from mainstream banks, RIAs, institutions, and retain investors as the XRP ETFs push the XRP price higher. He noted that the capital base will be larger than the $17 billion that ETFs are projected to bring when the broader financial system joins in. These financial institutions hold and manage trillions of dollars in assets. As such, Rob predicts that even 0.5% of allocation from these firms into XRP will dwarf the XRP ETF inflows . He added that $700 billion could flow into the altcoin from these institutions, which is way above the float of 5 billion coins. In line with this, the analyst asserted that $8 to $30 is likely for the XRP price without FOMO, while broad FOMO could lead to a rally to as high as $150. Lastly, he remarked that a systemic allocation could lead to a rally to as high as $500.",XRP|Altcoin|ChatGPT|fomo|ripple|Rob Cunningham|Spot XRP ETF|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 00:00:56

The image outlined the career of a senior Ripple executive and his prior experience at one of the world’s most influential central banks. This pairing offers an important perspective on Ripple’s positioning within global finance. Ripple Bank of England Documented. pic.twitter.com/pDCiyjyyRs — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 16, 2025 The Profile of Matthew Osborne The image displays a biography of Matthew Osborne, who currently serves as Policy Director for Europe at Ripple. His career trajectory highlights a strong foundation in financial regulation and innovation. Before joining Ripple, Osborne spent significant time at the Bank of England . The document states that he “previously worked at the Bank of England, where he led the payments policy team working on innovations such as stablecoins and distributed ledger technology.” This demonstrates that he was directly involved in shaping policy around technologies that overlap with Ripple’s areas of focus. His experience did not stop at one team. The biography further explains that Osborne held “a number of senior policy roles at the Bank of England and was seconded to NatWest Bank’s global treasury.” This shows depth and range in his involvement with financial institutions, particularly in areas linked to payments, treasury, and policy design. Why This Matters for Ripple and XRP The relevance of Osborne’s background to Ripple’s mission is significant. Ripple positions itself as a provider of XRP-powered digital asset infrastructure to businesses, emphasizing efficient cross-border settlement solutions . A leader in Europe who has previously guided policy efforts at one of the most influential central banks provides Ripple with a high level of credibility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Bank of England has previously explored Ripple’s Interledger Protocol for payments , and Osborne’s work on stablecoins and distributed ledger technology at the Bank of England overlaps with the company’s use of blockchain to facilitate payments and expand financial inclusion. The alignment between Osborne’s past responsibilities and his current role signals expertise that can help bridge the gap between traditional financial institutions and emerging digital asset solutions, and increase XRP’s adoption among these institutions . Having someone who has led a payments policy team at a central bank means Ripple can more effectively engage with regulators and policymakers, ensuring that its offerings are designed within the framework of well-considered regulation. Ripple’s strategy relies on combining innovative technology with regulatory alignment. Matthew Osborne’s career serves as a clear example of how the company is reinforcing its foundation to expand adoption and trust.

The decision, which came on Wednesday, had been widely expected by analysts and marked the second consecutive time policymakers had kept rates unchanged. The move is consistent with the bank’s cautious approach to inflation as they pledged to maintain the rate, a key gauge of short-term health in the economy, at a very low level for an extended period. They held out the possibility of ratcheting it up again should they sense inflationary pressures picking up. The statement underscored the bank’s desire to re-anchor overnight expectations and eventually bring inflation back to its 3% target. The head of the Brazilian central bank, Gabriel Galípolo, emphasized vigilance, adding that monetary policy is the key and first line of defense against inflation, which nobody should expect him to ease quickly. Inflation shows mixed signals Recent data show inflation is beginning to cool, with consumer prices rising 5.13% in the 12 months through August, the second consecutive month of slower gains. Falling electricity and food costs helped ease household expenses, but services inflation remains stubbornly high. Economists warn that consecutive upticks in headline inflation could still unmoor long-term expectations. But inflation remains well above the target, and service prices are still increasing. Economists worry that such back-to-back gains could contribute to long-term inflation expectations. In its survey, Banco de México forecasts inflation will reach 4.83% in 2025 and slow to 4.30% by 2026. Both levels remain above the bank’s target rate of 3 percent, so it has been gun-shy thus far in cutting rates too aggressively. The Brazilian real, which has gained about 5% since the last meeting, also helps curb importing costs. However, worldwide conditions, from commodities to shifts in policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve, jeopardize those plans. Economic growth loses steam Brazil’s economy remains a numbed mess over five months into tightened credit . And with the benchmark interest rate, the Selic, sitting at 15%, borrowing costs for companies and consumers are punishingly high. The effects are beginning to show up in critical economic data. The Brazilian central bank’s closely monitored IBC-Br index, a proxy for gross domestic product, was down 0.5% in July from the previous month. The drop was more than analysts had expected, and it was the third straight month of slowing. But economists said that it is a sign of the way they believe the sharp rate increases during the past year have been squeezing demand and investment. Credit-sensitive sectors like construction, retail, and small business also incur higher borrowing costs. Banks have said they see less demand for new loans, and companies say they are putting off growth plans. Household buying power has stalled, crimping consumer sentiment. Recent indications, however, show Brazil’s labor market has shown surprising resilience despite the drag. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.6 percent in July, the lowest since that indicator began being tracked by the national statistics agency. Wages for workers in the formal economy have been rising at a solid pace, fueled by services and agriculture. Workers’ pay has also surged, adding lift to domestic consumption. This resilience makes the job of the central bank trickier. A robust jobs market, strengthening wages underpinning households’ spending power, and the sales revenues to retail sales data published on Tuesday helped ensure inflationary pressures are still alive despite a broad slackening in overall growth. But if inflation turns out to be sticky, the central bank could be forced to hold rates high even longer, yet crowding out more growth.

However, attention is not only drawn to ETH. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a recent entrant into decentralized finance (DeFi), is drawing attention for its lending and borrowing protocol that offers real-world utility within an increasingly crowded market. Mutuum Finance is worth $0.035 in stage 6 of its presale. The protocol has crossed $15.85 million in funding raised and welcomed more than 16,340 holders. While Ethereum is creating a buzz with price targets, Mutuum Finance is creating a buzz independently as a high-growth project with retail and institutional attention. Ethereum Sees $10,000 Target as Momentum Builds Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $4,531.58 at the moment, with intraday highs of approximately $4,674.50 and intraday lows of $4,510.54. Although the crypto market has experienced volatility, ETH has been resilient with better investor sentiment, especially with risk asset flows being boosted by macroeconomic signals and interest rate expectations. Analysts projecting longer-term prices, such as $10,000, point towards ETH’s dominance in DeFi, increasing adoption of layer-2s, as well as continued network scaling. These factors suggest ETH may have potential for substantial returns, but its massive market cap and competitive landscape can constrain super-fast upside. On the other hand, newcomers like Mutuum Finance are being eyed by some as having more return potential under the same conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Stage 6 Mutuum Finance has already reached phase six of its presale, priced at $0.035 following a 16.17% rise from the previous stage. The market is witnessing record-breaking demand for the project as it has already reached more than 16,340 investors and surpassed $15.85 million. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduced a Bug Bounty Program worth $50,000 USDT for platform security. The bugs have been divided into four levels according to the tag critical, major, minor, and low. Collateralization of Mutuum Finance is capped by asset and differs based on the risk type an asset would take. It encompasses supply capping, collateral and borrowing capping. The protocol hedges the market risk by overcollateralizing the positions. The liquidators are also incentivized for unwinding the undercollateralized trades and thus risky positions are closed in real time. Risk tokens have very little collateral usage but the most correlated tokens are used to their fullest extent so that they can maximize their collateral. They are all used towards insolvency risk reduction in a way that no type of imbalance is created between lending and borrowing in the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to create an active user base with a $100,000 giveaway . Ten individuals will be awarded $10,000 MUTM tokens, rewarding their involvement in the project. Security Framework and Back-up Plan Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an LTV build risk-of-assets based with subjective collateral. Reserve factor added as fall-back and very bad market condition buffer. Reserved back more risk assets in an attempt to offer more security to the protocol and users. Ethereum (ETH) may be targeting $10,000, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investors’ attention with potential for more growth. Stage 6 presale tokens are worth $0.035, with 16,340+ token buyers and over $15.85M raised. With a $50K CertiK bug bounty, solid risk-managed lending habits, and a $100K community giveaway, MUTM delivers security, scalability, and community development. ETH may be the largest altcoin, but MUTM grants early investors a chance to be on a platform that is built to deliver outsized returns. Lock in your Stage 6 tokens today before the next price surge.

51900392,583526,1758157220,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51900392.jpeg,Sui Network Gains Wall Street Attention: Could Google Deal Push SUI Into The Top 10?,https://bitcoinist.com/sui-network-gain-wall-street-attention-could-google/,"Sui Network (SUI) has become one of the first launch partners for Google’s Agentic Payments Protocol (AP2). This open-source standard enables AI-driven agents to perform secure, programmable payments without human intervention. Developed by Mysten Labs, Sui’s Move-based architecture and zkLogin privacy solution made it a natural fit for Google’s initiative . AP2 is already supported by over 60 industry giants, including PayPal, Salesforce, and American Express, signaling its potential to become a cornerstone of automated commerce. By integrating privacy-first identity and programmable transactions, AP2 could improve how AI interacts with payments, from subscriptions and paywalls to real-world purchases, while positioning Sui at the heart of this technological shift. ETF Filings Signal Wall Street’s Growing Interest Adding to the momentum, several ETF issuers have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that include Sui. Among them is Tuttle Capital’s proposed “SUI Income Blast ETF,” designed to give both institutional and retail investors exposure to the token. This move follows a broader wave of crypto ETF filings across assets like Avalanche (AVAX) and Bonk (BONK) , highlighting Wall Street’s increasing appetite for altcoins. Analysts note that infrastructure-focused projects such as Sui and Avax have stronger chances of approval compared to riskier memecoin-linked products. If greenlit, a SUI ETF could channel significant liquidity into the network, bracing demand at a time when adoption of AI-driven payments is expected to accelerate. Price Outlook: Can SUI Break Into the Top 10? SUI currently trades around $3.58, marking steady gains since the Google announcement. Technical analysts point to historically tight Bollinger Bands, a pattern that preceded Sui’s 250% rally in December 2023 and a 404% surge in September 2024. If history repeats, SUI could see a 150–200% breakout, targeting prices between $6 and $8. Market watchers are also considering wider factors, including potential Bitcoin volatility, token unlocks, and regulatory scrutiny over AI-payment integrations. Nevertheless, the rise of Google’s AP2 partnership, ETF filings, and bullish technical signals indicates that Sui could ascend the ranks of major cryptocurrencies. If momentum persists, analysts believe Sui has a real chance of entering the top 10 digital assets by market capitalisation before 2026, boosting its position in AI-driven finance.

The discussion, shared by AllInCrypto (@RealAllinCrypto), centered on Teucrium’s approach to cryptocurrency funds, specifically the company’s 2x long daily XRP ETF, which launched earlier this year . An XRP Enthusiast at the Helm During the interview, Gilbertie confirmed his personal support for the digital asset, stating directly, “I’m an XRP enthusiast.” He explained that Teucrium had previously filed for Bitcoin products and maintained crypto interests, but XRP presented a distinct opportunity. The strategy focused on not holding the token itself but using derivatives to give investors the exposure and leverage they sought. Gilbertie emphasized that the product resonated immediately with the market. He described the launch by noting it was “a big hit immediately right out the door,” highlighting the appetite for leveraged access to XRP among investors. He revealed that he filed for the XRP ETF product immediately when the opportunity was available, and Gilbertie previously revealed that it was the most successful ETF debut in its history .

Instead, he drew attention to the industry shift as a whole. He argued that selecting the next successful cryptocurrency would be difficult, saying “picking the next coin is harder” than many believe. Rather than focusing on speculative picks, he suggested investors should pay attention to how blockchain technology transforms business operations. Ripple has emphasized its pursuit of adoption and utility over short-term price movements, and this approach aligns with Gilbertie’s push for transformative blockchain technology. Gilbertie described the landscape as a “sea change coming,” pointing to the importance of identifying the companies that will successfully adopt and implement cryptocurrency-related technologies. He stressed that success in this sector depends on recognizing utility and innovation rather than chasing names alone.

Gilbertie responded affirmatively without hesitation when asked if there would be an expansion of ETFs tied to companies operating in the cryptocurrency sector. This outlook reflects confidence that financial products linked to cryptocurrency infrastructure will continue to expand. The crypto market is currently anticipating multiple spot XRP ETF decisions in October , and with Teucrium’s XRP ETF already setting company records, institutional investment in the crypto space could explode once the SEC approves these products next month.

While many investors anticipate a strong fourth quarter, Citigroup has issued a tempered outlook, projecting ETH to close the year at $4,300. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Eyes 1,250% Surge To $3.5 – Here’s The Roadmap According to a Reuters report, Citi attributes Ethereum’s demand to the growing adoption of tokenization and stablecoins. However, the bank cautions that much of ETH’s recent price action may be fueled by market sentiment rather than fundamentals. The note highlighted, “Current prices are above activity estimates, potentially driven by buying pressure and excitement over use-cases.” ETH's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview ETF Flows and Diverging Analyst Predictions One of the main concerns weighing on Ethereum’s outlook is ETF activity. Citi expects ETH exchange-traded funds to attract weaker inflows compared to Bitcoin, a factor that could dampen bullish momentum. This comes after recent volatility in spot ETH funds, where inflows briefly returned following weeks of heavy outflows. Interestingly, not all institutions share Citi’s cautious stance. Standard Chartered raised its year-end Ethereum target to $7,500, citing the asset’s stronger position in digital treasuries and staking yields. BlackRock’s $363 million Ethereum purchase has further reinforced confidence in ETH’s long-term value. Ethereum (ETH)’s Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Ahead Citi laid out a range of possible outcomes for Ethereum. In a bullish case, ETH could climb to $6,400, driven by expanding institutional adoption and rising activity across decentralized applications. On the other hand, a bearish scenario projects a sharp drop to $2,200 if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or equity markets face a downturn. Meanwhile, digital asset bank Sygnum has painted a more optimistic picture, pointing to Ethereum upgrades, shrinking exchange reserves, and growing institutional interest as catalysts for a potential supply squeeze. If demand continues to rise under these conditions, ETH could retest its all-time highs faster than expected. Related Reading: Citi’s Ethereum Forecast: No New All-Time High Expected, Year-End Target At $4,300 Ethereum is trading near $4,500, about 8% below its record peak. With institutional demand picking up but ETF flows posing uncertainty, the coming months will be crucial in determining whether ETH leans closer to Citi’s conservative $4,300 call or accelerates toward the bullish $6,400 target.

This significant change paves the way for listing digital assets without individual approvals. The SEC’s decision, which is documented in its filing simplifying the process under Rule 6c-11, particularly relates to stock exchanges like NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX, and Nasdaq. Notably, this has greatly reduced the approval timeframe, which lasted several months. The SEC gives green light to the commodity-based trust’s new generic listing standards In a statement , Paul Atkins, t he US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman, mentioned that their principal aim in approving these general listing standards was to position their capital markets as the most preferred globally for the groundbreaking advancement of digital assets. The chairman further highlighted that this approval facilitates the listing process and reduces obstacles hindering the accessibility of digital asset products in America’s stable capital markets, encouraging innovation and improving investor options. This update was released at a time when applications for Solana , XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin spot ETFs are waiting for the SEC’s approval. Concerning this, the commission faces deadlines starting in October to decide on the situation, along with a few others. In the meantime, for one to be eligible for listing, a crypto spot ETF needs to have a commodity that either trades on a market related to the Intermarket Surveillance Group and has surveillance access, or is connected to a futures contract with an official market listing at a minimum of six months and a deal for sharing surveillance. Another option to qualify for listing is if another ETF already tracks the proposed ETF with no less than 40% exposure. Additionally, the securities regulator stated that it should be listed on a national securities exchange. It is worth noting that when an exchange intends to list and trade ETPs that do not follow the standards set for approved generic listing, it is required to file a rule submission with the SEC. Crypto Analysts such as ETF analyst James Seyffart have viewed this change as a game-changer in the crypto ecosystem. Seyffart stated that this is the kind of crypto ETP framework he has long awaited. Following this, he anticipated that any surge of crypto investment products would be introduced in the US soon. Despite being viewed as a game-changer, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has raised concerns about the new listing standards. Based on her argument, they might raise consumer safety issues by flooding the market with products not been carefully inspected for investor safety. The SEC approves REX-Osprey’s new altcoin exchange-traded funds Reports dated September 16 had highlighted that two new altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to XRP and Dogecoin were set to launch in the US this week. This action revealed that the SEC has recently become more accepting of crypto investment options. This announcement came after REX-Osprey, a fund issuer, informed the public that the REX-Osprey XRP ETF will be launched during the week. Trading under the ticker XRPR, these new US ETFs will be the first in history to grant investors direct accessibility to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The tremendous success followed REX and Osprey’s successful completion of the SEC’s 75-day review period, and they were expected to begin trading on Friday, September 19, if no delays arise. Interestingly, the product will be launched in a simple approval process, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, compared to the previous approval process, the Securities Act of 1933, used for spot Bitcoin ETFs. In contrast to products that directly own the actual asset, the 1940 Act approval process enables the fund to start on its own immediately, 75 days after filing. However, if the commission raises any concerns, this will not occur. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

On Wednesday, the companies announced a deal they described as opening a new chapter in digital commerce driven by artificial intelligence. The collaboration will integrate PayPal checkouts into multiple Google services, such as Google Cloud, Google Ads, and Google Play. PayPal will also handle card processing for Google’s enterprise offerings, so merchants and users can access new forms of payments across Google’s ecosystem. AI agents transform online shopping At the core of the PayPal–Google debate is an audacious new vision for shopping that enables bots to buy stuff on people’s behalf. This vision is supported by Google’s Agent Payments Protocol , or AP2, a framework system that defines the rules and protections of autonomous transactions. AP2 is designed to support AI agents in making decisions on behalf of consumers, while preventing them from falling victim to fraud and loss of control. It depends on “mandates”, digital authorizations that lay out what an AI assistant has the power to do. A mandate could limit weekly spending, authorize only certain purchases like groceries or travel, or require extra verification for high-value items. This way, even though agents act independently, users still retain full control over their money. With AP2 in place, AI agents would go far beyond today’s shopping assistants. Instead of simply scanning shelves, comparing prices, and predicting needs, they could take proactive action. For example, an agent might reorder household essentials before supplies run out, pick a shirt in the right size and style, or schedule a service appointment before the customer even realizes it’s needed. In more complex scenarios, agents could even manage subscriptions, handle investments, or direct funds into digital assets. PayPal’s role is to give AI agents a trusted platform, combining its global payments network and customer insights to strengthen security and personalize recommendations. Chriss said the integration added immediate weight to AP2 through PayPal’s large customer base and established reputation, a signal to merchants and shoppers that the system could be trusted. It also contributes to recognizing a new genre of commerce that we call “agentic commerce” at present. In models like this, humans act as a reference and handle boundary issues — they are expected to be the ones to specify their preferences. Meanwhile, AI bothers to take care of the pain in our neck, esp. browsing, comparing, and purchasing. Supporters say this could save time and eliminate friction, causing the shopping experience to become easier and less painful. But critics caution that it leaves unanswered questions about privacy, overreliance on automation in handling people’s money, and whether consumers might lose touch with how their money is spent. Partnership expands payment options For Google, the partnership is about faster and more reliable payment processing. For PayPal, it’s a way to entrench itself in the world’s largest online marketplaces. PayPal itself is also broadening its embrace of cryptocurrencies. The company envisions a future where AI-driven agents shop for and make payments on users’ behalf, using both fiat and digital currencies . PayPal chief executive Alex Chriss said the partnership was about building the future of commerce, adding that it would be both agentic and crypto-enabled. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the partnership brought together trust and innovation, noting that PayPal would use Google’s AI to deliver personalized, seamless customer experiences while relying on Google Cloud to drive innovation and business growth. AI startup Perplexity, only a few months ago, announced that PayPal would be its choice to fuel agentic commerce on its platform. These initiatives show that PayPal is trying to take a lead position in this new, AI-influenced shopping world. Analysts say the partnership could speed a broader shift in global e-commerce. Instead of shopping by browsing for, clicking on, and purchasing items themselves, consumers will soon be able to delegate the entire purchase journey to AI assistants.

The session was one of the starkest attempts yet to get lawmakers and the crypto industry in the same room to hammer out explicit, bipartisan rules for digital assets in the United States. Hoskinson congratulated Ripple’s representatives, XRP supporters, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) for their contributions in policy negotiations. He noted that Cardano was in full force at the conference and stressed that these conversations were productive and cooperative. Hoskinson said the meeting was fruitful, adding that the conversation went further than previous years, when crypto companies often felt sidelined from regulatory discussions. The founder said that the roundtable was a sign that lawmakers were starting to hear what the industry had to say. Business leaders push for regulatory clarity Hoskinson lauded Ripple and venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) for their active negotiation participation. The CLARITY Act is billed to clarify how digital assets are categorized, while providing transparent market structures and outlining duties for exchanges and issuers. For many, it is the best opportunity in years for the U.S. to move beyond piecemeal policies and toward a more far-reaching law. Recently, lawmakers even linked the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) bill to the CLARITY Act, which clearly indicated how legislators aimed to group together reform initiatives. To crypto enthusiasts worried about overregulating their investments, this move signals increasing political appetite for striking a balance between innovation and investor protection. Ripple’s presence was significant, considering that the company has had a protracted legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of XRP. The company has said that after years of courtroom battles, it is working to help develop clearer rules. A16Z’s move reflects its large financial interest in blockchain, Web3, and beyond, as regulatory choices could directly affect many of its initiatives. Cardano engages directly with regulators That Hoskinson was invited to the Washington round table is a sign that Cardano is serious about getting involved in shaping the future of crypto regulation in the United States. For a long time, digital asset projects have been sidelined in political discourse. Still, Hoskinson’s active participation indicates an initiative to engage policy­makers at the forefront rather than from behind. His update was also intended for Cardano’s supporters around the world. By verifying his participation in the discussions, Hoskinson gave ADA holders confidence that their ecosystem isn’t just building a blockchain; it’s also shaping policy that will impact the entire market. This two-pronged strategy, technology coupled with political work, makes Cardano a builder and a policy shaper. The roundtable also revealed the considerable support coalesced around the CLARITY Act. Eleanor Terrett, a former reporter for FOX Business who has closely tracked the discussions, confirmed that the room featured reps from some of the biggest names in crypto: Coinbase, Kraken, Circle, Paradigm, and Multicoin Capital. Their involvement illustrated high implications for exchanges, stablecoin issuers, venture capital funds, and blockchain projects. The meeting continued for over an hour and focused on the nuts and bolts of the market structure draft. They ranged from how tokens should be categorized, how exchanges would have to address compliance, and what kind of disclosures issuers would need to make. With so many perspectives at the table, lawmakers could listen to how regulatory language might affect real-world operations, from liquidity provision to user safety. Observers noted that this direct exchange between lawmakers and industry leaders was especially valuable. The crypto sector has long complained that U.S. regulators impose rules without understanding their impact on innovation. By inviting firms like Cardano into the conversation, policymakers gained insight into what works on the ground and what risks might emerge from poorly framed rules.

The market reacted quickly. BNB, Binance’s native token, climbed and in some feeds was shown near $962.29 on September 17, 2025, as traders pushed prices higher amid the rumors. Binance In Talks With US Justice Department Reports say Binance is in discussions with the US Justice Department about whether to end the three-year compliance monitor that formed part of its 2023 settlement. If those talks succeed, the monitor could be removed earlier than planned. That 2023 deal included a roughly $4.3 billion settlement and conditions meant to strengthen Binance’s controls. Ending oversight sooner would not automatically mean CZ can resume a top executive job, but it would remove one major obstacle cited by industry watchers. Legal Limits Still In Place According to earlier reporting, CZ’s legal agreements tied to the settlement include limits on his ability to run or manage the exchange for a given period. Those restrictions are a hard constraint until they are changed by a court or by an enforcement agency. Because of that, a full operational comeback as chief executive looks unlikely unless formal legal steps are taken to alter the terms. That point has been made repeatedly by legal analysts in the crypto press. Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Rally Yet? Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025 Public Moves And Treasury Plans Based on reports, CZ has been talking publicly about building the BNB ecosystem and has floated plans tied to a BNB Treasury effort. Those moves are fueling the sense he is preparing to take on a bigger public role, even if it is not the same as running day-to-day operations. Some market watchers say the profile change could be symbolic — meant to reassure traders and investors — rather than the start of a formal return.

VivoPower Doubles Down On XRP The company’s digital-asset arm, Caret Digital, has secured bulk-purchase discounts for additional mining rigs and plans to expand operations, a move it says further improves its unit economics and lowers the effective cost basis of the tokens obtained via token swaps. “Mined tokens will be exchanged into XRP, delivering an effective 65% discount, based on current market prices,” the release states. The mechanics, as described by VivoPower, hinge on a dual-pronged treasury program: first, produce mined tokens through an expanded fleet acquired at negotiated bulk discounts; second, convert those mined tokens into XRP rather than buying it directly in the open market. In parallel, the company says it will continue to seek exposure to Ripple Labs’ equity as part of its strategy to secure XRP-linked assets “at the lowest average cost possible.” VivoPower did not publish a detailed formula for the “effective 65%” figure, but tied the claim to current prices and the economics of mining and procurement. The discount-driven swap strategy is part of a broader corporate transformation in which VivoPower describes itself as “the world’s first XRP-focused digital asset enterprise,” with a mandate to acquire, manage, and hold the token over the long term while supporting ecosystem-based infrastructure and real-world applications. The group operates two business units: Tembo, which develops electric utility vehicles and associated energy solutions, and Caret Digital, which is tasked with power-to-X initiatives including mining. Not Just Purchases VivoPower has layered other initiatives onto this treasury pivot . On September 2, the company announced a definitive agreement with Doppler Finance—a native yield platform backed by ReForge, DCG and other Ripple-affiliated entities—to deploy an initial $30 million of XRP in staged tranches. The program is positioned as a “regenerative loop,” with yields reinvested back into reserves to compound the treasury over time. “By harnessing Doppler Finance’s programmable infrastructure, we can put reserves to work while retaining XRP as our cornerstone treasury asset,” Executive Chairman and CEO Kevin Chin said in the statement. A week later, on September 8, VivoPower’s Tembo subsidiary said it would accept Ripple USD (RLUSD) for customer and partner payments—citing near-instant settlement and lower costs versus traditional cross-border bank transfers. The company framed RLUSD acceptance as both operationally pragmatic for its global footprint and strategically aligned with its treasury plan, noting RLUSD’s issuance on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Taken together, the mining-to-swap channel, the Doppler yield deployment, and RLUSD integration sketch a cohesive playbook: reduce the acquisition cost via mining and procurement discounts, generate yield on held tokens within an institutional framework, and deepen real-economy ties to the ecosystem through stablecoin-based payments. While the “up to 65%” effective discount claim is explicitly forward-looking and contingent on market conditions, VivoPower intends to load up on XRP—by producing and swapping rather than simply buying.

Squire was clear in his assessment of what such a development would mean, describing the potential effect as a “liquidity tsunami” that could put XRP in a position of strength. In the video, Marszalek outlined his perspective on the state of digital assets and the role of exchange-traded funds. He noted that certain altcoins with strong flows are likely to outperform in the coming years. Turning to XRP specifically, he referenced forecasts suggesting that a dedicated ETF could attract $8 billion of inflows next year.

Large inflows of this kind would mark a substantial expansion of institutional access to XRP and potentially provide liquidity depth that could influence trading dynamics. Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg has also predicted that spot XRP ETFs could see inflows of $5 billion in the first month , suggesting even greater capital will come into the XRP market and a more positive impact on the digital asset’s price. These inflows would also represent a massive institutional interest in regulated XRP-related products and present a key point for market participants to watch as upcoming regulatory decisions unfold. ETF Decisions on the Horizon Attention now shifts to the coming months, with several spot XRP ETF applications scheduled for SEC decisions in October . Filings from companies including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital are expected to be addressed during the latter half of the month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Polymarket has set the odds of ETF approval at 94% and the community sees these decisions as pivotal for XRP’s next stage of market development, potentially opening the door for institutional participation at scale. The timing of these decisions gives weight to Marszalek’s forecast. The market remains attentive to how the SEC will respond to the applications and whether the projected inflows can materialize if approvals are granted. Experts have predicted double-digit targets for XRP after these investment products are approved, and market participants are eager to engage with them. For now, the conversation highlights both the anticipation around XRP’s regulatory moment and the role industry leaders see for the asset in shaping the next phase of crypto investment.

The decision, approved by 11 of 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reflects signs of slowing job growth, higher unemployment, and persistent inflation. This is the Fed’s fourth cut since late 2024, with two more expected before the end of 2025. President Donald Trump has repeatedly pressured the central bank for more aggressive action, even suggesting removing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Earlier this week, Trump said the Fed should cut “bigger than Powell had in mind.” Lower rates generally make traditional investments less attractive, pushing investors toward alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies . Analysts believe the extra liquidity could boost trading in Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and other tokens. However, market reactions may depend on how dovish or cautious the Fed’s outlook appears in its dot plot. Meanwhile, the Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, a crypto-friendly economist, to the Federal Reserve Board. He had pushed for a larger 50bps cut.

The service lets users buy, sell and hold crypto inside their bank account, with trading available for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Polygon and Cardano. Based on reports , the bank plans to make the offering available in Spain within weeks and to roll it out to other EU countries later this year. Santander Expands Crypto Access The new feature is built into Openbank’s investment platform so customers do not need to move money to an outside exchange. According to the bank, users can trade coins from the same app where they manage other accounts. Openbank, Banco Santander’s online bank, has started offering retail crypto trading, the latest move by a major European lender into the asset class https://t.co/IcozNgW1at — Bloomberg (@business) September 16, 2025 The initial list includes five major tokens, chosen for liquidity and demand, while a broader menu of assets is expected in future updates. Trading Costs And Custody Rules Reports have disclosed the buy and sell fee is 1.49% per transaction, with a minimum charge of €one per operation. There are no custody fees for holding assets on the platform, the bank says. For casual investors who plan to buy and hold, that no-holding-fee model may be attractive. Heavy traders, though, may find the 1.49% cost higher than some dedicated crypto exchanges. Rollout Timeline And Limits Openbank’s launch began in Germany. Based on reports, Spain will follow in the coming weeks, and broader EU availability is planned later in the year. The bank has indicated that it will add additional cryptocurrencies in the future and potentially offer crypto-to-crypto conversion at some point. Currently, the service is all about fiat-to-crypto direct trades and a limited selection of well-known coins. Regulatory And Compliance Notes The product is covered under the European Markets in Crypto-Assets regime, or MiCA, which provides rules for crypto services within the EU. The bank will implement KYC and AML processes applicable to regulated financial institutions, reports add. That means customers can expect identity checks and standard anti-money-laundering controls when they sign up to trade. Why It Matters For Customers This move brings crypto trading into the mainstream banking app for retail users. Reports have disclosed that traditional banks adding crypto features can make it easier for everyday savers to try these assets without opening accounts on unfamiliar platforms. At the same time, the limited initial token list and the fee level mean serious crypto users might still prefer specialist exchanges for low fees or access to many smaller tokens. Santander’s digital unit has said it will expand the service and widen the asset list. Based on reports, the bank aims to balance regulated oversight with easier access for retail clients. Observers will be watching how pricing, supported tokens and country-by-country rollout play out in the months ahead.

Hype: Analyst Examines XRP Supply Shock Theory,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/facts-vs-hype-xrp-supply-shock-theory/,"Prominent analyst Cheeky Crypto (203,000 followers on YouTube) set out to verify a fast-spreading claim that XRP’s circulating supply could “vanish overnight,” and his conclusion is more nuanced than the headline suggests: nothing in the ledger disappears, but the amount of XRP that is truly liquid could be far smaller than most dashboards imply—small enough, in his view, to set the stage for an abrupt liquidity squeeze if demand spikes. XRP Supply Shock? The video opens with the host acknowledging his own skepticism—“I woke up to a rumor that XRP supply could vanish overnight. Sounds crazy, right?”—before committing to test the thesis rather than dismiss it. He frames the exercise as an attempt to reconcile a long-standing critique (“XRP’s supply is too large for high prices”) with a rival view taking hold among prominent community voices: that much of the supply counted as “circulating” is effectively unavailable to trade. His first step is a straightforward data check. Pulling public figures, he finds CoinMarketCap showing roughly 59.6 billion XRP as circulating, while XRPScan reports about 64.7 billion. The divergence prompts what becomes the video’s key methodological point: different sources count “circulating” differently. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Major XRP Warning: Last Chance To Get In As Accumulation Balloons As he explains it, the higher on-ledger number likely includes balances that aggregators exclude or treat as restricted, most notably Ripple’s programmatic escrow. He highlights that Ripple still “holds a chunk of XRP in escrow, about 35.3 billion XRP locked up across multiple wallets, with a nominal schedule of up to 1 billion released per month and unused portions commonly re-escrowed. Those coins exist and are accounted for on-ledger, but “they aren’t actually sitting on exchanges” and are not immediately available to buyers. In his words, “for all intents and purposes, that escrow stash is effectively off of the market.” From there, the analysis moves from headline “circulating supply” to the subtler concept of effective float. Beyond escrow, he argues that large strategic holders—banks, fintechs, or other whales—may sit on material balances without supplying order books. When you strip out escrow and these non-selling stashes, he says, “the effective circulating supply… is actually way smaller than the 59 or even 64 billion figure.” He cites community estimates in the “20 or 30 billion” range for what might be truly liquid at any given moment, while emphasizing that nobody has a precise number. That effective-float framing underpins the crux of his thesis: a potential supply shock if demand accelerates faster than fresh sell-side supply appears. “Price is a dance between supply and demand,” he says; if institutional or sovereign-scale users suddenly need XRP and “the market finds that there isn’t enough XRP readily available,” order books could thin out and prices could “shoot on up, sometimes violently.” His phrase “circulating supply could collapse overnight” is presented not as a claim that tokens are destroyed or removed from the ledger, but as a market-structure scenario in which available inventory to sell dries up quickly because holders won’t part with it. How Could The XRP Supply Shock Happen? On the demand side, he anchors the hypothetical to tokenization. He points to the “very early stages of something huge in finance”—on-chain tokenization of debt, stablecoins, CBDCs and even gold—and argues the XRP Ledger aims to be “the settlement layer” for those assets.He references Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s earlier comments about an XRPL pivot toward tokenized assets and notes that an institutional research shop (Bitwise) has framed XRP as a way to play the tokenization theme. In his construction, if “trillions of dollars in value” begin settling across XRPL rails, working inventories of XRP for bridging, liquidity and settlement could rise sharply, tightening effective float. Related Reading: XRP Bearish Signal: Whales Offload $486 Million In Asset To illustrate, he offers two analogies. First, the “concert tickets” model: you think there are 100,000 tickets (100B supply), but 50,000 are held by the promoter (escrow) and 30,000 by corporate buyers (whales), leaving only 20,000 for the public; if a million people want in, prices explode. Second, a comparison to Bitcoin’s halving: while XRP has no programmatic halving, he proposes that a sudden adoption wave could function like a de facto halving of available supply—“XRP’s version of a halving could actually be the adoption event.” He also updates the narrative context that long dogged XRP. Once derided for “too much supply,” he argues the script has “totally flipped.” He cites the current cycle’s optics—“XRP is sitting above $3 with a market cap north of around $180 billion”—as evidence that raw supply counts did not cap price as tightly as critics claimed, and as a backdrop for why a scarcity narrative is gaining traction. Still, he declines to publish targets or timelines, repeatedly stressing uncertainty and risk. “I’m not a financial adviser… cryptocurrencies are highly volatile,” he reminds viewers, adding that tokenization could take off “on some other platform,” unfold more slowly than enthusiasts expect, or fail to get to “sudden shock” scale. The verdict he offers is deliberately bound. The theory that “XRP supply could vanish overnight” is imprecise on its face; the ledger will not erase coins. But after examining dashboard methodologies, escrow mechanics and the behavior of large holders, he concludes that the effective float could be meaningfully smaller than headline supply figures, and that a fast-developing tokenization use case could, under the right conditions, stress that float. “Overnight is a dramatic way to put it,” he concedes. “The change could actually be very sudden when it comes.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.0198.

ETH is now showing positive signs and might attempt to clear the $4,680 resistance. Ethereum is now recovering higher above the $4,550 zone. The price is trading above $4,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $4,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it settles above $4,640 and $4,700. Ethereum Price Eyes Steady Increase Ethereum price extended losses below $4,550 before the bulls appeared, like Bitcoin . ETH price tested the $4,415 zone and recently started a recovery wave. The price climbed above the $4,500 and $4,520 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,765 swing high to the $4,416 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $4,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,635 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,765 swing high to the $4,416 low. The next key resistance is near the $4,680 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,720 level. A clear move above the $4,720 resistance might send the price toward the $4,750 resistance. An upside break above the $4,750 hurdle might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,850 resistance zone or even $4,880 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,680 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,580 level. The first major support sits near the $4,535 zone. A clear move below the $4,535 support might push the price toward the $4,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,420 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,350.

OFAC Sanctions Iranian Nationals According to the Tuesday press release , Iranian nationals Alireza Derakhshan and Arash Estaki Alivand “used a network of front companies in multiple foreign jurisdictions” to transfer the digital assets. OFAC alleges that Alivand and Derakhshan’s transfers also involved the sale of Iranian oil that benefited Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) and the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL). IRGC-QF and MODAFL then used the proceeds to support regional proxy terrorist organizations and strengthen their advanced weapons systems, including ballistic missiles. U.S. officials say the move targets shadow banking in the region, where illicit financial actors use overseas money laundering and digital assets to evade sanctions. “Iranian entities rely on shadow banking networks to evade sanctions and move millions through the international financial system,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we will continue to disrupt these key financial streams that fund Iran’s weapons programs and malign activities in the Middle East and beyond,” he continued. Dozens Designated In Shadow Banking Scandal Both Alivand and Derakhshan have been designated “for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of the IRGC-QF.” In addition to Alivand and Derakhshan, OFAC has sanctioned more than a dozen Hong Kong and United Arab Emirates-based entities and individuals tied to the network. According to the press release, the sanctioned entities may face civil or criminal penalties imposed as a result.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $853.93. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,280.9 to $1,387.64. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $309 Market cap $4.70B Trading volume (24-h) $453.41M Circulating supply 15.22M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $309.31 24-hour high $292.05 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.94% 50-day SMA $302.65 14-Day RSI 49.13 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 52 (Neutral) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $249.73 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE rebounded from $291 to $308 but stalled under $310 resistance. The daily trend remains weak, but the short-term momentum is improving. A break above $312 could fuel a push to $325. Aave 1-day price chart As of September 18, AAVE is trading around $308, clawing back after dipping to the lower Bollinger Band near $291. The bounce has brought AAVE back toward the mid-band resistance at $307.9, which is also lining up as a key price level. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The next ceiling is at the upper band around $324.7, but buyers have yet to show the conviction needed to challenge it. The MACD remains in bearish territory, an indication that the broader trend still leans downward, even as the immediate selling pressure fades. AAVE’s daily volume is steady at $38M, though not strong enough to confirm a full reversal just yet. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, AAVE has recovered from $292 to $309, cutting through short-term moving averages near $300. Momentum has improved, with the RSI climbing to 59, though it sits close to overbought territory and may cool if buying stalls. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Immediate resistance is stacked at $310–$312, while support has shifted up to $300. A failure to break higher would invite another pullback toward $295, but a clean move above $312 could open a path to $325. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $306.58 BUY SMA 5 $305.58 BUY SMA 10 $313.88 SELL SMA 21 $308.93 BUY SMA 50 $302.65 BUY SMA 100 $292.83 BUY SMA 200 $249.73 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $308.91 BUY EMA 5 $311.90 SELL EMA 10 $314.98 SELL EMA 21 $312.27 SELL EMA 50 $301.38 BUY EMA 100 $283.51 BUY EMA 200 $258.89 BUY AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is showing signs of recovery, but the rally is fragile. Bulls need to clear $310 convincingly to push further. If they succeed, price could build toward $325, but another rejection would leave the token stuck in its broader range and vulnerable to another dip. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. It’s AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken, and KuCoin also support AAVE. Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave has proven itself to be one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in DeFi over the years. It’s not just surviving, it’s evolving, with features like the GHO stablecoin and multichain support keeping it ahead of the curve. If DeFi continues to grow and mature, Aave isn’t just likely to stick around; it’ll probably be one of the key players shaping the future.

Here’s What Is Next,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-explains-xrp-cross-and-push-strategy-heres-what-is-next/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has shared an XRP-based thread titled “Cross and Push,” in which he explained step by step how he constructed his technical analysis and anticipated XRP’s recent moves. His approach centers on the concept of a “cross and push,” which refers to the bullish cross between moving averages followed by sustained upward momentum. According to Egrag, this cross was achieved between the 21 SMA and 100 SMA in early August, creating the conditions for a potential breakout scenario. He noted that the analysis began with identifying the descending channel on the four-hour timeframe and projecting how price action would behave along its upper edge. The idea of the “cross and push” was based on the expectation that once the moving averages aligned, XRP could retest and eventually break through the top boundary of this channel. #XRP Cross & Push ( What's Next): Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how I built my analysis and anticipated the upcoming move under the post Titled "" Cross & Push) Go through the thread and take a look! and get into the details and explore what’s likely to happen… pic.twitter.com/wTuisEjziF — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 16, 2025 Ascending Triangle and Measured Move Egrag outlined the presence of an ascending triangle structure and explained how it ties into his broader framework. He described this as part of the measured move that often follows such a formation, stressing that he had anticipated the setup before it was clearly visible. The retest of the breakout is occurring as expected, though he explained that due to the slope of the descending channel, the level of the retest is lower than the initial breakout. He underlined that this is normal technical behavior and does not invalidate the broader bullish thesis. In the process of building this outlook, Egrag emphasized how the 100 EMA and the upper edge of the channel were acting as important guides. These elements confirmed that the “cross and push” had indeed taken place and could serve as the foundation for the next phase of price action. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Critical Price Levels Ahead Egrag stated that he originally looked at $3.02 as a key level to hold, but it did not maintain support. He explained that the immediate objective is to secure a close above $3.02 as the first sign of renewed strength. From there, $3.07 becomes the next level to watch, with $3.13 identified as an important confirmation target. A move through these levels would strengthen the bullish case and validate the breakout from the channel. At the same time, Egrag acknowledged the possibility of a bearish cross if these conditions are not met. Under that scenario, XRP could retrace toward $2.65, a downside level he highlighted. He also noted that while some market participants are looking ahead to potential rate cuts, markets often respond in unexpected ways, which could influence XRP’s short-term direction. The central point of Egrag’s post is that the “cross and push” strategy has been successfully identified and that XRP is now at a decisive stage. Sustaining closes above $3.07 and $3.13 would confirm strength, while failure to achieve these levels could result in continued movement along the descending channel. His structured breakdown highlights both the progress already made and the conditions required for XRP to move higher .

Key Principles For UK Crypto Trading Platforms The FCA has recently published a consultation outlining minimum standards that could potentially waive four crucial principles for crypto asset trading platforms. These principles mandate that firms operate with integrity, exercise skill and diligence, prioritize customer interests, and ensure that the advice and discretionary decisions provided to customers are appropriate. David Geale, the FCA’s Executive Director of Payments and Digital Finance, emphasized the regulator’s intention to cultivate a sustainable and competitive crypto sector. He stated, “We want to balance innovation, market integrity, and trust.” While acknowledging that these proposals will not eliminate the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, Geale noted they would help firms establish common standards, offering consumers clearer expectations. In light of recent events, such as the $1.5 billion hack of Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit in February, the FCA is also advocating for stricter operational risk management protocols. Talks To Shape Future Regulatory Framework The FCA is also seeking feedback on whether the consumer duty—which mandates that firms prioritize their customers—should apply to digital asset firms. Additionally, discussions are underway regarding customer access to the Financial Ombudsman Service for potential compensation. Charles Kerrigan, a partner and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist at law firm CMS, suggested that it is likely the consumer duty will apply once crypto assets are integrated into the broader regulatory framework. Interestingly, digital asset adoption among the British public is on the rise, with recent government statistics indicating that approximately 12% of adults own or have owned currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), a significant increase from just 4% in 2021. The FCA’s proposals come after the UK signaled its intention to collaborate with the US on crypto. Recent discussions between UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have reportedly set the stage for a significant agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in the cryptocurrency sector. The meeting included representatives from major digital asset companies like Coinbase (COIN), Circle (CRCL), and Ripple, as well as US banking institutions such as Citigroup and Bank of America. The urgency of these discussions was prompted by a letter from crypto industry groups urging the UK government to prioritize digital assets and blockchain in any new trade arrangements with the US.

The tokens were moved off Binance, OKX, Coinbase and Bybit into wallets linked to the brokerage, reports have disclosed. Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Rally Yet? Analyst Projects $20+ In October 2025 FalconX Withdrawals Raise Eyebrows Blockchain trackers flagged the transfers as significant because they happened across multiple venues in a short window. FalconX is the largest digital asset prime brokerage, the company’s website shows. Lookonchain and other analytics firms have flagged the pattern as consistent with institutional activity, where assets are moved into custody or cold storage rather than kept on exchange accounts ready for sale. Large withdrawals cut the pool of SOL sitting on exchanges. That matters because less exchange supply can tighten available coins for buyers, especially if demand holds or rises. Traders watch that metric closely. It is one of several data points that can change short-term odds for price swings. Looks like another institution is buying massive $SOL. In the past 8 hours, #FalconX has withdrawn 413,075 $SOL($98.4M) from #Binance, #OKX, #Coinbase, and #Bybit.https://t.co/BbJHB6YKtf pic.twitter.com/BibDGcoD3x — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 17, 2025 Analysts Note Caution On Attribution Based on reports, the wallets involved have been attributed to FalconX, a known institutional broker, but such labels are built from analysis of patterns, prior transfers, and public filings. What This Could Mean For Solana’s Price A withdrawal of roughly $98.4 million worth of SOL can add upward pressure if buyers keep coming. Less supply on exchanges tends to reduce immediate sell liquidity. If demand spikes, prices can react sharply. That said, price depends on many things: order book depth, macro drivers, derivatives flows and how other large holders behave. Market analysts tend to associate large exchange outflows with probable accumulation phases. For Solana, a move of this magnitude illustrates how institutional custody activity can affect views on short-term availability and supply. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Target $8,500 With Big Money Backing The Move – Details The scale and timing of FalconX’s activity guarantee that traders will be looking closely at order books over the next few days. Historical evidence also indicates that large withdrawals of tokens occasionally lead to heightened market activity. If transfers of this nature keep going ahead, Solana’s on-exchange liquidity profile may get tighter still, setting the stage for price to respond more rapidly to trading volume. In the meantime, attention is centered on how market demand compares to this diminished on-exchange supply.

The agreement aims to establish Da Nang as an international financial center by providing market liquidity and a secure financial infrastructure. The partnership follows previous talks between Bybit and Vietnam’s Ministry of Finance on regulatory sandboxes. Bybit has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Da Nang’s People’s Committee, Abu Dhabi Blockchain Center (ADBC), and Verichains Network Security Company. The partnership aims to establish Da Nang as an international financial and innovation center. Da Nang is one of Vietnam’s largest cities and a major economic zone. The MOU approves a blockchain sandbox in the city, allowing it to test progressive policies and international cooperation in digital assets. The parties will work together to support the city’s establishment as an international financial center (IFC). The collaboration aims to establish Da Nang as an international financial center From left to right: Mr. Abdulla Al Dhaheri, CEO of Abu Dhabi Blockchain Center; Helen Liu, Co-CEO, Bybit; Mr. Ho Ky Minh, Permanent Vice Chairman of the Da Nang People’s Committee; and Mr. Nguyen Le Thanh, Founder and CEO of Verichains Establishing Da Nang city as an international financial center has centered on three pillars: digital asset liquidity to connect Da Nang with global financial markets, ecosystem connectivity to link Vietnam and other leading financial hubs, and support for a risk-controlled environment for blockchain innovation. The agreement acts as a bridge between the national strategies and local implementations, ensuring the IFC model is adopted with minimal risk to the digital economy. The People’s Committee of Da Nang will provide the administrative ground for the other parties to operate. The parties will invest, open offices, and integrate their operations into the IFC. Bybit and its partners, on the other hand, will provide guidance on digital assets and blockchain policy, international best practices, and assist Da Nang in building a regulatory framework. Helen Liu, Co-CEO of Bybit, revealed that the agreement aligns with Vietnam’s momentum in digital transformation. “ Vietnam is an inspiring example of a nation embracing digital transformation, and we are honored to contribute to its journey. Bybit is committed to sharing our global expertise in blockchain and digital asset innovation to support Da Nang’s vision of becoming an IFC.” Helen Liu- Bybit Co-CEO She acknowledged that the partnership reflects their belief in building sustainable ecosystems with the governments, institutions, and trusted partners. In April, Bybit Co-founder Ben Zhou met with Nguyen Van Thang, the finance minister in Hanoi. The officials discussed the regulatory sandbox plan and other initiatives, including creating a safe, transparent, and innovative digital asset market. They also addressed pilot mechanisms for issuing and trading crypto assets under controlled environments. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements were proposed to enhance investor protection and financial security. Vietnam sets stage for 150,000 crypto startups by 2035 The latest partnership positions Bybit as a trusted long-term partner in Vietnam’s digital transformation. Da Nang now has the ground set to attract international investors, foster an innovation-friendly regulatory landscape, and connect with international financial systems. Cryptopolitan reported on KuCoin entering the Vietnamese market two weeks ago via a MOU with the Blockchain and Digital Assets Association (VBA) and 1Matrix Joint Stock Company. The KuCoin partnership aimed to push blockchain innovation, digital asset adoption, and improve regulatory compliance in the country. The partnership introduced pilot projects in payments, identity management, trading platforms, and risk management systems that are aligned with international standards. Damen Chen, Vice President of KuCoin, pointed out the youthful population of Vietnam, highlighting their tech-driven nature as a catalyst for blockchain adoption. Last week, Vietnam approved a five-year pilot programme for crypto trading. According to a Cryptopolitan report published last week, the programme requires all exchanges to be domestically owned and operate exclusively in the country, restricting crypto issuance to Vietnamese companies. The framework sets strict requirements for exchanges to prevent external entities from taking control of licensed platforms. The developments come ahead of Vietnam’s preparation to enforce its digital technology law in January 2026, which targets 150,000 crypto startups by 2035.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-18 04:02:33

The price is now showing positive signs and might gain pace if it clears the $3.120 zone. XRP price is moving higher from the $2.980 support zone. The price is now trading above $3.020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a rising channel with resistance at $3.070 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the price clears the $3.120 zone. XRP Price Attempts Fresh Increase XRP price extended losses below $3.00 before the bulls appeared, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price tested the $2.980 zone and recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $3.00 and $3.020 levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.185 swing high to the $2.957 low. Besides, there was a break above a rising channel with resistance at $3.070 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $3.080 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls protect the $3.050 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.10 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.185 swing high to the $2.957 low. The first major resistance is near the $3.120 level. A clear move above the $3.120 resistance might send the price toward the $3.20 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.2320 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $3.120 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.070 level. The next major support is near the $3.040 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $3.040 level, the price might continue to decline toward $3.00.

Exchange supply ratio falls to record lows, signaling reduced sell pressure compared to earlier market cycles. Binance ETH open interest drops an average 15%, aligning with spot price corrections near 11% recently. Ethereum Price Holds Within Range Ethereum (ETH) is trading at around $4,500 with a 24-hour trading volume of $32.4 billion. The asset has slipped slightly in the past day but is still up 4% over the week. Despite these moves, ETH remains locked in a range, with the all-time high near $4,900 forming the top and $4,000 acting as key support. The ETH/USDT 2-hour chart shows sideways action after the recent sweep of the ATH. Crypto Bully described ETH as “lacklustre since the ATH sweep,” adding that the market looks like a range “unless either of the levels is broken.” Meanwhile, the price has dropped under the Monday low and is moving closer to the monthly open, pointing to short-term weakness. Even so, the wider range stays intact while ETH trades above $4,000. Short-term levels, such as the weekly open and Monday high, continue to cap any upside. $ETH has been lacklustre since the ATH sweep Broadly in a range between the ATH and the $4k level, so you have to treat it like a range and look for buys at the lows and sell at the highs, no major development in my opinion unless either of the level is broken. Looking to… pic.twitter.com/lRnnKrZ68W — Crypto Bully (@BullyDCrypto) September 16, 2025 Crypto Bully also flagged $4,100 to $4,200 as an area of interest. The analyst warned that “invalidation is price acceptance below $4k; if that happens, we’re in for a deeper correction.” For now, conditions remain sideways, with no major breakout in sight. Long-Term Cycle Outlook CryptoELlTES shared a longer-term chart tracking Ethereum’s price history across cycles. The chart shows ETH hitting the top of a rising channel at the 2017 and 2021 peaks, while cycle lows formed along the lower boundary. Notably, ETH has recently rebounded from this lower boundary and moved back into the main channel. If the pattern repeats, ETH could be on track for a new ATH in 2025 near the top of the channel. That projection points to a possible range of $15,000 to $20,000, though this depends on whether the channel holds as it has in previous cycles. Source: CryptoELlTES/X Exchange Supply and Open Interest Trends On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that the share of ETH held on exchanges has been falling since 2020. The Exchange Supply Ratio has dropped from over 0.30 to about 0.14 this year. In past cycles, the ratio was much higher and lined up with market peaks. The current cycle is unfolding with the lowest levels on record, pointing to reduced supply on exchanges and more ETH in long-term storage. Source: CryptoQuant Derivatives data adds another layer. Binance ETH open interest (OI) has seen repeated drops over the last three months, averaging 15%. These moves in OI matched spot price corrections of around 11%. This shows that OI trends have been a useful signal for spotting local corrections.

Any more gains might call for a test of the $1,150 zone in the near term. Downside Correction? If BNB fails to clear the $995 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $980 level. The next major support is near the $970 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $948 swing low to the $995 high. The main support sits at $960. If there is a downside break below the $960 support, the price could drop toward the $940 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $920 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $970 and $960. Major Resistance Levels – $995 and $1,000.",BNB|Binance Coin|BNB Price|bnbbtc|BNBUSD|bnbusdt,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-09-18 04:28:37

On Wednesday, the regulator voted to let Nasdaq, Cboe BZX and NYSE Arca adopt generic listing standards for commodity-based trust shares. The decision clears the final hurdle for asset managers seeking to launch spot ETFs tied to cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ether . In July, the SEC outlined how exchanges could bring new products to market under the framework. Asset managers and exchanges must now meet specific criteria, but will no longer need to undergo drawn-out case-by-case reviews. Solana And XRP Funds Seen to Be First In Line Under the new system, the time from filing to launch can shrink to as little as 75 days, compared with up to 240 days or more under the old rules. “This is the crypto ETP framework we’ve been waiting for,” Bloomberg research analyst James Seyffart said on X , predicting a wave of new products in the coming months. WOW. The SEC has approved Generic Listing Standards for ""Commodity Based Trust Shares"" aka includes crypto ETPs. This is the crypto ETP framework we've been waiting for. Get ready for a wave of spot crypto ETP launches in coming weeks and months. pic.twitter.com/xDKCuj41mc — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 17, 2025 The first filings likely to benefit are those tracking Solana and XRP , both of which have sat in limbo for more than a year. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the approval reflects a commitment to reduce barriers and foster innovation while maintaining investor protections. The move comes under the administration of President Donald Trump, which has signaled strong support for digital assets after years of hesitation during the Biden era. New Standards Replace Lengthy Reviews And Repeated Denials Until now, the commission reviewed each application separately, requiring one filing from the exchange and another from the asset manager. This dual process often dragged on for months and led to repeated denials. Even Bitcoin spot ETFs, finally approved in Jan. 2024, arrived only after years of resistance and a legal battle with Grayscale. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the streamlined rules could apply to any cryptocurrency with at least six months of futures trading on the Coinbase Derivatives Exchange. That means more than a dozen tokens may now qualify for listing, potentially unleashing a new wave of altcoin ETFs. SEC Clears Grayscale Large Cap Fund Tracking CoinDesk 5 Index The SEC also approved the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which tracks the CoinDesk 5 Index, including Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana and Cardano. Alongside this, it cleared the launch of options linked to the Cboe Bitcoin US ETF Index and its mini contract, broadening the set of crypto-linked derivatives on regulated US markets. Analysts say the shift shows how far US policy has moved. Where once regulators resisted digital assets, the latest changes show a growing willingness to bring them into the mainstream financial system under established safeguards.

Reports have disclosed the move as the next step in bringing the company’s large ether holdings onto public markets. Draft Filing Ties To Dynamix Merger According to filings and company posts, the S-4 is linked to a business combination between The Ether Machine and Dynamix that was first announced in July. The merged entity would trade under the ticker ETHM when the deal closes, which market watchers expect to occur in Q4 2025 if shareholders and regulators approve the transaction. The company said it has engaged a Big Four auditor to bolster its financial reporting as it prepares for public scrutiny. As of today, we have confidentially filed our S-4 with the SEC. We’re shifting into the next gear, and officially on its path to full public form “The submission of our Form S-4 is a critical step towards becoming a publicly traded Ethereum company. We have also retained… — The Ether Machine (@TheEtherMachine) September 16, 2025 The Firm’s Ether Hoard And Recent Financing Based on reports , The Ether Machine now holds roughly 495,362 ETH, a stash valued at about $2.16 billion at recent prices, and has set aside roughly $367 million in cash to buy more ether. The company also recently secured a $654 million commitment in a private financing round tied to a 150,000 ETH in-kind investment, a deal that brought a new board member to the firm. Those moves have helped push the company’s balance sheet toward what backers call institutional-grade exposure to ether. Funding Push And Big Investors Reports have identified major crypto names among the backers. Investors such as Blockchain.com, Kraken and Pantera Capital participated in earlier financing, and organizers expect to raise more than $1.6 billion in the Nasdaq listing effort. The Ether Machine is also lining up additional capital, with Citibank said to be leading a third fundraising round that may target at least $500 million. Those inputs matter because they will shape how much ether the public company starts its life with on the books. Market Reaction Market response to the deal was swift when it was first revealed: Dynamix stock jumped sharply in premarket trading after the merger was announced. If the combination completes, The Ether Machine would become one of the largest publicly visible holders of ether, offering investors a way to gain regulated equity exposure to the token rather than buying it directly.

Analyst Flags Drop In Binance Open Interest,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-bottom-analyst-binance-open-interest/,"After failing to hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $5,000 in August 2025, Ethereum (ETH) may finally be ready to breach the psychologically important price level. A decline in Binance open interest suggests that ETH is likely close to a local bottom, ready for its next leg up. Ethereum Open Interest Declines, Is Local Bottom Close? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, Ethereum may be nearing a local bottom. The analyst referred to the Binance ETH open interest (OI) hourly timeframe metric for their analysis. Related Reading: Ethereum Marches Upward Without Leverage Overheating – Sign Of Structural Health? In their analysis, burakkesmeci noted that according to the Binance ETH OI metric, local bottoms have formed with an average decline of 14.9% over the past three months. On the spot market side, these corrections have typically resulted in an average 10.7% decline. The analyst said that drops in ETH OI have usually signaled spot price corrections ahead of time. For example, on August 17, the Binance ETH OI decreased from $11.4 billion to $10.2 billion, representing a 10.52% drop. Similarly, on August 20, the Binance ETH OI tumbled from $13 billion to $9.7 billion, a correction of 25.38%. The latest major tumble in Binance ETH OI was observed on September 13, when it crashed from $11.39 billion to $10.4 billion. The analyst concluded: So, we can say this: when spot price rallies are supported by the futures side, the trend progresses more healthily – just like a plane flying with two wings. In the opposite scenario, OI signals potential corrections. Binance ETH OI (measured on the highest-volume exchange, acting as a leading indicator) gives us a chance to catch local bottoms early. The analyst added that based on the recent trends, it can be speculated that the Binance ETH OI may dwindle to $9.69 billion. It also suggests that ETH is currently in the local bottom zone. However, the ETH price may fall further before it finds its local bottom. Is ETH Eyeing $6,800? Meanwhile, fellow CryptoQuant analyst, PelinayPA, noted that Fund Market Premium (FMP) has remained mostly neutral or positive between July and September 2025 – indicating renewed institutional demand. Over the same period, ETH has surged from $2,500 to $4,400. Related Reading: Ethereum To $6,800 By Year End? CME Futures Data Shows Record Institutional Demand For the uninitiated, the FMP in Ethereum’s context measures the price gap between futures contracts and the spot market. Currently, with positive premiums dominating, the market is showing strong institutional support for ETH. PelinayPA added: This environment could help Ethereum maintain stability above $4.4K and potentially sustain further upside momentum. Major target $6,8K. In addition, ETH exchange reserves continue to deplete at a rapid pace. Recent analysis by another CryptoQuant contributor named Arab Chain forecasted ETH to touch $5,500 in September. That said, the current pause in ETH’s rally remains a point of concern. At press time, ETH trades at $4,491, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

It is still a key part of the blockchain economy, with billions of dollars in value settled every day and thousands of decentralized apps. But even if Ethereum (ETH) is quite strong, economists say it is now a mature asset and won’t see huge profits. Investors looking for large multiples are now looking at a presale project called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that has institutional-grade mechanics and an early-entry price. Analysts say that this platform might increase by 50x by 2026, making it the next big thing in crypto investing. Ethereum (ETH)’s strong position but limited growth Ethereum (ETH) has always been the place where smart contracts, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces live. There is no doubt that it has had an impact on the blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum (ETH) is now a large-cap asset, which means that its future gains will be gradual rises instead of big jumps. High gas expenses and traffic jams are only two of the problems that have made it harder for smaller investors to get the most out of their investments. Ethereum (ETH) will probably always be the most important part of DeFi, but its size makes it hard for anyone who wants to turn thousands into millions to find new options. In markets where crypto prices go up and down a lot and people still remember the previous big crash, the best way to make money is to invest in younger tokens that have a good chance of being used. This is exactly why people are paying attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A ground-floor entry Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi platform that wants to get both individual and institutional investors. Its method avoids the problems that other ventures run into by focusing on safety, efficiency, and long-term sustainability. The mechanism is designed to keep lenders and borrowers in balance and to stop people from making too many stablecoins by limiting who can mint them and setting limitations on deposits and loans. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6 of its presale. The project has now raised $15.90 million. The token costs $0.035, and 42% of the initial allocation has already been sold. More than 16,400 people have already signed up. When Phase 7 starts, the price of the token will automatically go up to $0.040, meaning the token price will increase by 15%. This is the last chance for customers to get tokens at a lower price before the next stage. Utility and demand mechanics The stablecoin technology is what makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) work. Each stablecoin will be worth $1 and will be guaranteed by loans that are worth more than the stablecoin itself. These loans will be made with significant cryptocurrencies like ETH, SOL, and AVAX. Borrowers can only mint against collateral that has been approved, which keeps the system safe. This keeps the demand for borrowing steady because users will always have a reliable asset to use for trading, yield farming, or other things. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses a utilization-based interest strategy, which is different from how other lending platforms work. When there is a lot of liquidity, interest rates will stay low to encourage people to borrow. When liquidity gets tight, rates go up to get additional deposits. This dynamic system keeps the platform steady and keeps users from getting shocked. This predictability is a big reason why institutions and experienced borrowers use it. Its buyback and distribution mechanism is another strong generator of demand. The platform will use money made from borrowing, liquidations, and fees to buy MUTM tokens straight from the market. After buying these tokens, they will be given to anyone who stakes mtTokens, which will keep the demand going. Every user, whether they are a borrower, lender, or staker, has a motivation to use the token, which makes it the most important part of the ecosystem. The stats from the presale clearly show the potential for ROI. The token was available for $0.020 in Phase 3. With the presale price at $0.035 today, individuals who got in early have made a 75% paper profit. The long-term picture is still good for people who are buying now. A $1,000 investment at $0.035 gets you more than 28,500 tokens. Analysts think that MUTM will reach $1.75 by 2026. That means that $1,000 will rise to more than $50,000, which is a 50x return. This is not a guess based on hype, but on how things work. Every borrower makes stablecoins valuable, every lender makes money, and every staker benefits from buybacks. The way the platform is set up is that the more people who use it, the more demand for the token. Security, roadmap, and trust Trust and safety are very important in DeFi, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has put money into both. CertiK has already done a full audit of the project and gave it a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. These statistics put it ahead of a lot of other ventures that are still in the presale stage. A bug bounty program worth $50,000 is also going on. It pays white-hat developers up to $2,000 for finding security holes. The roadmap is just as ambitious. Each milestone, from finalizing smart contracts to launching testnet betas to forming agreements with institutions and expanding to many chains, is meant to attract more users and make the service more useful. A $100,000 giveaway campaign makes people even more involved in the community by rewarding early participants and spreading the word about the brand throughout the market. Ethereum (ETH) is still a major player in DeFi, but its development curve is not as steep as what investors are looking for right now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates a new environment where utility, demand, and institutional readiness all come together to make ROI potential grow exponentially. This is the time for investors to lock in their position, since 42% of Phase 6 has already been sold, and the presale price is likely to go up. Ethereum (ETH) is stable, whereas Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is growing. The initiative is shaping up to be the best chance to invest in crypto right now, with analysts predicting a 50x gain by 2026.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-touts-xrp-major-use-case-questions-amazon-uber-heres-why/,"Technical analyst AllinCrypto recently shared a video clip of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse discussing the limitations of current global payment systems and the opportunities blockchain technology, particularly the XRP Ledger, could provide. In the video, Garlinghouse questioned why large global marketplaces such as Amazon have not adopted blockchain solutions to improve efficiency in payouts and reduce friction. Garlinghouse pointed out that Amazon , despite being one of the world’s largest corporations valued in the trillions, only supports payouts in 19 different currencies across its marketplace operations. He described this as a patchwork of integrations spanning regions such as India, China, and the European Union. According to Garlinghouse, the fragmented nature of these systems results in inefficiencies that could be addressed through blockchain-based infrastructure. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse questions why marketplaces like Amazon have not yet adopted blockchain technology like the XRP Ledger for payments: ""Uber knows that if they can pay their drivers more frequently, the retention of their drivers goes up."" $XRP $RLUSD pic.twitter.com/Cr4QG5DTkc — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) September 16, 2025 The Case of Uber and Driver Payments Garlinghouse extended his argument by referencing Uber, noting that the ride-hailing company faces challenges in retaining drivers. He explained that Uber is aware of the correlation between frequent driver payments and higher retention rates. However, the company currently pays drivers on a two-week cycle, which creates friction compared to more immediate settlement options. He highlighted the contrast with traditional taxi services, where drivers receive payment instantly through cash or credit card transactions, even though credit card settlements may take a couple of days. For Uber drivers, the delay in receiving earnings reduces incentives, creating additional burdens for the company, which then needs to keep acquiring new drivers to replace those leaving the platform. Garlinghouse argued that blockchain technology could help remove such inefficiencies. By enabling instant, low-cost, and reliable settlements, platforms like Uber could pay drivers after each trip, thereby improving retention and reducing operational costs associated with driver churn. Ripple’s Broader Vision for Payments The Ripple CEO emphasized that the company’s broader goal is to create a global, real-time, and cost-efficient payments infrastructure. He outlined Ripple’s approach to enable businesses to integrate through a single API, providing access to liquidity, and allowing transactions to flow seamlessly into banks or payment networks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He noted that this vision is designed to meet the expectations of a new generation that has grown accustomed to immediacy in services, from food delivery to online purchases. According to Garlinghouse, the expectation of real-time services now extends naturally to payments, and companies must adapt to this shift. Garlinghouse further stated that Ripple’s technology aims to reduce errors and failed transactions, creating an experience that is both efficient and reliable for banks and their customers. By scaling RippleNet with this approach, the company hopes to meet a growing demand for on-demand and real-time payment solutions that fit modern consumer and business needs. In his closing remarks, Garlinghouse underlined the importance of making payments not only faster but also more cost-effective and accurate, ensuring that businesses and individuals alike benefit from an improved financial system powered by blockchain technology.

The Federal Open Market Committee voted to lower its target range to 4% to 4.25%, in line with investor expectations. After the move, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference that the unemployment rate remains low but job gains have slowed, “and downside risks to employment have risen at the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated.” A Growing Divide at The Fed The decision was nearly unanimous, with only the new Fed governor, and Donald Trump’s pick for Powell’s successor, Stephen Miran , wanting a larger 0.5% cut. “There is clearly a growing divide at the Fed over policy outlook,” reported the Kobeissi letter, which added that nine officials see two more cuts in 2025 while six officials see none. SUMMARY OF FED DECISION (9/17/2025): 1. Fed cuts rates by 25 bps in first rate cut of 2025 2. Median projection shows 50 bps in additional rate cuts for 2025 3. Governor Miran dissents in favor of 50 bps cut today 4. Fed says downside risks to employment have risen 5. 6 Fed… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) September 17, 2025 GDP growth slowed to around 1.5% in the first half of 2025, down from 2.5% last year, which “largely reflects a slowdown in consumer spending,” said Powell. The housing sector also remains weak, but this could be due to high interest rates impacting borrowing. “The decision to cut was all about guarding against downside risks to the job market, so the October decision will once again come down to which way the incoming labor market data break,” said Michael Pearce, deputy chief US economist at Oxford Economics. CME futures markets currently predict an 87.7% probability of a further 0.25% rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting on October 29. “We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2% goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored,” Powell concluded. US inflation is above the Fed target at 2.9%, and has been rising for the past four consecutive months. It has not been at or below 2% since February 2021. Crypto Market Reaction There was little reaction on crypto markets as the rate cut had been priced in. Bitcoin jumped toward $118,000 during early trading in Asia on Thursday but had retreated slightly to $117,500 at the time of writing.

Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) are still the mainstays of many portfolios, but many altcoins are having trouble keeping up with the market since investors are hesitant to buy them right now. But in the middle of all this worry, analysts are pointing to a new project called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one that could follow Ethereum (ETH)’s early development path. ETH set the standard, but growth is limited Ethereum (ETH) changed decentralized finance forever by making smart contracts, DeFi lending, and decentralized apps possible. It is still one of the most respected names in crypto investment, but its existing status makes it hard for new investors to get in. Newcomers can’t expect to achieve the same gains that Ethereum (ETH) did in its early days because of high transaction fees, poor speeds when the network is busy, and a market value that has already reached hundreds of billions. This is why people are looking for the next big growth story like ETH. Investors are looking for a project that has both groundbreaking utility and low entry prices, where the upside is still possible. That’s when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in a panic market Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trying to be like ETH, but with new solutions that fix many of the problems that older protocols had. It is expected to be cheaper and faster than standard Layer-1 networks because it is built with Layer-2 integration. The platform is working on a lending ecosystem where users may deposit assets, borrow against them without having to sell them, and stake mtTokens for rewards, all in a safe and open environment. The ongoing presale is already showing that people are getting more confident. Phase 6 is now online, and tokens are selling for $0.035. More than 42% of the 170 million tokens available for this stage have already been sold, and more than $15.9 million has been raised from more than 16,400 holders. Investors are now looking at Phase 7, when the price will go up 15% to $0.040. This makes people who want to get in early before listings drive more exposure feel like they need to act quickly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is adding genuine incentives to its presale, unlike protocols that go slowly. Ten people will win $10,000 in MUTM tokens in a $100,000 giveaway . The project has also passed CertiK’s strict audit process. The Token Scan Score is 90, and the Skynet Score is 79. There is also a $50,000 bug bounty program to reward anyone who uncovers bugs. This combination of openness and safety helps build trust at a time when people are often unsure about new projects. The two financing systems in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s design also make it stand apart. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) approach puts blue-chip assets and stablecoins into audited contracts. This lets depositors earn predictable returns while borrowers get access to cash. For example, a BTC holder who puts in $25,000 can borrow $18,000 in USDT at a 72% loan-to-value ratio. This lets them preserve their exposure to BTC’s long-term potential while putting their money to work in the immediate term. When a depositor puts $10,000 in USDD, they get mtUSDD at a 1:1 ratio, which means they make about 15% APY, or $1,500 a year. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) feature will put meme coins and other risky commodities into their own pools. Traders who want higher returns on tokens like PEPE will talk directly to lenders about the parameters. This keeps the primary liquidity pools safe by keeping them separate. This balance between being flexible and controlling risk is meant to make the protocol stable and able to grow, even when things are unstable. The stability design is what keeps the system together. Interest rates change based on how often the pool is used. This means that more deposits come in when the pool is used more, which stops people from borrowing too much. Liquidation levels, which are 80% for ETH and about 65% for meme currencies, keep things in check. Reserve factors, on the other hand, put value back into MUTM demand. These mechanics aren’t just vague promises; they deal with market volatility directly and give users real methods to earn and borrow money without having to guess. Conclusion Early purchases of Ethereum (ETH) made 100X their money back. Now that the market cap exceeds $500 billion, new investors have already missed the most exciting moment. In comparison, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale for $0.035, and once it gets listed on exchanges, it is expected to rise to roughly $1, giving early investors a chance to make 30X their money faster than ETH. Analysts are putting MUTM in the running for the next ETH-like growth story because there aren’t many opportunities like that in today’s market. Ethereum (ETH) will always be remembered as the first DeFi project, but as crypto prices change quickly today, the next leader is likely to come from projects that have new mechanics and real-world uses. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in the spotlight because it offers traders what they want in times of panic: the chance to expand, security, and usefulness.

51909038,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=811788,1758171974,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51909038.jpeg,Mercer reports a significant shift in client portfolios away from U.S. markets,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/economic-policies-are-chasing-investors-us/,"A wave of clients are shifting away from U.S. assets as investors react to President Donald Trump’s trade and interest-rate agenda, according to Mercer LLC. The consulting firm says concern over tariffs, pressure on the Federal Reserve, a swelling budget deficit and the risk of a softer dollar are pushing money to Europe, Japan and other markets. Hooman Kaveh, Mercer’s global chief investment officer, said a rising share of the firm’s 3,900 clients, together overseeing about $17 trillion, are reducing U.S. exposure. The opening weeks in the early phase of Trump’s second term “has been a trigger for genuine diversification,” he noted in an interview this week. “We’re certainly seeing that in client portfolios where flows are toward diversifying markets, geographies, asset classes, currencies.” Market nerves were evident in early April after Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement, when both U.S. stocks and Treasuries fell before rebounding. Even so, U.S. shares have trailed many overseas benchmarks in 2025 for dollar-based investors. Kaveh said investors are struggling to price the tariff path because the effects can cut two ways: either squeeze company margins or get passed through to consumers and lift inflation. “If you have a situation where tariffs are going to push prices up, and the weaker dollar potentially can increase inflation, that would cause the Fed much more of a challenge to cut rates,” he added. As mentione in a Bloomberg report, he called the White House’s preference for a weaker dollar “the Achilles heel to the current approach” since it can magnify the inflation impulse from tariffs. Where the money is going Trump’s repeated criticism of Chair Jerome Powell, saying he has been slow to lower borrowing costs, along with the president’s move to fire Governor Lisa Cook, is further encouraging clients to step back from the U.S., according to Kaveh. “The politicization of the Fed is putting the Fed in the corner,” he noted. “The single-minded focus on inflation and employment now is being blurred. It’s not good news. It does advocate for diversification.” Mercer sees clients increasing allocations to stocks in Europe and Japan , where prices are viewed as more appealing relative to the U.S. The firm is also seeing steady interest in private markets, including venture funds tied to the artificial-intelligence build-out. “The majority of our clients seem to think that AI will be a very significant driver of the macro environment over the next five-to-10 years,” Kaveh said. Trump’s attacks on Powell blamed for market jitters Adding to the debate, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel on Wednesday warned that curbing the U.S. central bank’s independence could backfire, lifting long-term borrowing costs and inviting similar political pressure elsewhere. Trump has stepped up demands for aggressive rate cuts, sought to dismiss a Federal Reserve governor and is weighing whether to replace Powell. “If the Fed’s independence were to be permanently undermined politically, the consequences would be serious,” Nagel said in Frankfurt. “This would endanger the economic and financial stability and prosperity of the U.S.” He praised Powell’s handling of the confrontation but cautioned that any doubt about the Fed’s commitment to price stability could push yields higher at the long end of the curve, even if policymakers cut rates at the short end. “There were indications that the attacks on the Fed contributed to a steeper U.S. yield curve on corresponding trading days: lower yields at the short end and higher yields at the long end,” Nagel said. “This shows that the financial markets certainly understand the importance of central bank independence.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Yet analysts are quick to point out that even with renewed interest, DOGE’s growth ceiling is limited to around a 5x gain at best. By contrast, the new DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is projected to deliver as much as 45x before 2026, thanks to its institutional-grade model and fast-growing presale momentum. For serious crypto investing, the divergence between short-term meme speculation and utility-driven ecosystems has never been clearer. DOGE vs MUTM: Two different growth stories DOGE has been the most famous meme coin for a long time. It can rally whenever social media mood or celebrity endorsements bring retail traders into the market. But DOGE is already seen as a mature asset because it has a lot of it, doesn’t have a way to make money, and doesn’t change much in terms of technology. Even when the market is going up, its upside is limited, so whales that buy in now are only looking for little gains of approximately 5x. That might get casual traders excited, but for investors looking for big changes, it’s not enough. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the other end of the scale. MUTM is built on a genuine financial framework instead of meme energy, which makes it easy for anybody to use. Its model is based on borrowing and lending stablecoins, where every transaction adds to the platform’s earnings and, in turn, the demand for tokens. This is why experts think the price will rise from today’s presale level of $0.035 to $1.60 by 2026, which is a 45x rise. It’s easy to see why: DOGE’s growth is based on people’s feelings, while MUTM’s growth is based on people’s actions, which are directly related to lending, borrowing, and staking functionalities that rise with user demand. Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale. So far, the initiative has raised $15.90 million, and 42% of this round has already been sold. The price of the token is $0.035 right now, but it will go up to $0.040 when Phase 7 starts. This means that anybody who buys now will make a 15% profit on paper. There are now more than 16,400 people involved in the presale community, and it is growing swiftly. This spike shows that people are quite confident before the introduction, making the token one of the most talked-about new crypto coins this season. The appeal is clear: investors are coming in at the ground floor, where gains are measured in multiples instead of percentages. MUTM is different from DOGE in that it is not yet listed on all major exchanges and needs a lot of money to get higher. Instead, it benefits from the natural pricing staircase of its presale. Since Phase 1, early movers have already made 75% of their money back on paper. The presale design includes the upcoming spike in crypto prices. Lending mechanics that fuel demand The dual lending structure is what makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) work. Peer-to-peer lending will allow traders to borrow against meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, FLOKI, PEPE, and TRUMP on the other side. This part of the piece is based on the culture of high-risk retail markets. On the other hand, peer-to-contract lending will focus on blue-chip assets like ETH, BTC, and stablecoins. This will make borrowing safer and more acceptable to institutions. The mix of meme-driven and institutional lending makes a unique balance. There will be limits on how much you can deposit and borrow, and only certain types of collateral will be eligible for minting stablecoins. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency makes it possible for users to borrow more money against safe assets, and the utilization-based interest model changes automatically to keep liquidity flowing. This implies that borrowers, lenders, and stakers all have a reason to get involved, which immediately leads to a steady demand for the MUTM token. Analysts’ 45x price target is based on the utility-driven approach. Every loan earns interest, every sale comes with penalties, and every transaction helps the treasury grow. The money will be used to buy back MUTM on the open market, and then it will be given to mtToken stakers. The cycle is meant to keep token demand high, unlike DOGE, which only works when there is a lot of hype in the market. ROI math: 5x vs 45x The difference in results could not be clearer. At best, DOGE whales that get in now will see their money grow fivefold. For instance, a $1,000 investment in DOGE could make $5,000 during times of high enthusiasm. In contrast, early investors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) who bought at $0.020 are already sitting on 75% paper profits, even though the market hasn’t listed it yet. People who buy now for $0.035 still have a long way to go. If the price goes up to $1.60, the same $1,000 investment will turn into $45,000, which is a 45x return over the 2026 cycle. That distinction isn’t just talk; it’s based on how lending works on a large scale and how presales work. Security and openness are very important in a market that is still nervous after the latest crypto crisis. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already been checked by CertiK, which gave it a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. This makes both institutional and ordinary investors more confident. The platform is also running a bug bounty program worth $50,000 to encourage ethical hackers to find security holes. They can earn up to $2,000 for finding major flaws. A $100,000 giveaway is going on right now to make the community even stronger. Ten people will each get $10,000 in MUTM tokens. These actions show that the project puts security first and is friendly to investors, which is not common in presale initiatives. Conclusion DOGE still attracts whales because of its nostalgic and retail appeal, but it can’t develop as fast as next-generation platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a fully structured ecosystem that includes lending, collateral efficiency, and revenue buybacks, all of which work together to create long-term demand for tokens. The price of presale tokens is rising swiftly, and the following phase price increase is coming soon. The admission window is closing shortly. Analysts agree that DOGE can only provide you 5x returns at best, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built to give you 45x returns by 2026. For people who are serious about investing in cryptocurrencies, it is the best move in a market where values change quickly and opportunities only come around once in a while.

ADA is very intellectual, but it sometimes irritates traders who watch the crypto fear and greed index and daily crypto prices today. The project is still moving forward, but the short-term rewards seem low; therefore, many investors are looking for a crypto investment that can grow faster right now. ADA’s slow grind leaves investors restless The basics of ADA still look good on paper. The fact that it is dedicated to smart contracts, staking pools, and decentralized applications makes it possible for a strong blockchain network. But its careful plan has worked against it in several ways. ADA has avoided some of the hazards that come with fast-moving ecosystems, but its moderate price action makes investors hunt for bigger returns elsewhere. Traders who bought ADA years ago are still waiting for big moves, but the charts are still slow compared to tokens that move faster. That gap between promise and short-term delivery has made it possible for investors to look for other projects that not only focus on security and innovation but also work in the real world right now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes into play here, changing the conversation from long-term potential to real, short-term use cases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) answers the question of which crypto to buy today Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is changing the way DeFi financing works by adding two new models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). This mixed strategy gives both institutional-grade investors and regular traders access to liquidity in ways that traditional platforms have had trouble doing. For instance, in P2C lending, a depositor may put $15,000 worth of USDT into the protocol and get mtUSDT back at a 1:1 rate. This makes $2,250 a year in dependable income, with a 15% yearly return. A person who holds ETH might lock up $12,000 worth of ETH as collateral, borrow $9,000 in USDT at a 75% loan-to-value ratio, and still be able to trade ETH while freeing up cash for other trades. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also adds a restricted P2P option for meme coins with a larger risk, such as SHIB or DOGE. Lenders and borrowers can talk to each other directly in these separate pools, which lets them get higher returns without putting the platform’s overall liquidity at risk with risky assets. The method is set up to safeguard users while keeping activity going by carefully setting the liquidation criteria at 80% for ETH and 65% for meme tokens. The presale phase has already shown that the project is moving forward. The price of Phase 6 tokens is $0.035, and more than 42% of the 170 million available have already been sold. More than 16,400 people have signed up as holders, and more than $15.9 million has been raised. With a Token Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, the CertiK audit gives it even more legitimacy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also giving away $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens to ten people, with each winner getting $10,000 worth of tokens. This is another reason for early adopters to join. The following step will see the price go up by 15% to $0.040, which makes people feel more urgent. Another main priority is security. CertiK did an audit of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that included both manual review and static analysis. The team has also started a bug bounty program with prizes that range from $200 to $2,000, depending on how serious the fault is. This proactive strategy makes it safer for investors to take part and builds trust over time. The architecture of the protocol is also closely related to how much people want the token. Some of the fees and liquidation penalties go to the treasury. MUTM’s buy-and-distribute mechanics then send this money to buy MUTM from the market to reward mtToken stakers. This generates a cycle where engagement on the site immediately leads to continued demand for the token. The difference in how ADA and MUTM prices are moving today is very noticeable for investors who are looking at crypto pricing. ADA’s controlled pace is good for patient people, whereas MUTM works right away and has clear mechanics. People who traded $5,000 worth of ETH for MUTM in Phase 1 now have a lot of paper gains, since tokens are worth $0.035 in Phase 6. With listings around $0.06 and a goal of $2 after launch, the upside is a huge 57x. Traders who track the crypto fear and greed index will not want to miss this. Conclusion As the beta launch gets closer and listings on major exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Kraken, and MEXC are expected, exposure will go up a lot. This means that more people will not only learn about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) but also try out its real functionality. This is something that ADA investors are still waiting for with many of Cardano (ADA)’s stated use cases. In the end, ADA is still an important project with solid values. But if traders want to know which crypto to purchase today, the answer is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM gives investors the ability to make huge profits as ADA moves at a slower pace. It has a strong presale, real-world lending mechanics, buy-and-distribute tokenomics, and a clear route to growth.

Gains were measured, however, as investors weighed the central bank’s cautious tone on future policy moves. Bitcoin last traded 1% higher at $117,426. Ether rose 2.8% to $4,609. XRP also gained, rising 2.9% to $3.10. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described Wednesday’s quarter-point reduction as a risk-management step, stressing that policymakers were in no hurry to speed up the easing cycle. His comments dampened expectations of more aggressive cuts, limiting enthusiasm across risk assets. Fed lowers rates by a quarter point, first cut since 2024 https://t.co/HogIohB0Wf — CNBC (@CNBC) September 17, 2025 Traders Anticipated Fed Rate Trim, Leaving Little Room for Surprise Rally The Federal Open Market Committee voted 11-to-1 to lower the benchmark lending rate to a range of 4.00% to 4.25%. The sole dissent came from newly appointed governor Stephen Miran, who pushed for a half-point cut. Traders were largely prepared for the move. Futures markets tracked by the CME FedWatch tool had assigned a 96% probability to a 25 basis point cut, making the decision widely anticipated. That advance positioning meant much of the potential boost was already priced in, creating what analysts described as a “buy the rumour, sell the news” environment. Fed Rate Decision Creates Conditions for Crypto, But Traders Still Hold Back Andrew Forson, president of DeFi Technologies, said lower borrowing costs would eventually steer more money toward digital assets. “A lower cost of capital indicates more capital flows into the digital assets space because the risk hurdle rate for money is lower,” he noted. He added that staking products and blockchain projects could become attractive alternatives to traditional bonds, offering both yield and appreciation. Despite the cut, crypto markets remained calm. Open interest in Bitcoin futures held steady and no major liquidation cascades followed the Fed’s decision. Analysts pointed to Powell’s language and upcoming economic data as the key factors for traders before building larger positions. Powell’s Caution Tempers Immediate Impact of Fed Rate Move on Crypto Markets History also suggests crypto rallies after rate cuts often take time. When the Fed eased in Dec. 2024, Bitcoin briefly surged 5% cent before consolidating, with sustained gains arriving only weeks later. This time, market watchers are bracing for a similar pattern. Powell’s insistence on caution, combined with uncertainty around inflation and growth, has kept short-term volatility muted even as sentiment for risk assets improves. BitMine’s Tom Lee this week predicted that Bitcoin and Ether could deliver “monster gains” in the next three months if the Fed continues on an easing path. His view echoes broader expectations that liquidity-sensitive assets will outperform once the cycle gathers pace. For now, the crypto sector has digested the Fed’s move with restraint. Traders remain focused on signals from the central bank’s October meeting to determine whether Wednesday’s step marks the beginning of a broader policy shift or just a one-off adjustment.

New money coming in and a renewed sense of hope are visible on crypto charts. Analysts currently think that this season will bring more momentum, and crypto predictions for the month are already pointing to a few projects that could do better than the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at the top of that list. Experts claim that this penny-priced token is the best cryptocurrency to buy in September. Why experts are naming MUTM the September favorite Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly become the center of attention because of how well it did in its presale and how useful its design is. The presale has already brought in $15.90 million, and the token is now worth only $0.035, which is 42% of the way through Phase 6. When Phase 7 starts, the price will go up to $0.040, which is a 15% increase for new customers right away. With more than 16,400 holders currently in place, the need to act quickly is mounting because this window won’t be open for long. This month, what makes MUTM different from other altcoins is the way its technical base and the market cycle work together. A lot of people are wondering why crypto prices are going up in September, but the real question is which projects will get the most attention as money comes back into the market. MUTM is one of the few that mixes real-world financial design with the chance of making a lot of money. Experts are pointing out five primary reasons why MUTM has the upper hand this time around. The first is the beta launch, which will happen at the same time as the token’s listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes sure that investor and user demand meet at the same time by launching a platform that is immediately usable. This creates pressure for quick price discovery. The second thing is adding Layer-2 scalability. MUTM has a distinct advantage over earlier protocols because transactions will be finished almost instantly and with very minimal fees. When trading starts, this competitive edge should bring in liquidity from both retail and institutional investors. Third, a decentralized stablecoin mechanism will be put in place. The protocol is meant to keep real-world use going by letting users borrow against top assets like ETH, SOL, or AVAX and automatically destroying tokens when loans are paid back or sold. This structure puts real financial activity into the ecosystem and creates a demand for MUTM that goes beyond just speculation. The fourth factor is better collateral efficiency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on a paradigm that keeps safety while maximizing liquidity. This is different from existing platforms that lock value in inflexible structures. This means more borrowing, more repayments, and more money for the platform, which will go right back into protocol through mtToken staking and MUTM buybacks. Lastly, experts stress the importance of the listing pipeline. Most presale tokens just make guesses about which exchanges will list them in the future. However, MUTM is getting ready to launch on platforms including Coinbase, KuCoin, Binance, Kraken, and MEXC. This means that access will be easy from the start, which will allow a lot of people to join in and create a lot of liquidity. Investor projections point toward 43x ROI The logic behind the investment is already working in favor of people who buy early. People who bought in Phase 3 at $0.020 are now up 75% to $0.035. But the real focus is on what’s to come. After listings, analysts are pointing to a target of $1.50, which is a 43x return on investment from where we are now. For instance, if someone invests $1,000 at $0.035 now, they may make $43,000 at that price target. This is why MUTM is getting a higher score than almost all other presale projects this year. Security is also making investors feel more confident. The code has been checked by CertiK, which shows that it is safe. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also set up a $50,000 bug bounty program to get security researchers interested. They are also giving away $100,000 to raise awareness and reward early community members. Investors look for this kind of simultaneous focus on trust and growth when they look at new projects. September is a turning point for the whole market. Many tokens will gain from increased optimism, but for now, both analysts and investors are focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With strong presale momentum, unusual dynamics, and readiness for exchanges, it’s one of the most appealing names this cycle. MUTM is the best entry of the month for people who want more than small gains. Buyers who join before the presale ends will get the kind of rewards that can change their portfolios.

The plan combines Franklin Templeton’s tokenised money market fund with Ripple’s U.S. dollar stablecoin RLUSD and makes them available on DBS Digital Exchange. This partnership is one of the biggest efforts to connect tokenised money market funds to stablecoins on a regulated platform. DBS will list Franklin Templeton’s sgBENJI token next to Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin to give investors new ways to trade and manage liquidity. DBS introduces tokenised fund and stablecoin on its digital exchange Investors who want stability can hold Ripple’s RLUSD, backed by the U.S. dollar, while those looking for yields can choose Franklin Templeton’s sgBENJI token, linked to a short-term money market fund. When market conditions change, investors will be able to quickly switch between the two tokens without leaving the DBS platform. DBS will also allow investors to use the sgBENJI token as collateral for borrowing money or accessing more liquidity. Clients can pledge sgBENJI tokens in repurchase agreements or through third-party platforms where DBS is the trusted agent to hold the pledged assets. This way, investors can take out loans without selling their holdings, and the bank will make tokenised products more attractive. Chief Executive Officer of DBS Digital Exchange, Lim Wee Kian, said digital assets break the limits of traditional banking hours. They allow investors to trade faster, settle transactions more securely, and manage portfolios 24/7. He added that the partnership with Franklin Templeton and Ripple proves that tokenisation can grow to become an integral part of the global financial system because it combines financial experience with blockchain technology. Franklin Templeton and Ripple build tokenisation network with sgBENJI and RLUSD Franklin Templeton said it will issue its sgBENJI tokens on the XRP ledger because it processes transactions quickly, uses less energy compared to other blockchains, and keeps costs affordable for users. The firm wants to create a safe environment for investors and institutions that want to trade large amounts of money efficiently by expanding the use of tokenised products on popular public blockchains. Many investors already use RLUSD (the market value reached almost $730 billion in September 2025) for trading and payments. Ripple wants to combine the stablecoin with Franklin Templeton’s sgBENJI to give investors both stability from the stablecoin and yields from the money market fund on one regulated platform. Ripple’s head of trading and markets, Nigel Khakoo, said linking tokenised money market funds with RLUSD makes digital assets more practical and useful. It creates a liquid and reliable system that institutions can use for their day-to-day needs. Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, also said tokenisation creates new opportunities that change how global finance works in the long term. He added that Asia’s policymakers and investors are open to adopting blockchain solutions that make markets more efficient and flexible. A joint survey by EY-Parthenon and Coinbase also found that 87% of institutional investors would invest in digital assets during 2025, which shows they believe regulation and technology can support widespread use. The survey results confirm today’s market trend, where companies like Franklin Templeton, Ripple, and DBS work together to deliver tokenised products and services that meet institutional standards.

There have never been so many options, from long-term performers who are still going strong to major players who are always on top and DeFi challengers who are growing quickly. For very different reasons, analysts are pointing to three crypto coins as the best: Cardano (ADA) for its long-term fundamentals, Ethereum (ETH) for its steady rise, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for its expected 1900% return that is turning heads in crypto investing circles. ADA for long-term growth Cardano (ADA) has always said that it is the stable player in a market that is continually changing. Its ecosystem has expanded with a strong focus on security, scalability, and saving energy. ADA’s staking system is one of the most popular in the business since it lets holders help keep the network safe while also making money passively. ADA has done well during downturns because it has been consistent. Today’s crypto prices show that it can bounce back when others fall behind. ADA is a patient choice for investors who want to take less risk. Analysts think of it as a dependable long-term asset that favors discipline over speed. ADA’s reputation as a stable platform makes it a good choice for portfolio stability, even while its upside isn’t projected to bring huge returns in the short term. ETH for steady growth Ethereum (ETH) is still the key part of decentralized finance, NFTs, and a lot of the new things that are emerging in the blockchain world. It is the network of choice for both developers and businesses. Its staking yields make it even more appealing to anyone who wants to make money without taking too much risk. ETH is still the most popular cryptocurrency for liquidity and smart contract use, which makes it one of the safest investments in crypto right now. However, analysts think that ETH’s upside would be consistent but small compared to other initiatives because it currently has such a big portion of the market. Investors who keep an eye on crypto charts may expect ETH to keep growing, but not very quickly. Instead, ETH is a good choice for people who want steady growth and stability. It strikes a good balance between ADA’s gradual burn and the exploding chances in other places. MUTM for 1900% returns Analysts recognize the asymmetric upside in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is why whales are starting to pay attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in its presale period; therefore, the price to get in is much lower than it will be when it goes public and starts to grow. This is different from ADA or ETH. The project combines peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending in a way that hasn’t been done before. Users can borrow meme tokens like PEPE, DOGE, or SHIB to speculate, and they can also borrow serious amounts of money against blue-chip assets like ETH, BTC, AVAX, or stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI, but only up to a certain amount of value. The platform’s rules provide that an investor who puts $10,000 in ETH can borrow $5,000 in USDT. The mechanics don’t end there. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a buy-and-distribute mechanism, which means that the platform’s profits will be utilized to acquire MUTM from the open market and provide it to mtToken stakers. This keeps demand high and rewards people who stay in the ecosystem for a long time. Its Layer-2 integration, which makes transactions faster and cheaper, and its beta launch, which lets users test features as soon as the token lists, are just two more reasons why analysts think this DeFi project is different from others. The presale has already attracted some attention, bringing in $15.90 million in Phase 6. The price is now $0.035, and 42% of the tokens have been sold. More than 16,400 people own them. The CertiK audit, which gave it a grade of 90/79, makes it safer. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, which means that the time to buy at a lower price is running out quickly. For investors who want to make money, the math is fairly clear. People who invested in Phase 1 for $0.01 are now up 250% to $0.035 on paper. When the listing goes up for $0.06, that number climbs up to unrealized 500%. Experts, on the other hand, anticipate that the real breakthrough will happen after the listing, with price estimates of $0.70 at first and $2 in the end. That means a 1900% return on investment, which means that a $10,000 investment would convert into $190,000. This is why many in the crypto investment community are talking about this idea seriously. Closing ADA guarantees long-term growth and ETH keeps making progress, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines new ideas, borrowing mechanisms, and reward systems that drive demand on a large scale. Analysts say this is a high-growth project because of its great presale, good audit results, and clear plan. Today’s crypto prices show the difference between sluggish but steady main coins and fast-moving challengers. In this context, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the crypto coin that can provide you with 1900% profits. The answer to the question of where the next wave of wealth will come from is already here.

The MoU will see Franklin Templeton tokenize its money market fund, Franklin on-chain U.S. dollar short-term money market fund, on XRP Ledger, a public and enterprise-grade blockchain. At the same time, DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx) will list sgBENJI, the money market fund token, alongside RLUSD, enabling DBS clients to rebalance their portfolios between a stablecoin and a yield-generating money market fund. This will help investors earn yield even during volatile periods. Nigel Khakoo, VP and Global Head of Trading and Markets at Ripple, called the collaboration a game changer. “2025 has been marked by a series of industry-firsts when it comes to traditional financial institutions moving onchain – and the linkup between Ripple, DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable repo trades for a tokenised money market fund with a regulated, stable and liquid mode of exchange, such as RLUSD, is truly a game-changer,” Khakoo said in an email announcement shared with CoinDesk. “Investors can also seamlessly rebalance their portfolios between a stablecoin and a yield-generating money market fund, all within a single, trusted ecosystem, unlocking real-world capital efficiency, utility and liquidity that institutions demand,” Khakoo added. Lim Wee Kian, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange, said that the collaboration is evidence of how tokenised securities can play that role while injecting greater efficiency and liquidity in global financial markets. Additionally, DBS is considering allowing holders of sgBENJI tokens to pledge their tokens as collateral to borrow funds from the bank of third-party platforms. The move will open new liquidity options for investors holding sgBENJI tokens, enabling them to leverage their digital assets to obtain credit while still retaining exposure to the underlying yield-generating money market fund.",Finance|Ripple|DBS|Franklin Templeton|Rlusd|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-18 05:32:21

Avalanche’s Asian footprint comes a week after the foundation announced plans to establish two AVAX reserve companies in the US. Further, Avalanche is one of BDACS’s core global partners, underscoring the firm’s commitment to scalable, institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure. “The Avalanche technology and its growing ecosystem of real-world assets will support BDACS and Woori Bank to deliver a trusted, innovative solution for Korea’s digital economy,” Justin Kim, Head of Asia at Ava Labs, said in an official release . BDACS completed a trademark registration for its proprietary won stablecoin KRW1 in December 2023. BDACS Develops Comprehensive Framework for KRW1 Issuance Per Avalanche post, BDACS is planning to utilise KRW1 as a “low-cost payment and settlement system” for public-sector programs. This would significantly lower the payment processing fees, making KRW1 a technical standard for stablecoins in Korea. “BDACS is not just a custody service provider,” said Harry Ryoo, CEO of BDACS. “We are building the backbone of the digital asset market, serving corporate, institutional, and public-sector partners alike.” Further, the company has developed a comprehensive framework for KRW1, including its issuance, management and transaction verification, an official release read. Besides, the stablecoin will have real-time API integration, which enables instant verification of reserves. The stablecoin craze in South Korea is taking shape among traditional finance players. At least three local financial institutions, including Kakao Bank, Kookmin Bank and the Industrial Bank of Korea, have filed for Korean won stablecoin trademarks. Early this month, Tether executives held stablecoin meetings with officials from the South Korean financial heavyweight Shinhan Bank.

People briefed on the matter said China’s State Administration for Market Regulation chose to end the competition inquiry into Google, a status in Chinese called “zhongzhi”, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, The FT added that Google has not yet received formal paperwork confirming the closure of the case. After talks with Chinese counterparts in Madrid, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said a September 17 deadline that could have disrupted the popular social media app in the United States pushed negotiators toward a possible agreement. He noted the deadline could be extended by 90 days to finish the terms, without giving specifics. Bessent said that when commercial details are made public, the arrangement would keep cultural features of TikTok that Chinese negotiators want to protect. “They’re interested in Chinese characteristics of the app, which they think are soft power. We don’t care about Chinese characteristics. We care about national security,” Bessent told reporters at the close of two days of meetings. Trump hinted at possible Chinese stake in TikTok Asked whether China might hold a stake, former President Donald Trump said, “We haven’t decided that but it looks to me, and I’m speaking to President Xi on Friday, for confirmation of that.” A Trump has said the platform aided his re-election last year, and his personal account counts 15 million followers. The White House launched an official TikTok account last month. Any deal may still need approval from the Republican-led Congress. In 2024, Congress passed a law saying TikTok must be sold because of worries that China could access U.S. user data and use it for spying or influence. The Trump administration has not ordered a shutdown, since that could upset millions of users and disrupt political messaging. China disappoints U.S. with fresh Nvidia crackdown Separately as Cryptopolitan reported yesterday, China’s internet watchdog directed major tech companies to stop tests and cancel purchases of Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D . The Cyberspace Administration of China issued the instruction this week, targeting a product Nvidia built to comply with U.S. restrictions on advanced AI chips sold into China. Before that notice, multiple firms had planned to buy tens of thousands of RTX Pro 6000D units. The order follows summer guidance steering companies away from Nvidia’s H20 and arrives as Washington and Beijing hold delicate trade talks. Also on Monday, China said Nvidia violated the country’s anti-monopoly law. The State Administration for Market Regulation disclosed the step after what it called an initial review of Nvidia’s practices. The announcement came as officials from both countries met in Madrid, where chip policy is expected to be part of the agenda. Bessent called the move “poor timing,” a remark analysts said could give Beijing added leverage during the discussions. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang adopted a conciliatory tone Wednesday, telling reporters there are “a lot of places we can’t go to,” and saying he will stay “patient” as governments on both sides manage geopolitical tensions. His comments came as Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson labeled China an “adversary” of the United States after a report that Beijing told tech companies to stop buying Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence chips. “They steal our intellectual property,” Johnson said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” adding China shows “no regard whatsoever for U.S. trademark law or any of the other provisions that make for fair trade agreements.” Get seen where it counts.

Priced at $799, the new Meta Ray-Bans are the first widely available smart glasses with a heads-up display since Google Glass. They stick to the classic Wayfarer design, so they look like regular sunglasses, but discreetly pack in a camera, speakers, and a microphone. The glasses’ digital screen can also be controlled through a neural-tech wristband. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, at the reveal, remarked, “These are glasses with the classic style that you’d expect from Ray-Ban, but they’re the first AI glasses with a high-resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band.” Meta’s new Ray-Bans can make calls and send texts The Ray-Bans’ right lens features a bright, high-resolution colour display that seems to hover just below the user’s eye line, capable of showing text, images, and even live video calls. However, it only lights up when the glasses are in use, and an LED signals when the camera is recording. Additionally, users can control the glasses through touch panels on the arms or by voice. The included water-resistant Neural Band detects forearm nerve signals, enabling intuitive hand-gesture navigation of the display, from swipes and taps to thumb-based virtual d-pad actions. By the end of the year, it will also support finger-drawn handwriting. The glasses can also send and receive texts, make video calls, and work seamlessly with Meta’s services like WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, once connected to a smartphone via Bluetooth. Moreover, they provide live conversation captions, translate speech, offer navigation directions, manage music playback, and turn the lens display into a live camera viewfinder. The glasses are expected in US stores on September 30. Meta introduced Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses and other Ray-Ban iterations Meta also unveiled the Oakley Meta Vanguard on Wednesday, a pair of smart glasses built for extreme-sport enthusiasts like snowboarders and mountain bikers. Set for release on Oct. 21, they’ll sell for $499, coming in $100 higher than the Oakley Meta HSTN model that debuted in June. The Oakley Meta Vanguard has a more athletic aesthetic than the Oakley Meta HSTN, featuring a wraparound frame that curves its vibrant lenses toward the temples. It also adds a conveniently placed button underneath the frame, making it easier for helmeted athletes to snap photos or record video. The company is also collaborating with Garmin to integrate its glasses with the brand’s popular watches and cycling computers. Athletes can ask for live stats such as pace, speed, distance, and heart rate, and get a subtle LED alert inside the lens when they reach a preset milestone. Meta also introduced the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the newest iteration of its original smart glasses. Priced at $379, up from $299 for the 2023 model, the updated glasses offer twice the battery life, lasting up to eight hours, and feature an upgraded camera capable of shooting 3K Ultra HD video, per the company’s description. Not to mention, the glasses are already available. Meta announced additional VR game titles Meta also noted updates on its other works, including Hyperscape, at the event. First introduced at last year’s Connect demo, Hyperscape is designed to help creators build visually rich, realistic VR environments. At the Wednesday event, the company shared that Hyperscape Capture is now available in Early Access. Quest users can scan and experience a room as a detailed, immersive VR space. The room capture is done in minutes, though the detailed rendering takes a bit longer, a few hours. Moreover, sharing options are not available now, but private invite links are expected down the line. Meta also revealed its fall VR game lineup with titles such as Marvel’s Deadpool VR, Star Wars: Beyond Victory, Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked, and Reach. Furthermore, the firm also announced that its Horizon TV will expand its library by adding Disney+, ESPN, and Hulu integration.

Key Takeaways: Bullish posted a $108.3M profit in Q2 2025, reversing last year’s $116.4M loss. The exchange secured New York’s BitLicense and expanded its global regulatory reach. Q2 trading volume hit $179.6B, but Bullish expects a slight dip in Q3 activity. This is the platform’s first earnings disclosure since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, and it comes with strong momentum in trading activity and regulatory wins. Digital asset sales for the quarter rose to $58.6 billion, up from $49.6 billion year-over-year. Bullish Secures Key New York Licenses to Offer Crypto Spot Trading and Custody The exchange also secured key licenses in New York , including a BitLicense and Money Transmission License, granting it permission to offer crypto spot trading and custody services in the state. These additions bolster its expanding regulatory presence, which already includes approvals in Europe under MiCA and licenses in Hong Kong. CEO Tom Farley said the results reflect a quarter of operational strength and strategic positioning. “We saw exciting liquidity services growth, executed a successful Consensus conference, and secured regulatory approvals that prepare us for long-term success,” Farley noted in Wednesday’s statement. Total trading volume hit $179.6 billion in Q2, up from $133 billion a year ago. Despite this growth, the company expects volumes to ease slightly in Q3, projecting between $133 billion and $142 billion. Following the report, Bullish’s stock closed at $54.35, up 5.8% on the day and an additional 2.1% in after-hours trading. However, shares are still down 21.8% since the exchange went public in August. With solid earnings, growing compliance credentials, and rising transaction volumes, Bullish appears to be gaining traction in a tightening crypto exchange landscape, offering a rare bright spot in an otherwise cautious market. Bullish Rides IPO Momentum and European Licenses to Enter US Market Bullish’s BitLicense and Money Transmission License in New York comes amid the company’s growing international presence, which now spans the EU, Hong Kong, Gibraltar, and the US. The exchange recently made headlines by becoming the first US-listed company to raise over $1 billion entirely in stablecoins during its NYSE IPO in August, with backing from Peter Thiel. Regulated and Revolutionary @Bullish becomes the first digital asset exchange to list on the NYSE. $BLSH | @CoinDesk | @ThomasFarley pic.twitter.com/m9ZnLOT5EQ — NYSE (@NYSE) August 13, 2025 The capital raise was settled across blockchain networks like Solana, reflecting Bullish’s commitment to digital-native finance. In Europe, Bullish achieved a MiCAR license uplift through BaFin in Germany, giving it a regulatory foundation to serve institutional clients across the EU. Its headquarters in Frankfurt places it under one of the most trusted financial regulators in the world. Now, with the U.S. licenses in hand, Bullish is opening its doors to institutional clients and advanced traders in New York, offering spot trading and custody services. Its high-performance trading engine combines order book matching and automated market making, ensuring deep liquidity. Bullish’s entry into the US comes amid a wave of crypto firms returning to or expanding in the country as regulatory clarity improves. Firms like Polymarket , TON Foundation , and Deribit are also eyeing US markets, while Wall Street prepares for a $15B crypto IPO pipeline before September.

Dogecoin Whales Have Reduced Holdings By 680 Million Tokens In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about the latest trend in the Supply Distribution of the Dogecoin whales. The “Supply Distribution” here refers to an indicator from on-chain analytics firm Santiment that tells us about the total amount of the DOGE supply that a given wallet group is holding right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Touches $117,000 As Binance Records 9 Days Of Outflows Investors or addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are currently carrying. For example, a holder with 5 DOGE is put into the 1 to 10 tokens bracket. In the context of the current topic, whales are the investors of interest. These entities are typically defined as those holding between 100 million to 1 billion DOGE. At the current exchange rate, the range’s lower end converts to $26.4 million, while the upper one to $264 million. Thus, only the holders that have a substantial amount of capital invested into the memecoin would qualify for this group. As such, the behavior of the cohort in the form of its Supply Distribution trend can be worth keeping an eye on, as if nothing else, it can inform us about the sentiment among DOGE’s most influential investors. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows how the Supply Distribution of the Dogecoin whales has changed over the last few weeks: As displayed in the above graph, the Supply Distribution of this Dogecoin group has witnessed a sharp decline over the past few days, indicating that its members have participated in some net selling. In total, the DOGE whales offloaded 680 million tokens (worth around $181 million) over a four-day span during this selloff. From the chart, it’s visible that the distribution began alongside DOGE’s recovery run to the $0.307 mark. As whales have continued to sell, the memecoin’s price has plunged, currently sitting around 13% down compared to the earlier high. The trend in the indicator could now be to monitor in the coming days, as what these humongous investors do next could also have an impact on the cryptocurrency’s value.

As the analyst has pointed out in another X post, XRP has also been facing selling pressure from its big-money investors. Over the last couple of weeks, XRP whales have shed 200 million tokens from their holdings, worth a total of $605.5 million at the current price. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.264, up 1.5% over the last 24 hours.

In a post on X, Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg stated that the fund “was just approved for trading along with the Generic Listing Standards.” The approval allows Grayscale to move forward with what it describes as the first multi-asset exchange-traded product featuring Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. This marks a departure from the single-asset model that has dominated crypto-linked exchange-traded products in the U.S., making Grayscale’s product the first approved multi-asset spot crypto ETP, including XRP. Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund $GDLC was just approved for trading along with the Generic Listing Standards. The Grayscale team is working expeditiously to bring the *FIRST* multi #crypto asset ETP to market with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano #BTC #ETH $XRP $SOL … — Peter Mintzberg (@PeterMintzberg) September 17, 2025 A New Pathway for Institutional Exposure to XRP The inclusion of XRP alongside top cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum gives regulated exposure to a digital asset that has until now been absent from U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded products, despite notable progress in other countries . XRP represents a portion of the fund’s holdings, complementing allocations to other large-cap tokens. This structure could attract institutions seeking diversified portfolios rather than single-asset products, particularly those bound by compliance requirements that restrict direct crypto purchases. Approval under the Generic Listing Standards could also facilitate faster launches of similar funds, reducing the prolonged delays and extended waiting periods that previously characterized the SEC’s process. By packaging XRP exposure within a diversified and SEC-approved vehicle, GDLC may act as an initial gateway for institutional allocations to this asset. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Pending Spot XRP ETF Applications in Focus The timing of the SEC’s decision on GDLC coincides with heightened anticipation over pending applications for spot XRP exchange-traded funds. Several filings are approaching key decision deadlines in October, and the Polymarket has set the odds of approval at 94% . The commission will decide on these products in mid-to-late October. While approval is not guaranteed, the GDLC decision demonstrates that XRP can be included in a regulated, exchange-traded structure under current rules. The market is convinced that the current pro-crypto SEC leadership will approve these products. A positive ruling would give institutions a direct avenue to invest in XRP, and experts have projected inflows of up to $5 billion in the first month . The next several weeks could clarify whether Grayscale’s milestone represents a single event or the start of a new phase for spot cryptocurrency ETFs and XRP’s growth.

HYPE is testing a new price range, after trading just under $60. Hyperliquid’s native token HYPE rallied to a new all-time peak near $60, on the back of the general market recovery. Hyperliquid remains central to whale positioning, and HYPE is seen as a token with a guaranteed growth arc, due to strong staking incentives. Hyperliquid’s HYPE rallied to a new peak above $59, following the general crypto market recovery. | Source: Coingecko HYPE peaked at $59.30, on trading volumes above $730M. The token got an immediate boost from a recent BitGo listing , which added liquidity to the market. HYPE is becoming less dependent on its native platform, as it spreads to major exchanges. Based on whale activity, HYPE is a bit more balanced, with no significant hype. More than 55% of whales hold long positions, though the biggest bets are still short. The leading whale with a $86M short position is the most notable risk-taker on the HYPE market . According to Nansen analysis , HYPE positions are grouped based on the type of wallets making the bet. Smart money wallets are betting $86M on long positions versus $40M on short positions. Influencer wallets are $47M into long positions and only $22M into short positions. Whales in general are split equally, trading with a more neutral sentiment. HYPE open interest also recovered close to its all-time peak at over $2.1B. Over $1.52B of the derivative open interest is on the Hyperliquid exchange. The HYPE token can inspire both spot buying for staking, and derivative bets, due to the price’s general bullish direction. HYPE sees $70 predictions HYPE is expected to have another rally, based on a general crypto market. Prediction pairs on Polymarket point to an acceleration to $70 in the short term. The Polymarket position suggests downward moves are highly improbable, based on extremely low trading volumes. On Polymarket, HYPE is accelerating bets on breaking above the $70 level. | Source: Polymarket The bets on expansion arrive just days after attempted short positions for HYPE. Whales bet on a short-term rally breakdown , while HYPE showed additional strength in the past day. HYPE may also drop to attack long positions, as the first level of accumulation is at around $53. Hyperdash data shows whales are positioned with a generally positive outlook that HYPE will keep expanding, without setbacks to a lower range. Based on attacking long positions, HYPE also has a short-term chance of dipping as low as $47. Will USDH change the trading on Hyperliquid? The upcoming native stablecoin USDH is raising questions on the way of Hyperliquid trading. Currently, only USDC is accepted as a collateral, from all stablecoins bridged to HyperEVM. USDC makes up 85% of the stablecoin supply on Hyperliquid, and inflows coincide with the need to take positions or increase collateral. According to Messari analysis , USDC will retain this role, while USDH will not immediately become a collateral asset. USDH may have other roles in the ecosystem, as HyperEVM prepares for a new wave of native tokens, after a period of point farming.

The partnership underscores the shared vision of both companies in driving compliant innovation in digital assets. Representatives from iZUMi Finance and CIMG shared their perspectives on the collaboration: “We are pleased to partner with CIMG to establish the Upstarts Fund, enhancing market liquidity and advancing institutional participation in digital assets.

He believes the approval of an XRP ETF is not just a possibility, but an inevitability. This sentiment, expressed during an interview with Bloomberg, suggests a significant shift for the digital asset, potentially paving the way for its inclusion in the White House’s reserve assets. Garlinghouse even anticipates an XRP ETF could launch by the end of this year, a forecast that has investors and enthusiasts eagerly watching the market. Is an XRP ETF Approval Truly Inevitable? Garlinghouse’s confidence stems from several factors. He highlighted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is actively reviewing applications for spot ETFs from prominent asset managers like Franklin Templeton and Bitwise. This institutional interest is a strong indicator of growing mainstream acceptance for cryptocurrencies. The success of recent Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals sets a precedent, making the path for an XRP ETF seem clearer. Growing Institutional Interest: Major financial players are increasingly looking to offer crypto-backed products. Regulatory Evolution: The SEC’s stance on digital assets is gradually evolving, favoring clearer guidelines. Market Maturity: The overall crypto market has matured, demonstrating resilience and growing liquidity. The Profound Impact of an XRP ETF on the Market What would an XRP ETF mean for the broader cryptocurrency market and for investors? Firstly, it would provide a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. Traditional investors, who might be hesitant to directly purchase cryptocurrencies, could gain exposure to XRP through their existing brokerage accounts. This move would significantly enhance XRP’s liquidity and market depth. Moreover, an approved XRP ETF could trigger a wave of institutional capital. This influx of funds would not only boost XRP’s price but also lend immense credibility to the asset. It signifies a regulatory stamp of approval, assuring investors of its legitimacy and compliance with financial standards. Navigating the Path to XRP ETF Approval: Challenges and Opportunities While optimism is high, the journey to XRP ETF approval is not without its hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains a key challenge for the entire crypto industry. The ongoing legal battles involving various cryptocurrencies, including past disputes surrounding Ripple itself, underscore the complexities involved. However, the positive outcome of Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC has significantly bolstered confidence in XRP’s legal standing as a non-security in certain contexts. The SEC’s rigorous review process for spot ETFs involves strict criteria related to market surveillance, investor protection, and preventing market manipulation. Meeting these stringent requirements is crucial for any applicant. The fact that major asset managers are submitting applications suggests they believe these challenges can be overcome, presenting a significant opportunity for market growth. XRP and White House Reserves: A Vision for the Future Perhaps the most intriguing part of Garlinghouse’s statement is the possibility of XRP being added to the White House’s reserve assets. This concept suggests a profound recognition of XRP’s potential as a valuable digital asset at a national level. While still speculative, such an inclusion would elevate XRP’s status beyond a mere investment vehicle, positioning it as a strategic national asset. This could signify a future where digital assets play a more integrated role in national financial strategies. For XRP, known for its efficiency in cross-border payments, this could mean its underlying technology is recognized for its utility in modernizing global financial infrastructure. The vision painted by Garlinghouse is one where XRP’s utility extends to national economic stability and innovation. In conclusion, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s confident outlook on XRP ETF approval paints a compelling picture for the future of XRP. His belief in an inevitable launch by year-end, coupled with the potential for inclusion in White House reserves, highlights XRP’s growing significance. As the SEC continues its review of applications from major financial institutions, the crypto community watches closely. This pivotal moment could redefine XRP’s role in both investment portfolios and national financial frameworks, ushering in a new era of digital asset adoption.

A spot XRP ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product that directly holds XRP, allowing investors to gain exposure to its price movements without needing to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. It trades on traditional stock exchanges. Why is Ripple CEO confident about XRP ETF approval? Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is confident due to the increasing institutional interest from major asset managers applying for an XRP ETF , the precedent set by recent Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals, and the evolving regulatory landscape. How would an XRP ETF benefit investors? An XRP ETF would offer investors a regulated, accessible, and convenient way to invest in XRP through traditional brokerage accounts, potentially increasing liquidity and attracting significant institutional capital to the asset. What are the main challenges for XRP ETF approval? Key challenges include navigating complex regulatory hurdles, meeting stringent SEC requirements for market surveillance and investor protection, and addressing ongoing legal and classification issues surrounding cryptocurrencies. Could XRP really be added to White House reserves? While currently speculative, Garlinghouse’s statement suggests a future where XRP’s utility and value could be recognized at a national level, potentially leading to its inclusion in strategic national reserve assets, given its efficiency in cross-border payments. When is an XRP ETF expected to launch? Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse anticipates that a spot XRP ETF could potentially launch by the end of the current year, though this is an expectation and subject to regulatory approval processes.

The Layer 2 platform finalized its mainnet upgrade using OP Succinct, completing its transition into a full ZK Rollup. With over $2 billion locked, Mantle is now the largest ZK rollup by total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. This is more than a technical win. It marks a repositioning of Mantle as the leading “liquidity chain” designed for the next era of decentralized finance, real-world assets (RWA), and institutional adoption. The Biggest ZK Rollup Live The upgrade shifts Mantle into a category of its own. By integrating OP Succinct, the chain inherits the efficiency of optimistic rollups with the security of zero-knowledge proofs. At the time of writing, Mantle holds over $2 billion in TVL, surpassing competitors like zkSync and StarkNet. The combination of scale and security positions Mantle as the most advanced ZK-powered Layer 2 live on Ethereum today. Mantle’s official account summed it up simply: “We’ve completed the final upgrade. Succinct powers the largest ZK rollup live” D-Day: A defining moment for Mantle Network. We’ve upgraded to @SuccinctLabs 's OP Succinct on Mainnet, becoming the first OP Stack L2 to launch as a ZK Validity Rollup — and the largest ZK rollup by TVL. The Liquidity Chain is evolving. pic.twitter.com/QV8EgzVC1Q — Mantle (@Mantle_Official) September 16, 2025 Security and Decentralization First Mantle’s new architecture strengthens its security model. Validators and relayers now operate as separate components, reducing systemic risk. If one part is compromised, the rest of the system remains secure. ZK proofs add cryptographic finality, while Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) staking distributes control across a broader set of participants. This dual-layer approach makes Mantle harder to attack compared to traditional Layer 2s that centralize key functions. According to @0xTindorr, “Mantle just upgraded into the most institution-ready rollup” $MNT just got a major structural upgrade. Mantle is now the largest ZK rollup live, powered by Succinct. This isn’t just a technical milestone, it’s a shift in @Mantle_Official 's positioning: 1/ Security & decentralization Validators and relayers are separated, meaning an… pic.twitter.com/UOEzikPauk — Tindorr (@0xTindorr) September 17, 2025 Built for Institutions Institutions demand certainty. With 1-hour finality and 12-hour withdrawals, Mantle now offers stronger guarantees for funds moving across its bridge. This matters. Previous L2 bridges have suffered high-profile exploits due to reliance on a single validator set. Mantle’s separation of roles and proof-based settlement makes its bridge design far more resilient to the kind of systemic failures that shook confidence in 2022 and 2023. For enterprises and DeFi protocols considering tokenized real-world assets, these assurances are critical. They provide the compliance-grade reliability needed for corporate treasuries, lending desks, and asset managers to participate. Strategic Positioning: The Liquidity Chain This upgrade is not just about engineering. It is about Mantle staking its claim as the chain of liquidity. Backed by Bybit and its vast reserves, Mantle has both the capital and the ecosystem incentives to seed deep liquidity pools. That liquidity is the magnet for developers building DeFi applications, RWA protocols, and institutional trading rails. In other words, Mantle is positioning itself as the infrastructure backbone for the next cycle of crypto growth, a cycle expected to be dominated by RWAs, regulated DeFi, and institutional capital inflows. The timing is significant. Layer 2 narratives are rotating back into focus. Base has been teasing its token, and competition among rollups is heating up. In that context, Mantle stands out as the “serious” option, not just for retail speculation, but for institutions looking for reliable rails. End users may not immediately notice the changes under the hood. But trust in infrastructure is built slowly. Each upgrade and each security feature adds to a chain’s credibility. For institutions that watched billions vanish in bridge hacks over the last cycle, those assurances will be decisive. $MNT Hits New All-Time High Markets have already responded. $MNT broke past $1.75, hitting a fresh all-time high. The move pushed Mantle’s fully diluted valuation to $10.5 billion, per CoinMarketCap. Among Layer 2 tokens in 2025, Mantle is in the lead: The only L2 token to break an all-time high this year The deepest treasury among Layer 2s One of the largest fully diluted valuations in the sector The biggest and most active ecosystem in the rollup space This valuation gap against peers presents asymmetric upside if Mantle secures the institutional and RWA lane. @Dropstab\_com highlighted Mantle’s surge in activity following the upgrade @Mantle_Official price hits a new all-time high, breaking above $1.75 and reaching a $10.5B fully diluted valuation. Previously, $MNT was marked as undervalued by #VWAP Radar on Dropstab and included in @Grayscale list of assets under consideration for investment products… https://t.co/JStprtmiot pic.twitter.com/TwcwisuuQT — DropsTab (@Dropstab_com) September 17, 2025 Mantle’s transition into a ZK rollup is not just a technical detail. It signals where the chain wants to sit in the broader Ethereum ecosystem. By solving bridge risks, tightening security, and prioritizing institutional readiness, Mantle is making a long bet on the next phase of adoption. While retail users may continue to flock to meme-driven L2s, Mantle is building for the other side of the curve, the institutions, enterprises, and protocols that will bring trillions in real-world value on-chain. In 2025, with over $2B TVL, a record $MNT valuation, and the most institution-ready infrastructure in the L2 landscape, Mantle is no longer just another rollup. It is the liquidity chain.

This is the question driving many investors to update their watchlists and study the Top New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. Market volatility is higher than ever, with meme tokens swinging wildly while utility chains like Hedera solidify their enterprise roles. The balance between hype and utility creates an intriguing landscape for anyone seeking both stability and explosive growth. Hedera ($HBAR) continues to strengthen its reputation as an enterprise-ready network. Its hashgraph insights reveal an architecture that prioritizes security, speed, and fairness. With Hedera enterprise use-cases expanding into payments, supply chains, and tokenized assets, it has carved out a clear lane in the blockchain industry. Yet, while Hedera attracts institutions, investors hungry for life-changing ROI are increasingly focused on BullZilla ($BZIL) presale mechanics and the viral momentum of its community-driven ecosystem. Positioned as one of the Top New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025, BullZilla combines narrative hype with deflationary supply to create a compelling case for meme coin believers. BullZilla ($BZIL): Presale Advantage and Momentum BullZilla is engineered to dominate the meme coin narrative. Unlike traditional fixed-stage presales, it employs a stage cadence where prices automatically rise with every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours. This ensures urgency and rewards early believers. For meme coin hunters seeking the Top New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025, this structure provides both transparency and FOMO. Currently, BullZilla is in its 3rd Stage (404: Whale Signal Detected) during Phase 2 of its roadmap. The token is priced at $0.00006574, with more than 26 billion tokens sold, 1,600+ holders onboarded, and a presale tally above $460,000. The next surge will lift the price to $0.00007241, a 10.14% increase. Early believers at Stage 3B already secured ROI of 1,043.30%, while current buyers still target a listing ROI of 7,918.57% at $0.00527. Consider the investment math: a $1,000 entry now secures 15.211 million tokens, potentially worth over $80,000 at launch. A larger $50,000 stake captures over 760 million tokens, translating to an even greater return if BullZilla meets its targets. With BZIL detail showing that 3 billion tokens sold within the first four hours of launch, the momentum is undeniable. For those looking at 1000x meme coin research, BullZilla remains at the top of the discussion. Ethereum Forged Meme: A New Breed of Hype What sets Bull Zilla apart is its Ethereum foundation. Unlike many meme tokens, it leverages Ethereum’s liquidity, infrastructure, and security while layering on a cinematic 24-chapter storyline. Every chapter ends with a Roar Burn, permanently destroying tokens and creating deflationary scarcity. This isn’t just a technical feature—it’s a community spectacle that fuels hype across social channels. Combined with 70% APY staking, referral bonuses through the Roarblood Vault, and visible burns, BullZilla has developed a sustainable cycle of growth. For investors scanning the meme coin trend 2025, this Ethereum-powered presale looks more like a carefully architected system than a speculative gamble. It’s why so many now call it one of the Top New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. Hedera ($HBAR): Price Analysis and Utility Hedera is the other half of this equation. Trading at $0.2358, it carries a market cap of $9.99 billion and a 24-hour volume of $209.43 million. In the past 24 hours, it dipped 0.53%, but over the last week it gained 1.56%. The monthly chart shows a 1.9% decline, while yearly performance reflects a staggering 374.98% increase. Despite being 43.35% below its all-time high of $0.5701 (September 2021), Hedera’s growth trajectory suggests resilience. Its all-time low of $0.01001 (January 2020) now feels like ancient history given its adoption curve. Much of Hedera’s momentum comes from Hedera enterprise use-cases, where real-world organizations employ its consensus service for financial applications, supply chain transparency, and asset tokenization. According to official network data, Hedera consistently processes thousands of transactions per second, delivering finality in seconds. These hashgraph insights underscore its technical edge over traditional blockchains. Looking ahead 6–12 months, analysts suggest Hedera could retest the $0.30–$0.35 zone if enterprise adoption continues to scale. Investors describe Hedera like a hawk gliding across turbulent skies: steady, sharp, and reliable. For risk-averse investors, Hedera offers predictability; for those chasing moonshots, it feels like a safer harbor than meme-driven tokens. Yet Hedera lacks the viral narrative of meme projects, making it less likely to deliver 1000x meme coin research outcomes. Conclusion Based on our research and the Hedera market trends, it’s clear both projects play pivotal but very different roles. Hedera remains an enterprise favorite with deep hashgraph insights, consistent adoption, and technical superiority for Hedera enterprise use-cases. Its growth trajectory is sustainable, and its upside lies in continued mainstream integration. BullZilla, however, is built for meme coin believers who want more than just hype. With stage cadence driving FOMO, presale momentum already above $460,000, and ROI projections north of 7,900%, it’s no wonder it tops lists of the Top New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025. The urgency is real: every 48 hours or $100K raised pushes the price higher. Staking yields, referral rewards, and game-themed tokenomics make BullZilla not just another presale, but a full ecosystem in the making. For those tracking the meme coin trend 2025, BullZilla is a candidate impossible to ignore.

Currently, all eyes are on Asia FX and the steady US Dollar , as markets diligently digest the implications of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts while simultaneously anticipating crucial policy decisions from the Bank of Japan. For anyone tracking global economics or engaged in currency trading, understanding these intricate dynamics is not just beneficial—it’s essential for navigating the complex currents of the global financial landscape. This article will unravel these intricate threads, providing clarity on the forces shaping currency valuations and broader global markets . Decoding the Muted Movement: Why is Asia FX Holding Steady? Despite significant chatter around global monetary policy, many Asian currencies have displayed a relatively muted reaction. This calm before the potential storm can be attributed to several factors, creating a complex environment for traders and investors. The region’s diverse economies each face unique domestic pressures, yet a common thread of caution ties them together as they await clearer signals from major central banks. Key Aspects of Asia FX Stability: Anticipatory Stance: Many Asian central banks are in a ‘wait-and-see’ mode, holding their policy rates steady to assess the full impact of global monetary tightening and potential easing cycles. This preemptive pause prevents drastic short-term volatility in their respective currencies. Diverse Economic Fundamentals: While some Asian economies, like India and Indonesia, exhibit robust domestic demand, others, such as China, grapple with internal challenges. This diversity means that not all Asian currencies react uniformly to external shocks, leading to a more averaged, muted regional performance. Intervention Measures: Several central banks in Asia have historically intervened in currency markets to manage excessive volatility, particularly against the US Dollar . This readiness to intervene can dampen sharp movements, contributing to a sense of stability. Trade Balances and Capital Flows: For export-oriented economies, trade surpluses can provide a buffer against currency depreciation. However, the prospect of capital outflows, particularly if the Fed rate cut makes other markets more attractive, remains a challenge. Consider the Japanese Yen (JPY), often a bellwether for Asian currencies. Its performance is heavily influenced by the Bank of Japan’s ultra-loose policy. The Chinese Yuan (CNY) is managed within a band, reflecting China’s economic health and policy priorities. Other currencies like the Korean Won (KRW), Singapore Dollar (SGD), and Indian Rupee (INR) are influenced by their respective growth trajectories, inflation rates, and foreign investment flows. The current muted state of Asia FX reflects a delicate balance of these internal and external forces, creating a challenging yet potentially rewarding environment for astute investors. The Profound Impact of a Potential Fed Rate Cut : What’s at Stake for Global Markets? The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions are arguably the single most influential factor in global finance. Speculation around a Fed rate cut has been a dominant theme, driving market sentiment and shaping expectations for everything from bond yields to currency valuations. A shift in the Fed’s stance carries profound implications, particularly for the US Dollar and capital flows into and out of emerging markets. Understanding the Mechanics of a Fed Rate Cut: When the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark interest rate, it typically aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper. However, the ripple effects extend far beyond domestic borders: Weakening the US Dollar: Lower interest rates reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets, potentially leading to a depreciation of the US Dollar against other major currencies. This can make U.S. exports cheaper and imports more expensive. Boosting Risk Appetite: A weaker dollar and lower U.S. yields can encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including emerging market equities and bonds. This can lead to capital inflows into Asian economies, potentially strengthening their currencies. Alleviating Debt Burdens: Many countries and corporations, especially in emerging markets, hold dollar-denominated debt. A weaker dollar makes it cheaper to service these debts, providing significant relief and potentially freeing up capital for domestic investment. Inflationary Pressures: While a rate cut aims to stimulate growth, it can also contribute to inflationary pressures, particularly if global demand picks up and commodity prices rise. This presents a challenge for central banks trying to maintain price stability. The anticipation of a Fed rate cut creates both opportunities and challenges. For instance, a stronger influx of capital into Asia could boost local equity markets and support economic growth. However, it also brings the challenge of managing potential asset bubbles and increased currency volatility. The delicate balance for policymakers lies in harnessing the positive aspects while mitigating the risks associated with such significant shifts in global monetary policy. The ultimate impact on global markets will depend on the pace, magnitude, and underlying reasons for any Fed easing. Navigating the Dominance: Will the US Dollar Maintain its Strength? The US Dollar has long held its position as the world’s primary reserve currency, a testament to the strength and stability of the U.S. economy and financial system. Its dominance is a key factor influencing currency markets worldwide, including Asia FX . However, the prospect of a Fed rate cut raises questions about whether this strength is sustainable or if a period of depreciation is on the horizon. Factors Influencing US Dollar Strength: The dollar’s resilience stems from a combination of fundamental and psychological factors: Safe-Haven Appeal: During times of global economic uncertainty or geopolitical tension, investors flock to the dollar as a safe haven, pushing its value higher. This demand often overrides interest rate differentials in moments of crisis. Economic Resilience: The U.S. economy has often demonstrated greater resilience compared to other major economies, supported by strong labor markets and consumer spending. Robust economic data can underpin dollar strength even as other central banks contemplate easing. Interest Rate Differentials: Higher interest rates in the U.S. relative to other major economies (like Japan or the Eurozone) attract capital seeking better returns, thus strengthening the dollar through carry trades. A Fed rate cut could erode this advantage. Global Trade and Finance: A significant portion of international trade and financial transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. This structural demand provides a continuous floor for the currency’s value, regardless of short-term policy shifts. The interplay between these factors is crucial. While a Fed rate cut would theoretically weaken the dollar by reducing its yield advantage, its safe-haven status and the relative strength of the U.S. economy could temper any significant decline. For global markets , a weakening dollar could signal a broader risk-on environment, benefiting commodities and emerging market assets. Conversely, a stronger dollar could tighten financial conditions globally, posing challenges for countries with dollar-denominated debt and potentially dampening commodity prices. Traders and investors must carefully monitor economic indicators and central bank rhetoric to anticipate the dollar’s trajectory. Anticipating the BOJ Policy Shift: A Game Changer for Japanese Yen and Beyond? While the Federal Reserve’s actions garner significant attention, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stands out with its unique and long-standing ultra-loose monetary policy. For years, the BOJ has maintained negative interest rates and yield curve control (YCC) to combat deflation. However, rising inflation and wage growth in Japan have fueled speculation about an imminent shift in BOJ policy , a move that could be a significant game changer for the Japanese Yen (JPY) and reverberate across global markets , especially Asia FX . Potential Implications of a BOJ Policy Shift: Yen Volatility: An end to negative rates or YCC would likely lead to a significant strengthening of the Japanese Yen. For years, the Yen has been used as a funding currency for carry trades due to its low interest rates. A policy shift could unwind these trades, leading to sharp JPY appreciation. Impact on Global Bonds: Japanese investors are major holders of foreign bonds, particularly U.S. Treasuries. If domestic yields rise due to a BOJ policy change, these investors might repatriate capital, potentially driving up bond yields in other major economies. Regional Currency Spillover: A stronger Yen could indirectly impact other Asia FX currencies. Some might appreciate against the dollar if capital flows shift towards Asia, while others might face competitive pressures if Japan’s exports become more expensive. Domestic Economic Challenges: While a policy shift signals confidence in Japan’s economy, it also presents challenges. Higher borrowing costs could impact heavily indebted companies and the government. The BOJ must carefully manage the transition to avoid disrupting economic recovery. The BOJ’s cautious approach underscores the complexity of exiting an extended period of unconventional monetary policy. Any adjustment to the BOJ policy will be closely scrutinized, not just for its immediate effect on the Yen but for its broader implications for global capital flows, interest rate differentials, and overall market stability. For traders, the BOJ’s upcoming decisions represent a critical inflection point, demanding careful analysis and strategic positioning to capitalize on or hedge against potential market movements. Beyond Currencies: How Central Bank Decisions Reshape Global Markets The decisions made by central banks, whether it’s a potential Fed rate cut or a shift in BOJ policy , extend their influence far beyond currency pairs. These monetary policy adjustments fundamentally reshape the landscape of global markets , affecting equities, commodities, and bonds alike. Understanding these broader implications is crucial for investors seeking to navigate the interconnected financial ecosystem. Wider Market Implications: Equities: A Fed rate cut typically signals lower borrowing costs for companies, which can boost corporate earnings and make equities more attractive, potentially leading to market rallies. Conversely, a stronger US Dollar can make U.S. exports less competitive, impacting earnings for multinational corporations. Commodities: Commodities, often priced in U.S. dollars, tend to become more affordable for buyers using other currencies when the US Dollar weakens. This can stimulate demand and push up commodity prices, particularly for oil and precious metals like gold. A stronger dollar has the opposite effect. Bonds: Bond yields are directly influenced by central bank rates. A Fed rate cut would generally lead to lower U.S. Treasury yields, while a BOJ policy shift towards tightening could push Japanese government bond yields higher, creating ripple effects across global bond markets. Capital Flows: Changes in interest rate differentials, driven by central bank policies, dictate the direction of global capital flows. Money tends to move from lower-yielding to higher-yielding assets, influencing asset prices and currency strength in various regions, including Asia FX . Actionable Insights for Investors: In this dynamic environment, investors should consider: Diversification: Spreading investments across different asset classes and geographies can mitigate risks associated with specific central bank actions. Hedging Strategies: Utilizing currency hedges can protect portfolios from adverse currency movements, especially when dealing with international investments. Monitoring Economic Indicators: Keeping a close watch on inflation, employment data, and GDP growth in major economies provides clues about future central bank actions. Sector-Specific Analysis: Certain sectors (e.g., technology, export-oriented industries) may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and currency fluctuations than others. The current period demands vigilance and adaptability. The interplay of major central bank policies, particularly concerning the Fed rate cut and BOJ policy , will continue to be a primary driver for global markets . Understanding these intricate connections allows investors to make more informed decisions and position themselves strategically in a constantly evolving financial landscape. Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of Global Monetary Policy The global financial landscape is currently at a critical juncture, defined by the intricate dance between major central banks. The muted reaction in Asia FX , the steady presence of the US Dollar , and the anticipation surrounding both a potential Fed rate cut and a pivotal BOJ policy shift underscore a period of profound uncertainty and immense opportunity. These central bank decisions are not isolated events; they are deeply interconnected threads that weave the fabric of global markets , influencing everything from bond yields to commodity prices and equity valuations. For investors, traders, and anyone keen on understanding the future trajectory of finance, staying informed is paramount. The benefits of anticipating these shifts include strategic positioning and risk mitigation, while the challenges lie in navigating increased volatility and the complex interplay of diverse economic fundamentals. As we move forward, the vigilance of market participants will be tested. The ability to interpret central bank signals and understand their ripple effects will be key to unlocking success in this dynamic environment.

51913852,https://nulltx.com/?p=152152,1758180203,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,CME Group Adds XRP and Solana Options After Record $942M and $895M Open Interest,https://nulltx.com/cme-group-adds-xrp-and-solana-options-after-record-942m-and-895m-open-interest/,"CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives marketplace, is expanding its crypto offerings once again. On October 13, 2025, pending regulatory approval, the exchange will launch options on XRP and Solana (SOL) futures. The move comes on the back of record open interest in both assets, signaling deepening institutional appetite beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The next step in regulated crypto trading is almost here. Get ready for: Options on SOL, Micro SOL, XRP and Micro XRP futures. Trading at Settlement (TAS) mechanism on SOL and Micro SOL futures. https://t.co/ZL7c0fNUnh pic.twitter.com/N37cGDZAmn — CME Group (@CMEGroup) September 17, 2025 The new lineup will include SOL, Micro SOL, XRP, and Micro XRP futures options, with expiries available on a daily, monthly, and quarterly basis. This gives market participants more flexibility in managing risk and gaining exposure to two of the most traded cryptocurrencies outside the top two majors. Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products at CME Group, said the decision builds on “the significant growth and increasing liquidity” that Solana and XRP futures have demonstrated since their launch earlier this year. The products are designed to cater to a growing institutional base that requires structured instruments to hedge portfolios, manage risk, and capture trading opportunities in altcoins. Institutional Support The move has already received strong backing from major trading firms. Cumberland, a leading liquidity provider, said the expansion shows rising demand beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, reflecting how institutions are diversifying their digital asset exposure. FalconX, another heavyweight in institutional crypto trading, pointed out the increasing presence of Solana and XRP in digital asset treasuries. The firm called CME’s new contracts a critical tool for hedging and managing large-scale positions. With backing from these players, CME’s latest addition is more than just a new product, it represents a shift in how institutions are starting to view altcoins as core parts of their strategies. Trading Data: Momentum in Solana and XRP The data tells the story. Solana (SOL): Since launch in March, more than 540,000 contracts have traded, representing $22.3 billion notional. In August alone, daily volume peaked at 9,000 contracts ($437.4M), while open interest climbed to 12,500 contracts ($895M). XRP: Since its debut in May, XRP futures have seen over 370,000 contracts traded, equal to $16.2 billion notional. In August, daily volume hit 6,600 contracts ($385M), with open interest reaching a record 9,300 contracts ($942M). These numbers highlight the rapid institutional adoption of both assets. In less than a year, Solana and XRP have carved out a meaningful share of the derivatives market, challenging the long-standing dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. What This CME Launch On XRP and Solana Means The launch of options on XRP and Solana futures could serve as a bullish catalyst for both assets. Options markets play a crucial role in improving liquidity, risk management, and price discovery. Here’s why it matters: New hedging tools: Institutions gain instruments beyond spot and futures, enabling more sophisticated risk management. Boost in liquidity: More participation deepens order books and reduces slippage. Legitimacy: CME’s listing strengthens the case for Solana and XRP as institutional-grade assets, not just retail-driven coins. Future ETFs: The step could pave the way for potential spot ETFs on altcoins, following the same path Bitcoin and Ethereum have taken. As one analyst put it, “Options on Solana and XRP make them look less like speculative tokens and more like part of a maturing asset class.” CME to launch options on Solana & XRP futures starting Oct 13, 2025 Why it matters: •Gives institutions new hedging tools (beyond spot/futures) •Boosts liquidity & price discovery •Adds legitimacy to SOL & XRP beyond BTC/ETH •Could pave the way for spot ETFs on altcoins… pic.twitter.com/3bGUtrlTrX — Constantin Kogan (@constkogan) September 17, 2025 While the expansion is seen as bullish, there are risks worth noting. Options markets often bring sharper volatility and the possibility of over-leverage, especially during the early trading phases. Some critics warn that the hype could overshadow deeper issues. For Solana, decentralization concerns continue to surface, particularly around validator concentration and network stability. For XRP, regulatory uncertainty lingers, despite Ripple’s recent legal victories. In short, while the products add credibility, they also create new dynamics that could magnify both gains and losses. Conclusion CME Group’s decision to launch XRP and Solana options marks another step in its strategy to broaden crypto derivatives. With record open interest already in place and strong backing from institutional players, the timing underscores just how far both tokens have come. The expansion not only legitimizes Solana and XRP in the eyes of Wall Street but also signals the beginning of a new phase where altcoins play a more significant role in institutional portfolios. A big step toward SOL and XRP becoming institutional-grade assets. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

That future might be closer than you think! A groundbreaking analysis suggests that as many as 100 crypto ETFs could hit the market within the next 12 months. This anticipated surge follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent approval of new, more relaxed listing standards, signaling a significant shift in the accessibility of cryptocurrency investments for everyday investors. What’s Driving This Predicted Surge in Crypto ETFs? This optimistic forecast comes from Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, who draws parallels to a previous regulatory shift in traditional finance. Balchunas referenced data shared by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, highlighting a similar phenomenon that occurred after the SEC adopted new ETF regulations in late 2019. Following those changes, the number of traditional finance ETF launches saw an incredible boost, soaring from approximately 117 to 370 annually. The expectation is that crypto ETFs will follow a comparable trajectory. The core reason behind this projected boom is the SEC’s evolving stance. By easing the listing standards, the regulatory body is effectively opening the floodgates for financial institutions to offer regulated investment products tied to cryptocurrencies. This move reduces the hurdles for fund providers, making it easier and more attractive for them to bring innovative crypto-focused products to market. Consequently, investors stand to benefit from a wider array of choices and potentially more secure investment avenues. Why are Crypto ETFs a Game Changer for Investors? The potential launch of numerous crypto ETFs is truly a game-changer for several reasons. For many, direct investment in cryptocurrencies can feel complex and intimidating due to concerns about custody, security, and navigating exchanges. ETFs offer a streamlined solution, allowing investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning or managing them. Here are some key benefits: Enhanced Accessibility: Investors can buy and sell shares of crypto ETFs through traditional brokerage accounts, just like stocks or other ETFs, making them accessible to a much broader audience. Regulatory Oversight: Being regulated products, these ETFs offer a layer of investor protection and transparency that might be perceived as lacking in the direct crypto market. Diversification Opportunities: Some ETFs might track a basket of cryptocurrencies, providing instant diversification across the digital asset landscape without needing to purchase individual coins. Professional Management: ETFs are managed by financial professionals, potentially reducing the burden of active portfolio management for individual investors. This shift represents a maturation of the cryptocurrency market, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. Navigating the Future of Crypto ETFs: Opportunities and Challenges While the prospect of 100 new crypto ETFs is exciting, it is important for investors to consider both the opportunities and potential challenges. The increased availability of these products will undoubtedly lead to greater market participation and could drive further institutional interest in the crypto space. It also suggests a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. However, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile. Even within a regulated ETF structure, the underlying assets are subject to significant price swings. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence and understand the specific investment objectives and risks associated with each ETF. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape, while evolving, is still relatively nascent. Future regulatory changes could impact the performance and structure of these funds. The next year promises to be a pivotal period for the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. As more crypto ETFs come online, they will undoubtedly reshape how individuals and institutions engage with this dynamic market. Summary: A New Era for Crypto Investing The analysis predicting up to 100 crypto ETFs within the next year marks a thrilling new chapter for digital asset investing. Fueled by relaxed SEC listing rules and a clear precedent from traditional finance, this potential influx of regulated products promises to make cryptocurrency exposure more accessible, secure, and diversified for a wider range of investors. While opportunities abound, understanding the inherent market volatility and evolving regulatory environment remains crucial. This development is set to transform the investment landscape, inviting both seasoned and new investors to explore the exciting potential of the crypto market through a more familiar vehicle. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto ETFs? Crypto ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment funds that trade on traditional stock exchanges and track the price of one or more cryptocurrencies. They allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly buying and holding the underlying cryptocurrency. Why is the SEC’s approval of new listing standards important for crypto ETFs? The SEC’s approval of new listing standards simplifies the process for financial institutions to launch and list crypto-related investment products. This regulatory clarity and reduced barrier to entry are expected to encourage a significant increase in the number of available crypto ETFs. How do crypto ETFs benefit investors compared to direct crypto ownership? Crypto ETFs offer benefits such as easier access through traditional brokerage accounts, a layer of regulatory oversight, potential for diversification through baskets of cryptocurrencies, and professional management, all without the complexities of direct crypto custody and security. What are the main risks associated with investing in crypto ETFs? The primary risks include the inherent volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency market, which can lead to significant price fluctuations for the ETF. Additionally, the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies could introduce new challenges or changes impacting these funds. When can we expect these new crypto ETFs to launch? According to the analyst’s prediction, up to 100 new crypto ETFs could launch within the next 12 months, following the SEC’s recent approval of new listing standards.

While Cardano (ADA) keeps showing strong performance in the market, and Dogecoin (DOGE) keeps holding onto community-led speculation, a new token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is building something much larger. Unlike speculative memecoins, Mutuum Finance is building real utility in the shape of its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol as it positions itself to be a fundamentals-driven project that will go way, way beyond the $1 threshold. As the market anticipates the next cycle, the following three coins, Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are gaining traction for their potential surge to $10 by 2028 but MUTM’s unique value proposition shines extremely brightly. Cardano Holds Firm Amid Market Turbulence Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.86 currently, level with the rest of the market as investors weigh in upcoming network upgrades against shifting macroeconomic trends. Cardano (ADA) retains its place as one of the flagship layer-1 projects focused on scalability and sustainability, but market participants are increasingly turning towards newer protocols with stronger growth drivers, and Mutuum Finance stands as a better choice in the DeFi market as it evolves. Dogecoin Halts After Rally as Market Considers Next Step Dogecoin (DOGE) is at $0.27, still considerably above its recent level of support after a very active rally. There is resistance at $0.30, and support at the $0.22-$0.25 level, which means probable consolidation unless new buying pressure is seen. Volume has reduced somewhat, suggesting some profit-taking by traders as they await better signals. In comparison to DOGE, analysts are now equating Mutuum Finance as having greater potential for gains. Mutuum Finance: Phase 6 Mark Presale Mutuum Finance has enjoyed a phenomenal level of traction in presale with more than 16,370 investors buying coins and more than $15.9 million raised thus far. Tokens can be bought in Phase 6 at $0.035 per token. Its tiered system is a rewards scheme and the individuals who arrive early are entitled to maximum rewards. Expansion and Community Rewards Mutuum Finance’s ultimate vision is to revolutionize the DeFi model the way it exists presently. Other than that, the project is also promoting early adoption through a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 participants will receive a $10,000 MUTM reward. Stablecoin Development with Security and Credibility Other than its general development of an ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will launch a USD stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Compared to algorithmic stablecoins that have depegged during times of financial duress, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be seen as non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and is hence able to maintain its peg during financial stress. The mechanism leverages the resilience of idle collateral reservoirs for long-term stability with value preservation assurance. This makes the stablecoin a safe unit of exchange, and a safe store of value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be the best 2025 altcoin play, with 10x in the wings for early-in investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is bursting out from sub-$1 cryptos, with a lot more than hype-driven momentum to provide. At Phase 6 presale worth $0.035, the venture has gained $15.9M in capital from 16,370+ buyers, and early buyers are set for top-of-the-line returns as costs rise in later stages. Backed by a $100K giveaway, an upcoming overcollateralized USD stablecoin, and a lending protocol based on a P2C and P2P model, MUTM marries in-world utility with upside potential. While ADA and DOGE grab headlines, MUTM’s fundamentals and early momentum positions it among altcoins set to hit the $10 mark by 2028. Lock up your tokens today at $0.035 prior to Stage 7 pricing.

It’s a question that often sparks debate within the crypto community. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin recently stepped forward to defend the network’s approximately 45-day ETH unstaking period , asserting its crucial role in safeguarding the network’s integrity. This lengthy waiting time, while sometimes seen as an inconvenience, is a deliberate design choice with profound implications for security. Why is the ETH Unstaking Period a Vital Security Measure? Vitalik Buterin’s defense comes amidst comparisons to other networks, like Solana, which boast significantly shorter unstaking times. He drew a compelling parallel to military operations, explaining that an army cannot function effectively if its soldiers can simply abandon their posts at a moment’s notice. Similarly, a blockchain network requires a stable and committed validator set to maintain its security. The current ETH unstaking period isn’t merely an arbitrary delay. It acts as a critical buffer, providing the network with sufficient time to detect and respond to potential malicious activities. If validators could instantly exit, it would open doors for sophisticated attacks, jeopardizing the entire system. Currently, Ethereum boasts over one million active validators, collectively staking approximately 35.6 million ETH, representing about 30% of the total supply. This massive commitment underpins the network’s robust security model, and the unstaking period helps preserve this stability. Network Security: Ethereum’s Paramount Concern A shorter ETH unstaking period might seem appealing for liquidity, but it introduces significant risks. Imagine a scenario where a large number of validators, potentially colluding, could quickly withdraw their stake after committing a malicious act. Without a substantial delay, the network would have limited time to penalize them or mitigate the damage. This “exit queue” mechanism is designed to prevent sudden validator exodus, which could lead to: Reduced decentralization: A rapid drop in active validators could concentrate power among fewer participants. Increased vulnerability to attacks: A smaller, less stable validator set is easier to compromise. Network instability: Frequent and unpredictable changes in validator numbers can lead to performance issues and consensus failures. Therefore, the extended period is not a bug; it’s a feature. It’s a calculated trade-off between immediate liquidity for stakers and the foundational security of the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum vs. Solana: Different Approaches to Unstaking When discussing the ETH unstaking period , many point to networks like Solana, which offers a much quicker two-day unstaking process. While this might seem like an advantage for stakers seeking rapid access to their funds, it reflects fundamental differences in network architecture and security philosophies. Solana’s design prioritizes speed and immediate liquidity, often relying on different consensus mechanisms and validator economics to manage security risks. Ethereum, on the other hand, with its proof-of-stake evolution from proof-of-work, has adopted a more cautious approach to ensure its transition and long-term stability are uncompromised. Each network makes design choices based on its unique goals and threat models. Ethereum’s substantial value and its role as a foundational layer for countless dApps necessitate an extremely robust security posture, making the current unstaking duration a deliberate and necessary component. What Does the ETH Unstaking Period Mean for Stakers? For individuals and institutions staking ETH, understanding the ETH unstaking period is crucial for managing expectations and investment strategies. It means that while staking offers attractive rewards, it also comes with a commitment to the network’s long-term health. Here are key considerations for stakers: Liquidity Planning: Stakers should view their staked ETH as a longer-term commitment, not immediately liquid capital. Risk Management: The delay inherently reduces the ability to react quickly to market volatility with staked assets. Network Contribution: By participating, stakers contribute directly to the security and decentralization of Ethereum, reinforcing its value proposition. While the current waiting period may not be “optimal” in every sense, as Buterin acknowledged, simply shortening it without addressing the underlying security implications would be a dangerous gamble for the network’s reliability. In conclusion, Vitalik Buterin’s defense of the lengthy ETH unstaking period underscores a fundamental principle: network security cannot be compromised for the sake of convenience. It is a vital mechanism that protects Ethereum’s integrity, ensuring its stability and trustworthiness as a leading blockchain platform. This deliberate design choice, while requiring patience from stakers, ultimately fortifies the entire ecosystem against potential threats, paving the way for a more secure and reliable decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main reason for Ethereum’s long unstaking period? A1: The primary reason is network security. A lengthy ETH unstaking period prevents malicious actors from quickly withdrawing their stake after an attack, giving the network time to detect and penalize them, thus maintaining stability and integrity. Q2: How long is the current ETH unstaking period? A2: The current ETH unstaking period is approximately 45 days. This duration can fluctuate based on network conditions and the number of validators in the exit queue. Q3: How does Ethereum’s unstaking period compare to other blockchains? A3: Ethereum’s unstaking period is notably longer than some other networks, such as Solana, which has a two-day period. This difference reflects varying network architectures and security priorities. Q4: Does the unstaking period affect ETH stakers? A4: Yes, it means stakers need to plan their liquidity carefully, as their staked ETH is not immediately accessible. It encourages a longer-term commitment to the network, aligning staker interests with Ethereum’s stability. Q5: Could the ETH unstaking period be shortened in the future? A5: While Vitalik Buterin acknowledged the current period might not be “optimal,” any significant shortening would likely require extensive research and network upgrades to ensure security isn’t compromised. For now, the focus remains on maintaining robust network defenses. Found this article insightful?

Leading exchange Bithumb has made a monumental announcement that promises to redefine how users interact with their platform: the elimination of Bithumb trading fees for a substantial number of cryptocurrencies. This strategic move is poised to create a ripple effect across the industry, offering unprecedented opportunities for traders and potentially intensifying competition among exchanges. What Exactly is Bithumb Offering? Zero Bithumb Trading Fees! South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb recently announced a bold initiative: it will waive trading fees for 200 cryptocurrencies. This applies specifically to digital assets traded against the Korean won (KRW). The fee waiver became effective on September 18 and will continue until further notice. This means users can now execute trades for these specific assets without incurring any direct transaction costs, a significant change that could dramatically impact trading strategies and profitability. This initiative isn’t just a temporary promotion; the “until further notice” clause suggests a long-term strategic shift. For many traders, the cumulative cost of fees can erode profits, especially for frequent or high-volume activities. By removing these Bithumb trading fees , the exchange aims to foster a more dynamic and accessible trading environment. Why is Bithumb Waiving Trading Fees? The Strategic Play Bithumb’s decision to waive Bithumb trading fees is a clear strategic play in a highly competitive market. South Korea is home to some of the most active crypto traders globally, and exchanges constantly vie for market share. By eliminating fees, Bithumb likely aims to: Attract New Users: Zero fees are a powerful incentive for traders to switch platforms or open new accounts. Increase Trading Volume: Lower costs encourage more frequent trading, boosting liquidity on the exchange. Gain Competitive Advantage: This move puts pressure on rival exchanges, potentially sparking a “fee war” in the region. Enhance User Loyalty: Providing a cost-effective trading experience can build stronger relationships with existing users. This strategy could lead to a significant influx of traders, solidifying Bithumb’s position as a dominant player in the South Korean crypto landscape. It’s a calculated risk, betting that increased volume and user base will ultimately outweigh the direct revenue loss from fees. What Are the Benefits for You, the Trader? For individual and institutional traders alike, the waiver of Bithumb trading fees presents several compelling advantages: Reduced Trading Costs: This is the most direct benefit. Every trade executed on the 200 listed cryptocurrencies will now be free of charge, allowing traders to keep more of their profits. Enhanced Profit Margins: Without fees eating into returns, even small price movements can become more profitable, especially for scalping or high-frequency trading strategies. Greater Flexibility: Traders can experiment with different strategies or assets without worrying about accumulating substantial fee costs. This encourages exploration and diversification within their portfolios. Improved Liquidity: As more traders are drawn to the platform due to zero fees, the liquidity for the 200 listed cryptocurrencies is likely to improve, leading to tighter spreads and more efficient execution. This initiative essentially lowers the barrier to entry and ongoing costs for active participation in the crypto market, making Bithumb an even more attractive venue for digital asset transactions. Navigating the New Landscape: What Should Traders Consider? While the elimination of Bithumb trading fees is overwhelmingly positive, traders should still approach the market with a well-informed strategy. It is crucial to: Understand the Covered Assets: Verify which of the 200 cryptocurrencies align with your investment goals. Monitor Market Dynamics: Keep an eye on how this move affects liquidity and price action for the fee-waived assets. Increased activity might lead to higher volatility. Security Practices: Always prioritize the security of your funds, regardless of fee structures. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication. Long-Term Strategy: Consider how Bithumb might adapt its business model in the future if this fee waiver becomes permanent. This bold step by Bithumb marks a significant moment for the South Korean crypto market. It underscores the intense competition among exchanges and highlights the growing trend of user-centric incentives. For traders, it’s an opportunity to optimize strategies and potentially enhance profitability in a more cost-effective environment. In conclusion, Bithumb’s decision to waive trading fees for 200 cryptocurrencies is a game-changer. It not only offers immediate financial benefits to traders but also sets a new precedent in the competitive crypto exchange landscape. This move could reshape market dynamics, encourage greater participation, and ultimately foster a more vibrant and accessible digital asset ecosystem in South Korea. Frequently Asked Questions About Bithumb’s Fee Waiver Here are some common questions regarding Bithumb’s recent announcement: Which cryptocurrencies are included in the fee waiver? Bithumb has announced that 200 cryptocurrencies traded against the Korean won (KRW) are included in the fee waiver. The exact list can be found on Bithumb’s official website or announcement page. How long will the Bithumb trading fees waiver last? The fee waiver became effective on September 18 and will continue “until further notice.” This suggests a potentially long-term strategic decision, but users should stay updated with Bithumb’s official communications for any changes. Why is Bithumb waiving these fees? Bithumb’s primary motivation is likely to attract new users, increase trading volume, and gain a competitive edge in the highly saturated South Korean crypto market. It’s a strategic move to boost liquidity and user engagement. Are there any hidden costs or conditions associated with the zero Bithumb trading fees? Based on the announcement, the waiver applies specifically to trading fees for the listed cryptocurrencies against KRW. Other potential costs, such as withdrawal fees or network fees (for transferring crypto off the exchange), are typically separate and may still apply. Always review the exchange’s full fee schedule. How does this move affect other crypto exchanges in South Korea? This bold move by Bithumb could intensify competition among South Korean exchanges, potentially leading to similar fee reduction strategies from rivals to retain or attract users. It might spark a “fee war” in the region. Share This Insight! Did you find this information about Bithumb’s fee waiver helpful?

Recently, the spotlight has been firmly on ETH liquidations , which have reached an astonishing $116 million in just 24 hours. This massive wave of forced selling isn’t just a number; it represents a significant event for thousands of traders, highlighting the inherent risks of leveraged trading in volatile markets. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone navigating the complex world of digital assets. Unpacking the Scale of Recent ETH Liquidations Liquidations in crypto perpetual futures refer to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin, typically due to adverse price movements. In the last 24 hours, the sheer volume of ETH liquidations has been particularly striking, dwarfing those of other major cryptocurrencies and sending ripples across the market. Here’s a breakdown of the significant figures: Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $116 million liquidated, with 61.29% from long positions. This indicates many traders betting on higher ETH prices were caught by a downward movement. Bitcoin (BTC): Saw $55.27 million liquidated, also predominantly long positions (63.54%), signaling a broader market downturn impacting bullish bets. Solana (SOL): Experienced $25.19 million in liquidations. Interestingly, short positions accounted for 61.62%, suggesting traders betting on a price decrease were squeezed, a different dynamic than ETH and BTC. Why Such Massive ETH Liquidations Occurred The primary driver behind these significant ETH liquidations is often a combination of heightened market volatility and the widespread use of leverage. Leverage allows traders to open positions larger than their actual capital, amplifying both potential gains and losses. When a market moves unexpectedly against a highly leveraged position, even a small price shift can lead to rapid margin calls and subsequent liquidations. Several factors contribute to such dramatic events: Sudden Price Movements: A sharp, unexpected dip in ETH’s price can quickly push leveraged long positions into liquidation territory. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic concerns or regulatory news can impact overall crypto market sentiment, leading to sell-offs. Technical Breaches: Breaking key support levels on charts can trigger automated stop-loss orders and further selling pressure, accelerating the cascade. Navigating the Risks: Lessons from ETH Liquidations For individual traders, being on the wrong side of these ETH liquidations can be financially devastating. This reality underscores the critical importance of robust risk management strategies, especially when engaging in leveraged trading. Without proper planning, even experienced traders can fall victim to the market’s unpredictable nature. To help navigate these turbulent waters and mitigate risks, consider these actionable insights: Understand and Manage Leverage: Use leverage cautiously. It magnifies both profits and losses. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Essential tools to limit potential losses by automatically closing a position at a predetermined price. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all capital into a single asset. Spreading investments can cushion the blow from a downturn. Stay Informed and Analytical: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and sentiment. This helps anticipate shifts that could lead to more ETH liquidations . Never Trade More Than You Can Afford to Lose: A golden rule, especially pertinent in high-stakes crypto trading. The recent surge in ETH liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the unpredictable, yet exhilarating, nature of the cryptocurrency market. While it offers opportunities for significant gains, it also carries risks of substantial losses, particularly with leverage. Understanding these market mechanics and implementing sound risk management are paramount for anyone venturing into perpetual futures trading. Stay vigilant, informed, and trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations Here are some common questions about cryptocurrency liquidations: What are cryptocurrency liquidations? Cryptocurrency liquidations refer to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens automatically when a trader’s margin balance falls below a required level, usually due to adverse price movements. Why were ETH liquidations so high recently? High ETH liquidations were primarily driven by a combination of market volatility and the extensive use of leverage by traders. A sudden price dip can quickly trigger margin calls for highly leveraged long positions. What is the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations occur when traders betting on a price increase (long positions) are forced to close due to a price drop. Short liquidations happen when traders betting on a price decrease (short positions) are forced to close due to a price rise. How can traders protect themselves from liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by using leverage cautiously, implementing stop-loss orders, diversifying their portfolios, staying informed about market news, and never trading more than they can afford to lose. Does a high volume of ETH liquidations mean Ethereum’s price will keep falling? While a high volume of ETH liquidations often accompanies or follows a price dip, it doesn’t guarantee continued decline. The market can recover, and liquidations can sometimes even signal a temporary bottom before a rebound. However, it indicates significant bearish pressure in the short term.

In his message, Hilton emphasized that while upcoming economic announcements such as the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision attract attention, his focus is on ensuring that individuals with exposure to XRP and broader digital assets are prepared. He explained that market volatility is unavoidable and that investors need a structured plan to navigate both short-term fluctuations and long-term opportunities. Hilton made it clear that being prepared means understanding key personal investment details. He asked viewers to assess whether they know the exact number of XRP tokens they hold, their average acquisition cost, and the target price at which they intend to sell. According to him, these three components form the foundation of a disciplined approach that allows investors to remain confident during downturns rather than reacting emotionally to temporary declines. Holding XRP? You Need To Be Prepared! pic.twitter.com/ea1xiLns4i — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 16, 2025 Learning from Previous Market Conditions Hilton reminded his audience that the cryptocurrency market already faced difficult periods, particularly in 2022 and 2023, extending partly into 2024. He highlighted that XRP holders endured significant pressure during those years but also noted that positive developments are now emerging. However, he cautioned that challenges remain and that the market is not yet at its final stage of growth. By maintaining clarity on holdings, average cost, and profit targets, Hilton argued that XRP investors can resist fear-driven decisions. He described this process as crucial for weathering downturns and recognizing that fundamental factors have not changed even when market sentiment weakens. Hilton reaffirmed his belief that XRP holds one of the greatest opportunities in the digital asset sector, saying that he sees potential for the asset to grow by multiples ranging from 10x to as much as 50x in the future. Importance of Discipline and Long-Term Perspective Hilton also stressed the psychological side of investing, noting that many traders tend to live in the moment and react to immediate market movements. He stated that maintaining a plan with clear targets reduces the risk of panic and allows investors to focus on long-term financial objectives.

According to Hilton, the current global crypto market capitalization of nearly $4 trillion is likely to grow to $8 trillion or beyond in the future. For those who share that belief, he questioned why they would not continue accumulating assets during periods of weakness. He underscored that these decisions are personal and not financial advice, but made it clear that he personally continues to purchase assets on market dips. Hilton’s central message was consistent throughout his commentary: XRP holders must have a structured plan to manage their holdings. He believes that knowing one’s exact position size, cost basis, and sell targets allows investors to remain calm during volatility and better position themselves for long-term growth .

The token rallied after the announcement of a potential swap into Aster tokens, supporting the growing perpetual DEX platform. APX tokens became one of the top gainers for the past day, as they gained the spotlight for an eventual upgrade into Aster tokens. APX broke out to a new all-time peak, after trading at a lower range. The token pivoted after rebranding from Apollo and going through a prolonged bear market. APX became one of the day’s top gainers with 400% expansion, following the launch of the ASTER token and the expectation of a 1:1 swap. | Source: CoinGecko The main reason for the breakout is the launch of Aster Finance and the native ASTER token. The project announced APX holders will be able to upgrade and become part of a new trading ecosystem. ASTER is also in the initial stages of trading, going for price discovery. The newly launched token rose to $0.75 hours after its launch, gaining over 375% in the first day of trading. ASTER broke out above $1.3B market cap within hours. The tokens remain risky, as they still rely on the native Aster exchange, as well as other decentralized pairs. APX, ASTER rally after mention by CZ Zhao In addition to the Aster perpetual futures DEX launch, the two tokens gained exposure from a mention by Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao. He noted the initial ASTER rally, which also boosted APX traders. Well done! 👏 Good start. Keep building! pic.twitter.com/oMfOxfsBRS — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) September 17, 2025 A direct message about a newly launched token is rare, and Zhao showed his influence is still outsized when it comes to direct attention for tokens. Zhao avoid explicitly endorsing tokens, but even a brief mention is enough to accelerate the rally. Binance was already preparing to swap APX, through its Binance Alpha platform. From October 1, all APX tokens will be swapped into ASTER with a 1:1 ratio. However, the rally did not start until ASTER completed its TGE on September 17. The upcoming swap may mean both the APX and ASTER prices may move closer in price, suggesting the APX rally may continue, or ASTER may move downward to close the gap. The tokens rallied just a day after the launch of STBL on BNB Smart Chain, showing trader exuberance for projects in the Binance ecosystem, as Cryptopolitan reported . Aster DEX aims to rival Hyperliquid Aster is a newly growing market, which has been backed by APX Finance and Binance’s YziLabs. The perpetual futures DEX arrives on a market where Hyperliquid still rules the roost. In the past month, Hyperliquid kept gaining on Binance’s perpetual futures market, expanding to over 24% of the combined trading volume. Aster may attempt to rival Hyperliquid, gaining a personal boost from Zhao. Previously, Binance attempted to build a perpetual futures market, where Hyperliquid grabbed a more significant mindshare. Aster attempts to rebuild the model from scratch and possibly gain mindshare as an alternative perpetual futures DEX. Aster already locks in $1.31B in liquidity, with around $270M in monthly volumes, based on DeFi Llama data . The recent price action may boost the project’s visibility and mindshare. As part of the Binance ecosystem, Aster may have a different set of users, as crypto traders are still split by regions. As with other Binance Alpha and YziLabs assets, ASTER outperforms other token launches, attracting outsized activity. The rallies arrive just a day after BNB posted a new all-time peak, moving close to $1,000 . Following the APX and ASTER pumps, BNB continued its rally, breaking above $990 and preparing for four-digit records.

Bitcoin hit the $117k mark once again, while Ether is trading above $4,600. Ripple’s XRP has topped the $3.0 resistance and is now heading towards the $3.18 TLQ level. With XRP adoption growing, the coin could rally to a new all-time high soon. Fed cuts interest rate, first U.S. XRP ETF to launch today XRP is up by 2% in the last 24 hours and is now trading above $3 per coin. The positive performance comes after the United States Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it had lowered its benchmark rate range by 25 basis points to 4%-4.25%. According to the Fed, the rate cut comes as the economic growth in the first half of the year had moderated, while the job market had also slowed. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that there was no basis for a larger cut as he defended the Fed’s decision to wait till now to lower interest rates. Another factor behind XRP’s ongoing positive performance is the launch of the first U.S.-listed spot ETFs for XRP and DOGE later today, under the tickers XRPR and DOJE. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart pointed out that the ETFs aren’t pure spot products. Rather, the funds are designed to hold XRP and DOGE directly, while also investing in other spot ETFs from outside the US to achieve exposure. James Seyffart @JSeyff · Follow Replying to @StockMKTNewz This isn’t “pure” spot. But it will hold spot directly and other spot XRP ETFs from around the world to get its exposure.The fund documents also have language that would allow derivatives usage for exposure if needed but that definitely isn’t the primary exposure method 6:21 PM · Sep 15, 2025 18 Reply Copy link Read 4 replies CME has also revealed plans to boost its crypto derivatives lineup by listing options on XRP and Solana futures, from October 13th, pending regulatory review. According to the exchange, its decision to list the XRP and SOL futures is prompted by strong growth in its newer altcoin futures. XRP eyes $3.2 as bullish momentum gathers The XRP/USD 4-hour chart is bearish and efficient despite Ether topping the $3 mark a few hours ago. However, the momentum indicators are switching bullish, suggesting that buyers are regaining control of the market. The RSI of 55 shows that it is no longer in the bearish zone, with further upward movement to take it into the overbought region in the near term. The MACD lines have also crossed over into the positive territory, suggesting a growing bullish momentum. At press time, XRP is trading at $3.0711. If the bullish trend continues, XRP could rally past the first major resistance level and the TLQ at $3.20. An extended bullish run would allow XRP to hit the $3.40 mark for the first time since July. However, if the market undergoes a correction following its recent rally, XRP could retest its recent support level at $2.95. The support level will likely hold, as failure to do so could see XRP drop to the $2.70 region.

Then you’ll want to pay close attention to this important announcement. Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has declared a temporary suspension of services for Toncoin (TON). This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a crucial step to ensure the security and efficiency of their systems. Why Are Toncoin (TON) Deposits and Withdrawals Being Suspended? Binance has officially announced the temporary suspension of Toncoin (TON) deposits and withdrawals . This essential measure is scheduled to begin at 6:00 a.m. UTC on September 18th. The reason behind this temporary halt is routine wallet maintenance. Think of it like a necessary system upgrade or a tune-up for your car – it’s designed to improve performance and security in the long run. While any service interruption can be inconvenient, these maintenance periods are vital for several reasons: Enhanced Security: Regular maintenance helps identify and patch potential vulnerabilities, safeguarding your assets. Improved Performance: Updates can lead to faster transaction processing and a smoother user experience. System Stability: Ensuring the wallet infrastructure remains robust and reliable for future operations. What Does This Mean for Your Toncoin (TON) Holdings? During the maintenance period, users will not be able to initiate new Toncoin (TON) deposits and withdrawals on the Binance platform. It’s important to understand that your existing Toncoin (TON) holdings on Binance remain safe and secure. This suspension only affects the ability to move TON in or out of the exchange during the specified timeframe. If you were planning to deposit or withdraw Toncoin (TON) around this date, it is highly recommended to adjust your schedule. Planning ahead can help you avoid any unexpected delays or missed opportunities. Binance aims to complete this maintenance as quickly and efficiently as possible, minimizing disruption for its users. Navigating the Temporary Suspension: Actionable Insights Understanding the impact of such announcements is key for any crypto enthusiast. Here are some actionable insights to help you manage your Toncoin (TON) deposits and withdrawals during this period: Check the Official Announcement: Always refer to the official Binance announcement for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the suspension and its estimated duration. Plan Ahead: If you need to move Toncoin (TON), ensure you complete your transactions well before 6:00 a.m. UTC on September 18th. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Binance’s official communication channels (website, social media) for updates on when services will resume. Consider Alternatives (Temporarily): For urgent transactions, if available, explore other exchanges that support TON, but always exercise caution and due diligence. This temporary halt is a standard procedure in the cryptocurrency world, reflecting an exchange’s commitment to maintaining a secure and high-performing environment for its users. It underscores the ongoing need for robust infrastructure in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Conclusion: A Step Towards a Stronger Binance Ecosystem The temporary suspension of Toncoin (TON) deposits and withdrawals by Binance is a proactive measure aimed at enhancing the platform’s overall security and efficiency. While it requires a brief adjustment from users, these maintenance periods are fundamental to ensuring a reliable and safe trading experience.

Ultimately, this crucial maintenance contributes to a more resilient and trustworthy ecosystem for all Binance users and the broader crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will Toncoin (TON) deposits and withdrawals resume on Binance? A: Binance has not provided an exact resumption time, only the start time of the suspension (6:00 a.m. UTC on Sept. 18). Users should monitor official Binance announcements for updates on when services will be restored. Q2: Are my Toncoin (TON) funds safe on Binance during the suspension? A: Yes, your existing Toncoin (TON) holdings on Binance remain secure. The suspension only affects the ability to deposit or withdraw TON, not the safety of your assets held on the exchange.

Was brauchen Investoren, um langfristig Gewinne zu machen? HODL und Diamond Hands – wie wichtig Geduld und Durchhaltevermögen sind Bitcoin Hyper – der neue Stern am Altcoin Himmel? Seien wir mal ehrlich: Investieren ist nicht einfach. Es klingt immer so, als bräuchte man nur ein bisschen Startkapital und schon rollt der Reichtum von alleine herein. In Wirklichkeit ist es eher eine Art Geduldsspiel, gewürzt mit einer Portion Selbstbeherrschung und der ständigen Frage: „Warum habe ich das eigentlich gekauft?“ Natürlich hilft es, ein Gespür für Menschen und deren Stimmung zu entwickeln. Schließlich bewegt nicht irgendeine allwissende Maschine die Märkte, sondern Menschen mit Ängsten, Hoffnungen und gelegentlich etwas zu viel Kaffee. Investieren in Kryptowährungen erfordert kühlen Kopf Investieren in Kryptowährungen ist quasi die Königsdisziplin des risikoreichen Investierens – wer denkt, Aktien seien nervenaufreibend, hat noch nie den Krypto-Markt an einem Sonntagabend beobachtet. Die Vorteile liegen auf der Hand: enorme Gewinnchancen in kürzester Zeit, Zugang zu einer globalen, dezentralisierten Welt und die verlockende Idee, beim nächsten „Bitcoin-Moment“ früh dabei zu sein. Doch genau diese Dynamik ist auch der Nachteil: Kurse können innerhalb weniger Stunden in den Himmel schießen – oder im Keller verschwinden. Viele Anleger steigen dann ängstlich aus und sichern Verluste, während andere mit den sprichwörtlichen „Diamond Hands“ einfach weiterhalten. Denn die großen Bewegungen entstehen über Jahre, nicht über Tage – und nur wer die Durststrecken aushält, profitiert am Ende vom Aufschwung. Was HODL heißt – und woher der Begriff kommt Nicht umsonst hat sich ein Begriff aus 2013 aus einem Bitcoin Forum unsterblich gemacht und wird für immer mit diesem “Festhalten” und “Durchhalten” verbunden sein: HODL. HODL bedeutet in diesem Kontext schlicht: Kaufen, festhalten und nicht verkaufen – egal, wie wild die Kurse schwanken. Ursprünglich ein Tippfehler für „hold“, hat sich der Begriff in der Kryptoszene zu einer Art Mantra entwickelt: Wer HODLt, bleibt stur investiert, auch wenn alle anderen in Panik verkaufen – in der Hoffnung, langfristig die großen Gewinne einzufahren. The original HODL post by u/valkener1 in CryptoCurrency Wir werfen nun einen Blick auf die historischen Kursverläufe von Bitcoin, Solana und Dogecoin. Diese machen deutlich, worauf es beim Investieren in Kryptowährungen wirklich ankommt: Geduld und Nervenstärke. Wer früh eingestiegen ist und nicht bei jedem Rücksetzer in Panik verkauft hat, konnte langfristig enorme Gewinne verbuchen – teilweise trotz zwischenzeitlicher Kurseinbrüche von 70, 80 oder gar 90 Prozent. Gerade diese Momente, in denen der Markt scheinbar im freien Fall ist, sind der entscheidende Test. Nun aber zu den Kursverläufen. Fangen wir an mit Bitcoin (BTC) , der ältesten und bekanntesten Kryptowährung. Hätte man v or 5 Jahren 1000 Euro in BTC investiert, würden heute 9060 Euro im Wallet stehen . Nicht schlecht oder? Das wären satte 806 % Gewinn über 5 Jahre. Das es in dieser Zeit Momente gab, in denen der Kurs stark gefallen ist und deutliche Verluste verzeichnete, ist dabei auch klar. Eben diese Momente müssen Investoren aushalten, um langfristig Gewinne zu machen. Natürlich ist dies bei Bitcoin etwas einfacher, da er sich doch klar von den vielen Altcoins und Memecoins abhebt, was die starken Preisschwankungen zum Beispiel durch Hypes angeht. Hier kannst du eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin lesen. Hätte man v or 5 Jahren 1000 Euro in SOLANA (SOL) investiert, würden heute satte 68.155 Euro im Wallet stehen . Das sind mal Gewinne, Junge! Das wären satte 6715 % Gewinn über 5 Jahre. Bei Solana ist der Anstieg so krass, da SOL noch relativ “jung” im Vergleich zu zum Beispiel Bitcoin ist und erst 2020 das Mainnet von Solana an den Start ging. So erklärt sich auch das deutlich höhere prozentuale Wachstum. Experten der Szene sehen bei Solana aber weiterhin eine rosige Zukunft. Bei Dogecoin sieht die Sache aber ähnlich aus. Natürlich ist klar, dass bei DOGE vor allem Hype und Emotionen sowie einige Social-Media Posts von einflussreichen Persönlichkeiten den Preis stark beeinflussen, trotzdem gilt auch hier: Wer früh einsteigt, und eisern 5 Jahre dabei geblieben wäre, hätte aus einer Investition von 1000 Euro vor 5 Jahren nun beachtliche 84.000 Euro gemacht. Das schmeckt doch ziemlich gut. Dogecoin macht mittlerweile, wie andere Kryptowährungen auch, Schlagzeilen mit Plänen für eine Zulassung für ETFs. Nur um es gesagt zu haben: Nur weil ein Kurs in der Vergangenheit gut performt hat, heißt das nicht das er es in den nächsten 5 Jahren genauso tun wird. Aber: Das Muster ist klar, wenn man sich diese 3 Coins ansieht: BTC, SOL und DOGE gehören zu den bekanntesten Coins der Szene und sind alle unter den Top10 Coins nach Marktkapitalisierung. Deshalb lohnt es, sich möglichst früh nach noch unbekannteren, kleineren Projekten und Coins umzusehen. Bitcoin Hyper ist ein Projekt, was unserer Meinung nach einen Blick wert ist. Bitcoin Hyper – die Verbindung von Bitcoin und Solana Bitcoin Hyper kombiniert Bitcoins Sicherheit mit Solanas Geschwindigkeit. Über eine Layer-2-Lösung werden Transaktionen fast in Echtzeit und zu geringen Kosten möglich. Die Integration der Solana Virtual Machine bringt Smart Contracts direkt ins Bitcoin-Ökosystem. Über eine dezentrale Brücke lässt sich BTC ins Hyper-Netzwerk übertragen, dort für Zahlungen, DeFi, Gaming oder Staking nutzen und jederzeit zurückholen. Der $HYPER-Token dient als zentrales Zahlungsmittel für Gebühren, Staking, Zugang zu dApps und Governance. Langfristiges Potenzial für Investoren Bitcoin Hyper erweitert Bitcoin um echte Nutzbarkeit und schafft ein Ökosystem, das Sicherheit und Performance vereint. Mit fairem Presale, sofortigen Staking-Belohnungen und steigender Nachfrage bietet $HYPER langfristige Chancen. Die wachsende Krypto-Adaption durch Unternehmen und die krypto-freundliche Politik der USA verstärken diesen Trend. Für Investoren ist Bitcoin Hyper damit eine frühe Gelegenheit, von der Zusammenarbeit von Solana und Bitcoin zu profitieren und sich in einem zukunftsweisenden Projekt zu positionieren.

Recent investigations revealed operatives creating legitimate U.S. corporations , including Blocknovas LLC and Softglide LLC, using fake identities to establish corporate fronts for attacking crypto developers. ZachXBT’s August investigation also exposed five North Korean IT workers operating under more than 30 fake identities, using government-issued ID cards and professional LinkedIn accounts to secure positions at crypto projects. The breach of one operative’s device revealed systematic expense documentation for purchasing Social Security numbers, professional accounts, and VPN services to maintain fraudulent employment. The schemes have also evolved to include Python-based malware called PylangGhost , deployed through fake interview websites impersonating major companies like Coinbase and Robinhood to steal credentials from over 80 browser extensions and crypto wallets. Corporate Infiltration Through Fake Companies and Stolen Identities North Korean operatives established multiple legitimate business entities across US states to create credible corporate fronts for their infiltration campaigns. Silent Push researchers discovered Blocknovas LLC registered to a vacant lot in South Carolina, while Softglide LLC traced back to a small Buffalo tax office, with Angeloper Agency operating as an unregistered third entity. The FBI seized Blocknovas’ domain as part of law enforcement action against North Korean cyber actors utilizing fake job postings to distribute malware. These companies served as launching pads for the “ Contagious Interview ” campaign, a Lazarus Group subgroup specializing in sophisticated malware deployment targeting crypto wallet developers. North Korean cyber spies reportedly set up fake US firms to deploy malware targeting crypto developers, violating Treasury sanctions. #NorthKorea #CyberSecurity https://t.co/TvCmrspaep — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 25, 2025 The elaborate schemes include purchasing stolen American identities and using complex laundering tactics to mask fund origins before routing money back to North Korea’s weapons program. In June, US authorities seized over $7.7 million in crypto allegedly earned through networks of covert IT workers posing as foreign freelancers. In fact, according to CZ, a recent case includes a major Indian outsource service hack that leaked U.S. exchange user data, resulting in over $400 million in user asset losses. The Justice Department linked these operations to Sim Hyon Sop, a Foreign Trade Bank representative, and Kim Sang Man, CEO of state-linked IT firm Chinyong operating under North Korea’s Ministry of Defense. The workers used sophisticated concealment methods, including fake accounts, transaction splitting, token-swapping techniques, and NFT purchases as value stores. Advanced Malware Campaigns Target Global Crypto Professional Networks The PylangGhost malware campaign is one of the most recent large-scale attacks by North Korea targeting crypto professionals, particularly focusing on India-based blockchain developers through elaborate fake interview schemes. Cisco Talos researchers documented how Famous Chollima threat groups create fraudulent skill-testing websites using React frameworks that closely mimic legitimate company assessment platforms. Victims complete technical assessments designed to validate professional backgrounds before receiving invitations to record video interviews. The sites request camera access through seemingly innocuous button clicks, then display platform-specific instructions for downloading alleged video drivers containing malicious Python-based payloads. The malware establishes persistent system access through registry modifications while targeting over 80 browser extensions, including MetaMask, Phantom, Bitski, and TronLink. North Korean hackers deploy ""PylangGhost"" trojan posing as Coinbase recruiters to steal crypto credentials through fake job interviews, part of $1.3 billion cyber campaign targeting industry professionals. #NorthKorean #Coinbase https://t.co/CGeDVs7s3J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 20, 2025 It also has advanced capabilities that include remote file access, OS shell control, and comprehensive data harvesting from password managers like 1Password and NordPass. Supply chain attacks have also expanded to include malicious JavaScript insertions into GitHub repositories and NPM packages. The Marstech1 malware campaign targeted popular crypto wallets, with SecurityScorecard identifying 233 victims between September 2024 and January 2025. International responses have intensified with South Korea and the European Union formalizing cybersecurity cooperation agreements specifically targeting North Korean crypto operations. As it stands now, CZ has warned companies to train employees against downloading files and implement careful candidate screening procedures to protect themselves from these malicious workers.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased $992.6 after achieving a new ATH of $994.53 in the past 24 hours. If traders continue buying tokens, the BNB price might see a further jump, and the next target could be above $1000. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,654.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $992.6, as bulls target $1000. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 4.15 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $1000 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,654.04 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. Heading into September, BNB is trading at approximately $854.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-18 07:53:00

For those immersed in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space, this evolution holds particular significance, as it lays the groundwork for future digital economies and immersive metaverse experiences. Meta, a company synonymous with this vision, has just taken a significant step forward with the unveiling of its new Meta Smart Glasses , a device that promises to reshape how we interact with technology and the world around us. Unveiling the Ray-Ban Meta Display: A Bold Leap for Meta Smart Glasses Meta made a significant announcement at its annual developer conference, Meta Connect 2025, revealing a new iteration of its Ray-Ban branded smart glasses. Dubbed the Ray-Ban Meta Display, these glasses are more than just a camera and audio device; they feature a built-in display on the right lens. This display is designed to deliver apps, alerts, and directions directly into the user’s line of sight, offering a seamless blend of digital information with the physical world. This product marks Meta’s latest push to introduce consumer-ready smart glasses capable of handling many tasks traditionally performed on a smartphone, aiming to reduce reliance on competitor hardware. The Ray-Ban Meta Display is priced at $800 and is expected to be available for purchase within weeks. This aggressive market entry highlights Meta’s commitment to leading the wearable tech segment, building upon the foundation laid by its successful predecessor, the original Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which have sold millions of units in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The Intuitive Power of the Neural Band : Control at Your Fingertips A standout feature accompanying the new smart glasses is the Meta Neural Band, a wristband controller that utilizes electromyography (EMG). This technology picks up on subtle electrical signals sent from your brain to your hand when performing gestures, allowing for precise and intuitive control of the smart glasses without needing overt movements. First showcased as part of the Orion demo at Connect 2024, the Neural Band is now a tangible consumer product, making complex interactions simple and discreet. CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the practicality of the Neural Band, noting its 18-hour battery life and water-resistant design. This control mechanism represents a new paradigm in human-computer interaction, offering a glimpse into how we might navigate digital interfaces in the future. Imagine controlling apps, scrolling through content, or answering calls with a mere flick of a finger, all without touching your glasses or pulling out a phone. The Neural Band is a core component of Meta’s strategy to make AI gadgets more integrated and less intrusive in daily life. Meta’s Vision for Augmented Reality : Bridging the Gap While the Ray-Ban Meta Display features a simpler display compared to the advanced augmented reality lenses of the internally codenamed ‘Orion’ prototype shown previously, it represents a crucial step in Meta’s long-term AR ambitions. Orion, with its eye-tracking capabilities and more immersive AR experience, may still be years away from consumer readiness. However, the Ray-Ban Meta Display serves as a bridge, familiarizing users with the concept of a visual overlay and hands-free interaction. Meta’s strategy is clear: be first to market with a practical, consumer-friendly smart glasses product. By doing so, they aim to cultivate user habits and build an ecosystem before potential competitors like Google and Apple launch their own, likely deeply integrated, smart glasses into their respective operating systems. This initial offering, while not full AR, paves the way for future, more sophisticated wearable tech that could eventually realize Meta’s metaverse vision. Enhanced Functionality: How These AI Gadgets Redefine Interaction The Ray-Ban Meta Display significantly expands the capabilities of its predecessors, transforming them into true AI gadgets . Here’s a comparison highlighting the advancements: Feature Original Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Ray-Ban Meta Display Display No dedicated display Built-in display on right lens for apps, alerts, directions Control Method Voice commands, touch controls Meta Neural Band (wristband with EMG for subtle hand gestures) Price (Approx.) Starting around $299-$329 $800 Core Functionality Capture photos/videos, listen to audio, make calls, AI assistant All original features plus app display, directions, live translations Connectivity Smartphone tethering Cloud connectivity, internet access Equipped with an on-board AI assistant, cameras, speakers, and microphones, the new glasses allow users to connect directly to the cloud. This enables access to the internet and Meta’s suite of social media apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, view directions, and even see live translations, all displayed within the right lens. This suite of features positions the Ray-Ban Meta Display as a versatile tool for communication, navigation, and information access, moving beyond simple media capture to a more integrated digital assistant. The Future of Wearable Tech : Challenges and Opportunities Meta’s foray into advanced wearable tech with the Ray-Ban Meta Display is not without its challenges. The market for smart glasses has seen various attempts, many struggling with user adoption, privacy concerns, and aesthetic integration. However, Meta’s partnership with EssilorLuxottica provides a strong fashion-forward foundation, making the devices appealing beyond just their technological capabilities. The looming competition from tech giants like Google and Apple remains a significant factor. Both companies are expected to launch their own smart glasses in the coming years, which will likely offer deep integration with their existing operating systems and vast app ecosystems. Meta’s ability to create a compelling, standalone experience that rivals the convenience of a smartphone will be key to its success. The Ray-Ban Meta Display represents a critical battleground in the ongoing race to define the next generation of personal computing, potentially moving beyond the smartphone as the primary interface. Conclusion: Meta’s Bold Vision for a Connected Future The unveiling of the Ray-Ban Meta Display and its accompanying Neural Band marks a pivotal moment for Meta and the broader wearable tech industry. By combining stylish eyewear with advanced display technology and intuitive control, Meta is making a concerted effort to establish itself as a leader in the next computing platform. While challenges remain, particularly in a competitive landscape with other tech giants, this new product demonstrates Meta’s commitment to delivering practical AI gadgets that bridge the gap between our physical and digital lives. For enthusiasts of cryptocurrency and the metaverse, these developments are foundational, offering new avenues for interaction and experience within the evolving digital frontier.

Key Takeaways: A 12-foot golden Trump statue holding a Bitcoin was unveiled near the US Capitol by Pump.fun memecoiners. Organizers framed the stunt as a tribute to Trump’s support for Bitcoin and decentralized finance. The unveiling coincided with a Fed rate cut and included a Trump-themed memecoin launch livestream. The 12-foot statue appeared just off Union Square on Washington, DC’s National Mall, a symbolic stretch leading toward Capitol Hill and located roughly a mile from the White House. The unveiling was orchestrated by a group of memecoin creators tied to Pump.fun, a popular platform for launching meme tokens. Memecoiners Hail Trump as Bitcoin Champion in National Mall Statue Tribute Organizers described the display as a tribute to Trump’s perceived role in championing Bitcoin and “decentralized technologies,” according to a website linked to the stunt. “This is our thank you, our statement, to the president,” said Hichem Zaghdoudi, one of the only publicly named organizers, in an interview with local station DC News Now. The statue’s appearance coincided with the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, the first rate cut of the year, prompting renewed bullishness across risk markets, including crypto. Zaghdoudi told ABC 7News that the statue aimed to spark public discussion about the future of government-issued currency, calling it a “symbol of the intersection between modern politics and financial innovation.” Supporters of the stunt credit Trump for paving the way for institutional Bitcoin adoption, citing his deregulatory stance during his presidency and the crypto industry’s current financial backing of his 2024 campaign. Still, some observers point out that the current Bitcoin bull market began under the Biden administration, fueled largely by anticipation around the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and wider institutional access to digital assets. The statue itself, made from hard foam for easier transport, was built over several days and featured in livestreams on Pump.fun, where the organizers also launched a Trump-themed memecoin. Clips shared on their X (formerly Twitter) account show the head of the statue being carved by machine and a group carrying the golden figure into place.

Trump Golden Statue (@djtgst) September 15, 2025 One participant on a livestream joked that he hoped Trump would “walk out there and see it,” seemingly unaware that the former president was visiting the UK at the time. Pro-Trump Bitcoin Statue Breaks Trend of Critical Displays on National Mall While political stunts are not new to the National Mall, this one marked a notable departure: previous Trump-related statues in the area this year have taken a more critical tone. In June, activists installed a statue titled “Dictator Approved” showing a golden hand giving a thumbs-up while crushing the Statue of Liberty’s crown, protesting Trump’s militaristic posturing.

In addition, the company also bagged the domain Bitcoin.jp – an indication that it will continue to spearhead BTC adoption in Asia. Metaplanet Unveils Subsidiaries To Expand Bitcoin Business In an announcement made earlier today, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet stated it had established a new wholly-owned subsidiary in the US called Metaplanet Income Corp. to expand its BTC income business. It should be noted that Metaplanet recently concluded a massive $1.4 billion capital raise. The firm’s US subsidiary will provide Metaplanet the opportunity to pursue derivatives operations and related activities that produce cash flow and revenue. The establishment of Metaplanet Income Corp. will help the firm have a clear separation between the Bitcoin income generation business, and its core BTC treasury operations. This will help the company enhance transparency, governance, and risk management. Besides Metaplanet Income Corp, the firm has also established a Japan subsidiary called Bitcoin Japan Inc. Metaplanet CEO, Simon Gerovich, commented on the development, saying : This business has become our engine of growth, generating consistent revenue and net income. We are cash flow positive, producing significant internal cash flow to support future initiatives. Bitcoin Japan Inc., will primarily look after an array of BTC-based media such as conferences and online platforms, the Bitcoin.jp domain, and Bitcoin Magazine Japan. Notably, the domain was purchased from a private investor who had held it for over a decade. Gerovich also commented on Metaplanet’s recent $1.4 billion capital raise, stating that almost 100 investors had joined the roadshow, with more than 70 of them ultimately investing. These investors include sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, and other similar financial entities. Metaplanet’s long-term ambition remains to be the second-largest holder of BTC, behind Michael Saylor-led Strategy. According to data from Coingecko, Metaplanet currently holds 20,136 BTC on its balance sheet. In comparison, Strategy holds 638,935 BTC, and continues to extend its lead. However, to rank second, Metaplanet only needs to overtake MARA Holdings, which currently holds 52,477 BTC in its reserves. Is BTC About To Fall? Corporate adoption of Bitcoin continues to reach new heights, with a recent report noting that the total value of BTC treasury holdings recently surpassed $113 billion. Just a week ago, Metaplanet added to its BTC reserves. That said, BTC whales recently dumped 115,000 – the largest distribution since 2022 – hinting that institutional demand for the digital asset may be temporarily waning. At press time, BTC trades at $115,670, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|Bitcoin Japan|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Metaplanet,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|ASIA|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 08:00:03

This means one KRW1 token should always be worth one South Korean Won. The primary goal of such a stablecoin is to offer the benefits of blockchain technology—like speed, transparency, and lower transaction costs—without the price fluctuations common in the broader crypto market. Bidaex has chosen the robust Avalanche blockchain for issuing KRW1, leveraging its high performance and scalability to ensure reliable operations. The Promise of Stability: Why KRW1 Matters for South Korea The introduction of KRW1 is particularly impactful for the South Korean financial landscape. News1 reported that Bidaex successfully completed a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the token, validating its technical viability and operational readiness. This success paves the way for a more stable and predictable digital asset environment. For individuals and businesses, a won-pegged stablecoin offers several compelling advantages: Reduced Volatility: Users can hold digital assets without constant worry about market swings, making it ideal for savings or everyday transactions. Efficient Transactions: Facilitates faster and potentially cheaper cross-border payments and remittances, bypassing traditional banking delays and fees. Gateway to DeFi: Opens up new opportunities for participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols with a familiar and stable currency. Enhanced Liquidity: Improves the liquidity of crypto exchanges by providing a stable trading pair for other digital assets. Navigating the Digital Won: Benefits for Users and Businesses Imagine sending money internationally or making large digital purchases without converting to a volatile cryptocurrency first. KRW1 makes this a reality, offering a digital equivalent of the South Korean Won that can be easily transferred and utilized on the blockchain. This innovation could significantly streamline financial operations for various sectors. Moreover, the transparency inherent in blockchain transactions means that every KRW1 movement can be verified, fostering greater trust and accountability. As the digital economy continues to evolve, a reliable won-pegged stablecoin will play a crucial role in its growth and adoption. The Broader Landscape: Stablecoins and the Future of Finance The launch of KRW1 by Bidaex is part of a global trend where stablecoins are increasingly recognized as vital components of the digital financial ecosystem.

After short-term volatility, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) rate cut, the cryptocurrency could be poised to close the month on a positive note. Related Reading: BNB Chain Projects Lead Binance Wallet With 2,000x IDO Returns Bitcoin Nears Multi-Month Bullish Run On Wednesday, Bitcoin retested the $117,000 resistance for the first time in nearly a month before being rejected. The cryptocurrency has been hovering between the $107,000-$116,000 levels since late August, falling to the local lows at the start of September. Amid the retracement, investors expected to see another “Rektember,” as it has historically been one of BTC’s weakest months. Notably, CoinGlass data shows that BTC’s returns during September have mostly been red throughout the years, with an average negative return of 2.99%. However, the flagship crypto’s price has had a positive streak over the last two years, recording returns of 3.91% and 7.29% in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Analyst Crypto Jelle suggested that with less than two weeks of the month, Bitcoin appears to be setting up for a multi-month green run. Last week, BTC recovered from the early September dip, breaking out of the crucial $114,000 level and turning it into support during the weekend. As a result, the cryptocurrency currently has a positive return of 6.35%, its second-best September, according to the analytics platform. Jelle noted that “a green September has historically resulted in the next 2, 3, or even 6 consecutive months closing in the green too.” Based on this, he suggested that if Bitcoin keeps its positive performance for the rest of the month, “Q4 looks very promising for BTC.” BTC Retests Key Area Amid Volatility Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin had a weekly Close above $114,000 and is retesting this area as support throughout this week’s pullbacks. This could lead to volatile downside wicks below this crucial level if this week’s close occurs above $114,000. On the contrary, failing to hold this level in the weekly timeframe could jeopardize BTC’s chances of a third price discovery uptrend. Overall, BTC needs to retest and hold $114k as support on the Weekly and any downside volatility below it would likely end up as a wick by the end of the week with the new Weekly Close. Multiple market watchers anticipated some volatility in the short term, as the Federal Reserve was expected to announce its first interest rate cut of the year. Altcoin Sherpa affirmed that “25bps is the expectation here” as “25 bps = Business as Usual but UP.” He added that this decision would likely result in a dip to the range lows or a choppy performance and “then higher in late Sept/ early October.” On Wednesday afternoon, the Fed lowered its rates by 25 basis points to a new range of 4.00% to 4.25%, marking the first rate cut since December 2024.

The benchmark rate was reduced by 25 basis points to a range of 4.00%–4.25%, signaling a shift in monetary policy as signs of labor market weakness emerge. The decision has prompted discussions across financial markets, including the cryptocurrency sector, where digital assets are often sensitive to broader macroeconomic conditions. Among the latest voices weighing in is Elon Musk’s AI platform, Grok, which has offered its forecast for XRP’s value by December 2025 in the wake of this rate cut. Fed Policy and Its Impact on Risk Assets Rate reductions have historically influenced risk assets by making traditional safe-haven investments such as bonds less attractive. This often encourages investors to allocate more capital toward higher-risk opportunities, including equities and digital assets. For cryptocurrencies, the Fed’s shift away from restrictive monetary policy could improve market liquidity and risk appetite, providing conditions more favorable for tokens like XRP. Given XRP’s continued association with cross-border settlement use cases, a supportive macro environment may strengthen its potential for price appreciation. Grok’s XRP Price Forecast In its projection, Grok predicted that XRP could reach the $5 to $7 range by December 2025, citing the Federal Reserve’s decision as a key turning point for sentiment. Grok stated, “With the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts, the environment for risk assets becomes more favorable. Under this policy shift, XRP is expected to trade between five and seven dollars by the end of 2025.” This view positions XRP significantly above its current levels, while still acknowledging the challenges and uncertainties that continue to surround the broader digital asset market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader Market Dynamics Beyond monetary policy, several structural factors will continue to shape XRP’s trajectory. Ripple’s ongoing engagement with financial institutions to enhance cross-border payments also plays a role in building XRP’s long-term use case. At the same time, competition from other blockchain-based settlement systems and central bank digital currencies presents a challenge to its growth. These factors, combined with global macroeconomic trends, will determine whether XRP moves toward Grok’s predicted range or remains closer to the more conservative expectations. While Grok’s outlook aligns with a more favorable environment, the ultimate trajectory of XRP will depend on the intersection of macroeconomic policy, regulatory clarity, and continued technological adoption in the payments sector.

The three firms have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to introduce trading and lending products that leverage tokenized money market funds on the XRP Ledger and Ripple’s stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). XRP Ledger Gains Institutional Edge As part of the collaboration, DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx) will list sgBENJI, the token of Franklin Templeton’s Onchain US Dollar Short-Term Money Market Fund, alongside RLUSD. This will allow accredited and institutional clients of DBS to trade between RLUSD and sgBENJI, and enable 24/7 portfolio rebalancing into more stable assets while also generating yield during volatile periods. The initiative addresses a growing need among digital asset investors, many of whom currently allocate primarily to crypto assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP without access to yield-generating mechanisms. In its next phase, the partnership aims to enable repo transactions by allowing clients to use sgBENJI tokens as collateral to unlock liquidity. Investors will be able to obtain credit either through repurchase agreements directly with DBS or via third-party platforms, where DBS will act as a trusted agent holding the collateral. This model expands liquidity options while, at the same time, ensuring institutional safeguards around pledged assets. To further strengthen interoperability, Franklin Templeton will also tokenize sgBENJI on the XRP Ledger and add to its existing blockchain integrations. This development comes as institutional interest in digital assets continues to accelerate. In fact, recent survey data, shared by Ripple, indicates that 87% of institutional investors expect to allocate capital to the sector in 2025. In a statement, Ripple’s VP and Global Head of Trading and Markets, Nigel Khakoo, said, “2025 has been marked by a series of industry-firsts when it comes to traditional financial institutions moving onchain – and the linkup between Ripple, DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable repo trades for a tokenised money market fund with a regulated, stable and liquid mode of exchange such as RLUSD is truly a game-change.” Ripple-BBVA The development comes less than two weeks after Ripple and Spanish banking giant BBVA signed a custody deal as Europe readies for the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The agreement enabled BBVA Spain to adopt Ripple Custody for its crypto services. The partnership strengthens Ripple’s relationship with BBVA, which was already established through its operations in Switzerland and Turkey.

The asset is currently near $0.00001093, just under resistance. The projected move, based on previous behavior, could reach up to $0.00002837, or more than 300% from current levels, if confirmed. Liquidation Pressure Builds on Shorts According to data from CoinGlass, PEPE is trading at $0.00001138, close to a zone where short liquidations begin to build. The chart shows heavy clusters of leveraged short positions between $0.0000119 and $0.0000128. If the price pushes into this range, many short positions could be forced to close, creating conditions for a short squeeze. Source: CoinGlass On the downside, cumulative long liquidation levels appear more concentrated below $0.0000103, but the exposure tapers off as the price moves lower. This suggests fewer long positions are at risk compared to shorts above current levels. As a result, an upside breakout above resistance carries greater potential to trigger liquidations and add momentum to buying pressure. The post Will PEPE Rocket 78%?

A recent significant development has captured attention across the financial landscape: Nasdaq-listed social media marketing firm Thumzup has made a substantial DOGE investment , acquiring 7.5 million DOGE tokens valued at $2 million. This strategic move, as reported by The Block, signals a potential shift in how traditional businesses view and integrate decentralized currencies into their operations. What’s Driving This Strategic DOGE Investment? Thumzup’s recent DOGE investment isn’t a standalone event; rather, it’s a calculated step within a broader vision. This acquisition follows an earlier announcement from the company detailing its plans to acquire 3,500 DOGE mining rigs. Consequently, this indicates a comprehensive strategy to not only hold but also actively participate in the Dogecoin ecosystem. This proactive approach suggests a long-term commitment to Dogecoin integration within their business model. The company might be looking to leverage Dogecoin for innovative marketing campaigns or as a versatile payment method. Furthermore, it could also serve as a strategic way to diversify its treasury assets, protecting against traditional market fluctuations. The Ripple Effect of Corporate DOGE Adoption When a publicly traded company like Thumzup makes a significant DOGE investment , it sends a powerful message to the entire market. This kind of institutional involvement can have several profound impacts: Boost Dogecoin’s Credibility: It effectively moves Dogecoin beyond its initial “meme coin” origins, lending it greater legitimacy and seriousness in the financial world. Attract New Investors: Other corporations and a broader base of retail investors might view this corporate endorsement as a green light to explore DOGE themselves. Influence Market Sentiment: Positive corporate news, particularly from a Nasdaq-listed firm, often leads to increased interest and potential price appreciation for the cryptocurrency. Are There Challenges with a Corporate DOGE Investment? While the news of Thumzup’s entry into the Dogecoin space is largely positive, a substantial DOGE investment by a corporate entity also comes with its unique set of challenges. Understanding these potential hurdles is crucial for any company considering similar moves. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, are famously known for their rapid and significant price fluctuations. This inherent volatility can impact the value of the investment considerably. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still very much in its developing stages. Future regulations could potentially affect operations or the legal standing of crypto holdings. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, some traditional investors and segments of the public might still harbor skepticism or caution regarding “meme coins” like Dogecoin. Thumzup’s Vision: Beyond Just Holding DOGE Thumzup’s plans extend beyond merely holding Dogecoin as a treasury asset. The strategic acquisition of mining rigs suggests an intent to become an active participant in securing the network and potentially generating revenue from mining operations. This dual approach of holding and mining showcases a comprehensive and forward-thinking strategy for their DOGE investment . The mining operation could provide a consistent and self-sustaining stream of Dogecoin for the company. It demonstrates a deeper commitment to the underlying technology and the broader Dogecoin ecosystem. Ultimately, this innovative strategy could set a powerful precedent for other companies exploring comprehensive crypto integration into their core business models. Thumzup’s substantial DOGE investment marks a pivotal moment for Dogecoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. It highlights a growing trend of corporate entities embracing digital assets not just as speculative investments, but as integral parts of their business strategy. This bold move could pave the way for increased institutional adoption, further solidifying Dogecoin’s position in the financial landscape. As the digital economy continues to evolve, we can expect more companies to explore similar avenues, ultimately reshaping the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Thumzup? Thumzup is a Nasdaq-listed social media marketing firm that focuses on leveraging digital platforms for brand promotion and engagement across various online communities. Why did Thumzup invest in Dogecoin? Thumzup’s DOGE investment is part of a broader, strategic initiative to embrace digital assets. This includes not only holding Dogecoin but also planning to acquire DOGE mining rigs, indicating a deeper integration into the crypto ecosystem for potential marketing applications or treasury diversification. What does this mean for Dogecoin’s future? Corporate DOGE investment by a publicly traded company like Thumzup can significantly boost Dogecoin’s legitimacy and market perception. This can potentially attract more institutional and retail investors, influencing positive market sentiment and long-term growth. Are there risks associated with corporate crypto investments? Yes, corporate crypto investments, including a significant DOGE investment , inherently carry risks. These include market volatility, regulatory uncertainty that could change rapidly, and potential shifts in public perception which might impact asset value. Share Your Thoughts!

This recent ascent is not merely a random fluctuation; instead, it reflects a confluence of strategic developments and growing market confidence. One primary catalyst is the increasing institutional adoption. Major financial institutions and corporations are now actively investing in and integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios, lending significant credibility and capital to the digital asset. Moreover, the anticipation and impact of Bitcoin’s halving events continue to play a critical role, effectively reducing the supply of new BTC entering the market and creating scarcity. This supply-demand dynamic often leads to upward price pressure. Institutional Influx: Large-scale investments from corporations and financial giants. Supply Scarcity: Halving events naturally constrain new Bitcoin supply. Macroeconomic Climate: Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Growing Retail Interest: Renewed enthusiasm from individual investors contributing to demand. Is This Bitcoin $116,000 Momentum Sustainable? While the current price action is exhilarating, many investors are asking about the sustainability of this momentum. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and a rapid ascent can sometimes be followed by a correction. However, the fundamental underpinnings of this particular surge suggest a more robust foundation than previous speculative bubbles. Expert analysts are closely monitoring various indicators. Some believe that the increasing mainstream acceptance and the development of stronger regulatory frameworks provide a more stable environment for sustained growth. Others caution that short-term corrections are always possible, especially after such a significant rally. Therefore, a balanced perspective is essential for navigating these exciting yet unpredictable times. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider market trends carefully. Navigating the Market After Bitcoin Reaches $116,000 For both seasoned and new investors, understanding how to react to such a significant price movement is key. The journey of Bitcoin to $116,000 presents both opportunities and challenges. It is crucial to approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy, rather than being swayed by immediate emotions.

Meme coins have led the charge, flipping jokes and community-driven hype into billions of dollars in market value. Shiba Inu was the first to prove that a token born from humor could shake the financial world, and its success paved the way for many other coins, and now a new wave of contenders like MoonBull. Today, Shiba Inu sits on a market cap of more than $40 billion, holding steady with modest weekly gains. Some investors view it as a maturing blue-chip meme coin, while others argue its best days of explosive growth are in the past. That’s why so much attention is shifting toward presales – where the chance of multiplying small investments is far greater. Enter MoonBull, a degen-built project that’s making waves with its whitelist, which is closing soon. Traders are rushing to secure early access before the gates shut. History has shown that the biggest gains in crypto often come from those who move early. Shiba Inu’s early adopters became legends in the space, turning small investments into life-changing outcomes. MoonBull is being hailed as the best upcoming crypto because it carries that same sense of ground-floor opportunity while adding structured rewards to amplify its appeal. For those who missed Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise, MoonBull feels like a second chance to ride a wave before it breaks into the mainstream. As the whitelist nears its end, traders are rushing to secure access. Once it closes, Stage One of the presale will open to the public, and prices will never be this low again. MoonBull Whitelist: The Gateway to the Best Upcoming Crypto Presale MoonBull isn’t just another meme coin trying to hitch a ride on the hype train. It’s a project built for degens, risk-takers, and meme culture addicts who live for the thrill of catching the next moonshot before it blows up. Powered by Ethereum, MoonBull combines the kind of security and smooth DeFi integration that serious traders demand with the meme-driven energy that keeps communities buzzing. And right now, the spotlight is firmly on its whitelist, which is closing soon. This is where things get exciting. Early supporters on the whitelist aren’t just buying into a token; they’re securing access to rewards that go far beyond the average meme coin play. Think of it less like tossing peanuts into a crowded zoo and more like sneaking into the front row before the gates open. Whitelist members lock in the lowest entry price, get exclusive hints about MoonBull’s roadmap, and even unlock secret token drops and staking rewards. Every perk is designed to make early entry feel like winning a golden ticket, and once these allocations disappear, there’s no second round. MoonBull ($MOBU) is packing features that directly target meme coin lovers: Exclusive staking rewards that go beyond simple token holding Secret token drops reserved for whitelist members Hidden roadmap hints revealed only to insiders Ethereum-based smart contract security First-come, first-served access at the lowest entry price This isn’t the second chance everyone’s waiting for – it’s the only chance to grab presale allocations before they vanish. It’s a classic case of being in the right place at the right time. MoonBull’s presale is shaping up to be one of the most exclusive drops in the meme coin scene, and those who hesitate could be left watching from the sidelines. Once the bull charges out of the gate, the chance to grab tokens at rock-bottom prices will be gone faster than a penguin sliding off the ice. How to Join the MoonBull Whitelist Securing a whitelist spot is time-sensitive but straightforward. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown: Submit an email address using the secure MoonBull whitelist form. Confirm the registration via private notification. Receive the exact time and date for Stage One access before anyone else. Lock in allocations at the lowest token price. Gain access to hidden staking rewards and roadmap leaks. Once Stage One opens to the public, it won’t matter if the penguins are marching or the bulls are charging – whitelisted users will already be sitting at the front of the line. Shiba Inu Price Analysis 2025: Can This Dog Token Still Deliver 1000x? Shiba Inu has grown into a household name in the crypto world, with a current market cap sitting above $40 billion and daily trading activity around $198 million. Despite a small 0.27% dip over the past 24 hours, the token managed to claw back gains of about 3.1% over the last month, showing that this pup still has fight left. Compared to its all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021, today’s price looks like pocket change, but that’s exactly why long-term holders continue to see potential. In the short term, analysts suggest Shiba Inu could move toward the $0.000012 level within the next 6–12 months, particularly if its Layer 2 scaling solution, Shibarium, delivers on promises of faster transactions and stronger utility. Whales remain active in the market, and even a modest increase in token burns could accelerate that climb. While a repeat of the early “1000x” fairy tale is unlikely, steady growth in the 20% to 35% range over the next year seems realistic. Looking ahead to 2025, conservative projections point to SHIB consolidating around $0.000015 to $0.000020, which would represent a significant improvement from today’s prices. In a more bullish scenario, where adoption broadens and token supply is aggressively reduced, Shiba Inu could stretch toward $0.00003. That would mark a gain of over 300% from current levels, which is nothing to sneeze at for a coin often written off as a meme. Still, it’s important to frame those numbers in context. Shiba Inu’s growth potential now resembles the steady pace of a penguin waddling forward rather than the stampede of a charging bull. The token may keep climbing the ladder, but its days of shock-and-awe returns appear behind it. For traders chasing the kind of “second chance” opportunity that once turned early SHIB holders into millionaires, the spotlight is shifting toward fresh entrants like MoonBull, where presale access offers a much cheaper ticket into potential 100x–1000x upside. Conclusion Based on the latest research and the market trends, Shiba Inu continues to hold the crown as one of the biggest meme coins in the world, but its upside looks more like a careful penguin waddle than a bull charge. Investors can expect steady growth into 2025, but the wild, wealth-multiplying gains of early SHIB days are in the rearview mirror. MoonBull, on the other hand, is shaping up to be the best upcoming crypto presale for those seeking massive upside. With its whitelist closing soon, traders who hesitate risk watching the bull run off without them. Early access, lowest entry price, and secret rewards make this presale one of the most exclusive drops in the meme coin world. For crypto enthusiasts, the choice is clear: secure a whitelist spot now, because once Stage One goes public, the chance to catch MoonBull at its cheapest price will vanish faster than peanuts at a zoo.

MoonBull’s whitelist is emerging as the standout presale of 2025, offering exclusive rewards, bonus allocations, and private access to roadmap updates before the public launch.

Powell recently indicated that he expects price increases stemming from tariffs to continue not just through the current year, but potentially well into next year. This projection carries significant weight for businesses, consumers, and even the volatile cryptocurrency markets, as persistent inflation can reshape investment strategies and purchasing power. Understanding this outlook is vital for anyone navigating today’s complex financial environment. What Exactly is Tariff-Driven Inflation? When we talk about tariff-driven inflation , we are referring to the rise in prices that occurs when governments impose taxes, known as tariffs, on imported goods. These tariffs make foreign products more expensive. As a result: Importers often pass these increased costs onto consumers. Domestic producers might also raise their prices, as competition from cheaper imports lessens. This ripple effect can lead to a general increase in the cost of living and doing business. Chair Powell’s expectation suggests that these cost pressures are not temporary blips. Instead, they represent a more enduring challenge to price stability, potentially impacting household budgets and corporate profit margins for an extended period. How Does Persistent Tariff-Driven Inflation Impact Your Wallet? The continuation of tariff-driven inflation into next year has several key implications for everyday finances and broader economic health. For consumers, it means: Higher Prices: You might continue to see elevated prices for imported goods, from electronics to clothing, and even some domestically produced items that rely on imported components. Reduced Purchasing Power: If wages don’t keep pace, your money simply won’t buy as much, eroding your savings and disposable income. Budgeting Challenges: Planning household budgets becomes more difficult when the cost of essential goods remains unpredictable or consistently high. For businesses, especially those heavily reliant on global supply chains, the scenario presents ongoing cost management headaches and potential reductions in profitability. This can, in turn, affect employment and investment decisions across various sectors. Navigating the Economic Currents: What Can Be Done About Tariff-Driven Inflation? Facing persistent tariff-driven inflation , both individuals and policymakers must consider strategies to mitigate its effects. From a personal finance perspective, this might involve: Re-evaluating Spending: Prioritizing essential purchases and looking for domestic alternatives where tariffs make imports prohibitive. Seeking Value: Focusing on durable goods and services that offer long-term value, rather than being swayed by fleeting trends. Investment Adjustments: Reviewing investment portfolios, as certain sectors or assets (like some commodities or inflation-protected securities) might perform differently in an inflationary environment. Cryptocurrency investors, for instance, often watch inflation trends closely, as some see digital assets as a hedge against traditional economic volatility. For the Federal Reserve, the persistent nature of this inflation adds complexity to monetary policy decisions, balancing the need to control prices without stifling economic growth. Businesses might explore diversifying supply chains or innovating to reduce reliance on tariff-affected imports. Jerome Powell’s outlook on tariff-driven inflation serves as a critical reminder that economic forces are constantly at play, shaping our financial realities. His expectation of continued price increases through next year underscores the importance of vigilance and adaptability. While the exact impact on every sector, including the dynamic crypto markets, remains to be seen, staying informed about these macroeconomic trends is essential for making sound financial decisions. The path ahead requires careful navigation, but understanding the underlying pressures is the first step. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did Fed Chair Powell say about tariffs and inflation? A1: Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated he expects price increases stemming from tariffs to continue through the current year and persist into next year. Q2: How do tariffs lead to inflation? A2: Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. They increase the cost of these goods, which importers often pass on to consumers. Domestic producers may also raise prices due to reduced foreign competition, leading to overall price hikes. Q3: What does persistent tariff-driven inflation mean for consumers? A3: For consumers, it typically means higher prices for goods, reduced purchasing power if wages don’t keep up, and increased challenges in budgeting for household expenses. Q4: Can cryptocurrency act as a hedge against tariff-driven inflation? A4: Some investors view cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against traditional economic inflation, believing they offer an alternative store of value outside of fiat currencies. However, their volatility means they also carry significant risks. Q5: What actions can individuals take to prepare for ongoing inflation? A5: Individuals can re-evaluate spending habits, prioritize essential purchases, seek value in durable goods, and review investment portfolios to see if adjustments are needed for an inflationary environment. Q6: How does the Federal Reserve typically respond to persistent inflation?

New U.S. ETFs for XRP and Dogecoin launch, offering traditional investors broader market exposure. Technical charts show XRP consolidating before a potential breakout, with Fibonacci levels pointing toward higher targets. Chart Comparison Shows Similar Cycle Analyst EtherNasyonaL shared a chart comparing XRP’s current structure to its 2017 cycle. The earlier move showed accumulation, a breakout, re-accumulation, and a parabolic distribution before the drop. That run pushed XRP from fractions of a cent to more than $3. Interestingly, the 2025 chart follows a similar path. XRP has completed its accumulation and is now consolidating in re-accumulation. If the cycle repeats, the next move could be a rally into distribution, with projections pointing above $5–$7. Source: EtherNasyonaL/X EtherNasyonaL commented : “Ripple face melting high is loading right there.” It suggests the market may be setting up for another steep rally. Fractal Analysis Points to $6–$7 EGRAG CRYPTO shared a fractal-based view of XRP/USDT on the 5-day timeframe. A yellow fractal from an earlier breakout was applied to the current move to project possible price action. Notably, the analysis shows XRP trading inside a rising channel, supported by upward-sloping averages. Fibonacci extensions are marked at $3.9 and $5.6, with further projections toward $6–$7 by mid-November. A longer extension points to $9. EGRAG CRYPTO wrote: #XRP – A Potential Similar Set-Up! I’ve been analyzing the yellow fractal from a previous setup and trying to fit it into various formations. Based on the fractal formation analysis, it suggests that by mid-November, #XRP could be around $6 to $7!

ETFs Bring XRP to U.S. Exchanges XRP is also gaining attention in traditional markets. On September 18, REX Shares and Osprey Funds will launch the first U.S. exchange-traded funds tied to XRP and Dogecoin on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The tickers will be XRPR and DOJE. The 1st $XRP and $DOGE Spot ETFs go live today. On Sept 18, 2025, REX Shares and Osprey Funds will launch the first U.S.-listed ETFs offering direct exposure to XRP and Dogecoin. $XRPR and $DOJE mark a major step in bringing altcoins into regulated, mainstream finance. pic.twitter.com/ILqwkCj7gW — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) September 18, 2025 Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart explained : “This isn’t “pure” spot. But it will hold spot directly and other spot XRP ETFs from around the world to get its exposure.” He added that the filings allow for the use of derivatives if needed, though that is not the main design. Consequently, the new ETFs give traditional investors another way to access XRP. This comes as technical analysts point to chart structures similar to the 2017 cycle, when XRP surged in one of its strongest historical rallies.

True to form, market makers sold Bitcoin down to $114,800. Then the price rebounded hard, stopping just short of $118,000. Is this rally just getting started? 3 more rate cuts to come? A failing US jobs market undoubtedly forced the hand of the Federal Reserve, and not only were 25-basis points cut on Wednesday, but analysts are predicting a further 3 monthly cuts through to the end of the year. These easier financial conditions are likely to be beneficial for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. Dip, then strong rally Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that the price rallied strongly after the initial dump going into the FOMC meeting rate cut announcement on Wednesday. Once the price had hit a bottom, which coincided with the lower trendline of the ascending channel and the top of the small bull flag, it then rebounded vigorously. Currently, the bulls are battling with the $117,500 horizontal resistance. This is the last big level to overcome before the $BTC price can head on back to the all-time high. A candle body pierced through the resistance level but a candle will have to open above in order to break this resistance. A tale of two resistances Source: TradingView The daily chart presents a nice clear picture of what is in front of the $BTC price . It can be observed that the price is right up against the first of the two resistances. If $117,500 falls, $120,000 will be next. The second of these two resistances is also likely to have the top trendline of the ascending channel acting as resistance at the same time, so this could prove even more difficult to break. That said, a break of $120,000 would most definitely leave an easy route open to $124,000. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has its indicators at the top, still signalling upside price momentum, while the RSI reveals that its indicator line has pierced through the downtrend line, has confirmed, and is rising upwards - a very positive signal for price action. Two week chart says current resistance is critical Source: TradingView Zooming a lot further out, the 2-week chart shows a picture that is as clear as daylight. On this much higher time frame, the $117,500 resistance stands out as the critical level to break - and the $BTC price is there now! If a candle body can open above this horizontal level at the end of next week, when this time frame comes to an end, this will likely signal that Bitcoin is about to embark on the next stage of its ascent. At the bottom of the chart the indicator lines in the Stochastic RSI are angled downward. That said, they are approaching the 50.00 level so this could be a good place for them to reverse back up. If they can do so, stand by for fireworks. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

SEC Approves Grayscale's Multi-Crypto Fund Including XRP, Solana, and Cardano Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg announced the approval of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) on Wednesday via social media platform X. Mintzberg stated that GDLC will be the first multi-cryptoasset ETP to be traded on the market. The fund offers investment opportunities in Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. According to Grayscale's official website, the fund has a net asset value of $57.7 per share and over $915 million in total assets under management. The SEC previously postponed the filing in July and began reviewing its conversion to trade on NYSE Arca. On the same day, the SEC also approved “expedited” public listing standards for crypto ETF issuers. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins stated that this step would provide investors with more options and lower barriers to accessing digital asset products. According to experts, this decision could lead to the launch of more than 100 new crypto ETFs in the next 12 months. Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas emphasized that this could be a critical turning point for the crypto market, noting that previous similar regulations have tripled ETF launches. *This is not investment advice.

A significant update from South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb is set to impact Filecoin deposits and withdrawals. Bithumb has officially announced a temporary suspension of these services, a crucial step for the platform and its users. This suspension is scheduled to begin promptly at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 24 . The reason behind this temporary halt is a vital mainnet upgrade for the Filecoin network. Understanding these developments is key for anyone managing their digital assets on the Bithumb exchange. What Does This Mean for Your Filecoin Deposits and Withdrawals? For users who regularly engage with Filecoin deposits or withdrawals on Bithumb, this announcement means a temporary pause in your ability to move FIL tokens in or out of the exchange. It is not a permanent shutdown but a necessary measure to ensure the safety and integrity of your assets during a network transition. During this period, any attempts to initiate Filecoin deposits or withdrawals will likely be rejected or result in lost funds, depending on the specific network status. It is paramount that users refrain from attempting these transactions once the suspension takes effect. Bithumb’s proactive communication aims to prevent any inconvenience or potential loss for its user base. Why Are Filecoin Deposits Being Temporarily Suspended? The primary reason for the temporary suspension of Filecoin deposits and withdrawals is an upcoming mainnet upgrade. Mainnet upgrades are critical events in a blockchain network’s lifecycle. They often introduce new features, improve security protocols, enhance scalability, or fix existing vulnerabilities. For an exchange like Bithumb, ensuring compatibility and stability with the upgraded network is essential. To facilitate a smooth transition and protect user funds, exchanges typically pause deposit and withdrawal services. This allows them to update their systems, test the new network’s stability, and ensure all integrations are working correctly before resuming normal operations. This careful approach safeguards users from potential technical issues that could arise during the upgrade process. Navigating the Temporary Halt: Actionable Steps for FIL Holders As the suspension of Filecoin deposits and withdrawals approaches, what steps should FIL holders take? Here are some actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw FIL from Bithumb, ensure you complete these transactions before 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 24. Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official announcements for updates regarding the upgrade progress and the resumption of services. Avoid Transactions: Do not attempt to send or receive FIL on Bithumb during the suspension period to prevent potential loss of funds. Consider Alternatives (Temporarily): If immediate FIL transactions are critical, explore other reputable exchanges that may not be undergoing a similar suspension, keeping in mind associated fees and verification processes. These proactive measures can help you manage your assets effectively during this temporary service interruption. Conclusion: A Proactive Step for a Stronger Filecoin Network The temporary suspension of Filecoin deposits and withdrawals by Bithumb is a clear indication of its commitment to user security and network integrity. While it may cause a brief inconvenience, such measures are vital for the long-term health and stability of the Filecoin network and the broader crypto ecosystem. Users are encouraged to stay vigilant, follow Bithumb’s official communications, and plan their transactions accordingly. This proactive approach by a major exchange like Bithumb ultimately contributes to a more secure and reliable environment for all cryptocurrency participants. The resumption of services will undoubtedly bring an improved and more robust Filecoin experience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why is Bithumb suspending Filecoin deposits and withdrawals? Bithumb is temporarily suspending these services due to an upcoming mainnet upgrade for the Filecoin network. This is a standard procedure to ensure system compatibility, security, and the smooth functioning of the network post-upgrade. 2. When will the suspension of Filecoin deposits and withdrawals begin? The suspension is scheduled to start at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 24. 3. How long will the suspension last? Bithumb has announced this as a temporary suspension. The exact duration will depend on the completion of the Filecoin mainnet upgrade and Bithumb’s internal system updates and testing. Users should monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for updates on when services will resume. 4. Can I still trade Filecoin (FIL) on Bithumb during the suspension? The announcement specifically mentions the suspension of deposits and withdrawals. Trading of FIL on the exchange might still be possible, but users should verify this directly with Bithumb’s official channels. However, you will not be able to move FIL into or out of the exchange. 5. What happens if I try to deposit or withdraw FIL during the suspension? Attempting to deposit or withdraw FIL during the suspension period is highly discouraged. Such transactions may result in the loss of your funds, as the network or Bithumb’s systems may not be configured to handle them correctly. Always wait for services to be officially resumed.

The coin gained 4.68% in the past 24 hours, easily outpacing the broader crypto market’s 1.39% increase. Over the last week, BNB is up 11.45%. BNB 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold The surge was driven by a mix of technical, ecosystem, and institutional forces. From a technical perspective, BNB cleared the key Fibonacci resistance at $952.11, backed by a bullish MACD divergence. Notably, the breakout ignited algorithmic buying and short-covering, with the move amplified by BNB’s low turnover ratio of just 2.96%, which means even moderate volumes can move the price sharply. On the fundamentals side, momentum is building across the BNB Chain. The recently deployed Maxwell upgrade, which cut block times to 0.75 seconds, has accelerated throughput, while the auto-burn mechanism continues to tighten supply. These features, combined with an expanding dApp ecosystem, have made BNB increasingly attractive to long-term holders. Institutional flows added further weight. Corporate treasuries such as Windtree Therapeutics disclosed $520 million in BNB purchases, strengthening the perception that major players are starting to treat BNB as a reserve-style digital asset. BNB price analysis At current levels, resistance lies at the 127.2% Fibonacci extension ($1,040.40). A sustained close above the recent swing high of $993.13 would confirm continuation toward that target. Overbought RSI conditions suggest caution, but the 30-day trend (+18.92%) points to structural demand. Renowned on-chain analyst Ali Martinez noted that BNB’s momentum could carry even further, with a potential upside target of $1,300 in the weeks ahead. That would mark a $300 price increase from the digital assets current price.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently trading in the sub-$0.50 zone, have recently gained attention for their potential to hit as high as $2.50 in the current cycle. As Dogecoin remains a memecoin-fueled sensation, Mutuum Finance is establishing itself as much more: a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol for achieving true utility across DeFi. With on-chain credit markets and robust demand-generating protocols starting to pick up, Mutuum Finance’s set of fundamentals are especially impressive in the crypto market today. Dogecoin Trades Near $0.27 in Today’s Market Dogecoin (DOGE) currently trades at $0.27, with its 24-hour range trade at $0.26 and $0.28. Volume now depicts moderate action, yet price fluctuations have been limited and fueled mainly by retail enthusiasm and meme-coin dynamics. Resistance is mounting at $0.30, while support has hovered at $0.25 to $0.22 and shows a likely period of consolidation unless new catalysts are introduced. Compared with the current trajectory of DOGE, newer-generation DeFi project Mutuum Finance is regarded as having greater potential for upside. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to perform well in presale phase six, racking up gigantic momentum with investor numbers rising in the market. The project already has more than 16,370 holders and has crossed $15.9 million in capital, with recent reports suggesting that momentum will continue to gain speed. Such record-breaking bounds are a strong indication of growing investors’ trust as the platform moves closer to launch. Early Bird Strategic Advantage In addition to presale investors locking up tokens at a completely astronomically lower cost, they are also standing in line for out-of-this-world day-one gains of up to 300%, and yet even more long-term potential as the ecosystem keeps expanding. Early adopters are rallying around a project atop a strongly future-predictive dual lending model, long-term-engineered stablecoin, open-source and completely audited codebase, and tokenomics for scarcity and appreciation generation. Put them together, and Mutuum Finance is a seriously legitimate disruptor to usher in the next generation of DeFi innovation. Bug Bounty Program Securing Security In a further attempt to offer security in its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a formal bug bounty program with a pool of rewards worth $50,000 USDT. Reward is offered in four degrees of severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, such that any vulnerability can be identified and eliminated. In opening itself up to external developer and researcher audit of its platform, Mutuum also opens itself up to the newest security controls, imparting security and confidence into its investor base. Risk Controls Embedded and Market Provisions Mutuum Tiered Loan-to-Value levels and liquidation levels depend on the volatility of the underlying collateral. Reserve multipliers that move from a level of around 10% for safer items to up to 35% for riskier items capture the second source of stability. The system is as delicately balanced between access and safety, and more market participation is made possible while systemic risk is contained. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Dogecoin (DOGE) both currently sit at prices below $0.50, but both have vastly different drivers of value. DOGE is resting at prices of roughly $0.27 with top drivers being retail sentiment and meme momentum, whereas Mutuum Finance is working on a DeFi lending and borrowing protocol with real utility. MUTM Stage 6 presale is already live with $15.9M raised and has acquired 16,370+ holders with tokens priced at $0.035 before advancing to $0.04 in Stage 7.

However, a groundbreaking survey from the DeFi Education Fund reveals a surprising truth: a significant portion of Americans are ready to embrace DeFi regulation . This isn’t just a niche interest; it’s a clear signal that mainstream adoption hinges on establishing clear, thoughtful rules for this innovative financial ecosystem. What’s the Buzz Around DeFi Regulation? Imagine a financial system that’s open, transparent, and accessible to everyone, everywhere. That’s the promise of DeFi. Yet, for many, the lack of established guidelines has been a major hurdle. The recent survey sheds light on this hesitation, indicating that nearly half of all Americans are willing to dive into DeFi, but only if it operates within a regulated framework. Key Finding: 42% of respondents would use DeFi under a regulated framework. This figure highlights a strong desire for security and clarity. Payment Services Potential: Among those willing, a remarkable 84% expressed readiness to try DeFi-based payment services. This suggests a massive untapped market for innovative payment solutions. This data points to a crucial intersection where innovation meets consumer protection. It suggests that appropriate DeFi regulation could unlock a new era of financial services for millions. Why Are Americans Eyeing Regulated DeFi? It’s not just about curiosity; there’s a deeper reason behind this willingness to engage with regulated DeFi. The survey also uncovered a significant lack of trust in existing financial systems. Only 29% of respondents believe the current U.S. financial system is truly safe. This sentiment is powerful. It indicates that people are actively seeking alternatives that offer greater transparency, security, and fairness. DeFi regulation , when done right, can provide the assurance needed for individuals to confidently explore these new avenues. It’s about building bridges of trust between cutting-edge technology and everyday users. Consider the benefits: enhanced consumer protection, reduced fraud risks, and a level playing field for all participants. These are the pillars upon which a trusted financial system, traditional or decentralized, must stand. The Promise of Regulated DeFi Payments The enthusiasm for DeFi isn’t limited to just financial products like lending or borrowing. A significant portion of the surveyed group expressed a strong interest in using DeFi for everyday transactions. The idea of regulated DeFi-based payment services is particularly appealing. Faster Transactions: Imagine sending money globally in minutes, not days. Lower Fees: Bypassing traditional intermediaries can significantly reduce costs. Greater Control: Users maintain more direct control over their funds. These advantages, combined with the security provided by clear DeFi regulation , could revolutionize how we think about and use money daily. It’s about creating more efficient, inclusive, and user-centric payment experiences. Navigating the Path to Mainstream DeFi Regulation While the demand for regulated DeFi is evident, the path to achieving it is complex. Regulators face the challenge of understanding a rapidly evolving technology while simultaneously protecting consumers and fostering innovation. This isn’t a simple task, but the survey provides a clear mandate for action. Key Considerations for Effective DeFi Regulation: Clarity: Establishing clear definitions and legal frameworks for DeFi protocols and assets. Consumer Protection: Implementing safeguards against scams, hacks, and financial exploitation. Innovation: Crafting rules that don’t stifle technological advancement and growth. Global Coordination: Harmonizing regulations across different jurisdictions to prevent arbitrage and ensure market stability. The future of finance could very well be decentralized, but its widespread adoption depends heavily on thoughtful and effective DeFi regulation . It’s a collaborative effort between innovators, users, and policymakers to build a financial system that serves everyone. Summary: A Clear Call for Action The survey from the DeFi Education Fund delivers a compelling message: Americans are ready for DeFi, but they want it to be safe and sound. The willingness of 4 in 10 respondents to engage with regulated DeFi, coupled with the strong interest in payment services, underscores the immense potential of this technology. It also highlights a critical opportunity for regulators to step up and provide the clarity and oversight necessary to unlock DeFi’s full promise. The future of finance is evolving, and DeFi regulation will be a cornerstone of its mainstream success. Frequently Asked Questions About Regulated DeFi Q1: What is DeFi?

A2: Americans desire regulation for DeFi primarily for security and trust. Many are wary of unregulated financial systems due to potential risks like fraud, hacks, and lack of consumer protection. Regulation can provide a framework of safety and legitimacy. Q3: What benefits could regulated DeFi offer? A3: Regulated DeFi could offer several benefits, including enhanced consumer protection, reduced risks of scams, greater transparency, potentially faster and cheaper financial services (especially payments), and increased trust, leading to broader adoption. Q4: How does DeFi regulation compare to traditional finance regulation? A4: Traditional finance operates under well-established, comprehensive regulatory frameworks. DeFi regulation is still evolving and aims to apply similar principles of consumer protection and market integrity to a decentralized, blockchain-based environment, often requiring new approaches due to its unique technological characteristics. Q5: What are the challenges in implementing DeFi regulation? A5: Challenges include the decentralized and global nature of DeFi, which makes enforcement difficult; the rapid pace of technological innovation; defining which entities are responsible for compliance; and ensuring regulations foster innovation rather than stifling it.

He revealed that lawmakers have strong bipartisan support for the bill. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act defines the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and other financial agencies in regulating digital assets, especially those outside the scope of stablecoins. Armstrong said he has never been more confident about the bill’s passage, arguing that the measure is essential to keeping the crypto industry rooted in the U.S. He said its passage will prevent a regulatory overreach witnessed under the ruling of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Sen. Lummis expects the Clarity Act to reach Trump’s desk soon Armstrong said the Senate strongly supported the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, with bipartisan support. The legislation is expected to be released to the public soon for feedback. The bill passed in the U.S House of Representatives in July alongside the GENIUS Act and the Anti-CBD Surveillance State Act. Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, while the other two remain under Senate review. I was in DC the last few days working to get MARKET STRUCTURE legislation passed for crypto.

Cythia Lummis, speaking at an event in Jackson Hole last month, said that the Clarity Act bill will reach the President’s desk before the end of the year. She said that the Republican goal is to pass a market structure bill at the Senate Banking Committee by the end of the year. This would be followed by considerations from the Senate Agriculture Committee in October. Both Committees would address U.S. financial regulators and how the SEC handles digital assets. Washington’s discussion included executives from Ripple, Kraken, Circle, Cardano, and venture capital firms such as Paradigm, a16z, and Multicoin Capital. Arjun Sethi, Kraken’s CEO, revealed that his focus is to ensure that crypto industry developers are prioritized. He emphasized the need to protect the ability to develop protocols, chains, tokenized equities, and other assets in a way that benefits the innovators. Armstrong also highlighted the unsuccessful attempts to prevent stablecoin competition from the banking sector. He cited lobbying efforts to ban interest-bearing stablecoins under the GENIUS Act, which later failed. He urged the lawmakers never to allow similar measures to destroy innovation. Coinbase CEO warns of rapid changes ahead of Clarity Act legislation The Bitcoin Act, sponsored by Sen. Lummis, was brought into subject during the discussions in Washington. The bill seeks to establish a national reserve of 1 million BTC accumulation within five years via budget-neutral methods such as reassessing Treasury gold certificates and reallocating tariff revenues. Several Bitcoin advocates, including Strategy’s Michael Saylor, attended the meeting. The Clarity Act developments follow the recent EU’s imposition of anti-money laundering rules on crypto firms, requiring them to collect and retain user data for regulatory purposes. Conversely, Russia legalized Bitcoin mining and allowed its use in international trade in 2024. Altcoins surged after the passage of the three bills in the House of Representatives in July, including Solana, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano. The total market cap of crypto assets crossed $4 trillion. Cryptopolitan recently reported on altcoins’ surge in August, with Ethereum reaching a new all-time high of $4,885. Ethereum ecosystem tokens such as Arbitrum, Aave, and Ethena increased by over 20%. Solana ecosystem meme coins such as Fartcoin, Pudgy Penguins, and SPX6900 also recorded high momentum. Large-cap coins such as Solana and Dogecoin recorded net gains above 10%, as small-cap demand grew, fueled by Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a layer two project that raised $11 million in presale. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong highlighted that the legislative process is moving faster than ever, warning companies to prepare for rapid regulatory changes.

Bitcoin is still firm above $115,000, Ethereum is ranging around $4,497.8, and Cardano is steadily recovering despite recent trading volume dips. Along with these veterans, Remittix is becoming one of the best crypto presales in 2025, its token costing $0.1080 and raising over $26 million in pre-investment. BTC Price, Ethereum and Cardano Market Update Bitcoin is the market stalwart, trading at $115,782.61 and going up 0.3% over the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization of $2.3 trillion places it firmly ahead, and the trading volume has gone up 15.79% to $49.33 billion. Ethereum has also been resilient, trading at $4,497 and going up 1.08%, supported by a strong market cap of $541.65 billion. Daily trading volumes in ETH have gone up to $31.92 billion, an increase by a 3.61% hike. Cardano, meanwhile, is worth $0.8667 with a modest 0.26% gain. The market capitalization of ADA is still at $30.99 billion, keeping it in the spotlight, though its 9.2% drop in trading volume obviously suggests that traders are exercising caution. Remitix On the Rise as a New Contender While BTC price and Ethereum are hogging the headlines, Remittix (RTX) is fast leaving its own imprint. The project has sold over 665 million tokens already, and the presale amount crossed over $26 million. In contrast to meme-based currencies, Remittix features real-world utility, with an emphasis on crypto-to-bank payments across 30+ countries, real-time FX trading, and 40+ digital asset support on launch. The key landmarks have helped fuel the hype. The project has just announced listings on BitMart and LBank, two centralized exchanges that will improve liquidity and global access once the presale is finalized. Additionally, the Remittix team is now verified by CertiK, the world’s leading blockchain security auditor, with the project ranked #1 on pre-launch tokens on CertiK Skynet. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction More than $26 Million raised in presale to date Ranked #1 by CertiK amongst pre-launch projects Actual-world remittance utility in a $19 trillion market Beta testing of the Remittix wallet already in progress Forecast Looking Ahead To Q4 As Q4 progresses, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano continue to be at the fore of market sentiment. Focus, however, is now on future crypto projects such as Remittix, which pair low gas fee crypto solutions with robust roadmap and clear use case. With its deflationary token model, ongoing presale, and features like the 15% referral scheme and an ongoing $250,000 giveaway, RTX is setting itself up not only as the next big altcoin of 2025 but also as a viable DeFi project that carries concrete real-world adoption prospects.

Specifically, an address associated with the Bhutanese government transferred 343.1 BTC, valued at an astonishing $40.18 million, to a new address just an hour ago, according to Onchain Lens. This substantial Bhutan BTC sell-off has immediately fueled speculation across the market. On-chain analysis firm Onchain Lens further reported that these funds are likely headed for a centralized exchange (CEX). This pattern aligns with past instances where the Bhutanese government has been observed selling BTC. For example, in July, it deposited a total of 650 BTC to Binance, one of the world’s largest centralized exchanges. Such movements are closely watched by investors and analysts alike, as they can signal shifts in strategy or liquidity needs from major holders. What’s Driving the Bhutan BTC Sell-Off Strategy? Bhutan’s foray into Bitcoin has been a quiet but intriguing story. The kingdom reportedly engaged in Bitcoin mining for several years, leveraging its abundant hydropower resources. While the exact scale of its holdings and mining operations remains somewhat opaque, these recent transfers bring its activities into sharper focus. The question on everyone’s mind is: why is the government selling? Several factors could contribute to a Bhutan BTC sell-off . Governments, like any large entity, manage their treasuries for various national objectives. Potential reasons for liquidating crypto assets include: Funding National Projects: The funds could be used to finance infrastructure development, social programs, or other government initiatives. Diversification: Governments often seek to diversify their reserves to mitigate risk, moving assets from volatile cryptocurrencies to more stable fiat currencies or traditional investments. Liquidity Needs: Immediate financial requirements might necessitate converting digital assets into spendable cash. Risk Management: Reducing exposure to the inherent volatility of Bitcoin, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Understanding the precise motivations behind such transfers remains challenging without official statements. However, on-chain data provides invaluable clues. The Market Impact: Should We Be Concerned About This Bhutan BTC Sell-Off? Large transfers of Bitcoin, especially from known entities like a government, often spark market concern. These movements are sometimes referred to as ‘whale’ activity, capable of influencing market sentiment and even price action. When significant amounts of BTC are moved to a centralized exchange, the immediate assumption is that they are intended for sale. This can create selling pressure or at least the expectation of it. The impact of a Bhutan BTC sell-off on the broader market depends on several factors: Execution Strategy: Whether the sale is executed gradually over time or in large, sudden blocks. Market Depth: The overall liquidity of the market at the time of sale. Overall Sentiment: How bullish or bearish the market is generally feeling. While $40.2 million is a substantial sum, the Bitcoin market has grown considerably. It can absorb such sales without catastrophic price drops, especially if spread out. Nevertheless, the speculation itself can cause short-term jitters among traders and investors. Leveraging On-Chain Analysis to Understand Government Crypto Moves The ability to track these transfers is a testament to the transparency of public blockchains. On-chain analysis firms like Onchain Lens play a crucial role in demystifying these movements. They monitor transactions, identify patterns, and link addresses to known entities where possible. This provides a layer of insight that is often unavailable in traditional financial markets. For investors, paying attention to on-chain data can offer an early warning system for potential market shifts. While not every transfer to a CEX results in an immediate sale, it certainly signals intent. The ongoing Bhutan BTC sell-off narrative highlights the power of these tools in a decentralized financial landscape. In conclusion, the recent $40.2 million Bitcoin transfer by the Bhutanese government has undeniably ignited a wave of speculation regarding a potential Bhutan BTC sell-off . While the specific reasons remain undisclosed, historical patterns and the destination of funds suggest a liquidation strategy. This event underscores the growing intersection of sovereign wealth and digital assets, and the increasing importance of on-chain transparency in understanding these complex financial maneuvers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a centralized exchange (CEX)? A centralized exchange (CEX) is a platform where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. These exchanges are operated by a central company, which holds the users’ funds and manages the order books, similar to traditional stock exchanges. Q2: Why is the Bhutanese government selling Bitcoin? The exact reasons are not officially stated, but common motivations for governments or large entities selling crypto include funding national projects, diversifying treasury holdings, meeting liquidity needs, or managing exposure to market volatility. Q3: How do we know the funds belong to the Bhutanese government? On-chain analysis firms like Onchain Lens use sophisticated techniques to identify and link specific blockchain addresses to known entities, often through historical transaction patterns, public disclosures, or associations with other identified addresses. Q4: Will this Bitcoin transfer significantly impact the BTC price? While a $40.2 million transfer is substantial, the overall Bitcoin market is vast and has considerable liquidity. The impact depends on how the sale is executed (gradually or all at once) and the prevailing market sentiment. It might cause short-term fluctuations but is unlikely to trigger a major market crash on its own. Q5: What is on-chain analysis? On-chain analysis involves examining publicly available data on a blockchain, such as transaction volumes, wallet activity, and asset flows, to gain insights into market trends, investor behavior, and the movements of specific entities.

The exemption lets intermediaries distribute stablecoins from firms already holding an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) without getting their own separate licenses. The relief will apply to secondary distribution of stablecoins and will start once registered on the Federal Register of Legislation. This development marks the country’s first formal step toward easing licensing requirements in the digital assets sector. As reported by Cryptopolitan at the beginning of the year, the Australian government had made new amendments to its legal regulations of digital assets that seek to improve the marketplace’s solidity and consumer safeguards. The rules hoped to exempt small businesses and firms outside the financial service sector, while larger cryptocurrency trading platforms would be required to seek an AFSL ASIC gives exemption to stablecoin distributors ASIC has created the Corporations (Stablecoin Distribution Exemption) Instrument 2025/631 exemption to ease policies around stablecoin exchanges. Before this exemption, exchanges, brokers, and stablecoin platforms went through a long and costly process of applying for an AFSL. They also had to apply for market or clearing and settlement licenses, even when a licensed company already issued the specific stablecoin. Now, they don’t need a separate license as long as the stablecoin issuer already holds an AFSL. AUDM by Catena Digital is the first token under this exemption, which means intermediaries can distribute it without applying for their separate licenses. However, ASIC still requires intermediaries to provide crucial information to clients, such as Catena Digital’s product disclosure statement (PDS) for AUDM (if the company prepared one). The PDS explains how the stablecoin works, the risks involved, and other important information people should know before trading it. ASIC said the exemption doesn’t change the legal status of stablecoins, but aims to allow companies to build more services for stablecoins while protecting consumers at the same time. In short, applying for a license is now simpler and quicker, but oversight on implementation remains strict. This exemption is the first of its kind in Australia and shows that ASIC wants to promote innovations without sacrificing consumer safety. ASIC plans to extend relief as the Treasury comes up with new rules ASIC also hopes to extend this relief to other stablecoins in the future, but issuers must first apply for and receive an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL). With a license, the exemption can also apply to intermediaries, and users could access more stablecoins. The idea is to reduce the current pressure on intermediaries while the Australian Treasury works on a full and permanent framework for stablecoins. CEO of Blockchain APAC, Steve Vallas, said ASIC’s exemption was practical because it removes a lot of friction that intermediaries face when they want to work with stablecoins. He added that the plan aligns with Australia’s financial services, but should be a temporary solution until the Treasury comes up with a permanent one. The decision also connects to the work ASIC has been doing for the past year to explain how current financial laws apply to digital assets. The agency released a consultation paper called CP 381 in December 2024, which was linked to its updates to the guidance document known as INFO 225. In this document, ASIC requested public feedback on how the definitions of financial products should apply to many types of digital tokens. These included stablecoins, tokens created by crypto exchanges, meme coins, tokens backed by commodities, and wrapped tokens. ASIC also included examples in the consultation paper to make it easier for businesses and intermediaries to understand when a digital asset should be treated as a financial product and what legal duties would apply to them.

Enhanced Ecosystem Development: A stronger BNB price provides more resources and incentives for developers to build on Binance Smart Chain, fostering innovation. Broader Market Validation: BNB’s sustained growth reinforces the idea that utility-driven tokens with strong fundamentals can achieve significant valuations. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile. While the current momentum is strong, careful consideration of market dynamics remains essential for all participants. Navigating the Future After the BNB All-Time High For existing BNB holders, this milestone is certainly a cause for celebration. For those looking to enter the market or expand their portfolios, it prompts important questions about future trajectories.

Many altcoins have produced impressive gains over the past day, and BNB has stolen the show again as it marked a new ATH at just over $1,000. BTC Eyes $118K Bitcoin’s gradual price increase began at the beginning of the previous business week. At the time, the asset dipped to just under $111,000, but that support held the price, and it started to recover almost immediately. By Friday, it had climbed to $116,000 but faced some resistance there from the bears. It couldn’t continue upwards during the weekend but tapped $116,800 on Monday morning, only to be pushed south to $114,400 later that day. The bulls reemerged at that point and didn’t allow another breakdown. Just the opposite, BTC started to gain traction and jumped to $117,200 yesterday ahead of the highly anticipated FOMC meeting. In the hours leading to the Fed’s announcement, bitcoin lost some ground and dipped to $114,800. However, it had recovered to roughly $116,000 when the US central bank outlined a 25 bps rate cut, as many anticipated . At first, bitcoin remained relatively still but jumped during the early morning Thursday session to a new multi-week peak of almost $118,000. It was stopped there, for now at least, and sits at just over $117,000 as of press time. Its market cap has risen to $2.335 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts has taken a big hit and is down to 55.6%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView BNB Taps $1K The declining BTC dominance means that many alts have outperformed it over the past day. This is particularly true for PENGU (14%), M (13%), AVAX (9%), and SUI (8%), which lead in terms of daily gains. HYPE, BCH, HBAR, LINK, SOL, DOGE, and ADA have charted price increases of up to 6%. BNB has added 4.5% on a daily scale, but managed to break through $1,000 to chart a new all-time high earlier today. Ethereum is close to $4,600, while XRP is at $3.1. The total crypto market cap is up by $60 billion since yesterday and is above $4.2 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Recent developments, particularly the Federal Reserve rate cut , have sent significant ripples across the global economy, directly impacting the Forex market volatility . These shifts in major currency valuations, especially the unexpected surge in US Dollar strength , are not just abstract economic phenomena; they can profoundly influence investor sentiment, capital flows, and ultimately, the performance of digital assets. Let’s unpack these crucial movements and their broader implications. What Triggered the Federal Reserve Rate Cut and Its Immediate Aftermath? Central banks worldwide are grappling with complex economic landscapes, balancing inflation control with economic growth. The recent decision by the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates was a pivotal moment, signaling a strategic response to evolving economic indicators. While the specific rationale often involves managing inflation targets, supporting employment, and maintaining financial stability, the market’s reaction can sometimes defy initial expectations. Historically, a rate cut might be perceived as a bearish signal for a currency, as lower rates typically reduce its attractiveness to foreign investors seeking higher returns. However, the immediate aftermath of this particular Federal Reserve rate cut presented a nuanced picture. Instead of weakening, the US Dollar demonstrated surprising resilience, even gaining ground against several major currencies. This unexpected display of US Dollar strength can be attributed to several factors: Relative Economic Performance: Despite the cut, the US economy might still be perceived as relatively stronger or more stable compared to other major economies, making the dollar a safe haven. Market Expectations: Sometimes, a rate cut is already ‘priced in’ by the market. If the cut was less aggressive than anticipated, or accompanied by hawkish forward guidance, it could lead to dollar appreciation. Global Uncertainty: In times of global economic or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to the US Dollar as a traditional safe-haven asset, irrespective of minor rate adjustments. This counter-intuitive response highlights the intricate dance between monetary policy, market psychology, and global economic conditions. Understanding the Drivers Behind Surging US Dollar Strength The persistent US Dollar strength following the Fed’s action is a testament to its enduring role in the global financial system. Several key drivers contributed to this upward trajectory, creating a challenging environment for other currencies and commodities. One primary factor is the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. In periods of economic stress or market uncertainty, capital tends to flow into dollar-denominated assets, driving up its value. This ‘flight to safety’ phenomenon often overrides the direct impact of interest rate differentials, especially if other major economies face even greater headwinds. Consider the following elements that bolster the dollar: Safe-Haven Appeal: Global economic slowdown fears or geopolitical tensions can trigger demand for the dollar. Interest Rate Differentials: While the Fed cut rates, other central banks might be perceived as even more dovish, or their economies weaker, making US yields still relatively attractive. Technical Factors and Positioning: Large institutional investors often hold significant long positions in the dollar, and these positions can be self-reinforcing. Economic Resilience: Data indicating robust US labor markets or stronger-than-expected GDP growth, even post-cut, can provide fundamental support for the dollar. This robust dollar performance has implications beyond currency traders, influencing everything from commodity prices to the cost of international trade. Navigating the Turbulence: A Look at Forex Market Volatility The period immediately following a significant central bank announcement is almost always characterized by heightened Forex market volatility . This volatility refers to the rapid and often unpredictable price swings in currency exchange rates. For traders and investors, this presents both opportunities and risks. The dollar’s gains against other major currencies, such as the Euro and the Yen, created significant shifts in key currency pairs. For instance, EUR/USD might have seen a sharp decline, while USD/JPY could have rallied. This dynamism necessitates a cautious approach for market participants. Let’s examine some common impacts of increased Forex volatility: Increased Trading Opportunities: For day traders and algorithmic systems, higher volatility can mean more opportunities to profit from price movements. Higher Risk: Conversely, rapid swings can lead to significant losses if positions are not managed effectively. Stop-loss orders become critical. Impact on Businesses: Companies engaged in international trade face greater currency risk, affecting their revenues and costs when converting foreign earnings or paying suppliers. Capital Flows: Volatility can influence where global capital is deployed, as investors seek stability or higher returns in less turbulent markets. Understanding the patterns and drivers of this volatility is crucial for anyone involved in global finance, including those in the crypto space, as major currency movements often foreshadow or amplify shifts in risk appetite. What’s Next for the Sterling Outlook Ahead of the Bank of England Meeting? While the US Dollar captured headlines with its surprising strength, the British Pound (Sterling) faced its own set of challenges, trading lower ahead of the anticipated Bank of England (BoE) meeting. The Sterling outlook is currently shaped by a confluence of domestic economic data, inflation pressures, and the BoE’s monetary policy stance. The BoE, like other central banks, is navigating the delicate balance of taming inflation without stifling economic growth. Market participants closely scrutinize every statement and data release for clues about future interest rate decisions. A cautious or dovish tone from the BoE, coupled with persistent inflation or weak growth figures, could further weigh on the Pound. Key factors influencing the Sterling outlook include: Factor Potential Impact on Sterling UK Inflation Data Higher inflation might prompt BoE to hold rates, potentially supporting GBP. Lower inflation could lead to cuts, weakening GBP. Economic Growth Figures Strong growth supports a stronger currency; weak growth pressures it. BoE Commentary Dovish signals (hints at future cuts) weaken GBP; hawkish signals (hints at holding/raising rates) strengthen GBP. Global Risk Sentiment In risk-off environments, the dollar often benefits at Sterling’s expense. The upcoming BoE meeting is a critical event for Sterling traders, as any deviation from market expectations could trigger significant price action. Investors will be looking for clarity on the BoE’s forward guidance and its assessment of the UK’s economic trajectory. Decoding the Global Economic Impact: Beyond Currencies The movements in major currencies, particularly the US Dollar strength and the Federal Reserve rate cut , extend their influence far beyond the Forex market. These developments have a profound global economic impact , affecting everything from commodity prices to emerging market economies and, by extension, the cryptocurrency ecosystem. When the US Dollar strengthens, it typically makes dollar-denominated commodities, such as oil and gold, more expensive for buyers using other currencies. This can dampen demand and put downward pressure on commodity prices. For emerging markets, a strong dollar can make it more challenging to service dollar-denominated debt, potentially leading to capital outflows and financial instability. The ripple effect on the broader financial landscape includes: Equity Markets: Strong dollar can impact the earnings of multinational corporations, especially those with significant overseas operations, as foreign profits convert to fewer dollars. Trade Balances: A stronger dollar makes US exports more expensive and imports cheaper, potentially widening the US trade deficit. Investment Flows: Capital may shift from riskier assets or regions to perceived safer havens, often benefiting the US. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding this global economic impact is vital. A strong dollar environment, often indicative of risk aversion, can sometimes correlate with a pullback in risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, periods of dollar weakness might signal a greater appetite for speculative investments. The interconnectedness of global finance means that no asset class exists in a vacuum; the tides of traditional markets inevitably touch the shores of the digital economy. A Shifting Landscape: Key Takeaways for the Informed Investor The recent Federal Reserve rate cut and the subsequent surge in US Dollar strength have injected a new layer of complexity into global financial markets. The resulting Forex market volatility , combined with a challenging Sterling outlook ahead of the Bank of England meeting, underscores a period of significant flux. For investors, these developments highlight the importance of staying informed and agile. While the immediate drivers are central bank policies and economic data, the underlying theme is one of ongoing global economic adjustment. The dollar’s resilience in the face of a rate cut serves as a powerful reminder that market reactions are multifaceted, often driven by relative performance and safe-haven demand rather than simplistic cause-and-effect relationships. The global economic impact of these currency shifts is far-reaching, influencing everything from international trade to the valuations of diverse asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. As we move forward, market participants will need to closely monitor central bank communications, key economic indicators, and geopolitical developments to navigate this dynamic environment successfully. Adaptability and a holistic understanding of market interconnectedness will be key to identifying both risks and opportunities in the coming months.

This coincides with the introduction of new ETF listing guidelines that make the process easier for issuers. Multi-Asset Crypto ETF Gets Go-ahead Peter Mintzberg, Grayscale’s CEO, shared the news in a September 18 X post, noting that the company’s team is “working expeditiously to bring the *FIRST* multi #crypto asset ETP to market.” The fund tracks the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index and will operate with daily cash creation and redemption of 10,000-share baskets. Shares will trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GDLC, offering investors access to various digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). The green light comes after a months-long process that began with Grayscale’s June filing to convert GDLC from a private trust into a publicly traded ETF. NYSE Arca submitted its rule change proposal on July 1, causing the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets to approve the listing. However, the agency issued a temporary stay the following day amid internal concerns over multi-asset crypto ETFs. In mid-August, the asset manager filed a legal challenge, arguing that the financial watchdog had missed its statutory deadline under the Exchange Act. This prompted the agency to lift its order and grant full approval on September 17. New Crypto ETF Listing Framework On the same day, the SEC also cleared new rules to adopt generic listing standards for exchange-traded products (ETPs) that hold spot commodities, including digital assets. “This approval helps to maximize investor choice and foster innovation by streamlining the listing process and reducing barriers to access digital asset products within America’s trusted capital markets,” said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. The move is expected to speed up the path to market for new ETFs by removing the lengthy 19(b) rule filing process, which can stretch up to 240 days and requires the regulator to issue a direct ruling. Under the new system, ETF issuers can work directly with exchanges such as Nasdaq, NYSE, or CBOE. If their product meets the requirements, the exchange can proceed with registering it. Meanwhile, the listing and trading of p.m.-settled options on the Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index and the Mini-Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index, including third-Friday, nonstandard, and quarterly expirations, has also been given the green light. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said the “crypto ETF floodgates” are about to open, with a surge of new filings and launches expected. He added that the investment products will provide a bridge between traditional finance and DeFi, giving mainstream access to digital assets.

According to federal authorities, he orchestrated a Ponzi scheme that defrauded more than 90,000 global investors. The 60-year-old dual citizen of the United States and the Philippines admitted in federal court that he used Praetorian Group International (PGI) to lure investors with false promises of daily profits. Between December 2019 and October 2021, PGI raised more than $201 million, including $30.3 million in cash and over 8,000 bitcoin valued at approximately $171.5 million. In April, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Palafox and PGI Global for defrauding investors of $198 million in a crypto and forex Ponzi scheme. The SEC alleged that he misused funds for luxury purchases and paying other investors until the company collapsed. Notably, PGI’s website was seized in 2021, shutting down its UK operations. The SEC charged Ramil Palafox and his company PGI Global on Tuesday for running a nearly $200 million crypto scheme. #RamilPalafox #TheSEC https://t.co/PCRxfNUv4u — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 23, 2025 Fake Bitcoin Trading Guru Stole $62M for Lambos & Penthouses Palafox claimed that PGI was engaged in high-volume bitcoin trading and promised investors daily returns of 0.5 to 3%. According to prosecutors, PGI did not operate at a level capable of delivering such profits. Instead, Palafox used funds from new investors to pay earlier ones, the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme. To keep the scheme running, Palafox launched an investor portal that displayed fabricated account growth. The system showed participants their investments were gaining value, reinforcing the illusion of security and profitability. Court documents show that Palafox diverted millions of dollars in investor funds for personal use. He spent about $3 million on 20 luxury vehicles, including Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porsche, McLaren, Bentley, and BMW models. He also purchased four homes in Las Vegas and Los Angeles worth more than $6 million, paid $329,000 for penthouse hotel stays, and spent another $3 million on clothing, watches, jewelry, and furnishings from high-end retailers such as Cartier, Rolex, Gucci, and Hermes. Palafox also transferred at least $800,000 in cash and 100 bitcoin, then worth $3.3 million, to a family member. Although PGI raised more than $201 million, prosecutors said victims collectively lost at least $62.7 million. Many investors were left without access to their funds after the scheme collapsed in late 2021. As part of his plea agreement, Palafox has now agreed to pay the $62.7 million in restitution to victims. Victims are expected to check for updates on the Justice Department’s official website. In addition, Palafox will be sentenced on February 3, 2026, before the U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema. He faces a maximum of 40 years in prison but is expected to receive less under federal sentencing guidelines. Ramil Ventura Palafox’s Case Adds to the Growing List of Crypto Ponzi Scheme Earlier this month, Nathan Fuller, owner of Privvy Investments, was denied bankruptcy protection after a Texas court ruled he ran a Ponzi scheme, hid assets, and lied under oath. The U.S. Trustee Program secured a default judgment blocking his bid to erase $12.5 million in debts, leaving him personally liable. Also this month, Kevin Spacey’s new film, Holiguards Saga—The Portal of Force, is linked to controversy as co-writer and actor Vladimir Okhotnikov faces U.S. charges over a $340 million crypto Ponzi scheme tied to Forsage. Meanwhile, the CFTC secured a $228.6 million judgment against pastor Eddy Alexandre, who defrauded 25,000 investors of $262 million through his crypto Ponzi scheme EminiFX. Similar to Palafox, he promised 5–10% weekly returns using a fake “robo-advisor” system and is already serving nine years for commodities fraud. CFTC wins $228M judgment against pastor who ran crypto Ponzi promising 5-10% weekly returns, defrauding 25,000 investors. #Ponzi #Crypto https://t.co/2eLsOeMuMg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 20, 2025 The lists of crypto Ponzi schemes are endless. In August, Estonians Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turõgin were sentenced to time served for the $577 million HashFlare Ponzi scheme , ordered to pay fines, perform community service, and forfeit $450 million in assets.

The exchange’s Q1–Q2 2025 report published Thursday found that 46% cent of users cited crypto as an inflation hedge, up from 29% in the first quarter. The shift shows growing anxiety over persistent price pressures and currency weakness worldwide. East Asia recorded the steepest increase, with the share of users citing crypto as an inflation shield jumping from 23% cent to 52%. The Middle East also saw a notable rise, climbing from 27% to 45%, showing the link between macroeconomic stress and digital asset adoption. Memecoin Craze Grows in Latin America, South Asia Pushes for Financial Independence Latin America, meanwhile, has emerged as a cultural hub of crypto. Ownership of memecoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rose from 27% to 34%, while 63% of new users said passive income was their main motivation for entering the market. In South Asia, younger mobile-first populations are driving activity. Spot trading rose to 52%, up from 45%. Moreover, more than half of the respondents cited financial independence as their main motivation. Futures trading was also strong, with South Asia at 46% compared with a global average of 29%. Bitcoin and Ethereum Still Core Holdings as Stablecoins Balance Risk Public chain tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the backbone of global portfolios, held by more than 65% of investors. Confidence was highest in Latin America and Southeast Asia, where long-term belief in blockchain infrastructure remains firm. Stablecoin holdings remained steady at about 50% worldwide. This shows that investors are balancing caution with a search for yield. The survey showed sharp differences across regions. In South Asia and Southeast Asia, investors leaned heavily into futures trading. Meanwhile, Latin America shifted toward safer, lower-risk approaches. Wealth distribution is also changing. High-value wallets above $20,000 fell in East Asia from 39% to 33%, reflecting regulatory pressure and profit-taking. At the same time, mid-tier wallets grew, indicating a broader spread of assets across retail participants. Rising Inflation Fears Push More Investors Toward Crypto for Wealth Protection Analysts say more investors now see crypto as a hedge against inflation. This reflects a wider distrust of fiat currencies. In places where exchange rates are weakening or inflation is persistent, digital assets are increasingly viewed as a store of value, even with their volatility. Looking ahead, MEXC expects “wealth protection” to become the main reason for new users by the third quarter if global macro pressures continue. At the same time, futures and margin trading are likely to grow as the bull cycle matures. Traders are seeking more structured ways to capture yield. Retail enthusiasm is also shifting. Memecoins and new narratives such as AI-linked tokens are expected to fuel short-term inflows. However, public chain tokens are set to remain the backbone of investor portfolios. “Crypto adoption is evolving in different ways and paces across the world, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach,” said Tracy Jin, chief operating officer at MEXC. She noted that regional patterns range from inflation hedges in East Asia to community-driven growth in Latin America. The survey results come as inflation remains stubborn in many parts of the world. For investors, crypto is no longer seen only as a speculative tool. It is also becoming an alternative instrument to protect wealth from the erosion of purchasing power.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin’s September rally shows no signs of slowing down. The token has now reclaimed the important $117K resistance level. With no other major resistance in sight, $BTC should now be gearing up to charge toward its all-time highs of $124,501 – a chunky 6.30% move from current price levels. On the charts, BTC’s current run-up is coming from a solid bounce off the 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart. Even better, the last couple of 4-hour candlesticks have together formed an inside candle pattern – with the second candle being totally inside the first candle’s high and low. This, especially given that it’s coming right after a breakout, suggests a potential continuation move to the upside, as bulls consolidate strength before the next leg higher. Right from the beginning of this month, there were high expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, which probably contributed to Bitcoin’s positive momentum. Experts believe the latest 25 bps rate cut is just one of many this year. So, with both fundamental and technical tailwinds, Bitcoin looks well-positioned to hit new ATHs in the coming weeks. Bulls Celebrate Rally as Fed Cut Interest Rates! Bitcoin Uptober Coming as Bitcoin Hyper’s Presale Hit $16.5M September 18, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The Fed has just cut interest rates by 25 points, and the crypto market is gobbling it up: Bitcoin’s trading volume spiked by 44% in the last day Ethereum’s trading volume shot up by 40% Solana is up by 3% to $242 after an intraday peak of $247 XRP touched $3.10 after the Fed decision was announced Some X analysts claim that September FOMC meetings typically precede big rallies . If that’s the case, then we might see $BTC aim for $120K–$125K or even higher. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is also at 71 , showing a parabolic upward trend these past couple of days. This could indicate bullish times for altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP. But the biggest gainers might be top trending cryptos and crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which has just hit $16.5M in its presale. $HYPER is building a Bitcoin Layer-2 to bring dApps and smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem, which could lit a fire under Bitcoin’s feet. Read more about Bitcoin Hyper in our guide, and make a smart decision. US Fed Rate Cut Strengthens $BTC Price Outlook – Why Bitcoin Hyper Could Deliver More September 18, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin is heading into one of its most historically bullish periods, and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 25 bps rate cut further strengthens the odds. A look at historical patterns reveals that bitcoin’s price often peaks around 20 months after halving; we could see a potential cycle top by December of this year. As bitcoin exposure becomes increasingly accessible through spot bitcoin ETFs, a series of rallies are on the horizon. But ETFs are not the only way to gain exposure to bitcoin. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has emerged as another popular gateway to Bitcoin’s next journey. The project is building a layer-2 solution that makes Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and programmable. As expected, whales and retail investors are circling the presale, pushing it past the $16.5M milestone.

His statement, emphasizing that there is no need to rush on Fed interest rates , sends a clear signal of caution and deliberation. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, understanding the nuances of this stance is absolutely crucial, as the ripple effects of central bank decisions often extend far into the digital asset landscape. Understanding Powell’s Stance on Fed Interest Rates Jerome Powell’s recent remarks underscore the Federal Reserve’s commitment to a patient strategy. Rather than aggressively adjusting borrowing costs, the Fed aims to observe incoming economic data closely before making any significant moves. This means we are likely to see a period of stability regarding Fed interest rates , which can have various implications across different sectors of the economy. What exactly does “no need to rush” signify? It suggests: Data Dependency: The Fed will prioritize economic indicators like inflation, employment figures, and growth rates. Avoiding Premature Action: There is a clear desire to avoid tightening monetary policy too quickly, which could stifle economic recovery. Flexibility: The central bank wants to maintain optionality, allowing it to respond effectively to unforeseen economic shifts. Why is the Fed Exercising Such Caution with Interest Rates? The cautious approach to Fed interest rates stems from a complex economic environment. While inflation has shown signs of cooling, it remains a key concern. Simultaneously, the labor market, though robust, is under constant scrutiny for signs of softening. The Fed is walking a tightrope, aiming to bring inflation down to its 2% target without triggering a significant economic downturn. Several factors contribute to this careful deliberation: Persistent Inflation: Despite recent improvements, inflation rates are still above the Fed’s target, necessitating vigilance. Global Economic Headwinds: International conflicts and supply chain issues continue to pose risks to economic stability. Lag Effects of Policy: Changes in interest rates do not impact the economy immediately; there’s a significant lag. The Fed is mindful of the full effect of past rate hikes still unfolding. How Do Fed Interest Rates Influence the Crypto Market? The connection between traditional monetary policy and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies might not always seem direct, but it is profound. When the Federal Reserve maintains stable Fed interest rates or signals a slower pace of hikes, it often creates an environment perceived as more favorable for risk assets, including Bitcoin and altcoins. Here’s how Fed policy can ripple through crypto: Risk Appetite: Lower or stable interest rates can make traditional, safer investments less attractive, prompting investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets like crypto. Dollar Strength: The Fed’s stance influences the strength of the US Dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated assets, including cryptocurrencies, more appealing to international investors. Liquidity: A less aggressive Fed typically means more liquidity in the financial system, which can flow into various asset classes, including digital ones. Conversely, a hawkish Fed, characterized by rapid hikes in Fed interest rates , tends to make investors more cautious, often leading to sell-offs in speculative assets. What’s Next for the Economy and Your Digital Assets? Powell’s “no rush” declaration suggests that significant shifts in Fed interest rates are not imminent. This period of potential stability could offer a clearer runway for both traditional and crypto markets. However, investors should remain agile and informed. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on upcoming economic data releases and Fed speeches. Diversify: While crypto can benefit from stable rates, diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investment strategy. Understand the Macro Landscape: Recognize that global events and broader economic trends continue to shape market sentiment. In conclusion, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s cautious approach to Fed interest rates is a significant development for anyone navigating today’s financial markets. His emphasis on patience and data dependency provides a framework for understanding future economic shifts. For the crypto community, this measured stance could translate into a more stable, albeit still dynamic, environment. While no guarantees exist, a predictable monetary policy often allows for more informed decision-making across all asset classes, from traditional stocks to innovative digital currencies. Frequently Asked Questions About Fed Interest Rates and Crypto Q1: What does it mean when the Fed says “no need to rush” on interest rates? A1: It signifies that the Federal Reserve will maintain a patient, data-dependent approach to monetary policy. They intend to observe economic indicators like inflation and employment before making further adjustments to Fed interest rates , avoiding hasty decisions. Q2: How do stable Fed interest rates generally impact the cryptocurrency market? A2: Stable or lower Fed interest rates often make traditional, safer investments less appealing. This can encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to increased demand and price stability or growth in the crypto market. Q3: Is a cautious Fed stance always good for crypto? A3: While a cautious Fed can often be seen as favorable for risk assets like crypto due to increased liquidity and risk appetite, the overall impact depends on various other factors, including global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and market sentiment. It’s not a guaranteed positive. Q4: What economic data does the Fed watch closely before adjusting Fed interest rates? A4: The Federal Reserve closely monitors a range of economic data, including inflation reports (like the Consumer Price Index – CPI), employment figures (such as non-farm payrolls and unemployment rates), GDP growth, and consumer spending, to guide its decisions on Fed interest rates . Understanding the Federal Reserve’s approach to Fed interest rates is key to navigating both traditional and digital financial landscapes.

For many retail investors, hitting that milestone represents validation after years of turbulence. Yet analysts looking at the broader market are turning their attention elsewhere. While XRP’s ambitions are noteworthy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging in presale as the new crypto coin analysts believe is capable of delivering far greater upside—up to 500% growth heading into the next market cycle. XRP’s $5 Ambition and Its Limits There is no denying XRP has built one of the most loyal followings in the crypto market. Its mission of facilitating faster and cheaper cross-border payments made it a favorite long before the rise of decentralized finance. Traders pushing for $5 show how strong its retail base still is. But that milestone is as much psychological as it is practical. Legacy altcoins like XRP face structural hurdles that slow their growth compared to newer projects. Heavy token supply weighs on upward price momentum. Ongoing regulatory battles, especially high-profile lawsuits, create lingering uncertainty for institutional adoption. And while the network’s payments focus remains relevant, innovation within the XRP ecosystem has been slower compared to projects leading in decentralized finance or tokenized assets. This means growth is respectable but limited, making XRP more of a conservative play than a life-changing investment. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stands Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stepping into that gap as a project designed with institution-ready mechanics and forward-looking adoption models. At its foundation, it is a decentralized platform that will allow users to lend, borrow, and stake across both major crypto coins and niche assets. What sets it apart is its architecture: deposit and borrow caps combined with restricted collateral access create a system that avoids runaway risk while staying attractive to institutional players. The presale is gaining attention for that reason. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6 at $0.035, with $15.90 million raised, 42% of tokens already sold, and more than 16,400 holders participating. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.040, a guaranteed 15% rise that underscores the urgency to secure entry while discounts remain. Features Fueling Demand Several core features are expected to drive continuous demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Its stablecoin, pegged at $1, will be minted only against overcollateralized assets and burned once loans are repaid, ensuring long-term usability without risking devaluation. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency will allow users to borrow more against safe assets like ETH or BTC, which is designed to increase platform activity and lending volume. On top of that, a utilization-based interest model dynamically adjusts borrowing costs and rewards to balance liquidity supply and demand. This not only makes lending markets more efficient but also increases participation from both sides of the ecosystem. For investors, these mechanics mean MUTM tokens will play a central role, driving demand from borrowers, lenders, and stakers alike. Early presale participants who entered at $0.020 are already enjoying a 75% paper profit, with no signs of momentum slowing. New buyers entering at $0.035 are aligning with analysts who project a 500% gain by the 2026 bull run, drawing comparisons to Solana’s explosive trajectory in 2021. Unlike speculative meme tokens, this growth story is backed by core utility, structured demand, and revenue recirculation through MUTM buybacks. This makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) not just another project in the long list of crypto coins but one positioned for outsized ROI as its roadmap milestones come to life. For investors serious about investing in crypto, it represents a stronger play than chasing psychological price levels. Security, Incentives, and Trust Investor confidence is further reinforced by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s security-first approach. The project has passed a CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, ensuring its smart contracts are built on solid foundations. To continuously improve defenses, the team has established a $50,000 bug bounty program, with structured rewards ranging from $200 for low-severity issues up to $2,000 for critical vulnerabilities. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway campaign adds another layer of community engagement and reward, ensuring long-term users feel valued while adoption grows. These measures stand in sharp contrast to meme-driven speculation, aligning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with the expectations of institutional investors who are already comfortable with products such as a crypto ETF. Conclusion XRP’s $5 target may capture retail imagination, but its growth ceiling remains defined by legacy constraints. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), in contrast, offers institutional-grade design, dynamic token demand mechanics, and a presale that is already demonstrating traction. With Phase 6 42% sold and the price set to rise to $0.040 in Phase 7, the entry window at current levels is closing quickly. For those evaluating where to allocate capital, analysts are clear: XRP’s growth is steady, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the crypto coin designed for breakout performance, with 500% upside projected for the coming cycle.

Ethereum Ready To Smash All-Time Highs In a video published today, the analyst argues that ETH has cleared a cluster of late-cycle resistances and is now exhibiting a confluence of technical signals—on monthly, weekly, daily, and intraday charts—that “favor some of the higher targets to be met, maybe 1.272, 1.414, 1.618, anywhere around potentially five figures.” These Fib levels would put ETH at $7,752, $9,883 and $14,011 respectively. On the monthly chart, the analyst centers his case on the log-scale Fibonacci structure and volatility regime. ETH, he says, spent months stalling around the 0.886 retracement near $4,000—the same zone that repeatedly repelled the market in prior attempts—but “last month, we had the break through that here, convincingly.” Related Reading: Ethereum Rally Stalls As Spot And Perpetual Volumes Flatten On Binance He notes that the wick of the latest push already poked above the wick from the November 2021 peak, reinforcing the idea that supply at the former top is thinning. Simultaneously, the monthly Bollinger Bands are expanding while price “is impulsively going to the upside here along with the upper Bollinger Band,” a backdrop he describes as consistent with trend acceleration rather than mean reversion. “It does favor some of the higher targets to be met,” he said, while stressing sequencing: “We need to kind of break above the previous all-time high here first before we can actually talk about moving further up.” A second pillar of the bullish thesis is the Ichimoku profile across cycles—specifically the fusion of Tenkan-sen (conversion line) and Kijun-sen (base line). “When you have the Tenkan and Kijin fused together and price is riding up along with it, this fusion over here is called Katana,” he explained. Historically, he said, this “precipitates a big move,” and with price now above the Katana, “the Katana is shooting the price up.” On the current structure: “We got a Katana here being built up and price is currently impulsively going to the upside, so that is also favorable for Ethereum.” On the weekly timeframe, Cantonese Cat frames ETH’s advance through a three-cycle template defined by a “cycle liquidity zone” acting as a pivot. Each prior cycle saw deviations above and below a governing trend line before a sustained move once the zone was recaptured. He places the present consolidation directly on that blueprint: after breaking the “$4,000 liquidity level,” ETH is “consoling sideways… trying to find some energy before breaking up higher.” A back-test is possible but not required, he said; the “primary case” remains continuation unless the chart invalidates. Lower Timeframe Signals The lower timeframes, in his view, are already aligning with that outcome. On the daily chart, he highlights a developing “Adam and Eve continuation pattern” nested within a classic cup-and-handle, where “the handle… volume is not that great,” which he views as textbook, followed by “a pretty decent volume bullish engulfing candle.” Measured against log-scale retracements, price was rejected at 0.786, found support at 0.5, and is now “trying to break through 0.6… work our way back… to 0.786,” a rhythm he says “is being respected pretty decently.” He also points to a short-term bottoming sequence—“you can see something called a tweezer bottom… if you have anywhere around two or three of these kind of wick sticking down like that, that’s usually a pretty decent bottom”—and a three-candle “morning star” reversal: “It’s a reversal pattern and it could end up leading to a reversal here… seems to be working out pretty well.” Related Reading: Citi’s Ethereum Forecast: No New All-Time High Expected, Year-End Target At $4,300 On the 12-hour chart, he reads the structure as reaccumulation in a Wyckoff sense, referencing the “rounded bottom,” a strengthening secondary test—“the ST is higher than the VCLX”—and the emergence of a “creek” overhead that price appears ready to vault. “It does look like a reaccumulation type pattern… showing some strength… consolidating sideways… to reaccumulate before [a] bullish continuation,” he said, adding that after the prior vertical leg, digestion at elevated levels is constructive. Relative-strength diagnostics, he argues, reinforce the ETH-led narrative. Ethereum’s market-share gauge (ETH.D) “has broken above the Ichimoku cloud… with strength,” then “back-tested the cloud for about four weeks,” and may be waiting for the Tenkan to “rise… as support” before the next leg. On a monthly volatility basis, he adds, “the 20-month moving average was reclaimed… and we simply spent a month here back-testing” it—evidence that dominance could trend higher if the back-test holds. “That’s basically meaning that Ethereum wants to continue to outperform the rest of the cryptocurrency market here for [the] foreseeable future,” he said. Breadth indicators outside of ETH also tilt risk-on in his framework. The Total3 index (total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) is “trying to break above and form an all-time high” on a monthly “cup and handle” structure, while the “Others” index (market cap excluding the top 10 coins) has punched through the 0.786 level on the weekly and is “gravitat[ing]… to the next level, the 0.886.” He emphasizes the distinction between log and linear retracements, noting a failed linear 0.886 breakout in a prior attempt: “If we were to break above the linear, as well as the log 0.886 here with style, then I think Others would end up performing extremely well and would end up following the footsteps of Ethereum.” His conclusion is unambiguous: “I am bullish on Ethereum. I’m bullish on altcoin. I’m bullish on the cryptocurrency market space in general.” At press time, ETH traded at $4,565.

EIGEN rallied by 33% for the past day, logging 67% gains for the past 90 days. Eigen Cloud (EIGEN) was the latest breakout token during the current altcoin season. It gained 33.8% in the past day, to trade at a three-month peak of $2.03. The token attempted a recovery after its rebranding in June. EIGEN broke out to a three-month peak, following its addition to Google’s AI agent payment framework. | Source: CoinGecko . EIGEN open interest also jumped to over $130M , the highest level in the past six months. The token still has limited positions on Hyperliquid, with just nine whales betting on its direction. Five of those positions are shorting EIGEN, and are carrying unrealized losses after the recent breakout. Eigen Cloud rallied after becoming part of Google’s AI agent payment initiative. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , Google opened a toolset for safe, verifiable payments coming directly from AI agents. Google’s AP2 protocol included Eigen as a platform for safe, verified transactions originating with AI agents. We’re excited to be a launch partner for @GoogleCloud ‘s new Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), a standard that gives AI agents the ability to transact with trust and accountability. At EigenCloud, our focus is on verifiability. As our founder @sreeramkannan said: AP2 helps create… https://t.co/Fx90rTJuhm pic.twitter.com/0Vil6yLdkf — EigenCloud (@eigenlayer) September 16, 2025 The new use case for Eigen arrives as older Web3 and DeFi projects seek to pivot to new use cases. Other AP2 partners from the crypto space include Coinbase and the Ethereum Foundation. Most of the payment and e-commerce platforms offer fiat handling, while Eigen’s verifiable transaction data target crypto payments and transfers. The market for AI agent transactions is estimated at over $27B, based on e-commerce transfers. The AI agent market outside crypto expects to be valued at $7.84B, with over 46% in annual growth, with demand for intricate multi-step tasks. The inclusion of payments and e-commerce interactions are part of the projected growth. Is the EIGEN rally sustainable? EIGEN has been expecting a breakout, based on the overall inflows into altcoins. The project got a boost from the A16Z fund, injecting another $70M during the rebranding to Eigen Cloud. The token also has relatively small linear unlocks until 2027, calming the fears of ongoing dilution. Fundamental factors may also boost the project with real activity growth. EIGEN also benefits from the positive performance of ETH, holding above the $4,500 range. The project still holds over $19B in liquid staking, remaining a key part of the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Are AI agents making a comeback? The AI agent narrative slowed down in 2025, with most agentic tokens crashing. However, Virtuals Protocol remains one of the robust ecosystems. Based on recent Messari data, Virtuals Protocol still carries $500M in AI token value. The agentic economy also crosses over into DeFi, experimenting with agent-to-agent transactions. Until recently, agentic actions were facilitated by humans, but demand for direct on-chain activity may boost the usage of data layer protocols and other verification tools.

Amid these moves, XYZVerse brings features that set it apart. Some investors are focused on big names like ADA and HBAR, but there could be details going unnoticed. The following look reveals what sets XYZVerse apart and what could matter most now. Cardano's Green Speed: Is ADA the Next Big Crypto Wave? Cardano is a fresh take on blockchain. It uses clever proof-of-stake math, not power-hungry mining. This saves energy and cuts costs. Two separate layers keep the network tidy—one moves coins, the other runs smart deals. That split lets Cardano aim for lightning speed, maybe a million moves each second. Its coin, ADA, helps people pay, save, and earn extra by staking. Since 2021, anyone can launch tokens on Cardano with tiny fees, which opens doors for games, loans, and more. The market now hunts for low-fee, green coins. Bitcoin feels slow and pricey. Ethereum fights high gas costs. ADA avoids both pains. Big funds also like its academic roots and clear road map. Prices still swing with the wider crypto tide, yet ADA sits far below its old peak. If the next bull run rewards useful tech, this coin could shine. Still, rivals like Solana push hard on speed, and newer chains pop up daily. For investors who want eco care, decent staking, and a shot at growth, ADA looks worth a closer look in this cycle. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges HBAR: Fast Green Coin Racing Past the Blockchain Crowd Hedera Hashgraph offers a fresh road for digital money. Instead of adding blocks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, it weaves data into a quick graph. This design needs no power-hungry mining, so it is kinder to the planet and lighter on the wallet. Fees stay tiny, and the network can handle many moves at once. HBAR is the fuel. People pay it to send value, run apps, and help guard the system through a simple Proof of Stake process. Prices of many coins have jumped this year, yet fees on big chains still bite. Traders hunt for speed and low cost, and HBAR ticks both boxes. Its code is owned, which can slow hobby builders, but major firms like Google, IBM, and Boeing sit on its council and test real use cases. If the next market leg favors clear utility over hype, HBAR could shine. Still, volume is thin compared with Solana or Polygon, so sharp swings are likely. For bold buyers, that mix of risk and promise looks tempting. Conclusion ADA and HBAR remain sound, but XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, blends fan culture, community control, and GameFi plans for outsized gains in the accelerating 2025 rally.

Specifically, Nasdaq intraday trading has seen a surprising 1% fall, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. This immediate shift on a major index like the Nasdaq often prompts questions about market stability and future trends. What exactly does a 1% drop in Nasdaq intraday trading signify for the broader economic landscape and your portfolio? What Does a 1% Drop in Nasdaq Intraday Trading Truly Imply? When we talk about Nasdaq intraday trading , we’re referring to the movements of the index within a single trading day. A 1% drop might seem minor on the surface, but for a technology-heavy index like the Nasdaq Composite, it can represent billions of dollars in market value. This kind of movement often reflects immediate market reactions to breaking news, economic data, or shifts in investor sentiment. Such a dip highlights the inherent volatility of the stock market. While not uncommon, it serves as a crucial indicator for traders and long-term investors. It signals a period where selling pressure has momentarily outweighed buying interest, leading to a noticeable decline in stock prices across many of the Nasdaq’s constituent companies. Why Did Nasdaq Intraday Trading See This Sudden Shift? Understanding the catalysts behind such a move is essential. Several factors can influence Nasdaq intraday trading performance. These often include: Economic Data Releases: Inflation reports, unemployment figures, or GDP growth numbers can directly impact market sentiment. A negative surprise can trigger immediate selling. Corporate Earnings: Disappointing results from major tech companies listed on the Nasdaq can drag the entire index down. Conversely, strong earnings can provide a boost. Interest Rate Expectations: Changes in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, especially regarding interest rate hikes, significantly affect growth stocks prominent on the Nasdaq. Geopolitical Events: International conflicts or political instability can create uncertainty, leading investors to pull back from riskier assets like tech stocks. Technical Trading Factors: Algorithmic trading and reaching key support or resistance levels can also contribute to rapid intraday movements. Today’s specific reasons could be a combination of these, or perhaps a single, powerful piece of news that spurred a wave of selling during active Nasdaq intraday trading hours. Navigating the Challenges of Volatile Nasdaq Intraday Trading For investors, periods of market volatility, especially during active Nasdaq intraday trading , present both challenges and potential opportunities. The immediate challenge is often emotional – resisting the urge to panic sell. However, these periods can also offer chances for strategic adjustments. Key considerations during a dip: Don’t Panic: Short-term market fluctuations are a normal part of investing. Long-term strategies often ride out these dips. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Use this as an opportunity to review your holdings. Are your investments still aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals? Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: If you believe in the long-term prospects of your investments, a dip can be a chance to buy more shares at a lower average price. It’s crucial to distinguish between a temporary pullback and a fundamental shift in market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights during such times. Actionable Insights for Today’s Nasdaq Intraday Trading Environment What can you do when the market, particularly the Nasdaq, shows signs of weakness during active trading? Here are some actionable steps: Firstly, stay informed. Keep an eye on reliable financial news sources to understand the underlying reasons for the market movement. Secondly, avoid making impulsive decisions based on intraday swings. Focus on your long-term investment strategy rather than reacting to every fluctuation. For those engaged in more active trading, setting clear stop-loss orders can help manage risk. Always remember that diversification across different asset classes and sectors can cushion the impact of a downturn in any single index or sector. While Nasdaq intraday trading can be exciting, it also demands discipline and a well-thought-out plan. In conclusion, while a 1% fall in Nasdaq intraday trading might seem alarming, it’s a reminder of the dynamic nature of financial markets. Such movements are part of the investment journey, driven by a myriad of factors from economic reports to investor sentiment. The key is to approach these events with a clear head, a well-defined strategy, and a focus on long-term objectives. Market dips, though uncomfortable, often pave the way for future growth, rewarding those who remain patient and strategically sound.

Key Takeaways: The SEC has approved Grayscale’s GDLC, the first multi-crypto ETP in the US. GDLC provides exposure to Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Analysts expect the approval to trigger a surge in new crypto ETF launches. The move comes as the agency accelerates its stance on crypto ETFs, signaling a broader shift in regulatory momentum. Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg confirmed the approval on Wednesday via X (formerly Twitter), thanking the SEC’s Crypto Task Force for helping bring long-awaited clarity to the space. Grayscale’s GDLC Fund Offers Exposure to Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana GDLC offers investors diversified exposure to five major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The approval comes just months after the SEC delayed Grayscale’s bid to convert GDLC from an over-the-counter fund to an ETP listed on NYSE Arca. With the green light now granted, the fund is poised to trade on a major US exchange, providing broader access to digital assets through traditional investment platforms. According to Grayscale, GDLC currently holds over $915 million in assets under management, with a net asset value of $57.70 per share. Its transition to a publicly traded ETP gives retail and institutional investors alike a regulated path to diversified crypto exposure. Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund $GDLC was just approved for trading along with the Generic Listing Standards.

Industry analysts expect a wave of new crypto ETF launches to follow. “The last time this type of approval happened, ETF launches tripled,” noted Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. “We could see more than 100 new crypto ETFs within a year.” The approval of GDLC may mark a turning point in how multi-asset crypto products are treated under U.S. securities law, opening the door for broader participation in the digital asset market. Crypto ETF Flood Hits SEC as Issuers Bet on Avalanche, Bonk, and Beyond A new wave of crypto ETF filings landed at the SEC on Tuesday, showcasing issuers’ growing appetite for exotic and niche digital assets. The latest batch includes products tied to Avalanche infrastructure, meme coin Bonk, and basis trade strategies involving Bitcoin and Ethereum. Leveraged and income-focused ETFs tied to Orbs, Litecoin, and Sui were also submitted. Nate Geraci of the ETF Institute warned that the filings represent just the beginning of a flood of novel crypto products, with over 92 ETF applications now pending and key deadlines looming in October and November. The surge follows regulatory momentum and alternative structures like the 40 Act, which will bring XRP and Dogecoin ETFs to market this week. Analysts say Avalanche-based products may stand the best shot at approval, while memecoin and basis trade ETFs could face pushback over concerns about volatility and liquidity. Meanwhile, market flows show Bitcoin ETFs attracting $292 million in net inflows, even as Ethereum products saw $61.7 million in outflows on the same day.

The framework builds on Vitalik Buterin’s 2024 vision for seamless cross-chain interoperability through Ethereum Improvement Proposals, including EIP-3370 for address standards, EIP-7683 for communication protocols, and EIP-3668 for off-chain data access. Ethereum Foundation researchers identified interoperability as the top near-term priority for development in the next six to twelve months. The ongoing initiative launches with production-ready ERC-7683 implementation, an open-source TypeScript solver application, composable smart contracts, and customizable UI templates. Source: Open Intents Audits were expected to be completed during Q1 2025, with cross-chain validation anticipated in Q4. Understanding the Open Intents Framework Mechanics The Open Intents Framework simplifies cross-chain transactions by allowing users to state what they want rather than how to achieve it. According to the documentation , instead of manually moving tokens between different blockchain networks, users submit their desired outcome (such as swapping 100 USDC on Base for 100 USDT on Arbitrum), and the system handles the complex execution. Specialized services called solvers compete to fulfill these user requests by finding the most efficient routes across blockchain networks. These solvers automatically handle the technical challenges, including transaction settlements, risk management, and coordinating asset movements between different chains while users wait for their desired result. The framework uses standardized smart contracts based on ERC-7683 protocols to ensure consistent operation across different blockchain networks. Multiple verification methods, including Hyperlane’s security modules and storage proof systems, maintain transaction security without creating single points of failure. New standards enable seamless user experiences, including unified addresses across chains. These consolidated token balances treat the same asset on different networks as one balance, and neutral messaging systems that work with any bridge or verification system. The framework operates through three development phases focusing on setup , speed optimization , and final improvements . Major ecosystem partners, like Arbitrum, Uniswap, and Superbridge, are integrating the framework into their existing services. Ethereum’s Evolution Toward Cross-Chain Interoperability Ethereum’s transition to a multichain ecosystem began with layer-2 scaling solutions addressing network congestion and high transaction costs. Users now access blue-chip DeFi protocols on Arbitrum, experiment with decentralized social networks on Base, and test AI agents on Mode, while tech giants like Sony build L2s on the OP Stack. Vitalik Buterin outlined his vision for seamless cross-chain interoperability in August 2024, emphasizing community collaboration to resolve cross-L2 compatibility challenges. His roadmap introduced key Ethereum Improvement Proposals, including EIP-3370 for chain-specific address standards with human-readable prefixes and EIP-3668 for standardized off-chain data access. Cross-L2 roadmap in one tweet: * 3770 (cross-L2 addrs) * 7683 (cross-L2 sends via liquidity providers) * 3668 (L2 light clients) * Cross-L2-replayable account state updates The above is enough already. Later, phase 2: * L1sload/staticcall * Keystore rollups * Proof aggregation — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) August 5, 2024 Buterin has already been discussing “cross-L2-replayable account state updates” from his 2023 blog post, allowing L2 networks to receive recent layer-1 state updates while maintaining security and low latency. He anticipated that all rollups would eventually adopt zero-knowledge technology for transaction finalization, though the transition would require more than five years. Ethereum Foundation researchers elevated interoperability as the top near-term priority in August, identifying it as “ the highest leverage opportunity ” within user experience development for the next six to twelve months. The strategy focuses on intent-based architecture and general message-passing to allow users to express outcomes while networks handle low-level transactions. Current message-passing remains bottlenecked by slow settlement times, creating fragmentation pressures across the ecosystem.

Names like XRP, Avalanche, Dogecoin, and XYZVerse catch attention for what they can actually do. Each brings something useful to the table. This article looks closer at what sets them apart and why they may be strong choices for anyone watching the market. Ripple (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP trades between 2.87 and 3.19 after a mixed stretch. The coin gained 2.74% this week, trimming a 2.02% drop over the past month. Despite the short-term pullback, price is still 24.40% higher than six months ago, keeping the broader trend tilted up. The 10-day average at 3.03 almost matches the 100-day line at 3.05, showing a standoff. RSI at 49.45 and Stochastic at 43.12 sit near neutral ground, while a small positive MACD hints that bulls could seize the edge if buying picks up. A clean move above 3.19 opens the path to the 3.35 barrier; clearing that could propel XRP to 3.67, a rise of about 16% from today’s midpoint. If momentum fades, support rests at 2.71, with 2.38 as the deeper safety net, about 20% below current levels. Near-term signals are flat, but the strong six-month gain suggests that any dip may still attract buyers looking for the next leg higher. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Avalanche (AVAX) Source: TradingView AVAX jumped about 16% this week and 20% over the past month. Six-month gain sits near 61%, putting the coin back on trader radars. It now moves between $25.60 and $32.28, almost in line with its 10-day and 100-day averages around $30. Momentum stays positive. The RSI reads 54.6, showing neither hot nor cold pressure. The stochastic at 73 hints at buyers still active. The MACD hovers a touch above zero, adding to the mild upward bias. These signals keep the path toward resistance at $35 in sight. Breaking $35 could unlock the next barrier at $42, roughly 30% above the top of the current band. A close past that mark would set the stage for fresh highs later this year. If bulls tire, the nearest floor sits at $21.73, about 25% beneath today’s action. That deeper base lines up with longer support near $15, so odds favor traders defending the upper 20s. With steady gains and tight moving averages, the market leans to a slow climb rather than a sharp drop. Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin sits between 0.23 and 0.31, basically parked near 0.27. The meme coin just rallied 11.45% in 7 days and 14.84% in 30 days. Stretch the view to 6 months and the gain lands at 58.59%. Buyers clearly hold the upper hand, but recent candles show hesitation inside this narrow band. Short-term momentum is flat, with the price glued to the 10-day average at 0.26 and the 100-day mark at 0.27. A midline momentum reading near 52 signals neither overheating nor exhaustion. Volume has cooled since last week’s burst, suggesting traders now wait for a clear break. A push above 0.35 would free DOGE toward the second ceiling at 0.43, a jump of about 45% from today’s mid-range. Failure to clear 0.35 risks a slide to 0.18, roughly −33%, with deeper support at 0.10, or −60%. The odds tilt slightly upward while the coin stays above 0.26, yet a decisive move is overdue. Conclusion XRP, AVAX, and DOGE hold solid upside, yet XYZVerse’s presale, sports-driven meme appeal, community rewards, and GameFi roadmap position $XYZ to chase PEPE-scale gains during the 2025 bull run.

Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, has just announced a pivotal development that could reshape how many investors access the crypto market. The company’s application for a GDLC ETF conversion , turning its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into an Exchange Traded Fund, has received approval for trading under standard listing criteria. This landmark decision, shared by Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg on X, marks a significant step forward for institutional adoption and accessibility in the digital asset space. It builds on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) prior approval of new listing standards for various cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds, setting the stage for this latest breakthrough. What Does This GDLC ETF Conversion Mean for Investors? The approval for the GDLC ETF conversion is a game-changer for several reasons. Firstly, it offers investors a new, regulated pathway to gain exposure to a diversified basket of large-cap digital assets without directly holding the cryptocurrencies themselves. This can simplify the investment process and reduce some of the complexities associated with direct crypto ownership, such as secure storage and private key management. For many, an ETF structure is more familiar and accessible than a traditional trust. It allows for trading on conventional stock exchanges, often with greater liquidity and tighter spreads. This move is expected to attract a broader range of investors, including those from traditional finance who have been hesitant to venture into the crypto market due to regulatory uncertainties or operational hurdles. Enhanced Accessibility: Easier for traditional investors to participate. Diversified Exposure: Invest in multiple large-cap digital assets through a single product. Regulatory Clarity: Operates under established financial regulations. Increased Liquidity: Traded on major exchanges, potentially offering better buy/sell opportunities. The Journey to GDLC ETF Conversion: A Regulatory Milestone Grayscale has been at the forefront of pushing for crypto product conversions, famously succeeding with its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) earlier this year. The GDLC ETF conversion represents another victory in the firm’s ongoing efforts to bring digital assets into the mainstream financial system. The SEC’s decision reflects an evolving regulatory landscape. After years of cautious approaches, the commission has gradually shown a greater willingness to approve crypto-related financial products, especially those that meet stringent listing and investor protection standards. This progressive stance is crucial for the industry’s maturation and widespread acceptance. The approval process involves rigorous examination of various factors, including market surveillance, investor protection mechanisms, and the underlying liquidity of the assets. Grayscale’s ability to meet these requirements for its Digital Large Cap Fund underscores the growing sophistication and compliance efforts within the digital asset sector. Impact on the Broader Digital Asset Market This development is not just about Grayscale or GDLC; it sends a powerful signal to the entire digital asset market. It suggests a continued trend towards the financialization of cryptocurrencies, where more regulated investment vehicles become available. This could lead to increased institutional capital flowing into the crypto space, potentially boosting market stability and growth. Moreover, the success of the GDLC ETF conversion could pave the way for other similar conversions or new ETF applications for various digital assets. As more diversified and single-asset crypto ETFs emerge, investors will have even more choices to tailor their exposure to this dynamic asset class. This competition could also lead to more innovative product offerings and lower fees for investors. The move also validates the long-term vision of many crypto enthusiasts who believe that digital assets will eventually integrate seamlessly with traditional finance. It’s a testament to the persistent efforts of firms like Grayscale and the increasing recognition of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and significant asset class. What’s Next for Grayscale and Crypto ETFs? With the GDLC ETF conversion now approved, the focus will shift to its launch and performance in the market. Investors will be keen to observe how the new ETF trades and whether it attracts the anticipated institutional and retail interest. Its success could accelerate further innovations and regulatory approvals in the crypto ETF landscape. This moment truly marks a new chapter for Grayscale and the wider digital asset investment community. It reinforces the idea that well-structured, compliant products are the key to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. As the market continues to mature, we can expect to see more such integrations, offering investors unprecedented access and opportunities. The journey has been long, but the destination—a more accessible and regulated crypto investment environment—is clearly in sight. This approval is a clear indicator that the future of finance is increasingly intertwined with digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a GDLC ETF conversion? A GDLC ETF conversion refers to the process of transforming Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), which was previously structured as a trust, into an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). This allows it to trade on traditional stock exchanges under standard listing criteria, offering greater accessibility and liquidity to investors. Why is this GDLC ETF conversion significant? This conversion is significant because it provides a regulated and familiar investment vehicle for gaining exposure to a diversified portfolio of large-cap digital assets. It lowers barriers for traditional investors, increases market accessibility, and signifies growing regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency-related financial products. Who approved the GDLC ETF conversion? The application for the GDLC ETF conversion was approved for trading under standard listing criteria, following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) prior approval of new listing standards for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. What are the benefits of investing in a crypto ETF like GDLC? Benefits include enhanced accessibility for traditional investors, diversified exposure to multiple large-cap digital assets through a single product, operation under established financial regulations, and potentially increased liquidity compared to direct crypto holdings or trust structures. How does this impact the broader crypto market? The approval of the GDLC ETF conversion sends a positive signal to the entire digital asset market, indicating a trend towards increased financialization and institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. It could attract more capital, lead to market stability, and pave the way for more crypto ETF products in the future. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that approval of an XRP spot ETF is inevitable and that XRP could soon be included in the US government's digital asset stockpile. “XRP will be part of a cryptocurrency stockpile along with other major cryptocurrencies. With these, XRP will no longer be seen as just a trading asset, but as a trusted cryptocurrency for institutional use.” Garlinghouse emphasized that the addition of XRP to the US digital stock reflects increased confidence in XRP’s stability and its growing role in global financial systems. Garlinghouse stated that he expects an XRP spot ETF to launch by the end of the year, noting that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing applications from major asset managers such as Franklin Templeton and Bitwise. “Approval of the XRP ETF is inevitable. This ETF will allow large investors to safely enter the XRP market. It will provide investors with a safer and more regulated way to invest in XRP.” The government's inclusion of XRP and the growing discussions about an upcoming ETF are seen as a sign that digital assets are becoming increasingly accepted in the mainstream financial system. *This is not investment advice.

The news comes almost a full year in advance of the planned launch of Russia’s coin for public use, which will be carried out in stages, beginning next fall. Russia starts paying digital ruble salaries on request Russia has for the first time employed its central bank digital currency (CBDC) to pay a salary, the Ministry of Finance (Minfin) announced. “The first budget payment in digital rubles has been successfully completed,” the department stated in a press release published on its website on Wednesday. It further detailed: “The Russian Treasury has made the first salary payment in digital rubles to an individual holding a government position in the Russian Federation.” The department added that the experiment to introduce the sovereign coin into the budgetary process is being carried out jointly with the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), its issuer. Starting from January 1, 2026, the Minfin and the CBR will enable transactions between digital ruble accounts, the ministry also unveiled. The digital variant of the national fiat will be used for intra-budgetary transfers and to make various payments from the federal budget as well, explains the announcement . The ministry noted that payments in digital rubles will be made only at a recipient’s request. It did not reveal, however, who was the first to ask to have their wages credited in CBDC. Financial committee chair shares more Russian media found out that the first digital ruble salary was paid to Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the Committee on Financial Markets at the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament. Aksakov has been closely involved in legislative efforts to regulate digital financial assets in Russia and create the legal basis for the country’s own digital currency. The lawmaker received the money in his wallet on the CBR’s dedicated platform and then joined the testing of the digital Russian ruble by making some payments, his press service told RBC. The deputy transferred funds to the Life Line foundation for children with illnesses and to the SOS Children’s Villages charity for orphans. He also used the coins to place an order at a Teremok restaurant, a fast food chain that offers traditional Russian dishes on its menu. In July, Aksakov unveiled that he had asked relevant agencies to make him “the first person to start receiving a salary in digital rubles,” the business news outlet recalled. Digital ruble to be launched in 2026 The Bank of Russia began developing its CBDC in 2021. Two years later, the Russian parliament adopted the necessary legislation for its introduction. The CBR started trials later that same year, inviting a limited number of participants, including commercial banks, companies and private individuals. The coin’s launch was initially planned for 2025, but the monetary authority postponed it for next year. Following a call from President Vladimir Putin for its wide adoption this summer, the regulator scheduled it for September 1, 2026. The state-issued digital currency will be introduced in several stages. The dates were also approved by Russian lawmakers with a special law, which Putin signed in July. In June, the Moscow Metro, the subway system of the Russian capital, announced it had made its first digital ruble payment. In August, Russia registered the first real estate deal sealed using the government cryptocurrency, as reported by Cryptopolitan. And in September, St. Petersburg’s Pulkovo Airport, Russia’s second busiest, accepted digital rubles from a visitor who paid for parking, using his smartphone to scan a QR code. The air transit hub plans to introduce the CBDC payment option for other services in the future. Get seen where it counts.

Trong khi đó, các “cá voi” – nhà đầu tư lớn – đang tích cực tìm kiếm những cơ hội mới để đa dạng hóa danh mục. Phân tích xu hướng giá Dogecoin Từng được xem chỉ là một dự án giải trí, Dogecoin nay đã trở thành đồng meme coin đứng thứ 7 về vốn hóa thị trường. Gần đây, DOGE đã chạm mốc cao nhất trong 3 năm ở 0,43 USD, nhưng sau đó điều chỉnh nhẹ. Hiện DOGE đang giao dịch quanh mức 0,3832 USD, giảm 2% trong 24 giờ và 5% trong tuần, sau một đợt tăng mạnh trước đó. Điều này khiến các nhà đầu tư lớn bắt đầu tìm kiếm cơ hội ở các dự án mới nổi. Cá voi tập trung vào dự án mới nổi Toàn bộ thị trường meme coin đang trong giai đoạn điều chỉnh, với nhiều token giảm giá, kể cả Floki (FLOKI). Trong bối cảnh này, một dự án gây nhiều chú ý là Crypto All-Stars (STARS) – nền tảng phát triển MemeVault, giao thức staking tổng hợp đầu tiên dành cho meme coin. Chỉ trong 3 tháng ICO, STARS đã huy động hơn 18 triệu USD, với tốc độ dòng vốn khoảng 200.000 USD/ngày. Cơ hội mua presale kéo dài đến ngày 20/12, với mức giá hiện tại chỉ 0,0016782 USD. Theo dự báo, sau khi niêm yết, STARS có thể tăng 11 lần trong ngắn hạn, và thậm chí đạt tới 93 lần vào tháng 1/2025. Điểm nhấn: Nền tảng staking độc đáo Crypto All-Stars thu hút sự chú ý nhờ vào MemeVault – nền tảng staking tổng hợp đầu tiên cho phép nhà đầu tư stake nhiều meme coin cùng lúc để nhận thưởng. Hiện chương trình staking gốc của STARS đang mang lại lợi nhuận APY 376%, một con số cực kỳ hấp dẫn với cộng đồng. Khai thác và xu hướng thị trường Trong khi đó, Dogecoin hưởng lợi từ việc đào hợp nhất với Litecoin, giúp cải thiện lợi nhuận khai thác nhưng đồng thời cũng tạo ra áp lực bán lớn từ thợ mỏ.Cùng lúc, Bitcoin đang tiến gần ngưỡng lịch sử 100.000 USD, vượt trội so với altcoin , khiến các nhà đầu tư thêm phần thận trọng khi đánh giá tiềm năng tăng trưởng của DOGE trong ngắn hạn. Vì sao Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) có thể là lựa chọn tiếp theo của bạn Trong khi Dogecoin, Stellar và Maxi Doge vẫn giữ được sức hút riêng, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) đang chứng minh rằng nó có thể trở thành cái tên thống trị trong làn sóng BitcoinFi sắp tới. Khác với những meme coin chỉ dựa vào cộng đồng, HYPER mang đến một hệ sinh thái thực tiễn, kết hợp AI, DeFi và staking để tạo ra giá trị bền vững. Với mức giá presale chỉ 0,0002 USD, HYPER mang lại cơ hội hiếm có cho những ai tham gia sớm, trước khi token này niêm yết trên các sàn giao dịch lớn. Ngoài ra, cộng đồng Hyper Army ngày càng phát triển mạnh, tổ chức các sự kiện, giveaway và chương trình thưởng staking, khiến HYPER không chỉ là một token, mà còn là một phong trào toàn cầu. Nếu bạn đang tìm kiếm một dự án có tiềm năng tăng trưởng khổng lồ trong bull run 2025, thì Bitcoin Hyper chính là cơ hội không nên bỏ lỡ.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|BTC|ALTCOIN|FLOKI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 11:37:36

Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, a a company dedicated to accumulating digital assets, has made a significant move by listing on the U.S. OTCQX Best Market under the ticker BTCFF. This isn’t just another listing; it signals a growing trend of institutional confidence in digital assets and their long-term potential. What Does This Strategic OTCQX Listing Mean for Bitcoin Treasury Corporation? For those unfamiliar, the OTCQX Best Market is the highest tier of the three marketplaces for the over-the-counter (OTC) trading of stocks. It’s designed for established, investor-focused U.S. and international companies. Being listed here offers several distinct advantages for a company like Bitcoin Treasury Corporation. Enhanced Visibility: The listing provides a more transparent and regulated trading environment, making the company more attractive to a broader range of institutional and retail investors. Increased Liquidity: A higher-tier market often leads to greater trading volumes, which can improve the liquidity of the company’s shares. Credibility Boost: Operating on a recognized market lends significant credibility, especially for an entity deeply involved in the nascent crypto space. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation began its journey of accumulating BTC in June and has rapidly grown its holdings to over 700 BTC. This strategic accumulation underscores their belief in Bitcoin as a foundational asset for the future. Why Are More Companies Embracing Bitcoin for Their Treasuries? The move by Bitcoin Treasury Corporation isn’t an isolated incident. We’ve witnessed a remarkable shift in corporate finance over the past few years, with numerous companies integrating digital assets into their balance sheets. Why this sudden embrace of Bitcoin ? Many view Bitcoin as a powerful hedge against inflation, especially in an era of quantitative easing and rising global debt. Its decentralized nature and finite supply of 21 million coins make it an appealing “digital gold” alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a bold vision for corporate capital allocation. While the potential for significant gains is attractive, companies must also navigate the inherent volatility of the crypto market and evolving regulatory landscapes. Despite these challenges, the long-term strategic benefits often outweigh the risks for those with a strong conviction in this digital asset. How Does This Listing Impact the Broader Bitcoin Market? Each time a company like Bitcoin Treasury Corporation makes such a move, it sends a ripple through the entire crypto ecosystem. It serves as a strong validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset class, not just a speculative tool. This increased institutional involvement can lead to: Greater Stability: As more large entities hold Bitcoin for the long term, it could potentially reduce some of the extreme price swings often associated with the asset. Mainstream Acceptance: Corporate adoption paves the way for wider public acceptance and understanding of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Clarity: With more traditional companies engaging, regulators may be compelled to provide clearer guidelines, fostering a more secure environment for everyone involved with digital currencies. For individual investors, this trend suggests a maturation of the market. It implies that fundamental analysis and long-term investment strategies are becoming increasingly relevant in the Bitcoin space. Navigating the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The listing of Bitcoin Treasury Corporation on the OTCQX Best Market marks a pivotal moment. It highlights a growing confidence among corporations in integrating digital assets into their financial strategies. As the digital economy continues to expand, we can expect more companies to explore similar avenues for their Bitcoin investments. However, it’s crucial for any company considering Bitcoin for its treasury to conduct thorough due diligence. Understanding market dynamics, regulatory compliance, and secure custody solutions are paramount. The journey into corporate crypto holdings is still relatively new, but pioneers like Bitcoin Treasury Corporation are charting a course for others to follow. In conclusion, Bitcoin Treasury Corporation’s OTCQX listing is more than just a procedural step; it’s a powerful testament to the enduring appeal and increasing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin . This move not only benefits the company but also reinforces the broader narrative of digital assets’ emergence as a crucial component of modern financial portfolios.

Some are drawn to presales that promise explosive growth, while others prefer established blockchains preparing for their next rallies. For financial students, analysts, developers, and meme coin hunters, three projects stand out: TRON, Toncoin, and BullZilla . TRON is consolidating near key resistance as on-chain metrics show historic growth. Toncoin is defending support levels with a potential move to $6 on the horizon. Meanwhile, BullZilla’s presale is firing up Ethereum’s DeFi engine, creating the kind of ROI potential that presale investors crave. Together, these coins showcase why diversification is key when considering the Best crypto presales to invest in 2025. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Presale Powerhouse Forged in Ethereum’s Blue Fire Among the Best crypto presales to invest in 2025, none are catching as much buzz as BullZilla ($BZIL).

This structure not only ensures balanced growth but also explains why $BZIL is being widely discussed as the Best crypto presales to invest in 2025. The Mutation Mechanism BullZilla’s presale employs the Mutation Mechanism, which increases the token price automatically either when $100,000 is raised or every 48 hours. This dynamic pricing ensures urgency while rewarding early investors. For many, this model cements BullZilla ($BZIL) as one of the Best crypto presales to invest in 2025.

TRON (TRX): Eyeing Breakout as On-Chain Growth Surges TRON has become impossible to ignore in the conversation about the Best crypto presales to invest in 2025, despite being an established coin rather than a fresh presale. Priced near $0.3625, TRX is consolidating just below resistance after reclaiming the $0.32–$0.33 support zone. Analysts argue this setup mirrors previous breakout phases that preceded parabolic rallies. A clean move above $0.3625 could unlock a run to $0.50, with long-term targets between $1.40 and $3.10.

Toncoin (TON): Support Holds, Breakout Toward $6 in Sight Toncoin adds a unique flavor to the debate over the Best crypto presales to invest in 2025. Trading just below $4.80, TON is consolidating in a sideways channel. Buyers are defending support levels, suggesting resilience in the face of volatile conditions. Analysts suggest that if Toncoin clears the $4.80 resistance, it could surge to $6 or higher before year-end. Institutional interest has helped fuel this resilience, but weakening volume warns of possible pullbacks if momentum fades. This mix of volatility and upside potential is precisely what keeps Toncoin on investors’ radars when they explore the Best crypto presales to invest in 2025. For traders, Toncoin offers shorter-term opportunities driven by technical setups. For longer-term holders, institutional activity provides assurance that the project has staying power. While not a presale, its positioning in 2025 makes it a top contender alongside emerging meme coin narratives.

Today, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a fascinating snapshot, currently holding steady at 52 – firmly in the neutral zone. But what does this really mean for investors, and how can we interpret this balancing act of emotions? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular tool from Alternative.me, provides a daily barometer of the market’s emotional state. It’s a simple scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 shouts “Extreme Greed.” A score of 52, as we see today, indicates that neither fear nor euphoria is dominating the scene; instead, there’s a delicate equilibrium. Extreme Fear (0-24): Investors are highly concerned, often leading to selling pressure. This can sometimes signal a buying opportunity for contrarian investors. Fear (25-49): General apprehension in the market. Neutral (50-54): A period of indecision, where the market isn’t leaning strongly in either direction. This is where the index currently sits. Greed (55-74): Growing optimism and potential for price surges. Extreme Greed (75-100): Overly enthusiastic market, often preceding a correction. How is This Crucial Sentiment Indicator Calculated? You might wonder how this single number captures such complex market psychology. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a guess; it’s a weighted average of several key factors, each contributing to the overall score. Understanding these components helps us appreciate the index’s comprehensive nature. Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average. Higher volatility often signals fear. Market Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a positive market can indicate greed, while high volumes during a downturn might suggest panic selling. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment from various social media platforms, looking for keywords related to fear and greed, and the overall engagement around them. Surveys (15%): Although paused currently, these polls directly ask investors about their market outlook, providing a direct sentiment measure. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates a shift from altcoins to Bitcoin, which can be a sign of fear or uncertainty in the broader altcoin market. Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” could signal fear. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Mean for You? A neutral reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it suggests a period of relative calm, potentially offering a stable environment for analysis rather than impulsive decisions driven by extreme emotions. On the other hand, neutrality can sometimes precede significant shifts, making vigilance key. For investors, this neutral stance encourages a balanced approach: Avoid Hasty Decisions: Don’t get swept away by short-term price movements. A neutral index suggests the market isn’t in an emotional frenzy. Conduct Thorough Research: This is an excellent time to delve into project fundamentals, upcoming developments, and market trends without the pressure of extreme fear or greed. Rebalance Portfolios: Consider if your current portfolio allocation aligns with your long-term goals. Neutral periods can be ideal for adjustments. Set Clear Strategies: Whether you’re a long-term holder or a day trader, having a predefined entry and exit strategy is crucial. The Power of Perspective: Beyond the Crypto Fear & Greed Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool, it’s essential to remember it’s just one piece of the puzzle. It reflects sentiment, but doesn’t dictate future price action directly. Savvy investors combine this indicator with technical analysis, fundamental research, and macroeconomic factors to form a comprehensive market view. The crypto market is inherently volatile. Emotional swings can lead to irrational decisions. By understanding tools like the index, you empower yourself to make more informed, rational choices, rather than reacting to the crowd’s sentiment. This balanced perspective is truly a game-changer for navigating the unpredictable crypto landscape. The current neutral reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 52 offers a moment of reflection rather than panic or euphoria. It’s a reminder that while emotions play a significant role in market dynamics, a data-driven, strategic approach remains the most reliable path. Use this neutral period wisely to refine your strategies, deepen your understanding, and prepare for whatever comes next in the fascinating world of digital assets. Stay informed, stay calm, and make empowered decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a “neutral” reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signify? A neutral reading, typically between 50 and 54, indicates that market participants are neither extremely fearful nor extremely greedy. It suggests a period of indecision or equilibrium, where strong emotional biases are not currently driving the market. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily by Alternative.me, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment every 24 hours. Q3: Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict future price movements? While the index is a valuable sentiment indicator, it does not directly predict future price movements. It helps investors understand the prevailing market psychology, which can inform their decisions when combined with other analytical tools like technical and fundamental analysis. Q4: Why is Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance a factor in the index? Bitcoin’s dominance reflects its share of the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance can sometimes signal that investors are moving funds from more volatile altcoins back into Bitcoin, often perceived as a safer asset during times of uncertainty, thus contributing to a “fear” sentiment in the broader market. Q5: Should I buy when the index shows “Extreme Fear” and sell during “Extreme Greed”? Many experienced investors use a contrarian strategy, buying during extreme fear (when others are selling) and selling during extreme greed (when others are buying). However, this strategy carries risks and should be part of a well-developed investment plan, not the sole basis for decisions.

Most past M2E projects relied on extractive token models that failed to deliver sustainable value. As a result, the NFTs and tokens in their ecosystems eventually lost all of their value, leaving users disappointed and the market stagnant. LivLive offers a fresh approach by combining augmented reality (AR), blockchain, and meaningful crypto rewards to revive and redefine M2E. It connects players and businesses, rewarding users for their data and actions while enabling companies to run optimised, measurable, and impact-driven marketing campaigns. The LivLive presale is offering a potential 12x with the presale price set at $0.02 and the launch at $0.25. LivLive: crypto rewards and M2E mechanics The LivLive protocol is an augmented reality game layer designed to shift how users interact with the world while offering businesses a next-generation approach to customer engagement and loyalty. The LivLive protocol overlays a digital layer onto the physical world, transforming every city street into an interactive ecosystem. Here, users are rewarded directly for their actions, unlike the Web2 model, where corporations harvest and sell data. Businesses engage by sponsoring quests that drive foot traffic, generate authentic reviews, and build measurable trust. At the heart of the ecosystem is the $LIVE token. It is used to reward players for their actions, provide governance options, and serve as a medium of exchange between businesses and the LivLive community. Unlike previous M2E projects that focused on speculative tokens and short-lived hype, LivLive offers a sustainable model centred on real utility and lasting value for users and businesses alike. A key element of the project is the integration of real-world assets (RWAs) as rewards. Beyond ‘just tokens’, players can unlock tangible prizes like event tickets, branded merchandise, and travel experiences, bringing real value to every achievement. Another essential feature is delivering a personalised experience to every player. AI personalisation tailors quests and rewards to each user, enhancing engagement and creating meaningful interactions within the LivLive AR world. The $LIVE token powering the M2E ecosystem The $LIVE token is central to the ecosystem and the broader objectives of LivLive. Unlike some tokens associated with M2E projects in the past, $LIVE offers much more than an opportunity for short-term speculation. It is a multi-utility token with a maximum supply of 1 billion and a transparent, fair launch tokenomics structure. The token’s utility includes in-game transactions, mining power multipliers, trading on supported exchanges, and unlocking exclusive experiences within the LivLive AR world. Players use $LIVE to participate actively, access rewards, and engage with the platform’s features. Moreover, $LIVE plays a crucial role in bridging the digital and real economies. Through partnerships with brands and companies, it enables users to earn tangible rewards and services, connecting blockchain technology with real-world value. This integration strengthens the LivLive ecosystem by creating lasting value for both players and businesses. $LIVE tokenomics. LivLive presale bundles available now The $LIVE token presale is live, offering early exposure to the project with five different tiers. Every tier provides full access to the AR game through a physical wristband, along with varying $LIVE token allocations and bonuses. Each tier also determines the mining power, which affects how much $LIVE players can earn by completing quests in the LivLive AR world. Higher tiers offer stronger multipliers, enabling faster and more consistent token mining. The presale includes access to the $2.5 million treasure hunt, where NFT keys are awarded to unlock virtual chambers containing token prizes, including a grand prize of $1 million in $LIVE tokens. Presale participants will hold 75% of the total $LIVE supply. After the presale, new tokens will be introduced through mining rewards, positioning presale holders as key market leaders within the LivLive ecosystem.

The company said the new batteries aim to extend the driving range of electric vehicles with the new batteries. The firm also plans to eliminate the anode in batteries during the manufacturing stage to boost energy density. Panasonic believes the initiative will likely provide more advanced capacity levels by the end of 2027. Panasonic expects a 25% increase in battery capacity The opening of @panasonic ’s $4 billion electric vehicle battery plant in @CityofDeSotoKS later this month means 4,000 new 🇺🇸 jobs and an investment in tomorrow’s workforce and tomorrow’s economy. A fascinating discussion with @panasonic President and CEO Yuki Kusumi on the future… pic.twitter.com/0aSg6DxvVL — ジョージ・グラス駐日米国大使 (@USAmbJapan) July 1, 2025 Panasonic acknowledged that the new products could lead to a 25% increase in battery capacity, which it expects will boost the driving range of Tesla’s Model Y vehicles. Panasonic disclosed that the improvement will reduce the driving range of Tesla’s most affordable sport-utility vehicles by roughly 90 miles (about 14 km), at the current battery pack size. Reuters reported that one of the executives at Panasonic said the announcement came ahead of a presentation on Thursday by Shoichiro Watanabe, the technology chief at the group’s battery arm. The official also revealed that the technology is being sought after by a flurry of global battery manufacturers. According to the report, the new battery will not have an anode at the manufacturing stage; rather, a lithium metal anode will be formed after being charged for the first time. The company said the technology will allow more active cathode materials, including nickel, aluminium, and cobalt, to increase capacity without changing the volume. The Japanese firm added that it plans to reduce nickel production, arguing that it’s relatively more expensive. On Wednesday, Vantage Market Research projected that the global EV battery recycling market will surge at a CAGR of 40.8% from $0.57 billion in 2024 to $24.5 billion by 2035. The research company argued that EV battery recycling enables the recovery of critical raw materials while reducing environmental impact and supply-chain dependence. The initiative also offers value to automakers and energy providers by lowering raw material volatility, reducing import reliance, and enabling greener EV production. Vantage forecasts a rise in EV battery recycling According to the research, the Asia Pacific region leads in EV battery recycling due to massive EV production in Japan, China , and South Korea. Lithium-ion batteries also accounted for the major share in 2024. The research firm also estimates that EVs will reach 200 million globally by 2030, creating a huge amount of end-of-life batteries. CEO and founder Nnega Rathod Godbole said that EV battery recycling is not just an environmental compliance initiative, but it’s becoming a strong push towards sustainable mobility and energy economy. MIT researchers also came up with a new kind of self-assembling battery material that quickly breaks apart when submerged in a simple organic liquid. According to the report, the team found a way for the material to work as the electrolyte in a functioning, solid-state battery cell and then revert to its original molecular components. The report’s author, Yukio Cho, said the approach offers an alternative to shredding batteries since the electrolyte serving as the battery’s connecting layer helps accelerate the recycling process. He also revealed that the current battery sector has been focused on high-performing materials and designs, but has later sought to find a way to recycle without the complex structures and hard-to-recycle materials.

Namely, since the fallout started following the June 5 spat regarding the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency has surged nearly 50%, climbing from $0.1882 to $0.2799 on September 18. What’s more, the meme coin is not only up 5.42% on the day at the time of writing, but it is also the biggest gainer among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies over the past week, outperforming the market with an 11.43% surge.

The leading decentralized crypto lending protocol, Aave (AAVE), is gearing up for the highly anticipated launch of Aave V4 in the fourth quarter of this year. This upcoming version promises to redefine how users interact with lending and borrowing, introducing a groundbreaking architectural shift that could enhance flexibility and security across the platform. What is the Hub-and-Spoke Architecture in Aave V4? At the core of the Aave V4 upgrade is a brand-new Hub-and-Spoke architecture. This innovative structure moves away from the traditional monolithic design, where all assets and risk parameters were managed uniformly. Instead, it creates a central ‘hub’ that connects to multiple specialized ‘spokes’. Think of the hub as the central nervous system, managing overall liquidity and core functionalities. Each ‘spoke’, on the other hand, acts as a dedicated, independent module tailored to specific asset characteristics or risk profiles. This modular approach allows for greater customization and isolation of risks, which is crucial for a robust DeFi ecosystem. Unlocking Enhanced Flexibility and Liquidity with Aave V4 The introduction of the Hub-and-Spoke architecture with Aave V4 brings several compelling benefits, addressing some of the key challenges in decentralized lending: Flexible Risk Management: Individual spokes can implement unique risk parameters, collateral factors, and liquidation thresholds. This means a volatile asset can have stricter rules without impacting more stable assets in other spokes. Tailored Asset Support: The protocol can now support a wider variety of assets, including those with unique characteristics or regulatory considerations, by assigning them to specialized spokes. This opens up new avenues for lending and borrowing. Liquidity Network Effects: While spokes are independent, they all benefit from the aggregated liquidity at the hub level. This ensures that even specialized markets maintain deep liquidity, improving capital efficiency for all users. This strategic move by Aave aims to create a more resilient and adaptable lending platform, capable of handling diverse assets and market conditions more effectively. It represents a significant step forward in making DeFi more secure and accessible. How Will Aave V4 Impact Decentralized Lending Users? For existing Aave users and new participants in the DeFi space, Aave V4 is set to deliver a more refined and secure experience. The ability to manage risks on a per-asset basis means the entire protocol becomes more robust against isolated incidents or exploits related to specific tokens. Users can expect more tailored lending opportunities, potentially with better rates for certain asset classes due to optimized risk management. Furthermore, the increased flexibility could lead to the listing of a broader range of assets on Aave, expanding the utility and reach of the protocol significantly. This upgrade reinforces Aave’s commitment to innovation and user protection. Looking Ahead: The Future of Aave with V4 The launch of Aave V4 is not just an incremental update; it is a strategic repositioning for the future of decentralized finance. By embracing a modular design, Aave is paving the way for greater scalability, allowing the protocol to adapt quickly to new market demands and technological advancements. While the transition to a new architecture will require careful auditing and community governance, the long-term benefits for the entire ecosystem are substantial. This upgrade underscores Aave’s leadership in the DeFi space, demonstrating a proactive approach to enhancing security, efficiency, and user experience. It’s an exciting time for anyone invested in the future of decentralized lending. Conclusion The planned Q4 launch of Aave V4 marks a pivotal moment for the decentralized lending giant. With its innovative Hub-and-Spoke architecture, Aave is set to deliver unparalleled flexibility, enhanced risk management, and stronger liquidity network effects. This upgrade is poised to strengthen Aave’s position as a leading DeFi protocol, offering a more robust, adaptable, and user-centric platform for the future of crypto lending. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Aave V4? Aave V4 is the upcoming major version upgrade for the decentralized crypto lending protocol Aave, planned for launch in Q4 this year. It introduces a new Hub-and-Spoke architecture to enhance flexibility, risk management, and liquidity. When is Aave V4 expected to launch? According to Aave’s official roadmap, Aave V4 is scheduled to launch in the fourth quarter of this year (Q4 2024). What is the Hub-and-Spoke architecture in Aave V4? It’s a new design where a central ‘hub’ manages core liquidity and functions, while multiple specialized ‘spokes’ handle specific assets or risk profiles independently. This allows for tailored risk management and greater modularity. How will Aave V4 benefit users? Users can expect more flexible and tailored lending options, enhanced risk isolation for specific assets, and improved overall protocol security and capital efficiency due to better liquidity management. Is Aave V4 expected to be more secure than previous versions? Yes, the Hub-and-Spoke architecture in Aave V4 is designed to improve security by allowing for isolated risk management on individual spokes. This means issues with one asset or market are less likely to impact the entire protocol. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

With the market becoming increasingly complex, investors need strategies that balance long-term security with exposure to exponential upside. The goal is not only to survive volatility but to thrive during market cycles that can generate life-changing returns. Analysts argue that the best portfolios today mix foundational large-cap assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum with fast-growing ecosystems such as Solana and carefully chosen presale projects. This layered approach ensures resilience while capturing opportunities for outsized gains. One project frequently cited in this conversation is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has quickly become one of the most talked-about presale tokens thanks to its scarcity model, legitimacy through audits, and strong community momentum. Foundations of a crypto portfolio Every successful crypto portfolio begins with a solid foundation. For most investors, that foundation is Bitcoin. With its fixed supply and growing institutional adoption through ETFs, Bitcoin remains the closest equivalent to digital gold. Analysts suggest allocating a significant portion of any portfolio to Bitcoin for stability and long-term appreciation. Ethereum serves as the second cornerstone, offering exposure to decentralized finance, tokenization, and staking mechanics that provide consistent demand. Together, Bitcoin and Ethereum form the core of most long-term strategies, ensuring portfolios are anchored to assets that have repeatedly proven their staying power across cycles. The role of growth assets Once a foundation is established, the next step is to incorporate growth assets. Solana is a leading candidate in this category, with its speed, scalability, and expanding ecosystem attracting both developers and institutional investors. Avalanche, Polkadot, and other layer-1 blockchains can also play this role, offering exposure to ecosystems with room to grow. Analysts note that allocating to these assets provides investors with upside beyond the conservative returns of Bitcoin and Ethereum. While they carry more volatility, they also deliver stronger growth during bullish cycles, making them essential for portfolios that aim to outperform. Diversification through presales A strong crypto portfolio balances foundation assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum with high-upside plays that capture speculative momentum. Analysts stress the importance of diversification, highlighting that presales can provide outsized returns when chosen wisely. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly featured in such discussions, with ROI projections up to 11,000% driving serious retail attention. What elevates it beyond hype is audit-backed legitimacy, CertiK and HashEx approvals confirm its structure, offering confidence rarely found at this stage. For those constructing portfolios, the takeaway is clear: resilience should come from majors, but exponential growth comes from asymmetric bets like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts argue this presale isn’t just a speculative flyer, it’s becoming the strategic high-upside component of modern portfolio design. Balancing allocation strategies The key to building a strong portfolio lies in allocation. Analysts recommend dividing capital across three categories: foundations, growth assets, and speculative opportunities. Foundations like Bitcoin and Ethereum may take up 50–60% of the portfolio, growth assets such as Solana 20–30%, and presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE 10–20%. This mix provides stability while maintaining exposure to exponential upside. Investors are reminded that diversification does not mean owning every token—it means owning the right mix of tokens that complement one another. By blending these categories, portfolios can perform well across different phases of the cycle. Timing matters Another crucial element in portfolio construction is timing. Entering positions during periods of consolidation often provides the best risk-adjusted opportunities. Historical data shows that investors who accumulated during market lulls, rather than chasing rallies, consistently outperformed. In 2017, 2020, and 2023, September and October accumulations preceded strong year-end rallies. Analysts suggest that 2025 may follow a similar pattern, with opportunities to enter Ethereum, Solana, and presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE before broader retail participation accelerates. Timing, combined with allocation, forms the backbone of successful portfolio design. The importance of community momentum While fundamentals matter, community momentum remains one of the strongest drivers of crypto valuations. Bitcoin’s rise was fueled by conviction, Ethereum’s by builders, and Shiba Inu’s by retail energy. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now showcasing this dynamic in real time. Its Telegram and X communities are expanding rapidly, creating a feedback loop where growing interest fuels demand, and demand strengthens the narrative. Analysts emphasize that portfolios built for outperformance often include at least one community-driven project because such assets have the ability to scale attention into capital flows. Learning from past cycles Past cycles highlight the dangers of building portfolios too narrowly. Investors who held only Bitcoin in 2017 missed out on Ethereum’s exponential gains. Those who ignored meme coins in 2021 missed Shiba Inu’s parabolic run. The best-performing portfolios blended core assets with emerging narratives, ensuring that no single sector dictated performance. In 2025, analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the kind of narrative that could define the cycle, much like SHIB or DOGE did in the past. Allocating even a small portion can provide exposure to this possibility without compromising overall stability. Analyst commentary Analysts from multiple firms are highlighting the same themes: anchor portfolios with Bitcoin and Ethereum, diversify with growth layer-1s, and add presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE for exponential potential. Reports note that presales often deliver returns unattainable from large caps, especially when they combine scarcity with legitimacy. The consensus is that the best crypto portfolios in 2025 will not be those chasing trends but those built methodically with layers of stability, growth, and early-stage opportunity. Conclusion Building the best crypto portfolio in 2025 requires discipline, balance, and a willingness to embrace both stability and asymmetry. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the non-negotiable anchors, Solana and other growth assets provide ecosystem-driven expansion, and MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers presale momentum that could define the next breakout story. Together, they form a portfolio positioned not just to survive volatility but to thrive across cycles. For investors looking ahead, the message is clear: the strongest portfolios are those built with foresight, balance, and conviction.

Still, some analysts are maintaining a cautious bias. ""The Fed rate cut gave crypto a near-term lift, but the rally is not yet clean,"" Timothy Misir, head of research, BRN, said in an email. ""Institutional flows are supportive overall, yet exchange inflows and a single-day ETF outflow signal distribution into strength."" Misir suggested traders use a bitcoin price band of $115,000–$115,500 as the guardrail for tactical risk management. Derivatives Positioning by Omkar Godbole BNB, AVAX, and DOT have all seen double-digit increases in futures open interest (OI) in the past 24 hours, reinforcing their price gains of 5% to 9%. BTC's cumulative OI in USD and USDT-denominated perpetual futures continues to drop, diverging from the ascending price. Perhaps derivative traders are not participating in the rally. (Check out the Technical Analysis section.) BCH, TRX, BNB, BTC, XMR, AVAX, and SUI stand out with a positive open interest-adjusted cumulative volume delta, indicating strong buying pressure. There are no signs of overheating even in the further corners of the crypto market, as annualized funding rates for smaller speculative tokens remain at around 10%. On the CME, OI in ether futures is again closing on the 2 million ETH mark, while positioning in BTC futures remains considerably light. The annualized three-month basis for both tokens remains below 10%, offering significantly lower yield to carry traders than SOL's 17% return. On Deribit, 25-delta risk reversals reveal a neutral to bearish (put) bias in options out to March expiry. In contrast, ether options are bullish across all tenors. Block flows on OTC network Paradigm featured demand for the $116K call expiring on Sept. 19 and the $100K put expiring on Oct. 31. Token Talk By Oliver Knight The altcoin market staged a strong rebound following Wednesday's oversold RSI readings, with several tokens posting gains in excess of 10%. Leading the rally is ether.fi (ETHFI), up 12% in the past 24 hours to $1.64, the highest since January. BNB also notched a milestone, breaking through $1,000 for the first time as momentum accelerates toward fresh record highs. The bullish backdrop comes as bitcoin creeps up toward $117,300, consolidating above critical support at $110,000. Meanwhile, bitcoin dominance slipped to 56% at CoinMarketCap, its lowest since early January, highlighting investors’ growing appetite for more speculative investments. The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has been one of the largest beneficiaries of Thursday's move higher, with total value locked (TVL) across all protocols hitting $170 billion , the highest point since April, 2022. Hyperliquid's layer-1 blockchain notched a record high of $2.77 billion having risen by 3.88% in 24 hours, while Sui's TVL is up by 3% to $2.1 billion.",Markets|Markets|market analysis|Crypto Markets Today|Derivatives|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-18 12:00:00

Then you need to know about a significant development that could impact your digital assets. South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has announced the temporary suspension of POKT deposits and withdrawals . This crucial move comes directly from a halt in Pocket Network’s block production, impacting users’ ability to move their POKT tokens effectively. What Exactly Caused the Halt in POKT Deposits and Withdrawals? Upbit’s decision to suspend POKT deposits and withdrawals stems from a critical issue within the Pocket Network itself. The network has experienced a complete halt in its block production. In simple terms, new blocks are not being added to the blockchain, which is essential for processing and confirming transactions. When a blockchain stops producing blocks, it means no new transactions can be recorded or verified. This directly affects the reliability and security of transferring POKT tokens. Upbit, prioritizing user asset safety, acted quickly to prevent potential issues such as lost funds or transaction errors. This situation is temporary, but it underscores the technical challenges that can arise in the fast-paced world of blockchain technology. Understanding the Immediate Impact on Upbit Users For users holding POKT on Upbit, this suspension of POKT deposits and withdrawals means you currently cannot move your tokens onto or off the exchange. Your existing POKT holdings within Upbit remain secure, as the issue is with the network, not the exchange’s security. However, their liquidity is temporarily restricted. What should you do if you are affected by this situation? Stay Informed: Regularly check Upbit’s official announcements and the Pocket Network’s communication channels for the latest updates. Avoid Unverified Information: Rely only on official sources for updates regarding the resumption of POKT deposits and withdrawals to prevent misinformation. Upbit has a strong track record of communicating such events transparently to its user base, ensuring clarity during uncertain times. What is Pocket Network (POKT) and Why Does Block Production Matter? Pocket Network (POKT) is a decentralized relay infrastructure designed for Web3 applications. It enables decentralized applications (dApps) to query various blockchains without relying on centralized intermediaries. POKT tokens are used to incentivize node operators who relay these requests, ensuring a robust and decentralized service. Block production is the lifeblood of any blockchain. Each block contains a batch of confirmed transactions. When block production stops: New transactions cannot be processed or validated. The entire network becomes unresponsive, halting all on-chain activity. Exchanges like Upbit must pause activities like POKT deposits and withdrawals to prevent lost funds or transaction errors, safeguarding user assets. This temporary halt highlights the critical importance of robust network stability and continuous operation for any blockchain project. What Are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem? Incidents like the temporary suspension of POKT deposits and withdrawals by a major exchange such as Upbit serve as important reminders for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They highlight the inherent technical risks associated with early-stage blockchain projects and the continuous need for development, monitoring, and quick problem-solving. Exchanges play a vital role in protecting users when underlying network issues occur. Their quick response can mitigate potential losses and maintain user trust. This event also emphasizes: The importance of decentralization and redundancy in blockchain infrastructure to minimize single points of failure. The need for clear, timely communication from project teams during outages to keep the community informed. Such challenges, while inconvenient, often lead to stronger, more resilient networks in the long run as vulnerabilities are identified and addressed. Looking Ahead: When Will POKT Deposits and Withdrawals Resume? The temporary nature of this suspension means that Upbit will likely resume POKT deposits and withdrawals once Pocket Network successfully resolves its block production issues. The exact timeline for resolution depends entirely on the Pocket Network development team’s efforts and the complexity of the underlying problem. Users should exercise patience and monitor official announcements closely for updates. Upbit has committed to providing updates as soon as the network stabilizes and operations can safely resume. This proactive approach helps maintain user confidence and ensures a smooth return to normal service for POKT holders. In conclusion, Upbit’s temporary halt of POKT deposits and withdrawals is a direct consequence of a block production issue on the Pocket Network. While inconvenient for users, it is a necessary and responsible step taken by the exchange to protect assets. Staying informed through official channels is the best course of action during this period. The crypto world is dynamic, and such challenges often pave the way for stronger, more reliable systems in the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Upbit suspend POKT deposits and withdrawals? A: Upbit suspended POKT deposits and withdrawals due to a complete halt in Pocket Network’s block production, which prevents new transactions from being processed. Q2: Are my POKT tokens on Upbit safe during this suspension? A: Yes, your POKT holdings on Upbit remain secure. The issue is with the Pocket Network itself, not with Upbit’s security infrastructure. Q3: What does a ‘block production halt’ mean for Pocket Network? A: A block production halt means the Pocket Network blockchain is not creating new blocks, effectively stopping all new transaction confirmations and rendering the network unresponsive. Q4: When will POKT deposits and withdrawals resume on Upbit? A: The resumption depends on when the Pocket Network team resolves its block production issues. Upbit will announce the resumption once the network is stable and operations can safely proceed. Q5: What should POKT holders do during this suspension? A: POKT holders should monitor Upbit’s official announcements and Pocket Network’s communication channels for updates and avoid relying on unverified information.

In a video analysis posted the same day, the veteran price-action trader argued that with the policy move now in the rear-view mirror, crypto can “just focus on the charts,” sketching a roadmap in which Bitcoin posts one more leg higher into new all-time highs before a pullback ushers in a classic altseason blow-off. “We had FOMC today and the rates got cut finally… It’s 25 basis points,” he said. “Now the market’s going to digest it.” Where Is Bitcoin Price Going Next? The policy backdrop he’s reacting to is straightforward: the FOMC lowered the fed funds target range by a quarter point to 4.00%–4.25% on Sept. 17, with Chair Jerome Powell describing the move as a risk-management response to weakening labor dynamics and leaving the door open to additional easing this year. The decision drew an 11–1 vote, with newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran dissenting in favor of a larger, 50 bps cut—an unusually hawkish dissent in a dovish direction—while the Board’s implementation note reset key administered rates effective Sept. 18. Markets read the statement and projections as signaling scope for further cuts into year-end. Related Reading: Crucial Ten Days Ahead For Crypto: Will They Ignite Mega Altcoin Season? From here, Mayne’s framework is unapologetically technical. He characterizes Bitcoin’s most recent upswing as corrective relative to the prior impulse and expects price to “push above the mid-range” toward a range high around $120,000–$121,000, where he will watch for rejection at a higher-time-frame confluence defined by a weekly swing-failure pattern (SFP) and an H12 breaker. If momentum stalls there, he plans to short into a washout to clear out built-up leverage—“HYPE made another all-time high today. PUMP has tripled in the last two weeks… there’s some leverage in the system”—and then buy the dip for what he calls the last parabolic leg of the cycle. “Any sort of dip on BTC, I want to be looking for a long,” he said, adding that a shallow retest in the $110,000–$111,000 area or a deeper sweep of recent lows would both be acceptable springboards if the rebound is decisive. If, instead, price grinds through the $120,000 s with no signs of exhaustion, Mayne says he has “no problem” flipping to breakout longs above the all-time high once strength is confirmed intraday—an approach that mirrors his playbook from prior expansions (“Once this thing broke out aggressively… you’re looking for longs”). He emphasizes sequence over prediction: the short he’s eyeing is counter-trend—“a pullback in an uptrend”—and the prime objective remains to position for the next impulsive advance. When Will The Crypto Market Top? Timing-wise, he situates the prospective cycle top in Q4 2025 or Q1 2026, describing a pattern in which Bitcoin’s final vertical leg into the $150,000 to $180,000 region is followed by distribution while altcoins reprice higher—the archetypal altseason. “This parabolic leg I think would be the last leg of the bull run,” he said, before outlining notional alt targets consistent with a late-cycle melt-up: Ethereum $5,000–$7,000, Solana $300–$500, Dogecoin $0.50–$0.70. The mechanics, as he narrates them: a last BTC push, a corrective wash, a V-shaped reclaim of the 2024 ATH “very quickly,” then Q4 “mania” with breadth shifting to large-cap alts as Bitcoin distributes. Related Reading: December 2024 Crypto Crash Signal Returns As Altcoins Go Wild The technical scaffolding behind that view leans on concepts familiar to discretionary price-action traders. Weekly SFPs (failed breaks of prior extremes) set the trap line at range edges; H12 breakers and order blocks frame high-probability reaction zones; and fair-value gaps guide where liquidity vacuums might fill during a corrective flush. On structure, he insists the weekly trend remains up, so any short is tactical and any deeper dip must resolve in a swift V-bottom and reclaim of the former highs to keep the cyclical script intact. His invalidation is equally clear: “If we spend any significant time back below [the 2024 all-time high], it’s really bad… I’m probably going to reassess my thoughts.” Macro, in Mayne’s view, now recedes to the background. The rate cut may have helped pull forward some September strength—“you could argue… the up move we’ve seen on Bitcoin… is in anticipation of this rate cut”—but with the decision made and Powell hinting there “could be another one… there could be two,” his emphasis is squarely on execution: wait for price to trade into the $120,000s and signal weakness for the clean counter-trend short; or, absent weakness, wait for the breakout continuation and ride it. Either way, he’s explicit about the north star for the coming weeks: “Focus on Bitcoin… Any sort of dip on BTC, I want to be looking for a long… Then altseason.” At press time, BTC traded at $117,176.

A recent admission from a U.S. investment firm serves as a stark reminder of these dangers. Praetorian Group International has confessed to orchestrating a massive crypto Ponzi scheme , defrauding tens of thousands of unsuspecting investors. This shocking revelation highlights the importance of vigilance in the digital asset space. What Exactly is a Crypto Ponzi Scheme? The Praetorian Case Unpacked A crypto Ponzi scheme operates much like traditional Ponzi schemes, but it leverages the allure and complexity of digital assets. Praetorian Group International, for instance, promised incredibly high daily returns, ranging from 0.5% to 3%. These figures often seemed too good to be true, and unfortunately, they were. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated Praetorian’s operations from 2019 to October 2021. Their findings confirmed that the firm was not generating returns through legitimate investments. Instead, it was simply paying earlier investors with money collected from newer participants. This classic Ponzi model ultimately collapses when the flow of new money dries up. How Did Praetorian Lure 90,000 Investors Worldwide? Praetorian’s deceptive tactics reached a global audience, ensnaring over 90,000 investors. The firm likely used sophisticated marketing and the promise of quick riches in the booming crypto market to attract victims. Many individuals, eager to participate in the perceived wealth generation of cryptocurrencies, fell prey to these enticing but false claims. Exaggerated Returns: Daily profits of up to 3% are virtually unheard of in legitimate investments. New Investor Funds: Money from new participants was the sole source of “returns” for existing investors. Lack of Transparency: The firm provided little to no verifiable information about its actual investment strategies. This scheme managed to collect a staggering $201 million in total funds, showcasing the immense scale of the deception. The Cost of Deceit: Luxury Lifestyles Funded by Victims’ Savings While thousands of investors faced significant losses, Praetorian’s CEO enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle. Investigations revealed that the funds siphoned from investors were used for personal enrichment. This included the acquisition of: Luxury homes High-end cars Other lavish goods Such actions are a common hallmark of a fraudulent crypto Ponzi scheme . The perpetrators live lavishly at the expense of their victims’ hard-earned money and financial security. The sentencing for this case is set for February 3, 2026, marking a significant step towards justice. Safeguarding Your Investments: Avoiding a Crypto Ponzi Scheme This unfortunate incident serves as a crucial lesson for anyone navigating the cryptocurrency market. Protecting your investments requires careful due diligence and a healthy dose of skepticism. Here are key actionable insights to help you avoid falling victim to a crypto Ponzi scheme : Be Wary of Guaranteed High Returns: Legitimate investments always carry risk; promises of guaranteed, exceptionally high daily or weekly returns are major red flags. Research Thoroughly: Investigate the firm, its founders, and its investment strategies. Look for verifiable information and regulatory compliance. Understand the Technology: If you don’t understand how an investment generates returns, it’s best to steer clear. Check for Regulatory Scrutiny: Verify if the firm is registered with relevant financial authorities like the SEC. Lessons Learned: Navigating the Crypto Landscape Safely The Praetorian case underscores the critical need for investor education and awareness. The crypto market, while innovative, remains a target for unscrupulous actors. Investors must prioritize security and verify the legitimacy of any platform or project before committing funds. Trusting your instincts and performing diligent research are your best defenses against financial fraud. The admission by Praetorian Group International to running a $200 million crypto Ponzi scheme is a sobering reminder of the persistent threats in the digital asset space. While the pursuit of high returns can be tempting, the devastating consequences of such schemes demand extreme caution. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and always prioritize the security of your investments. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Ponzi Schemes Q1: What is the primary characteristic of a crypto Ponzi scheme? A1: The primary characteristic is that returns paid to early investors come from the funds contributed by new investors, rather than from actual legitimate profits generated by investments. These schemes often promise unsustainably high returns. Q2: How can I identify a potential crypto Ponzi scheme? A2: Look for red flags such as guaranteed high returns with little to no risk, complex or vague investment strategies, pressure to recruit new investors, lack of transparency, and unregistered platforms or firms. Q3: Is the cryptocurrency market inherently risky due to schemes like Praetorian’s? A3: While the crypto market can be volatile and attracts fraudsters, it’s not inherently risky. The risks stem from unregulated entities and fraudulent actors. Legitimate crypto projects and platforms exist, but due diligence is crucial. Q4: What role does the SEC play in combating crypto Ponzi schemes? A4: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) actively investigates and prosecutes individuals and firms involved in financial fraud, including those operating crypto Ponzi schemes, to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Q5: What should I do if I suspect I’ve been involved in a crypto Ponzi scheme? A5: If you suspect you’re a victim, immediately cease further investments, gather all documentation, and report the scheme to relevant financial authorities like the SEC or your local regulatory body. Seek legal advice if necessary. Understanding the risks in the crypto market is vital for every investor.

DBS will list sgBENJI alongside Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin on the DBS Digital Exchange. The three firms explore repurchase agreements and custody models that allow tokenized collateral to serve as credit and short-term funding. DBS confirmed it may accept sgBENJI as repo collateral. According to Lim Wee Kian, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange, the initiative demonstrates the potential of tokenized securities to bring enhanced efficiency and liquidity to markets worldwide, highlighting their transformative impact. It also highlights strong institutional interest . Sorry there is more good news Tokenised money markets to facilitate lending and trading solutions on the XRPL partnering with DBS and Franklin Templeton. You can’t make this up. Sub-$3.00 coming https://t.co/mC2P4cPWrL pic.twitter.com/EoG5eWjNfa — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) September 18, 2025 Why Institutional Tokenization Matters Bringing money-market exposure onto blockchain technology reduces settlement inefficiencies. It also enables these assets to interact seamlessly with stablecoins, lending platforms, and exchange-traded digital assets, fostering greater integration and functionality. This composability enables programmable yields and can shorten settlement cycles for institutional cash management. The DBS–Franklin–Ripple collaboration is viewed by analysts as part of a larger trend toward tokenization, promising to boost liquidity and operational effectiveness in capital markets. Context and Trendline The partnership follows a steady increase in tokenization projects by major asset managers and global banks, reinforcing a broader shift toward digital representations of cash and short-duration instruments. Regulators and market infrastructure providers are also rolling out frameworks to support safe institutional adoption, signaling that on-chain money markets are transitioning from pilot projects to mainstream use. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Implications and Market Sentiment Morgan’s “Sub-$3.00” remark—made while XRP was already trading near $3.10—is clearly tongue-in-cheek. By joking about a dip below a round number during such bullish news, he was mocking persistent skeptics, not predicting a collapse. The laughing emoji underscores the sarcasm and signals his confidence that prices are more likely to climb than fall. His comment is also a sentiment gauge. It reflects growing belief that institutional adoption and new liquidity paths—especially pairing RLUSD with sgBENJI on DBS—could reshape demand for XRP and shift focus from legal risk to practical utility. Traders interpret this as suggesting that any brief move under $3 would be quickly bought, while the broader trajectory remains higher, depending on execution, custody approvals, and actual trading volumes. What to Watch Next Investors are now watching for the official issuance and listing of sgBENJI on the DBS Digital Exchange, the rollout of repo functionality, and early trading volumes that would confirm institutional uptake. If these milestones unfold as planned, Morgan’s light-hearted post could prove prophetic—signaling a market poised for sustained growth rather than a fleeting rally. Ripple’s announcement marks a significant institutional milestone, moving tokenized cash instruments from concept to tradable, yield-bearing products. Morgan’s playful response captures how swiftly market narratives can change when tangible adoption begins to take hold.

The rally follows a period of extreme bearish market sentiment for the token, according to data tracking platform Santiment. ""Historically, prices move in the opposite direction of the crowd's expectations. So, implementing a strategy of buying when the crowd is fearful and selling when the crowd gets greedy continues to work extremely well for most altcoins,"" Santiment said on X, explaining BCH's upswing. The token's rally aligns with the broader risk-on sentiment sparked by Wednesday's Fed rate cut and market expectations for continued liquidity easing in the coming months. Several tokens, including DOT, SUI, JUP, and NEAR, have seen similar gains in the past 24 hours, while smaller coins like PENGU have led the charge with impressive double-digit increases. Possibly greasing the Fed-led bullish market sentiment is the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision to approve generic listing standards for commodity and crypto ETFs without undergoing individual reviews for each product. This move is expected to speed up the introduction of new products tied to a variety of tokens in the coming months. BCH’s recent move builds on the bullish breakout confirmed two months ago. In July, its price surged above the upper boundary of a channel pattern formed by trendlines connecting highs from April and December 2024, and lows from August 2024 and April 2025. This breakout from a prolonged period of consolidation suggests that selling pressure has been absorbed, clearing the way for further upside. The immediate resistance to watch is the 2024 high at $719, which could be the next key hurdle for BCH to surpass.",Markets|Bitcoin Cash|cryptocurrencies|Markets|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BCH|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-18 12:07:15

In a pivotal move, Caliber buys LINK , acquiring a substantial 278,011 Chainlink (LINK) tokens. This impressive $6.5 million investment showcases a growing trend of traditional finance embracing innovative blockchain technologies. What Does Caliber’s Strategic LINK Acquisition Entail? This considerable purchase by Caliber is far from a spontaneous decision; it aligns perfectly with a previously announced corporate strategy. Caliber publicly declared its intention to both acquire and actively stake LINK tokens. This calculated approach by Caliber to buy LINK highlights a deliberate integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) assets into its robust investment portfolio. It signifies a forward-thinking perspective on digital asset management. Caliber’s investment in LINK was executed at an average price of $23.38 per token, reflecting a precise entry point. The details of this significant transaction were officially reported by GlobeNewswire , ensuring transparency. The total value of this acquisition reached a substantial $6.5 million, underscoring its importance. This strategic foresight positions Caliber to potentially capitalize on the growth and utility of the Chainlink network. Why Did Caliber Choose Chainlink (LINK) for This Major Investment? Caliber’s specific decision to target Chainlink (LINK) for this major investment is highly indicative of its strategic vision. Chainlink operates as the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, playing a critical role in bridging real-world data with smart contracts on various blockchains. Its unparalleled security, reliability, and widespread adoption make it an indispensable foundation for countless decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols.

Generate Yield: Earn staking rewards, creating a new stream of passive income for the firm. Gain Exposure: Secure a direct foothold in the rapidly expanding decentralized finance ecosystem. This strategic alignment with a cornerstone of Web3 infrastructure demonstrates Caliber’s deep understanding of the long-term value and utility that Chainlink provides to the digital economy. How Does Caliber’s LINK Investment Influence the Crypto Market? The news that Caliber buys LINK has already sent positive ripples across the cryptocurrency market. Immediately following the announcement, LINK tokens experienced a favorable price movement, climbing 4.73% to trade at $24.19, as reported by CoinMarketCap. Such significant institutional acquisitions often serve as powerful validation signals, bolstering confidence across the entire digital asset landscape.

Catalyst for Adoption: It can inspire further institutional adoption, encouraging more capital inflow into the crypto space. Confidence Reinforcement: It strengthens belief in the fundamental technology and the practical utility offered by projects like Chainlink. This evolving trend strongly suggests a maturing market where cryptocurrencies are increasingly perceived as serious, long-term investment opportunities, moving beyond mere speculative instruments. Navigating the Landscape: Opportunities and Considerations While the benefits of increasing institutional adoption are evident, the cryptocurrency market still presents its unique set of challenges. Market volatility remains an inherent characteristic, and the global regulatory framework continues to evolve. However, for forward-thinking companies like Caliber, the immense opportunities presented by blockchain technology and decentralized finance appear to significantly outweigh these perceived risks. Their carefully calculated entry, beginning with a foundational asset like LINK, exemplifies a prudent yet optimistic approach to integrating digital assets. It highlights a nuanced understanding of the potential for innovation and growth within this dynamic sector.

This strategic move by a Nasdaq-listed firm underscores the accelerating trend of institutional interest and the increasingly sophisticated integration of digital assets into traditional financial portfolios. As Caliber buys LINK and commits to its long-term staking strategy, it not only fortifies Chainlink’s ecosystem but also sends a powerful signal of growing confidence in the future of decentralized technologies. This development is poised to catalyze more mainstream adoption, firmly establishing crypto’s integral role in the evolving global financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is LINK? LINK is the native cryptocurrency of the Chainlink decentralized oracle network. Chainlink enables smart contracts to securely interact with off-chain data, events, and payment systems, making it a vital component for many blockchain applications. Why is Caliber investing in LINK? Caliber’s investment in LINK is strategic. By acquiring and staking LINK, Caliber aims to participate in the Chainlink network’s security, earn staking rewards, and gain exposure to the rapidly growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, aligning with its long-term digital asset strategy.

They signal confidence in digital assets, can attract further mainstream adoption, and often contribute to positive price movements and market maturation. What does “staking LINK” mean? Staking LINK involves locking up LINK tokens to support the operations and security of the Chainlink network. In return for staking, participants can earn rewards, contributing to the decentralization and reliability of the oracle services.

The portfolio includes institutional-grade multifamily and hospitality properties, showing a transformative step in making real estate investing more accessible and liquid. The announcement was made at the Stellar Meridian event in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, on September 18, a flagship annual gathering of blockchain leaders, investors, and policymakers. Unlocking Institutional-Grade Assets for All Investors By using the Stellar’s blockchain infrastructure, RedSwan said it is opening the doors of institutional-quality real estate to a wider investor base. Tokens are minted through the company’s regulatory-compliant Token Studio, allowing fractionalized real estate securities to be distributed seamlessly across borders. This model allows investors worldwide to participate in tokenized real estate opportunities with lower entry requirements, greater transparency, and 24/7 secondary market liquidity, explains RedSwan. “The Stellar network’s architecture aligns perfectly with our mission to unlock real estate investing through blockchain,” said Edward Nwokedi, Founder and CEO of RedSwan. Solving Traditional Barriers in Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate has historically been one of the most exclusive asset classes, typically reserved for institutional players. High minimum investments, limited liquidity, and opaque ownership structures restricted access for everyday investors. RedSwan’s platform addresses these barriers by offering fractional, compliant security stock shares in premium properties. This reduces the financial barrier to entry while creating liquidity by enabling investors to buy and sell shares in a transparent, regulated marketplace. A Trillion-Dollar Opportunity Through Tokenization According to RedSwan in North America alone, the real estate market represents an estimated $75 trillion in potential assets that could be unlocked through tokenization. The firm explains Tokenization not only democratizes access but also streamlines efficiencies, allowing asset owners to connect with a global investor base at lower costs. This model creates a bridge between institutional real estate and everyday investors seeking stable, long-term returns. Stellar’s Role in Real-World Asset Innovation “Stellar is purpose-built for moving value quickly, securely, and reliably across borders, which is why it is the network of choice for so many real-world assets,” said Denelle Dixon, CEO of the Stellar Development Foundation. “Tokenized real estate is a sector where the Stellar network can support innovation, and RedSwan’s tokenized offerings represent the kind of transformative use case the network was designed for,”adds Dixon. By joining forces, RedSwan and Stellar said they are reshaping financial access—making institutional-grade real estate investment global, affordable, and efficient through blockchain technology.

At this point, one of these altcoins was Avalanche (AVAX), which was closely followed by Turkish investors. While AVAX stands out from other altcoins with its 10% rise in the last 24 hours, Tiger Research said Avalanche’s structure is driving institutional adoption. Global companies are increasingly choosing Avalanche for its intuitive nature, according to a new report from Asia-focused Web3 research firm Tiger Research. At this point, Tiger Research said that Avalanche is leading the digitalization of the Asian economy, especially in Korea, which has a vibrant crypto market with more than 15 million accounts on local crypto exchanges. The report highlighted that unlike traditional blockchains that process all tasks on a single chain, Avalanche has a network of interconnected, specialized chains. According to Tiger Research analysts, Avalanche's structure and design allow organizations to select and use only the functions they need without having to understand all the technical complexity of the platform. “Avalanche’s key differentiator is its proven track record of delivering success with institutions. From KKR’s healthcare fund tokenization in 2022 to Wyoming’s stablecoin in 2025, these have always been industry-first and highly complex projects.” Tiger Research also highlighted Avalanche's advantages in accuracy, support, security, and cost-effectiveness, noting that over 100 organizations have already adopted and integrated Avalanche. *This is not investment advice.

New data suggest that the crypto asset’s path forward depends on $115,440 support. The reaction around this level will likely determine whether Bitcoin extends its rally or slips into a sharper correction. Lose $115K, Face $93K According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s latest update, BTC’s Pricing Bands reveal the emergence of $115,440 as the most critical support level for the crypto asset. This threshold now serves as the decisive pivot point for the market’s next major move. If Bitcoin manages to hold above it, momentum could build toward the next upside target at $137,300. This is expected to boost bullish conviction further. However, a breakdown below this zone could expose the market to deeper downside pressure, and even bring $93,600 into focus as the next key support. Meanwhile, Swissblock found that the recent short-term volatility in Bitcoin was repricing risk, and not a market breakdown. According to the firm, testing the lower end of Bitcoin’s current range remains within normal volatility expectations and could be the final downside move before the next major leg higher. Two bullish signals have surfaced that support this outlook – rising liquidity and strong network growth. These signals together have historically led to sharp advances. For example, in February 2024, Bitcoin surged 35% in two weeks, while in November 2024, it rallied 40% in three weeks following similar build-ups. Now, the firm noted that Bitcoin is experiencing the strongest and longest build-up of the entire cycle, and is effectively spring-loading the market for a breakout. Within one to three weeks, they expect new all-time highs for Bitcoin, which could be accompanied by upside rotations in Ethereum and altcoins, fueled by sidelined cash ready to re-enter at lower levels. September Seasonal Drag Nearing End? September has historically been challenging for Bitcoin, but conditions appear to be changing. The crypto asset climbed 3% last week. Bitfinex Alpha report also highlighted that the asset is showing signs of forming a stable base. The momentum is visible across the market as evidenced by the surge in the total crypto capitalization, while on-chain buy pressure and Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metrics further point to a strong investor participation, which could position Bitcoin for a potential breakout into Q4.

That future is getting closer, thanks to a significant move by South Korea’s BC Card. The company has filed a patent for a cutting-edge stablecoin payment technology , signaling a bold step towards integrating digital assets into our everyday financial lives. This development isn’t just about accepting cryptocurrencies; it’s about making them practical and reliable for daily use. BC Card’s innovation could truly revolutionize how we think about spending digital money, bringing stability and real-time accuracy to transactions. What is BC Card’s Groundbreaking Stablecoin Payment Technology? At its core, BC Card’s patented system introduces a clever way to handle stablecoin transactions. It focuses on determining the exact amount to deduct from a user’s digital wallet. How does it do this? It reflects real-time market data at the moment a merchant transaction occurs. This ensures that the value of the stablecoin being spent accurately matches the price of goods or services. This real-time adjustment is crucial. It addresses a major concern in the crypto world: price volatility. By tying the deduction to live market conditions, BC Card aims to provide a seamless and fair transaction experience, making stablecoin payment technology a more attractive option for both consumers and businesses. Why is This Stablecoin Payment Technology a Game-Changer for Payments? BC Card’s initiative carries immense potential, especially in a market as tech-forward as South Korea. This move signifies a broader acceptance and integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Here are some key benefits this stablecoin payment technology could bring: Enhanced Stability: Stablecoins, by design, aim to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. Integrating them into payments means less risk of value fluctuations during a transaction. Real-time Accuracy: The system’s ability to reflect real-time market data ensures transparency and fairness for all parties involved. Broader Accessibility: By bridging the gap between digital wallets and traditional payment networks, it opens up stablecoin usage to a wider audience who may not be familiar with complex crypto exchanges. This isn’t just about a new way to pay; it’s about expanding financial inclusion and offering more choices to consumers in the digital age. How Will This Stablecoin Payment Technology Integrate with Existing Systems? BC Card understands that success lies in collaboration and integration. The company has clear plans to build a robust infrastructure by partnering with various entities: Financial Firms: Traditional banks and financial institutions will play a key role in ensuring regulatory compliance and broader adoption. Fintech Companies: Innovative technology firms will help develop and refine the user experience and underlying technical solutions. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs): These crypto-native companies will provide the necessary expertise in handling digital assets securely. The goal is to weave stablecoins into familiar payment methods. Think about using stablecoins through your existing card network or via QR code payments. Leveraging South Korea’s largest merchant network, BC Card aims to make this integration as smooth and widespread as possible, ensuring the stablecoin payment technology becomes a practical reality for millions. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Stablecoin Payment Technology? While the prospects are exciting, implementing such an advanced system comes with its own set of challenges. Regulatory frameworks for stablecoins are still evolving globally, and South Korea is no exception. Ensuring consumer protection, preventing illicit activities, and maintaining financial stability will be paramount. Moreover, user adoption will depend on ease of use and clear communication about the benefits. Educating the public about how stablecoin payment technology works and its advantages over traditional methods will be key to its success. Despite these hurdles, BC Card’s proactive approach signals strong confidence in the future of digital currency payments. A Future Where Digital Payments Are Seamless and Stable BC Card’s patent filing for stablecoin payment technology is more than just a technical innovation; it’s a statement about the future of finance. It represents a commitment to making digital assets a practical, stable, and integrated part of our daily spending habits.

Key Takeaways: GRVT raised $19 million to challenge Hyperliquid with a privacy-first approach backed by ZKsync. The platform uses zero-knowledge tech to hide trade data and protect large positions from manipulation. Alongside privacy, GRVT targets yield-driven growth to attract both active traders and passive investors. The round was led by ZKsync, which contributed $14 million, backing GRVT’s bid to bring institutional-grade privacy to on-chain trading, according to a report by Forbes . While Hyperliquid dominates with a 70% market share and monthly volumes nearing $400 billion, its full-transparency model, where all positions, liquidation levels, and order data are visible, has become a double-edged sword. For Big Traders, On-Chain Transparency Comes at a Cost For large traders moving tens of millions, that visibility creates risks. “We’ve seen those cases where they do get hunted,” said GRVT co-founder and CEO Hong Yea, describing how large positions become targets for manipulation. GRVT’s solution is built on zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography, allowing traders to operate without exposing sensitive data. Using a “validium” chain, GRVT validates transactions without publishing underlying trading details, position size, entry price, or liquidation levels. This shields traders from front-running and “liquidation sniping,” problems institutional players cite as barriers to on-chain activity. The platform’s privacy pitch is already resonating with large traders. “We’ve had multiple whale traders talking to us because of these privacy elements,” said Yea. GRVT also offers incentives like negative maker fees and future token airdrops, aligning with liquidity providers. But GRVT isn’t only selling privacy, it’s pushing a yield-first strategy. The platform offers products such as fixed-yield instruments, tokenized vaults managed by institutional partners like Ampersan, and tokenized versions of yield-generating assets that can double as trading collateral.

GRVT holds regulatory licenses in Bermuda and has integrated with LTP and Coin Routes, signaling clear institutional ambitions. It also secured support from Abu Dhabi-based Further Ventures, whose managing partner called GRVT’s use of ZK “a foundation for institutional-scale markets.” GRVT Faces Uphill Battle as Hyperliquid Expands Its Lead Still, GRVT faces a steep climb. Hyperliquid’s deep liquidity and network effects are powerful, and it’s not standing still—it recently launched vault products and its own stablecoin. Other DEXs are also beginning to experiment with privacy layers and yield strategies, narrowing GRVT’s early-mover advantage. As ZK technology becomes cheaper and more widespread, privacy may become standard rather than standout. Earlier this week, Native Markets secured the USDH ticker for Hyperliquid’s native stablecoin , emerging as the winner in a heated governance vote that drew bids from heavyweights including Paxos and Ethena. The decision, finalized Sunday, followed weeks of speculation and community debate, with Native Markets ultimately pulling ahead after validator commitments and prediction markets heavily favored the team. Ethena, once seen as a top contender, exited the race on Thursday , citing community concerns about its non-native infrastructure.

This uptick isn’t just a number; it’s a significant indicator that the market might be gearing up for some thrilling changes, potentially ushering in a period where alternative cryptocurrencies could shine brighter than Bitcoin. For many investors, this rising index sparks hopes of substantial gains and a dynamic shift in portfolio performance. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a crucial barometer in the cryptocurrency space, designed to give investors a clear picture of market sentiment. It meticulously tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, carefully excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to ensure an accurate representation of genuine market movements. The core of its calculation involves comparing how these selected altcoins have performed against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. An “altcoin season” is officially declared when 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin. Therefore, a reading closer to 100 is considered a strong signal that an altcoin season is in full swing, indicating a broad-based rally among these alternative digital assets. Why Does a 73 on the Altcoin Season Index Matter Now? Reaching 73 on the Altcoin Season Index is a pivotal moment, as it brings us tantalizingly close to the 75% threshold needed to officially declare an altcoin season. This isn’t merely a statistical point; it suggests that a significant majority of altcoins are already outperforming Bitcoin, hinting at a potential market rotation where capital flows from the dominant cryptocurrency into a broader array of digital assets. This movement indicates growing investor confidence and interest in projects beyond Bitcoin, opening up new avenues for diversification and potentially higher returns. It’s a clear signal that the market’s focus might be broadening, offering a diverse landscape for exploration and strategic investment. Unlocking Opportunities: The Benefits of an Altcoin Season When the Altcoin Season Index is on the rise, it typically signifies a period where many altcoins experience rapid price appreciation. This can be a goldmine for investors looking for substantial gains and new growth avenues. Higher Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, can offer exponential returns during an altcoin season, often surpassing Bitcoin’s growth percentages. Portfolio Diversification: Investing in a variety of altcoins can help spread risk and capitalize on different market niches, reducing reliance on a single asset. Innovation Showcase: An altcoin season often highlights emerging technologies and innovative projects within the crypto ecosystem, bringing attention to groundbreaking developments. Navigating the Volatility: Risks and Smart Strategies While the prospect of an altcoin season is exciting, it’s crucial to approach it with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin, and their prices can fluctuate dramatically. This means potential for significant gains, but also for substantial losses if not managed carefully. To navigate this dynamic period successfully, consider these smart strategies: Thorough Research: Always perform your own due diligence (DYOR) on projects, understanding their technology, team, and use case. Diversify Wisely: Don’t put all your eggs in one altcoin basket. Spread your investments across several promising projects. Risk Management: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: Keep track of market news, regulatory changes, and project developments to make timely decisions. Preparing Your Portfolio for a Potential Altcoin Season With the Altcoin Season Index climbing, now is an opportune time to review your crypto holdings and strategize. This period demands proactive engagement and informed decision-making to truly capitalize on the market’s shifts. Here are some actionable insights: Identify Promising Projects: Look for altcoins with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear, real-world use cases that address specific market needs. Consider Market Trends: Focus on sectors like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Layer-2 scaling solutions that show strong momentum and innovation. Set Clear Goals: Define your entry and exit strategies to manage expectations and profits, ensuring you have a plan regardless of market direction. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for the Altcoin Season Index? As the Altcoin Season Index inches closer to the 75-point mark, the anticipation within the crypto community is palpable. While no one can predict the future with certainty, the current trajectory suggests a growing appetite for altcoins, potentially leading to a full-fledged altcoin season. This shift could redefine portfolio strategies for many. Staying vigilant and informed will be key to navigating these exciting times. The crypto market is dynamic, and understanding these indicators can provide a significant edge, helping investors make more informed decisions. The recent rise of the Altcoin Season Index to 73 is a powerful signal that the crypto landscape is evolving, presenting both immense opportunities and important considerations for investors. This indicator provides a valuable lens through which to view the market’s health and potential direction. Whether we officially enter a full altcoin season or not, the current momentum underscores the vibrant innovation and diverse investment potential within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Stay informed, stay strategic, and prepare for what promises to be an exciting chapter in the crypto journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does the Altcoin Season Index measure? The Altcoin Season Index measures the percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. How is an “altcoin season” officially declared? An altcoin season is officially declared when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Is an Altcoin Season Index of 73 good for investors? An index of 73 is highly significant as it’s very close to the 75% threshold, suggesting that a large number of altcoins are already performing well against Bitcoin, indicating potential for further gains. What are the risks of investing during an altcoin season? Key risks include high volatility, potential for significant losses, and the increased presence of less legitimate projects. Thorough research and risk management are crucial. How can I prepare my portfolio for a potential altcoin season? Prepare by researching promising projects, diversifying your investments across different altcoins, setting clear entry and exit strategies, and only investing what you can afford to lose.

Therefore, investors’ fears are alleviated, and the market is likely to rally further in the coming weeks. By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin’s daily chart demonstrates a clear bounce from the $107K demand zone and a rise back above the 100-day moving average, located around the $113K mark. After yesterday’s Fed rate cut, the asset is continuing its path toward the $124K supply zone, which aligns with the current BTC all-time high. The RSI is also trending above the 50% level, indicating that the momentum has now shifted bullish once again. All these signals point to a potential continuation toward the $124K ATH and likely a further rally toward $130K and even higher. The 4-Hour Chart As the 4-hour chart demonstrates, Bitcoin’s recent rally has occurred after the price successfully broke out of a descending channel, following a swift double bottom rebound at the $108K supply zone. The asset has now swept the liquidity pool above the previous $107K high, which can lead to two possible scenarios. The market can either carry on with the uptrend and attack the $124K area once again, or it can pull back at least to the $112K order block, which is the most notable demand zone nearby. Yet, with the RSI still below the overbought region, the price seemingly has more room to grow before a correction occurs. Sentiment Analysis Open Interest This chart displays the Bitcoin aggregate open interest, which shows the number of open perpetual futures positions. Typically, during bullish market conditions, this metric climbs higher or consolidates, as more and more traders are taking leveraged positions. This is exactly what can be seen on the chart. Meanwhile, another interesting observation is that even with the market going through a short-term correction a few weeks ago, the open interest has yet to drop. While this is generally a bullish sign, it also points to the fact that the futures market might still be overheated. Therefore, there is still the probability for a liquidation cascade to happen in the short term, which could cause a flash crash before the market stabilizes again.

The Google-backed protocol by Mysten Labs adds attention as consolidation continues above key support zones. SUI’s TVL holds above $2.1B, with consistent capital inflow and renewed bullish interest from analysts. Price Moves Toward Key Resistance SUI gained 7% in the last 24 hours, reaching $3.83. The trading volume for the same period was over $1.7 billion. Over the past week, the token is up 5%. The price is now testing the top of a downtrend channel that has held since earlier this year. Chart analysis shows that SUI is approaching the upper boundary of the structure. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital said , “SUI is on the cusp of breaking out from this Downtrending Channel (light blue). A breakout would see SUI revisit the old All Time High area.” Notably, the previous high sits near $5.35. SUI has formed a series of higher lows in recent weeks. These moves suggest growing interest from buyers. The top of the channel, near $3.80, is a key area. If the price moves above this level and holds, it may open the way toward higher levels. Source: Rekt Capital/X If the breakout fails, SUI could move back to support near $3.40. Below that, the next range sits between $2.33 and $2.00. This zone acted as a strong base earlier in the year and may do so again if tested. Google Partnership Adds Fuel Recent developments around the SUI network have drawn attention to the project. Google announced its Agents Payments Protocol, built by Mysten Labs, which is the team behind SUI. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe commented, A massive partnership announcement from $SUI as Google has announced the Agents Payments Protocol. This has been built by the Mysten Labs team, the founders of $SUI . $SUI & $WAL are both partners with Google and I think that the ecosystem is ready to do well. Great… pic.twitter.com/BhzMagMudf — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) September 17, 2025 He also noted the current trend, saying there is “great consolidation before a big breakout.” The price has moved within a tight range for several weeks while forming a clear support structure. Platform Usage Remains Strong SUI’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is $2.116 billion as of September 18, 2025, according to DeFiLlama. TVL reached new highs earlier in the summer and has stayed above $2 billion since then. Source: DeFiLlama Net inflows on the most recent day came in at $3,852. While this is a small figure, overall capital in the ecosystem has remained steady. Analyst Kaleo said , “Still believe it’s only a matter of time before we see SUI break out of the range it’s been accumulating in… and make a run for all time highs vs. BTC.” The post SUI Eyes Old ATH After 7% Daily Jump, Is a Big Rally Coming? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Sui,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SUI|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-09-18 12:25:51

The survey , released on September 18, revealed that many Americans feel frustrated with traditional financial institutions and seek greater control over their financial assets and data. Respondents believe DeFi innovations can deliver this change by providing affordability, equity, and consumer protection. The survey was conducted with Ipsos on KnowledgePanel and included supplementary in-depth interviews in the Bronx and Queens between August 18 and 21, polling 1,321 US adults. 1/ [ NEW] DeFi Education Foundation is excited to debut a national study by @Ipsos KnowledgePanel and supplemented by in-depth interviews from the Bronx & Queens, NY, providing timely insights into how Americans view the U.S. financial system & emerging tech, like DeFi! pic.twitter.com/wYzcMGER2V — DeFi Education Fund (@fund_defi) September 18, 2025 Survey Results Show Americans Ready to Adopt DeFi Protocols The findings demonstrate that many Americans are curious about DeFi despite its early stage. 42% of Americans indicated they would likely try DeFi if proposed legislation becomes law (9% extremely/very likely and 33% somewhat likely). 84% said they would use it to “ make purchases online ,” while 78% would use it to “ pay bills .” According to the survey, 77% would use DeFi protocols to “ save money ,” and 12% of Americans are “extremely” and “very” interested in learning about DeFi. Moreover, nearly 4 in 10 Americans believe that DeFi can address high transaction and service fees found in traditional finance (39%). Consistent with other probability-based sample surveys, the Ipsos x DEF research shows that almost 1 in 5 Americans (18%) have owned or used crypto at some point in their lifetime. Nearly a quarter of Americans (22%) said they’re interested in learning more about nontraditional forms of finance, such as blockchain, crypto, or decentralized finance. Source: DEF The research shows that more than half (56%) of Americans want to reclaim control of their finances. Americans are interested in having control over their money at all times, and many seek ways to send or receive money without intermediaries. One Bronx, NY resident shared his experience of needing to transfer money between accounts, but the bank required him to certify the transfer and visit in person because he couldn’t move the amount he needed remotely. He expressed frustration about the situation because “ it was my money… I didn’t understand why I was given a hard time. “ More than half of surveyed Americans agree there should be a way to digitally send money to people without third-party involvement, and this number rises notably for foreign-born Americans (66%). The researchers concluded that Americans are interested in DeFi and believe DeFi can reduce friction points in today’s financial system. Regulatory Developments on DeFi Adoption in the U.S Last month, DeFi Education Fund called on the US Senate Banking Committee to rethink how it plans to regulate the decentralized finance industry after reviewing its recently published discussion draft on a key crypto market-structure bill. The response, signed on behalf of DeFi Education Fund (DEF) members including a16z Crypto, Uniswap Labs, and Paradigm, argued the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 (RFA) bill should be crafted in a more tech-neutral manner. The DeFi Education Fund and Andreeson Horowitz (a16z) are pushing the SEC to create a ""safe harbor"" for blockchain apps. #DeFi #a16z https://t.co/7OCIWRvUgk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 The group also emphasized that crypto developers should be protected from “ inappropriate regulation meant for intermediaries ,” and that self-custody rights for all Americans are “ essential .” The banking committee is now working on the discussion draft to help ensure it builds on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025. The goal is to promote innovation in the $162 billion DeFi industry without compromising consumer protections or financial stability. On September 5, US Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said there was “ nothing to be afraid of ” about crypto payments operating outside the traditional banking system.

Then you’ve likely heard of Pump.fun (PUMP), a platform that has revolutionized how new tokens are launched. In a market teeming with innovation, understanding the future trajectory of projects like PUMP is crucial for any investor. This comprehensive Pump.fun price prediction delves deep into PUMP’s potential, exploring whether it can truly lead Solana’s DeFi boom and what its future might hold between 2025 and 2030. What is Pump.fun and Why Does it Matter for Solana DeFi? Pump.fun is a unique platform built on the Solana blockchain that empowers anyone to launch a new token without needing initial liquidity or coding knowledge. It simplifies the often complex process of creating and distributing cryptocurrencies, primarily focusing on meme coins. The platform operates on a bonding curve mechanism: as more people buy a token, its price increases, and vice versa. If a token reaches a certain market capitalization threshold, it automatically gets listed on Raydium, a major decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, with initial liquidity provided by the platform. This innovative approach has several benefits: Accessibility: Lowers the barrier to entry for token creation, fostering creativity and experimentation. Fair Launch: Prevents ‘rug pulls’ often associated with traditional token launches by ensuring liquidity is locked. Community-Driven: Success is determined by organic community interest and buying pressure. Solana Integration: Leverages Solana’s high throughput and low transaction fees, making the process fast and affordable. The significance of Pump.fun extends beyond just meme coins. By providing a robust and secure launchpad, it contributes to the overall vibrancy and liquidity of the Solana DeFi ecosystem, attracting new users and developers to the network. The Rise of Meme Coins and PUMP’s Role Meme coins have evolved from niche internet jokes into a significant, albeit volatile, segment of the cryptocurrency market. Projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have demonstrated the power of community, virality, and speculative interest. Pump.fun capitalizes on this phenomenon by streamlining the creation of such tokens. Historically, launching a meme coin required technical expertise and significant capital for liquidity provision. Pump.fun changes this narrative by: Democratizing Access: Anyone with a few Solana tokens can launch a new project. Reducing Risk: The bonding curve mechanism and automatic Raydium listing with locked liquidity mitigate some of the common risks for early investors. Fostering Innovation: It encourages rapid iteration and experimentation within the meme coin space, leading to new trends and narratives. The platform’s success is intertwined with the continued popularity of meme coins and the broader growth of the Solana network. As more users flock to Solana for its speed and low costs, platforms like Pump.fun become crucial gateways for new projects and liquidity. Analyzing Factors Influencing Pump.fun Price Prediction Predicting the future price of any cryptocurrency, especially one tied to the volatile meme coin sector, involves analyzing a multitude of factors. For our Pump.fun price prediction , we consider both fundamental and technical aspects: 1. Solana Ecosystem Growth Pump.fun’s success is directly correlated with the health and expansion of the Solana blockchain. As Solana continues to attract developers, dApps, and users, the demand for tools and platforms within its ecosystem will naturally increase. A thriving Solana DeFi sector means more potential users for Pump.fun, more tokens launched, and potentially more value for the PUMP token itself. 2. Meme Coin Market Sentiment The meme coin market is highly speculative and driven by trends, social media hype, and community enthusiasm. A general bullish sentiment in the meme coin space could significantly boost activity on Pump.fun, leading to increased demand for the PUMP token. Conversely, a bear market or regulatory crackdowns on meme coins could have a detrimental effect. 3. Platform Development and Features The Pump.fun team’s ability to innovate and introduce new features will be critical. Enhancements to user experience, additional security measures, or integration with other DeFi protocols could attract more users and strengthen the platform’s value proposition. Continuous development ensures Pump.fun remains competitive as a meme coin launchpad . 4. Tokenomics and Utility of PUMP Crypto The native token of the platform, PUMP crypto , needs strong utility to sustain its value. While Pump.fun currently allows anyone to launch tokens, the introduction of a native token, or a clearer utility for one if it exists or is planned, could significantly impact its long-term price. Potential utilities could include governance, reduced fees for launching, staking rewards, or exclusive access to features. 5. Competition and Regulatory Landscape The crypto space is fiercely competitive. New launchpads and token creation tools emerge regularly. Pump.fun must maintain its competitive edge. Furthermore, the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly for meme coins and decentralized finance, could pose challenges or opportunities. PUMP Crypto Tokenomics and Potential Utility Understanding the tokenomics of PUMP crypto is crucial for any long-term forecast. While Pump.fun primarily focuses on enabling the creation of other tokens, the existence of a native PUMP token or a similar value accrual mechanism is key. If PUMP has a defined token, its supply, distribution, and utility will dictate its intrinsic value. Typical utility functions for platform tokens include: Governance: Allowing token holders to vote on platform developments and proposals. Fee Discounts: Offering reduced fees for token launches or trading on the platform. Staking Rewards: Users staking PUMP tokens could earn a portion of platform fees or newly minted tokens. Exclusive Access: Gaining access to premium features, early access to new launches, or higher allocations. If PUMP crypto successfully integrates these utilities, it creates a demand-side pressure that can positively influence its price. Without clear utility, the token’s value might remain purely speculative, making it more susceptible to market sentiment. Will PUMP Lead Solana’s DeFi Boom? A Deeper Look at its Position The question of whether PUMP can lead Solana’s DeFi boom is complex. While Pump.fun undoubtedly contributes to the vibrancy and accessibility of the Solana ecosystem, ‘leading’ a boom implies a foundational role in the core DeFi infrastructure (lending, borrowing, DEXs, stablecoins). Pump.fun’s strength lies in its ability to onboard new projects and users, acting as a crucial entry point for innovation. Here’s how PUMP’s position can be viewed: Catalyst for Innovation: By making token creation easy, Pump.fun fosters a rapid iteration cycle for new projects, some of which may evolve into significant DeFi protocols. Liquidity Provider: The automatic listing on Raydium with locked liquidity adds to Solana’s overall liquidity, benefiting the entire ecosystem. User Acquisition: It brings new users to Solana who might not otherwise engage with the blockchain, introducing them to its speed and low costs. Brand Recognition: A successful meme coin launchpad like Pump.fun enhances Solana’s reputation as an innovative and developer-friendly blockchain. While PUMP might not directly lead in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) in traditional DeFi protocols, its role as an enabler and incubator for new projects makes it a significant player in Solana’s overall growth narrative. Its impact is more indirect but equally vital, fueling the grassroots expansion of the ecosystem. PUMP Token Forecast 2025-2030: A Multi-Year Outlook Projecting cryptocurrency prices several years into the future involves significant uncertainty. However, by considering the factors discussed, we can formulate a plausible PUMP token forecast . PUMP Price Prediction 2025 By 2025, we anticipate continued growth for Solana and increased adoption of platforms like Pump.fun. If the broader crypto market experiences a bullish trend, and Pump.fun continues to innovate, PUMP could see substantial gains. We might see new features, expanded utility for the PUMP token, and increased institutional interest in the Solana ecosystem. The price could reach a moderate high, potentially establishing a new baseline. PUMP Price Prediction 2026 The year 2026 might bring a period of consolidation or further growth, depending on the overall market cycle. If Pump.fun successfully integrates more advanced features or forms strategic partnerships, its value proposition will strengthen. However, increased competition in the launchpad space could also temper growth. Expect a more stable, yet potentially upward, trajectory if the platform executes its roadmap effectively. PUMP Price Prediction 2027 As the crypto market matures, regulatory clarity might emerge, impacting projects like Pump.fun. If regulations are favorable or provide clear guidelines, it could attract more mainstream users and developers. By 2027, Pump.fun could be a well-established name in the Solana ecosystem, with its token reflecting its utility and market share. Price could continue its upward trend, albeit with expected market volatility. PUMP Price Prediction 2028-2030 Looking further out to 2028-2030, the long-term viability of PUMP will depend on its ability to adapt to technological advancements, maintain its user base, and innovate beyond just meme coins. If Pump.fun evolves into a comprehensive launchpad for various token types, or if the PUMP token gains significant governance power and staking rewards, its value could appreciate considerably. However, sustained growth requires continuous development and a strong community. In a highly bullish scenario, with Solana becoming a dominant blockchain, PUMP could achieve remarkable price levels. Conversely, a failure to adapt or intense competition could lead to stagnation. Plausible PUMP Token Forecast Table (Illustrative) Year Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) Key Factors 2025 0.005 0.012 0.025 Bull market continuation, Solana ecosystem growth, PUMP feature expansion. 2026 0.008 0.018 0.035 Platform maturation, moderate competition, PUMP token utility. 2027 0.015 0.028 0.050 Regulatory clarity, increased mainstream adoption of Solana, strong community. 2028 0.020 0.040 0.070 Technological advancements, Pump.fun diversification, sustained DeFi growth. 2029 0.030 0.055 0.095 Mass adoption trends, strong PUMP ecosystem, innovative partnerships. 2030 0.040 0.075 0.150 Solana dominance, PUMP as a premier launchpad, widespread crypto adoption. Disclaimer: These predictions are speculative and based on current market trends and potential developments. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and actual prices may vary significantly. Investors should conduct their own research and consider professional financial advice. Challenges and Risks for PUMP Crypto Despite its innovative approach, Pump.fun and its associated PUMP crypto face several challenges: Market Volatility: Meme coins are inherently volatile. A downturn in the broader crypto market or a loss of interest in meme coins could severely impact PUMP. Competition: The launchpad sector is competitive. New platforms with better features or stronger marketing could emerge, drawing users away from Pump.fun. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, especially decentralized platforms and meme tokens. Adverse regulations could limit growth or even pose existential threats. Scalability Issues: While Solana is fast, a massive influx of users and token launches could still test its limits, potentially leading to congestion or increased fees. Security Risks: Despite measures to prevent rug pulls, smart contract vulnerabilities or other security exploits could undermine trust in the platform. Investors must weigh these risks against the potential rewards before making any investment decisions related to PUMP. Actionable Insights for Potential PUMP Investors For those considering an investment in PUMP or closely watching its development, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Solana’s Health: Since PUMP is deeply integrated with Solana, keep a close eye on Solana’s network activity, TVL, and overall ecosystem growth. A robust Solana is good for PUMP. Track Meme Coin Trends: Understand the cycles and sentiment within the meme coin market. Periods of high enthusiasm for meme coins often translate to increased activity on platforms like Pump.fun. Research Platform Updates: Stay informed about any new features, partnerships, or utility developments for the PUMP token. These can be significant price drivers. Assess Competition: Keep an eye on other token launchpads, especially those on Solana. Understand their offerings and how Pump.fun maintains its competitive edge. Risk Management: Due to the speculative nature of meme coins and new launchpads, allocate only a small portion of your portfolio that you are comfortable losing. Diversification is key. Community Engagement: A strong and active community is vital for projects like Pump.fun. Engage with the community to gauge sentiment and future direction. Conclusion: Will PUMP Cement its Place in Solana’s Future? Pump.fun has carved a significant niche for itself within the Solana ecosystem, revolutionizing the meme coin launchpad space. By democratizing token creation and providing a safer environment for new projects, it has undoubtedly become a key contributor to Solana’s vibrant DeFi landscape. Our Pump.fun price prediction for 2025-2030 suggests a path of potential growth, contingent on sustained innovation, favorable market conditions, and effective risk management. While PUMP may not lead Solana’s DeFi boom in the traditional sense of TVL, its role as a powerful engine for grassroots innovation and user acquisition cannot be overstated. Its ability to onboard countless new projects and users directly fuels the network’s expansion. The future of PUMP crypto hinges on its continuous evolution, its capacity to introduce compelling utility for its token, and its resilience against market volatility and competition. For investors, PUMP represents an intriguing, albeit high-risk, opportunity within the dynamic and ever-evolving world of Solana DeFi.

51927608,583956,1758202259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51927608.jpeg,Laos Eyes Bitcoin Mining To Tackle Mounting Debt,https://bitcoinist.com/laos-bitcoin-mining-tackle-mounting-debt/,"Laos is exploring a new way to service the debts from its decades-long hydropower build-out: turning excess electricity into Bitcoin. In a report published on September 17, the South China Morning Post framed the pivot bluntly: “Saddled with debt and surplus electricity, the ‘battery of Southeast Asia’ is eyeing energy-intensive crypto mining to turn a profit.” The article situates the move within a dam-driven development model that has left Laos with power it cannot always sell and a mounting repayment schedule. Why Laos Eyes Bitcoin Mining The policy logic is straightforward. Bitcoin mining converts electrons into a globally liquid asset and can be sited directly at hydropower plants, mitigating transmission bottlenecks and absorbing seasonal surpluses. Laos has promoted electricity exports for years—SCMP notes power accounted for roughly a quarter of the country’s exports last year—yet export deals and grids do not always line up with generation, exacerbating revenue-timing mismatches against hard-currency debt obligations from dam construction. According to SCMP “environmental campaigners view the turn to crypto as symptomatic of a flawed energy policy that has left Laos indebted and unable to offload its surplus power.” The Chinese news report cites Witoon Permpongsacharoen, director of the Mekong Energy and Ecology Network: “Laos allowing electricity to be used for cryptocurrency mining is clearly not something driven by internal conditions. It stems from the fact that Laos is heavily indebted and unable to pay off its debts.” If implemented, this would not be Laos’s first embrace of digital-asset mining. In September 2021, the government launched a pilot program authorizing six firms to mine and trade Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies under regulated power-purchase terms, a move widely read as an attempt to capture miners displaced by China’s crackdown . However, the stance has seesawed amid hydrological stress and grid constraints: in August 2023, the state utility Électricité du Laos (EDL) halted electricity supply to Bitcoin miners citing drought and power shortages; by May 2024, Reuters reported crypto data centers made up “over a third of the country’s power” consumption and contributed to outages, prompting authorities to stop approving new operations even as they weighed proposals to stabilize supply. The fiscal backdrop helps explain the renewed interest. External public debt service is projected by the World Bank to average about $1.3 billion per year over 2025–2028—around 9% of GDP annually—keeping gross financing needs elevated as key hydropower assets are still ramping. Separate reporting this year underscored the strain: a Chinese dam operator initiated a $555 million arbitration against EDL for alleged unpaid dues, highlighting the financial pressures on the state power sector. Yet the “surplus power” narrative is not uniform. Hydropower output is volatile, impacted by erratic rainfall and a warming climate, while export pipelines remain politically and commercially complex. Laos produces surplus electricity in the wet season but must import power from neighboring countries during the dry months. These structural frictions are precisely the niches where mobile, interruptible loads like Bitcoin mines can monetize stranded energy—until the water runs low. Analysts who champion “wasted renewables” see a broader pattern. “Bhutan, Ethiopia, and now Laos use Bitcoin mining to monetize wasted renewable energy,” Bitcoin climate activist Daniel Batten wrote via X as coverage of the SCMP story circulated, casting the strategy as part of a 2025 “vibe shift.” Bhutan has openly leaned into hydro-powered mining this year, calling bitcoin “a strategic battery” to arbitrage seasonal surpluses and fund development; Ethiopia’s power utility has said it generated about $55 million over 10 months by selling surplus hydro to miners. Laos’s plan would slot into that template, albeit with more fragile hydrology and balance-sheet constraints.

While it was stated that the approval of these rules would pave the way for the approval of ETFs pending before the SEC, the expected approval from the SEC has come. Accordingly, the SEC approved general listing standards for commodity-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This approval is also critical for altcoins awaiting approval from the SEC. For the SEC to approve, altcoins applying for a spot ETF will need to be traded on an authorized futures market for at least six months. At this point, when the SEC first published these rules, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that all altcoins that have been traded on the derivatives exchange of Coinbase, the largest US exchange, for more than six months would be eligible for a spot ETF. Balchunas listed the altcoins that meet this requirement and are currently traded on the Coinbase futures platform as follows: “Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot (DOT), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), Cardano (ADA), and XRP.” Related News: SEC Announces New Rules for Altcoin ETFs! Which Altcoins Can Be Approved? Here's the List! Eric Balchunas stated that the adoption of general listing standards following the SEC's approval could trigger a wave of approvals in the crypto ETP market. He noted that the number of ETFs approved by the SEC doubled the last time it implemented a similar standard, and predicted that more than 100 crypto ETFs could launch in the next 12 months. *This is not investment advice.

The Nasdaq-listed firm announced on Thursday that it had purchased about 7.5 million Dogecoin tokens at a weighted average price of $0.2665, marking its first open-market DOGE acquisition. Thumzup Media Corporation is significantly increasing its focus on Dogecoin, most recently acquiring 7.5 million Doge for $2 million after plans were announced to acquire DogeHash, a Dogecoin mining operation with 2,500 rigs. pic.twitter.com/UtJiPJm8vq — KrissPax (@krisspax) September 18, 2025 The move comes as Thumzup prepares to expand into large-scale Dogecoin mining through its pending acquisition of Dogehash Technologies. Thumzup Deepens Digital Asset Pivot With Dogecoin Mining and Treasury Strategy Despite the announcement, shares of Thumzup closed down 7.7% at $4.61 on Wednesday. The stock recovered about 4.5% in after-hours trading following the filing. The price of Dogecoin, meanwhile, rose 5.4% to $0.28, according to CoinGecko. Source: Google Finance Thumzup’s pivot toward Dogecoin has accelerated in recent months. Earlier this month, the company revealed plans to deploy 3,500 mining rigs by the end of the year , following its agreement to acquire Dogehash. Dogehash currently operates around 2,500 Scrypt ASIC miners across North America, focused on producing Dogecoin and Litecoin, with another 1,000 rigs expected later in 2025. Trump-linked Thumzup is acquiring Dogehash, a Dogecoin mining operation, with plans to list as Dogehash Technologies Holdings. #Thumzup #Dogecoin https://t.co/qfqYdP8aOt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 20, 2025 Pending shareholder approval, the deal will see Dogehash shareholders swap their holdings for 30.7 million Thumzup shares, after which the merged entity will rebrand as Dogehash Technologies Holdings and trade under the ticker XDOG. To support its expansion, Thumzup has also strengthened its leadership. This week it appointed Jordan Jefferson , CEO and co-founder of DogeOS and head of the Dogecoin wallet MyDoge, to its Crypto Advisory Board, alongside DogeOS executive Alex Hoffman. Jefferson, whose DogeOS platform is backed by Polychain Capital, has been active in Bitcoin and blockchain development since 2011. He said Thumzup’s strategy of deploying its DOGE holdings into the ecosystem rather than simply storing them could help strengthen the Dogecoin economy. The company’s chief executive, Robert Steele, said Jefferson’s appointment shows Thumzup’s commitment to expanding its role in digital assets, citing his leadership in building applications that increase the utility of Dogecoin. Thumzup has rapidly reshaped itself from a social media marketing firm into a crypto-focused company. Founded in 2020 and based in Los Angeles, the firm originally operated a platform that rewarded users with cash for promoting branded content on social media. In January, it launched a crypto treasury with a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and has since diversified its holdings. By July, its board authorized the company to hold up to $250 million worth of cryptocurrencies , including Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and USDC. @thumz_up , with @DonaldJTrumpJr as an investor, has received board approval to hold up to $250 million in cryptocurrencies. #Trump #Crypto https://t.co/7Y5TnS5RL9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 In August, Thumzup raised $50 million in a stock offering priced at $10 per share , with proceeds directed toward crypto mining infrastructure and targeted blockchain investments. The company reported holding 19.1 BTC as of mid-year and said it intends to diversify further into major tokens. Thumzup’s investor base also drew attention in July when it was revealed that Donald Trump Jr., son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, owns 350,000 shares of the company . Notably, the stake was acquired on the advice of an investment adviser, and Trump Jr. holds no role in management or operations. Dogecoin Climbs Ahead of First-Ever US ETF Launch Dogecoin traded at $0.28 on Thursday, recovering 12% from a local low of $0.25 earlier this week. The token remains nearly 62% below its all-time high of $0.7316, reached in May 2021. The rebound comes as the first Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) prepares to launch in the United States. The REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF debuts Thursday, becoming the first regulated product dedicated to a memecoin. Launching Tomorrow: REX-Osprey XRP ETF, $XRPR , & REX-Osprey DOGE ETF, $DOJE .

Analysts say the ETF could channel institutional capital into the Dogecoin market while granting broader legitimacy to an asset once considered a novelty. “The first ever DOGE ETF is launching tomorrow,” ETF Store president Nate Geraci wrote on X, predicting “wild” months ahead. Influencer SMC Kapil DEV called the debut a milestone for Wall Street, adding that Dogecoin is shifting “from a memecoin to a mainstream asset.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also reviewing applications for spot DOGE ETFs , including Grayscale’s proposal to convert its Dogecoin Trust. A decision on that filing is expected by mid-October. Betting platform Polymarket shows traders assigning a 98% chance of approval for a spot DOGE ETF in 2025. Technical indicators back the optimism. Chart data shows Dogecoin broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern in early September, rallying toward $0.30. Immediate resistance sits at $0.30–$0.35, with support near $0.26–$0.25. Source: X/Scofield Analysts say holding above that range could pave the way for a push toward $0.35–$0.40, while a breakdown below $0.25 would invalidate the bullish trend.

Secondo i report , se approvata, la proposta segnerebbe uno dei primi prodotti statunitensi a tracciare direttamente entrambi i settori sotto un unico veicolo finanziario. Due Comparti, Peso Uguale Il report descrive un prodotto suddiviso in due parti uguali . Una metà detenuta in azioni di società quotate coinvolte in stablecoin o tokenizzazione (emittenti, società di pagamenti o exchange ). L’altra metà con esposizione ad asset digitali tramite prodotti regolamentati scambiati in borsa, coprendo Bitcoin , Ethereum , oracoli e infrastrutture blockchain. Sono previsti dei limiti nella struttura: Nessuna singola posizione crypto potrà pesare oltre il 22,5% del comparto dedicato agli asset digitali. Sul lato azionario, le aziende verranno classificate in base al grado di coinvolgimento in stablecoin o tokenizzazione, con un tetto massimo per ogni livello per evitare eccessiva concentrazione. Cambiamento normativo apre la strada Questa mossa segue l’approvazione del GENIUS Act a luglio 2025, una legge che ha introdotto maggiore chiarezza sulle regole per le stablecoin. Tale normativa viene accreditata come il catalizzatore che ha aperto la strada a fondi come quello di Bitwise, che potrebbe debuttare sul mercato già a novembre 2025 , se riceverà l’approvazione.

In his view, multiple structural shifts in finance, regulation, and technology are aligning simultaneously, positioning XRP at the center of institutional adoption . Pumpius presented the information as a map of interlinked events and frameworks rather than speculation, indicating regulatory clarity, banking integration, stablecoin infrastructure, settlement systems, and broader policy momentum. The XRP Endgame: Everything Is Aligning at Once What I’m about to lay out isn’t hype, it’s a map of tectonic shifts converging around Ripple & $XRP . If you don’t see the magnitude after this thread, you’re not paying attention. pic.twitter.com/FZRCjDd0Re — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 16, 2025 DTCC Patent and Settlement Systems One of the central elements of Pumpius’ argument is a patent filed by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest settlement utility. He emphasized that the DTCC processes between $2 trillion and $4 quadrillion in annual settlements and that the patent explicitly references XRP in its liquidity tokenization design. Pumpius stated that this highlights how Ripple’s infrastructure has been incorporated into blueprints for future settlement rails, indicating a potential alignment between XRP and global clearing operations. Regulatory and Legal Clarity According to Pumpius, XRP holds a unique legal status in the United States after Ripple’s multi-year legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He underscored that the case outcome granted XRP legal clarity , which he argued places it ahead of other digital assets that continue to face lawsuits and regulatory ambiguity. In his assessment, this positions XRP as a safe option for institutional entities seeking to enter digital asset markets without exposure to uncertain regulatory risk. Pumpius also highlighted Ripple’s launch of RLUSD , its enterprise-grade U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. He noted that reserves for RLUSD are held at BNY Mellon, a custodian managing over $53 trillion in assets and widely recognized as a key partner for institutions such as BlackRock and the U.S. Treasury. He described this connection as providing XRP with a strong reserve-backed liquidity layer, enhancing Ripple’s settlement infrastructure through the integration of a stable value asset. Banking Ambitions and Federal Reserve Access In the thread, Pumpius drew attention to Ripple’s application for a New York banking charter , describing it as one of the most challenging licenses to obtain. He linked this to Ripple’s existing Money Services Business and Electronic Money Institution licenses, framing the company’s trajectory as one moving toward full-scale global banking capabilities. He further noted that Ripple has applied for access to a Federal Reserve Master Account, which would provide direct access to the U.S. settlement system. According to Pumpius, such access would elevate Ripple and XRP beyond competition with banks to a position of direct integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Investment Pathways Pumpius stated that nearly 20 spot XRP exchange-traded funds have been filed. He described approval of such products as an event that could open pathways for institutional capital to enter the market at scale. In his view, this would shift XRP from being perceived as an undervalued altcoin to becoming an asset class that Wall Street could adopt. The thread also noted that by November, global banking institutions must comply with ISO 20022 messaging standards. Pumpius pointed out that XRP has been compliant for years, meaning its infrastructure is already aligned with the migration. He suggested that this transition will enable RippleNet’s systems to integrate more seamlessly with legacy financial messaging frameworks. Policy Environment and Legislative Alignment Pumpius highlighted what he described as a favorable political and regulatory environment in the United States, with measures such as the Clarity Act, Genius Act, and Blockchain Act advancing. He noted that for the first time, policy appears to be aligning with Ripple’s operational strategy, reinforcing the wider convergence of developments he outlined.

This isn’t just another corporate buyout; it’s a strategic investment in the very fabric of how software is built. The Atlassian acquisition of DX, a pioneering developer productivity platform, for a staggering $1 billion, signals a profound commitment to optimizing engineering workflows and understanding the true pulse of development teams. For those invested in the efficiency and scalability of digital ecosystems, this development underscores the growing importance of robust tooling at every layer. Unpacking the Monumental Atlassian Acquisition : A Billion-Dollar Bet on Developer Efficiency On a recent Thursday, Atlassian officially announced its agreement to acquire DX for $1 billion, a sum comprising both cash and restricted stock. This substantial investment highlights Atlassian’s belief in the critical role of developer insights in today’s fast-paced tech landscape. For years, Atlassian has been synonymous with collaboration and project management tools, powering teams worldwide with products like Jira, Confluence, and Trello. However, recognizing a growing need, the company has now decisively moved to integrate a dedicated developer productivity insight platform into its formidable product suite. This acquisition isn’t merely about expanding market share; it’s about deepening Atlassian’s value proposition by providing comprehensive visibility into the health and efficiency of engineering operations. The strategic rationale behind this billion-dollar move is multifaceted. Atlassian co-founder and CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes shared with Bitcoin World that after a three-year attempt to build an in-house developer productivity insight tool, his Sydney-based company realized the immense value of an external, existing solution. This candid admission speaks volumes about the complexity and specialized nature of developer productivity measurement. DX emerged as the natural choice, not least because an impressive 90% of DX’s existing customers were already leveraging Atlassian’s project management and collaboration tools. This pre-existing synergy promises a smoother integration and immediate value for a significant portion of the combined customer base. What is the DX Platform and Why is it a Game-Changer? At its core, DX is designed to empower enterprises by providing deep analytics into how productive their engineering teams truly are. More importantly, it helps identify and unblock bottlenecks that can significantly slow down development cycles. Launched five years ago by Abi Noda and Greyson Junggren, DX emerged from a fundamental challenge: the lack of accurate and non-intrusive metrics to understand developer friction. Abi Noda, in a 2022 interview with Bitcoin World, articulated his founding vision: to move beyond superficial metrics that often failed to capture the full picture of engineering challenges. His experience as a product manager at GitHub revealed that traditional measures often felt like surveillance rather than support, leading to skewed perceptions of productivity. DX was built on a different philosophy, focusing on qualitative and quantitative insights that truly reflect what hinders teams, without making developers feel scrutinized. Noda noted, “The assumptions we had about what we needed to help ship products faster were quite different than what the teams and developers were saying was getting in their way.” Since emerging from stealth in 2022, the DX platform has demonstrated remarkable growth, tripling its customer base every year. It now serves over 350 enterprise customers, including industry giants like ADP, Adyen, and GitHub. What makes DX’s success even more impressive is its lean operational model; the company achieved this rapid expansion while raising less than $5 million in venture funding. This efficiency underscores the inherent value and strong market demand for its solution, making it an exceptionally attractive target for Atlassian. Boosting Developer Productivity : Atlassian’s Strategic Vision The acquisition of DX is a clear signal of Atlassian’s strategic intent to not just manage tasks, but to optimize the entire software development lifecycle. By integrating DX’s capabilities, Atlassian aims to offer an end-to-end “flywheel” for engineering teams. This means providing tools that not only facilitate collaboration and project tracking but also offer actionable insights into where processes are breaking down and how they can be improved. Mike Cannon-Brookes elaborated on this synergy, stating, “DX has done an amazing job [of] understanding the qualitative and quantitative aspects of developer productivity and turning that into actions that can improve those companies and give them insights and comparisons to others in their industry, others at their size, etc.” This capability to benchmark and identify specific areas for improvement is invaluable for organizations striving for continuous enhancement. Abi Noda echoed this sentiment, telling Bitcoin World that the combined entities are “better together than apart.” He emphasized how Atlassian’s extensive suite of tools complements the data and information gathered by DX. “We are able to provide customers with that full flywheel to get the data and understand where we are unhealthy,” Noda explained. “They can plug in Atlassian’s tools and solutions to go address those bottlenecks. An end-to-end flywheel that is ultimately what customers want.” This integration promises to create a seamless experience, allowing teams to move from identifying an issue to implementing a solution within a unified ecosystem. The Intersection of Enterprise Software and Emerging Tech Trends This landmark acquisition also highlights a significant trend in the broader enterprise software landscape: a shift towards more intelligent, data-driven solutions that directly impact operational efficiency and competitive advantage. As companies continue to invest heavily in digital transformation, the ability to measure and optimize the output of their most valuable asset — their engineering talent — becomes paramount. DX’s impressive roster of over 350 enterprise customers, including some of the largest and most technologically advanced organizations, is a testament to the universal need for such a platform. These companies recognize that merely tracking tasks isn’t enough; they need to understand the underlying dynamics of their engineering teams to truly unlock their potential. The integration of DX into Atlassian’s ecosystem will likely set a new standard for what enterprise software can offer, pushing competitors to enhance their own productivity insights. Moreover, this move by Atlassian, a global leader in enterprise collaboration, underscores a broader investment thesis in foundational tooling. Just as robust blockchain infrastructure is critical for the future of decentralized finance, powerful and insightful developer tools are essential for the evolution of all software, including the complex applications underpinning Web3. The success of companies like DX, which scale without massive external funding, also resonates with the lean, efficient ethos often celebrated in the crypto space. Navigating the Era of AI Tools : Measuring Impact and ROI Perhaps one of the most compelling aspects of this acquisition, as highlighted by Atlassian’s CEO, is its timely relevance in the era of rapidly advancing AI tools . Mike Cannon-Brookes noted that the rise of AI has created a new imperative for companies to measure its usage and effectiveness. “You suddenly have these budgets that are going up. Is that a good thing? Is that not a good thing? Am I spending the money in the right ways? It’s really, really important and critical.” With AI-powered coding assistants and other generative AI solutions becoming increasingly prevalent in development workflows, organizations are grappling with how to quantify the return on investment (ROI) of these new technologies. DX’s platform can provide the necessary insights to understand if AI tools are genuinely boosting productivity, reducing bottlenecks, or simply adding to complexity. By offering clear data on how AI impacts developer efficiency, DX will help enterprises make smarter, data-driven decisions about their AI investments. This foresight positions Atlassian not just as a provider of developer tools, but as a strategic partner in navigating the complexities of modern software development, particularly as AI integrates more deeply into every facet of the engineering process. It’s about empowering organizations to leverage AI effectively, ensuring that these powerful new tools translate into tangible improvements in output and innovation. The Atlassian acquisition of DX represents a significant milestone for both companies and the broader tech industry. It’s a testament to the growing recognition that developer productivity is not just a buzzword, but a measurable and critical factor in an organization’s success. By combining DX’s powerful insights with Atlassian’s extensive suite of collaboration and project management tools, the merged entity is poised to offer an unparalleled, end-to-end solution for optimizing software development. This strategic move, valued at a billion dollars, underscores Atlassian’s commitment to innovation and its vision for a future where engineering teams are not only efficient but also deeply understood and supported, paving the way for a more productive and insightful era in enterprise software.

Mallers said he is confident that Bitcoin can achieve great success, saying that the digital coin is approaching a savings market valued at an unbelievable $400 to $500 trillion, the market that used to be dominated by equities, real estate, and precious metals. According to Mallers, global wealth held across various assets amounts to approximately $900 trillion, with nearly half of it used as a savings mechanism. As more families, investors, and institutions turn to Bitcoin for wealth preservation and protection against inflation, he believes the cryptocurrency could gain a larger portion of this market. “Right now, Bitcoin represents just $2 trillion. In terms of purchasing power, the growth potential is staggering, 100 to 200 times from here,” Mallers explained Mallers’ optimistic forecast comes at a time when Bitcoin is experiencing a strong upward trend in price. At press time, Bitcoin fluctuated between $116,340 and $117,156, showing a steady 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. This surge also follows the Federal Reserve’s first rate cut of the year, reducing its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 4-4.25%. This shift in macroeconomic policy has injected further fuel into Bitcoin’s rally. Bitcoin Price.

The company with the support of such large institutional participants as Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank has become one of the rare who amassed Bitcoin with their own approach. Since its launch, Twenty One Capital has secured a remarkable 43,514 BTC, surpassing its initial target by about 1,500 BTC. At current market prices, this Bitcoin stash is valued at approximately $5.04 billion. Twenty One Capital has chosen a more conservative course of action, unlike that of Michael Saylor who accumulated substantial debt just to buy Bitcoin. This approach will enable the company to be flexible whenever the market changes, so that it can avoid the market volatility usually experienced by Bitcoin investments. Following a committed strategy, Mallers and Twenty One Capital are establishing themselves as a powerhouse in the Bitcoin treasury reserve market.

A conservative estimate might place UNI between $15 and $25 , while more optimistic scenarios, driven by strong market momentum and successful protocol upgrades, could see it challenging its previous all-time highs, potentially reaching $30 to $45 . This makes UNI a potentially attractive UNI investment for those with a mid-term horizon. Uniswap Price Prediction 2026: Sustained Growth or Consolidation? Moving into 2026, the crypto market might experience a period of consolidation after a potential 2025 bull run. However, Uniswap’s fundamental utility and continued development could help it maintain strength. Considerations for 2026: Market Maturation: The overall crypto market might show signs of greater maturity, with less extreme volatility and more stable growth. DeFi Dominance: Uniswap’s continued dominance in the DEX sector will be crucial. Its ability to fend off competitors and innovate will determine its trajectory. Regulatory Clarity: By 2026, there might be clearer regulatory frameworks for DeFi, which could either provide stability or impose restrictions. For 2026, the Uniswap price prediction could see UNI trading in a range of $20 to $35 , depending on market conditions. If the broader market remains strong, and Uniswap continues to innovate, it could push towards the upper end of this range or even exceed it. Conversely, a bear market could see it retract. This period will be critical for assessing the long-term viability of DeFi tokens . Uniswap Price Prediction 2027-2030: Long-Term Vision for the Uniswap Future Predicting prices several years out is inherently challenging due to the rapidly evolving nature of the crypto space. However, we can analyze the long-term potential of Uniswap based on its foundational strengths and the future of decentralized finance. Long-Term Drivers: Mainstream DeFi Adoption: As DeFi becomes more integrated into traditional finance and everyday use, Uniswap, as a leading DEX, stands to benefit immensely. Technological Advancements: Continuous improvements in blockchain technology, scalability, and cross-chain interoperability will enhance Uniswap’s reach and efficiency. Governance and Community: The strength of the UNI governance model and its active community will be vital for its adaptability and sustained relevance. For 2027, a reasonable Uniswap price prediction could see UNI in the range of $30 to $50 , potentially surpassing its previous all-time high if market conditions are favorable and significant upgrades are delivered. As we look towards 2028, 2029, and 2030, the potential for UNI could be substantial. Some optimistic crypto predictions suggest UNI could reach $70 to $100+ by 2030, assuming widespread DeFi adoption, successful scaling solutions, and Uniswap maintaining its leadership position. This long-term outlook paints a compelling picture for the Uniswap future , positioning it as a potentially lucrative UNI investment . However, it’s also important to consider potential headwinds such as increased regulatory pressure, significant competition, or unforeseen technological disruptions that could temper these ambitious targets.

However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $4,800 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $33,171 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000?

This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $49,492 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $49,492 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

XRP is showing signs of mounting bullish pressure as it consolidates in a tight range between $2.90 and $3.13, according to market analyst DavidTheBuilder. The cryptocurrency’s price action comes in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, the first reduction since December, a move that could provide short-term support for risk assets. The analyst believes that XRP’s inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is signaling bullish reversal with a breakout above $3.13 being the stepping stone toward unleashing stronger upward momentum. DavidTheBuilder added, “From my perspective, an XRP daily close above $3.13 would be a strong signal. I’m watching that level closely. If it clears, I see $3.30–$3.40 as the next logical targets, with $3.80 still in play long-term. But if bulls lose $2.90, I’d expect a quick retest of $2.75 support before any further upside.” At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $3.12, according to CoinGecko data . The Fed’s 25bps rate cut signals a more accommodative stance, typically fueling risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. For XRP, this may attract increased trader inflows seeking higher returns amid lower traditional yields amid a German analyst predicting that a new all-time high (ATH) of $3.90 might happen soon. REX-Osprey Debuts First U.S.-Listed ETFs Offering Direct Exposure to Dogecoin and XRP In a landmark move for the cryptocurrency investment landscape, REX-Osprey™, the strategic partnership between REX Shares and Osprey Funds, has officially launched the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) providing spot exposure to Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple’s XRP. The REX-Osprey DOGE ETF under the tag DOJE and REX-Osprey XRP ETF labelled as XRPR mark a significant milestone, offering investors a regulated and accessible way to participate directly in the performance of these high-profile digital assets. Notably, XRPR offers direct exposure to spot XRP, a top digital asset powering fast, low-cost cross-border payments. The fund primarily holds spot XRP, with the remainder in XRP-backed ETFs, giving investors streamlined ETF access to a crypto asset with real-world payment utility. On the other hand, DOJE is the first-ever Dogecoin ETF, providing direct spot exposure to one of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies, famed for its Shiba Inu mascot and vibrant global community. By offering DOGE within a regulated 1940 Act fund, REX-Osprey opens seamless access to digital assets through traditional brokerage accounts, pioneering first-to-market spot cryptocurrency exposure for investors. Unlike traditional ETFs tied to futures, these spot-based funds hold DOGE and XRP directly, letting investors track real-time prices. They provide U.S. investors with a transparent, regulated way to access cryptocurrencies without managing wallets or exchanges. This launch taps into growing investor interest in secure, liquid crypto exposure. Dogecoin has evolved from a meme token into a widely adopted digital currency for payments and tipping, while XRP remains a key player in cross-border payments, offering investors a digital asset with real-world financial utility. Therefore, the roll out of REX-Osprey’s DOGE (DOJE) and XRP (XRPR) ETFs marks the U.S. debut of regulated, spot-based crypto ETFs, providing investors a new, accessible way to diversify portfolios and participate in the fast-growing digital asset market. Conclusion The launch of REX-Osprey DOGE and XRP ETFs marks a milestone for U.S. investors, blending regulatory oversight with direct cryptocurrency exposure. These spot-based ETFs offer a simple, secure, and liquid way to access leading digital assets, enabling broader participation, portfolio diversification, and engagement with top cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, XRP is at a critical juncture, as technical signals and the Fed’s rate cut set the stage for bullish momentum.

The Bhutanese government is actively engaged in significant Bhutan Bitcoin sales , a move that signals a strategic shift in its digital asset management. This is a story that impacts not just Bhutan, but potentially the broader crypto market. What’s Behind the Recent Bhutan Bitcoin Sales? Just recently, an address linked to the government of Bhutan made headlines by transferring a substantial amount of Bitcoin. Specifically, 570 BTC, valued at approximately $66.85 million, was moved to a new address. This transaction, reported by Lookonchain, occurred only a few hours after an earlier transfer of 343.1 BTC, worth about $40.18 million. Significant Transfers: Two major transactions totaling over $100 million in Bitcoin. Continuous Activity: These moves are part of a continuous pattern of the Bhutanese government selling its BTC holdings. Transparency: On-chain data provides clear evidence of these substantial transfers. These recent Bhutan Bitcoin sales highlight a consistent strategy. It’s not a one-off event, but rather an ongoing process that merits closer examination. Understanding Bhutan’s Unique Crypto Journey Bhutan, a small Himalayan nation known for its Gross National Happiness index, has quietly been involved in the cryptocurrency space for some time. Reports have suggested its involvement in Bitcoin mining, leveraging its abundant hydropower. So, why would a nation that potentially mines Bitcoin also be selling it? There are several plausible reasons for the ongoing Bhutan Bitcoin sales : Diversification: Governments often diversify their reserves to manage risk and allocate assets across various classes. Funding National Projects: Proceeds from Bitcoin sales could be channeled into infrastructure development, social programs, or other national initiatives. Treasury Management: As part of a sophisticated treasury strategy, nations might sell assets to realize profits or rebalance their portfolios based on market conditions and economic objectives. Bhutan’s approach offers a fascinating case study in sovereign wealth management within the digital asset realm. Their engagement demonstrates a pragmatic view of Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Potential Impacts of These Bhutan Bitcoin Sales When a sovereign entity like Bhutan makes significant moves in the crypto market, it can send ripples. While the total amount sold, over $100 million, is a fraction of Bitcoin’s overall market capitalization, the source of the sale carries weight. Consider the potential impacts: Market Sentiment: Such sales could be interpreted by some as a bearish signal, suggesting that even early adopters are taking profits. Liquidity: While not massive enough to crash the market, consistent sales add to the available supply, which can influence short-term price dynamics. Government Precedent: Other nations observing Bhutan’s strategy might consider similar moves, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a treasury asset, whether for holding or selling. The continuous Bhutan Bitcoin sales invite discussion about how governments perceive and utilize cryptocurrencies in their broader financial strategies. What Do These Bhutan Bitcoin Sales Mean for You? For individual investors and crypto enthusiasts, Bhutan’s actions offer valuable insights. It underscores the evolving landscape of digital asset adoption and management at a national level. It also reminds us of the dynamic nature of the crypto market, where even unexpected players can make significant moves. Here are some actionable takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on institutional and governmental crypto activities, as they often provide indicators of broader market trends. Diversify Wisely: Just as governments diversify, individuals should consider a balanced portfolio that aligns with their risk tolerance. Understand Market Drivers: Large transfers, regardless of source, contribute to market liquidity and can influence price action. The strategic Bhutan Bitcoin sales are more than just transactions; they are a window into the growing intersection of national finance and decentralized digital currencies. Conclusion: The recent and ongoing Bhutan Bitcoin sales represent a compelling narrative in the world of government crypto adoption. Bhutan’s calculated moves, offloading over $100 million in BTC, suggest a mature approach to managing digital assets within its national treasury. This isn’t just about selling; it’s about strategic financial planning in a rapidly evolving global economy. As more nations explore and engage with cryptocurrencies, Bhutan’s journey provides valuable lessons on the opportunities and challenges of integrating Bitcoin into sovereign financial frameworks. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is the Bhutan government selling Bitcoin? A1: The Bhutanese government is likely selling Bitcoin as part of a strategic treasury management plan. This could involve diversifying national assets, funding domestic projects, or realizing profits based on market conditions. Q2: How much Bitcoin has Bhutan sold recently? A2: In recent transfers reported by Lookonchain, the Bhutanese government moved 570 BTC (worth $66.85 million) and an earlier 343.1 BTC (worth $40.18 million), totaling over $100 million in Bitcoin. Q3: Does Bhutan’s Bitcoin selling affect the overall crypto market? A3: While Bhutan’s sales are significant for a single entity, the amounts are relatively small compared to Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. However, consistent sales from a sovereign entity can influence market sentiment and add to overall market liquidity. Q4: What is Bhutan’s broader strategy with cryptocurrencies? A4: Bhutan has been reportedly involved in Bitcoin mining, leveraging its hydropower. Their strategy appears to involve both accumulation (through mining) and strategic selling, treating Bitcoin as a treasury asset to be managed alongside other national reserves. Q5: Where can I find more information about government crypto holdings? A5: Information on government crypto holdings often comes from on-chain analytics firms like Lookonchain, public disclosures, or investigative reports, though transparency varies greatly between nations.

The upgrade will allow users to seamlessly transfer USDC between Stellar and more than 15 other blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Base, unlocking deeper liquidity and wider use cases for the Stellar ecosystem. Seamless Cross-Chain Liquidity Historically, users faced challenges when moving USDC across different blockchains, often relying on custodial bridges or Circle accounts. Liquidity was fragmented, making it difficult to dynamically manage assets between ecosystems. With CCTP V2, Stellar becomes natively interoperable with every other CCTP-enabled blockchain. This integration allows USDC liquidity to flow freely, providing exchanges, wallets, and DeFi protocols with more efficient access. For decentralized exchanges (DEXs), this means better rates for traders, while centralized exchanges (CEXs) can consolidate liquidity rather than maintaining isolated pools. Programmable Transfers for Developers CCTP V2 isn’t just about liquidity—it also introduces programmability. Developers can embed cross-chain USDC transfers directly into their decentralized applications (dApps), enabling seamless integration with the Stellar network. Projects can even include metadata within transfers that can trigger autonomous actions on the destination chain via Hooks, opening up new possibilities for automation and innovation. By building on top of CCTP V2, developers can leverage Stellar’s strengths—fast, low-cost payments and robust offramping options—without having to design complex multi-chain liquidity strategies. This creates a unified development experience across chains and accelerates the adoption of cross-chain finance. Eliminating Bridge Risk with Native Transfers A key innovation of CCTP V2 is its 1:1 burning and minting process. Instead of relying on wrapped tokens or custodial intermediaries, USDC is burned on the source chain and minted natively on the destination chain. This model eliminates bridge risk, improves transaction security, and ensures settlement can occur in seconds. For users and businesses, this means simpler, safer, and faster movement of capital across chains. The efficiency of this model also boosts confidence for institutions that require predictable liquidity and compliance-grade infrastructure. Strengthening Stellar’s Global Payments Role The Stellar network already powers global payments with low fees, near-instant settlement, and a network of 475,000+ MoneyGram locations for fiat on- and off-ramps. With CCTP V2, Stellar extends its role in cross-border finance by linking directly to the broader multichain USDC ecosystem. This upgrade makes Stellar a hub for stablecoin liquidity while enabling new financial applications, from treasury management to cross-chain lending. As programmable money gains traction, CCTP V2 ensures Stellar remains at the forefront of innovation, bridging traditional payments with the multichain future.

Major indices reported strong openings, signaling a wave of optimism among investors. This initial climb reflects a broader sentiment that could influence various investment avenues, including the digital asset space. What’s Driving the Positive Start for the U.S. Stock Market ? Today’s robust opening saw all three primary U.S. stock indices climb, marking a positive beginning to the trading session. Specifically: S&P 500: Rose by +0.44% Nasdaq: Saw a significant increase of +0.87% Dow: Posted a modest gain of +0.05% These figures suggest a broad-based positive momentum. Investors are likely reacting to a combination of factors, including recent economic data, corporate earnings reports, and evolving geopolitical landscapes. When the U.S. stock market shows strength, it often indicates a ‘risk-on’ environment, where investors are more willing to seek higher returns. This early rally can be attributed to several key drivers. For instance, better-than-expected corporate earnings from bellwether companies often instill confidence. Furthermore, positive economic indicators, such as improvements in employment figures or manufacturing data, can reassure investors about the underlying health of the economy. Consequently, this translates into increased buying activity across various sectors. Investor Sentiment: A Critical Catalyst Investor sentiment plays a pivotal role in daily market movements. When there’s a collective feeling of optimism, it can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, pushing prices higher. Today’s opening certainly reflects such a positive mood. The tech-heavy Nasdaq’s strong performance, in particular, highlights renewed interest in growth stocks, which often thrive in periods of market confidence. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any investor, whether in traditional equities or emerging markets like cryptocurrency. A thriving U.S. stock market often correlates with a stronger global economy, potentially freeing up capital for diversified investments. However, it’s always important to remember that market movements can be volatile, and an opening rally does not guarantee an entire day of gains. Navigating the Market: What Comes Next? While the initial hours of trading are promising, market participants will be closely watching for sustained momentum. Key economic announcements, shifts in commodity prices, or unexpected geopolitical events can quickly alter the trajectory. Therefore, staying informed is paramount for making sound investment decisions. For those observing the cryptocurrency space, a strong traditional market can sometimes signal increased liquidity and risk appetite, potentially benefiting digital assets. Conversely, if traditional markets face headwinds, investors might become more cautious, affecting all asset classes. The interconnectedness of global financial markets means that movements in the U.S. stock market are rarely isolated events. In conclusion, today’s higher opening for the U.S. stock market provides a compelling start to the trading day. It underscores the dynamic nature of financial markets and the multitude of factors that influence investor behavior. While the immediate outlook appears positive, continuous monitoring and strategic planning remain essential for all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when the U.S. stock market opens higher? A1: When the U.S. stock market opens higher, it means that the major stock indices (like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow) have started the trading day with an increase in their values compared to the previous day’s closing prices. This often indicates positive investor sentiment and anticipation of favorable economic news or corporate performance. Q2: How do these market openings impact individual investors? A2: A higher market opening can boost the value of an individual’s stock portfolio. It can also signal a ‘risk-on’ environment, encouraging investors to consider new opportunities. However, it’s crucial to remember that opening movements don’t dictate the entire day’s performance, and market volatility can occur. Q3: Is a strong U.S. stock market opening good for cryptocurrency? A3: While not a direct correlation, a strong traditional market, like the U.S. stock market, can sometimes indicate a broader ‘risk-on’ sentiment in the financial world. This can lead investors to allocate capital to higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, as they seek greater returns. Q4: What factors typically cause the U.S. stock market to open higher? A4: Several factors can contribute to a higher opening, including positive corporate earnings reports, optimistic economic data (e.g., strong job growth, low inflation), favorable geopolitical developments, and general investor confidence. Anticipation of positive news can also drive pre-market buying. Q5: How long do these initial gains usually last? A5: The duration of initial gains can vary significantly. Sometimes, the momentum carries through the entire trading day. Other times, new information, profit-taking, or shifts in sentiment can lead to a reversal. It’s why market watchers pay close attention to news and data throughout the day. Did you find this analysis helpful? Share your thoughts and insights on social media!

The analyst also mentioned what needs to happen for DOGE to reach this ambitious price target. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally To $5 If This Happens In an X post, CryptoELITES stated that the target for the Dogecoin price is $5 after a DOGE ETF launches. The analyst opined that a huge wave of institutional money is about to flow into meme coins very soon, with this money coming through the ETFs. Notably, REX-Osprey is launching the first Dogecoin ETF today. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Eyes 1,250% Surge To $3.5 – Here’s The Roadmap The REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF will provide institutional investors with spot exposure to DOGE and could serve as a catalyst for a Dogecoin price rally to $5, as CryptoELITES predicts. New capital could flow into the DOGE ecosystem through this ETF, which would spark higher prices for the foremost meme coin. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that more Dogecoin ETFs could launch soon enough, especially with the SEC’s approval of generic listing standards, which help fast-track crypto ETF listings. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that DOGE is one of the crypto assets that has futures on Coinbase, which makes it eligible for faster listing under the SEC’s new rule. Notably, Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares have filed for a DOGE ETF, and their respective funds could launch soon, which is bullish for the Dogecoin price. The launch of these other ETFs besides the REX-Osprey ETF means that more liquidity could flow into the meme coin’s ecosystem, although it remains to be seen if the $5 target is achieved. Meanwhile, CryptoELITES had also previously predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach $5 from a technical analysis perspective. The analyst cited DOGE’s historical cycles and the gains it recorded previously as the reason why the meme coin could reach this target. $10 DOGE Target Still In Place Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has again reiterated his $10 target for the Dogecoin price in this cycle. He believes that the meme coin can reach and surpass this target based on historical trends. He noted that each cycle’s first year (2013, 2017, and 2021) has historically delivered the strongest gains. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Just Broke A Regional High For The First Time This Year, Why A 300% Rally To $1 Is Possible The analyst noted that in the current cycle, the pattern suggests that the Dogecoin price could be in for substantial upside this year if history repeats, although the yearly candle hasn’t closed yet. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could even reach as high as $36 in this cycle.

The report affirms that all major digital assets on the platform remain overcollateralized, reinforcing BTCC’s ongoing emphasis on transparency and user fund protection. The report includes updated figures for leading cryptocurrencies, showing that Bitcoin is backed at 111%, Ethereum at 152%, XRP at 166%, and stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) at 156% and 121% respectively. Cardano (ADA) also showed a reserve ratio of 153%. Alex Hung, Head of Operations at BTCC, commented on the figures, stating: “Since Q3 began, the crypto market has remained consistently active, and BTCC continues to maintain a platform-wide reserve ratio above 140%. Maintaining high reserves is essential to withstand volatility and maintain solid trust during uncertain times. The latest September PoR report reflects our commitment to long-term user protection and asset transparency.” This marks the fifth consecutive monthly PoR update from BTCC since it began publishing reserve data earlier this year.

Alongside the PoR update, BTCC shared new operational metrics. The platform now serves over 10 million registered users globally, offering more than 350 spot trading pairs and over 380 futures contracts. Between September 1 and 15, BTCC processed $41 billion in spot volume and $315 billion in futures trading volume. BTCC is also set to appear at TOKEN2049 Singapore, one of Asia’s leading crypto industry conferences.

Tron Inc. trades at a 500% premium to its underlying TRX token value, making it an expensive vehicle for crypto exposure. Risks include extreme volatility of the TRX token and the unsustainable nature of staking yields, which resemble dilution rather than true earnings. Initiate with a hold rating, as both the premium and inherent crypto risks make Tron Inc. shares unattractive for investment. Tron Inc. ( TRON ) is a company that changed its name, shareholders, and business recently. It went from a toy designer and wholesaler (under the name SRM Entertainment) to a crypto treasury company, specializing in the crypto token TRX. The founders of the TRON crypto protocol are related parties to Tron Inc. Tron Inc.'s business is to stake the TRON token (TRX-USD) and earn a yield for that staking. I do not want to make many comments on whether the price of the TRX is fair or not, or on the sustainability of the yield mechanism. I will make some comments on risks around staking crypto. However, the most important comment for the article is the realization that, after accounting for dilution in recent transactions, at current prices, the shares of Tron Inc. are traded at 6 times their TRX treasury value at market. Therefore, even for those who believe in the TRX value and its staking potential, Tron Inc. is not a reasonable ownership vehicle. For that reason, I initiate with a Hold rating on the company. A toy manufacturer bought with crypto tokens Up until July 2025 , Tron Inc. was called SRM Entertainment and traded under the ticker SRM. SRM was an ailing toy designer and wholesaler, specializing in toys for theme parks (like themed backpacks or drinking cups). The company generated operational losses and had not grown sales at all in a long time. Then, in June 2025, the company received an equity injection of $100 million in exchange for 100 thousand preferred class B shares, convertible into 200 million shares, plus 220 million warrants exercisable at $0.5 per share (all explained in the 10-Q under note 6 ). The equity injection was made not in cash but in digital assets, specifically 365 million tokens of the TRX. Then, in August 2025, the investor (Bravemorning Limited, as disclosed in a recent release ), exercised the 220 million $0.5 strike warrants with an additional injection of $110 million, also paid via TRX, 312 million in this case ( release ). As a result, Bravemorning became the largest shareholder of the company. On a fully converted basis, it owns 420 million shares out of 440 million fully diluted shares (200 million from the conversion of preferreds, plus 220 million from the exercise of warrants, plus 20 million pre-existing shares). Tron Inc. now owns about 677 million TRX, which, according to specialized sources , is about 0.7% of the total supply of TRX (95 billion). Affiliated parties to the TRON token Bravemorning is owned by Weike Sun (disclosed in a recent 8-K ). Mr. Sun is also a director of Tron Inc. As disclosed in the 2Q25 10-Q, also under Note 6, Weike Sun is the father of Justin Sun, who founded the TRON protocol, foundation, and token. The other two directors are affiliated with the TRON protocol or related companies (disclosed in the same place). New business: staking and Treasury The company's new business is to own TRX and to stake them. The staking of crypto tokens is a complex process through which some blockchains validate transactions and make decisions. In exchange for the staking, the owners of the token receive a yield on that token itself. It is akin, in some way, to earning a deposit yield on a currency. In Tron Inc.'s case, the process is more complex because the company does not directly stake the TRX it owns, but rather hires an affiliate company, which stakes the TRX, but instead of paying the TRX yield to Tron Inc., issues staked TRX (sTRX), which, according to the 10-Q, are convertible into TRX, albeit, as shown in price charts , at a slowly decreasing parity. The Treasury business is not actually a business (it generates no earnings), but it is actually a market function. If people want to have exposure to the TRX, they can buy Tron Inc. instead of going through the process of owning TRX directly, which might present higher complexity in regulatory, custodial, or other fronts. Crypto risk exposures This is not an article about the TRX or crypto. However, given that Tron Inc. basically owns TRX, an explanation of the risks is important. First, like with any financial asset, we have price risk. Crypto tokens are extremely volatile, and therefore, they can fall in price. Buying shares in Tron Inc. directly exposes the shareholder to that risk. Determining the value of a crypto token is hard, one might say even impossible. One is indeed betting on sentiment in an extremely volatile market. Second, the methodology of earning a yield on the same cryptocurrency or crypto token has led many cryptos astray, with the best-known example being the Terra and LUNA collapse . Paying a yield on its own cryptocurrency is like offering a share dividend on a public stock paid via stock issuance. It is basically a yield paid via dilution/issuance, which decreases the scarcity and value of the rest of the ownership. Other considerations Cash should not be a problem Given that TRON has issued equity, it has a significant cash runway, currently in the form of TRX, valued at approximately $236 million, as we will see below. Of course, the value of these holdings depends on a volatile crypto market, and they could go down. The cash burn is harder to determine, given that the company has only presented 2Q25 financials so far, and the change in business, control, and name started only in June 2025, that is, at the end of the quarter. We do not have much insight into the economics of the Treasury operation. Liquidity is good so far Again, we are talking of a company that has substantially changed in the past few months, so historical figures are not representative of the current situation. Still, the company has presented an average daily volume of 4 million shares since early July, potentially lower if removing the outlier in mid-July. At about $3 per share, that would represent a liquidity of about $12 million per day, which can be considered sufficient for a small-cap of this size. Data by YCharts Owning TRX via Tron Inc. is expensive Some potential shareholders in Tron Inc. might face regulatory or other burdens that lead them to prefer paying a premium for owning the TRX via Tron Inc. instead of owning the TRX directly. I would not own the TRX directly because of the reasons exposed above, but even more, I would not own it via Tron Inc. because I would be paying a 500% premium on the price of the TRX. As of today, the TRX is worth $0.35 per token. Based on the disclosures linked above, Tron Inc. has a total ownership of 677 million TRX, or about $236 million, at current prices. The company has 440 million shares on a diluted basis, meaning about 1.5 TRX per share, considering that liabilities are minimal, and also other assets of the company. That is to say, the company's stock underlying TRX ownership is worth about $0.5 at market prices. However, the company's stock trades at more than $3, or a 500% premium on the underlying value of the tokens. Summing up, Tron Inc. is a stock that trades at a substantial premium to its token ownership. These underlying tokens, in addition, are potentially overvalued and risky, therefore compounding the loss potential. In my opinion, there is no reason to own Tron Inc. shares, and their price risk, either via TRX price reduction or via premium reduction, is significant. I initiate with a Hold rating for those reasons. Upside risks are substantial Even though I have a relatively negative view about the price or value of TRON, readers should be warned about the potential for the stock to rise significantly, either because the price of TRX climbs or because of hard-to-explain sentiment factors. Crypto treasury companies have generally traded at a premium to underlying NAV, although I do not think it has reached the level of 500%. The best example is MicroStrategy, now called simply Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ). These stocks are used as a vehicle for speculative activity and can climb rapidly above what could be considered reasonable fundamentals (which are already hard to determine in the crypto world).",TRON,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRX|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-18 14:04:59

Ripple Face Melting High Is Loading,https://timestabloid.com/technical-analyst-xrp-mega-cycle-is-coming-ripple-face-melting-high-is-loading/,"Prominent X analyst EtherNasyonaL has ignited excitement across the crypto space with a striking forecast: “XRP mega cycle is coming. Ripple face melting high is loading right there.” His post includes a carefully annotated two-panel chart that he says captures the beginning of XRP’s next historic surge. Chart Fractals Signal a Mega Cycle The image shared by EtherNasyonaL places two line charts side by side. The first revisits XRP’s explosive 2017 rally, highlighting a long period of accumulation followed by a near-vertical climb to its all-time high of $3.84. The second chart overlays XRP’s 2024–2025 price action, showing a nearly identical structure. Months of sideways trading have formed a broad consolidation base, and momentum is beginning to tilt upward in a pattern that echoes the earlier bull run. Crucially, the 2025 panel features a clearly marked distribution range pointing toward $7–$10, indicating the zone where EtherNasyonaL expects intense trading and potential profit-taking as the next leg higher unfolds. $XRP mega cycle is coming. Ripple face melting high is loading right there. pic.twitter.com/ow6CnCZCtH — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL (@EtherNasyonaL) September 17, 2025 Market Catalysts Strengthen the Outlook Real-world developments lend weight to the chart-based thesis. As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.12, its firmest footing in years. Institutional on-ramps are expanding quickly: a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is launching this week , and CME is preparing options on XRP futures. These products are positioned to attract new investment and expand opportunities for professional traders, potentially increasing market participation and activity. Equally important is the regulatory clarity that has emerged. Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is finished , with both parties formally withdrawing their appeals earlier this summer. This finality removes a key barrier for U.S. financial firms, making it easier to list XRP products and for investors to gain exposure without fear of sudden legal hurdles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Implications and Key Risks Technical analysts who support the “mega cycle” narrative point to compressed volatility, rising on-balance volume, and the fractal similarities highlighted in EtherNasyonaL’s chart. The $7–$10 distribution zone serves as an initial target and critical battleground. A strong breakout and sustained trading above that band could confirm the next phase of the rally and open the door to double-digit prices. Yet risks remain. Market-wide shocks, weaker-than-expected ETF inflows, or heavy profit-taking near the $7–$10 zone could slow or even reverse momentum. Traders are urged to pair enthusiasm with disciplined risk management, including clear stop levels and prudent position sizing. In conclusion, EtherNasyonaL’s annotated comparison of past and present price action captures the current mood among XRP bulls: technical signals, structural catalysts, and regulatory clearance are converging in a way not seen since 2017. If institutional inflows materialize and price decisively clears the $7–$10 range, the “face melting high” he predicts may shift from bold forecast to market reality. Until then, the market watches closely as XRP tests the boundaries of its long-awaited mega cycle. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

AtHeart represents our bold, innovative spirit.” The launch coincides with the debut of AtHeart, a seven-member group – Michi, Katelyn, Seohyeon, Aurora, Bome, Arin, and Nahyun – formed through global auditions and developed in partnership with Republic Records’ IMPERIAL Music. Led by Han, former CEO of SM Entertainment, AtHeart is the first group under Titan Content’s mission to shape the next generation of K-pop stars through innovative production, fan engagement, and artist development strategies. A key feature of 2GATHR is its use of Avalanche blockchain, enabling fans to access exclusive digital collectibles, such as limited-edition NFTs tied to AtHeart’s music, artwork, and performances. This ensures authenticity and ownership, providing an immersive, interactive fan experience. While blockchain operates on the backend, the app remains intuitive and user-friendly for existing fans. John Nahas, Chief Business Officer of Ava Labs, the company supporting the launch of Avalanche L1 blockchains, praised Titan’s fan-first approach, saying, “We need applications that everyday consumers will come in and use, and those applications will come from specified experiences that bring them value. Avalanche allows for any business to leverage our customizable blockchain technology to maximize their business use case.” His comment underscores how 2GATHR prioritizes unique, fan-driven experiences. In addition to the fan experience Titan Content is building, it has also chosen to utilize blockchain technology for its ability to significantly improve outdated processes involving artist payouts and voting, among others. AtHeart officially debuted on August 13, 2025, with their first EP Plot Twist, marking the arrival of KPop’s newest breakout act. The release left a powerful first impression and quickly drew global attention, positioning the group as one of the most anticipated debuts of the year. Based in Los Angeles, Titan Content blends Korean roots with a U.S. perspective, led by Han, who has shaped acts such as H.O.T., Girls’ Generation, and EXO. Fans can follow AtHeart’s rise on social media as 2GATHR drives a K-pop revolution into 2025. About Titan Content The formation of AtHeart aligns with TITAN CONTENT’s ambitious vision, spearheaded by Nikki Semin Han, the renowned K-pop executive and former CEO of SM Entertainment.

It has set a new BNB all-time high , pushing closer to the coveted $1,000 mark. This impressive surge is not just a number; it reflects growing confidence and robust activity within the Binance ecosystem. What’s Driving This Historic BNB All-Time High? BNB’s journey to its new peak has been nothing short of spectacular. The token reached an unprecedented $997.67 on the Binance spot market against USDT, demonstrating significant buying pressure. Currently, it trades around $995.53, having climbed over 4.23% in just the last 24 hours. Several factors contribute to this incredible momentum: Strong Ecosystem Growth: BNB is the native coin of the Binance ecosystem, which includes the Binance exchange and the BNB Chain. Its utility extends across various applications, from trading fee discounts to participation in token sales on Binance Launchpad. Increased Utility: The continuous expansion of decentralized applications (dApps) and projects on the BNB Chain drives demand for BNB, as it is used for gas fees and staking. Market Sentiment: A generally bullish sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market, coupled with positive developments within Binance, often translates into significant price movements for major tokens like BNB. The consistent development and innovation within the Binance sphere underpin this sustained growth, solidifying BNB’s position as a top-tier digital asset. The Impact of BNB’s All-Time High on the Crypto Landscape This remarkable BNB all-time high sends a clear signal across the entire crypto landscape. For investors, it represents a significant return and validates the long-term potential of the Binance ecosystem. For the broader market, it highlights the increasing maturity and resilience of established blockchain platforms. BNB’s performance often influences other tokens within the BNB Chain ecosystem. As BNB gains value, it can attract more developers and users to the network, fostering further innovation and adoption. This creates a positive feedback loop, strengthening the entire ecosystem. Moreover, reaching near the $1,000 psychological barrier could attract even more institutional and retail interest, potentially fueling further upward movement. It’s a testament to BNB’s fundamental strength and its integral role in one of the largest crypto platforms globally. Navigating the Future: What’s Next After This BNB All-Time High? While the recent BNB all-time high is certainly cause for celebration, many are now looking ahead. Will BNB breach the $1,000 mark soon? The market remains dynamic, and while past performance does not guarantee future results, the current trajectory is undeniably optimistic. Continued innovation, coupled with sustained user adoption, will be key drivers. For those interested in the future of BNB, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Binance’s official announcements and BNB Chain developments. New features or partnerships could significantly impact its value. Understand Market Trends: While BNB has shown strong individual performance, it is still influenced by overall market trends. A broad market downturn could affect its price. Consider Utility: Evaluate BNB not just as a speculative asset but also for its utility within the Binance ecosystem. Its practical applications contribute to its long-term value proposition. The journey to new highs is always exciting, and BNB’s current run is a compelling narrative in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. In conclusion, BNB’s recent achievement of a new BNB all-time high is a significant moment for the cryptocurrency community. It underscores the robust health of the Binance ecosystem, driven by increasing utility and strong market confidence. As BNB flirts with the $1,000 threshold, its future trajectory remains a focal point of interest, promising continued excitement for investors and enthusiasts alike. This momentous climb reinforces BNB’s position as a dominant force in the digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is BNB and why is it important? BNB, or Binance Coin, is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem. It is crucial because it powers the Binance exchange, the BNB Chain, and various decentralized applications, offering utility for trading fees, staking, and participation in new token launches. What does a ‘BNB all-time high’ mean for investors? A new BNB all-time high indicates strong market confidence and significant returns for long-term holders. It suggests that the asset’s value is appreciating, potentially attracting more investors and capital into the ecosystem. What factors contributed to BNB reaching a new all-time high? Key factors include the continuous growth and expansion of the Binance ecosystem, increased utility of BNB across the BNB Chain, strong bullish market sentiment, and successful projects launched on Binance Launchpad.

51928764,https://blog.kraken.com/?p=29927,1758204710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/98/default.png,"Introducing Kraken Launch, powered by Legion",https://blog.kraken.com/product/launch/introducing-launch,"For 14 years, we have been one of the most trusted crypto platforms. Our vision is for Kraken Launch to support project teams throughout their token journey by offering services before, during and after token sales. Why Kraken Launch? Crypto started with an ethos of open access for all. However, the first chance retail has to buy a token is often once it’s already trading on the open market, long after many others have had the opportunity to do so. The worlds of crypto and traditional finance are colliding. As this convergence accelerates, we believe offchain businesses will increasingly choose to raise funds through onchain token sales. This shift represents more than a technological upgrade: It’s a reimagining of capital markets as open, global and permissionless by default. With this vision of the future in mind, we think token sales should work differently. How does Kraken Launch raise the bar? Transparency : No hidden round allocations, no insider deals; instead, you have all the information required to make an informed decision. Built on trust : Participate safely in token sales within the familiarity and security of our platform. Compliance-first : Sales adhere to clear regulatory frameworks like MiCA in Europe. Smarter technology: Working with Legion’s reputational features, sales will increasingly reward genuine community engagement, while also recognizing the contributions of long-time Kraken clients. “Kraken is building the foundation of tomorrow’s financial infrastructure with crypto at its core,” said Brett McLain, Kraken Head of Payments and Blockchain. “Together with Legion , we’re scaling a product that democratizes token sales and aligns communities with builders. It’s not just better fundraising, it’s better infrastructure for the next generation of finance.” This is not just another launchpad; through this partnership with Legion, Kraken is improving how early token sales and ICOs are conducted — with higher standards for disclosures, compliance and fair access — pairing an exchange sale with a native onchain sale to cater to everyone. Why Legion? Legion has built the most advanced fundraising platform in crypto. It combines retail-friendly access and institutional-grade protections, with an emphasis on clear disclosures, fair allocations and regulatory compliance . The most high-profile Legion sales will deploy simultaneously on both Kraken Launch and Legion, and will be available for trading on Kraken shortly after the sale. The Legion technology allows projects to evaluate users across social activity, developer contributions, onchain history and more to hand-select users that most deserve to be among their early token holders and supporters. A portion of each sale on Legion will be reserved for users based on this merit score. The remainder will be available via first-come, first-serve rounds on Legion and Kraken Launch. “Crypto gave us the tools to rebuild capital markets from first principles. This partnership combines Legion’s approach to regulation and merit-based access with Kraken’s global distribution, compliance infrastructure and deep liquidity,” said Legion co-founder Matt O’Connor. “The next Figma or Reddit won’t IPO. It’ll launch to its community onchain. This partnership is another step toward making that possible.” What’s next Be ready. Log in to your Kraken account or the Kraken app and stay tuned for details on the first sale.

On Thursday, the Finance Ministry said it plans to roll out a new oil price formula next year that would lower the cut-off price for oil revenues going into the country’s fiscal reserve fund. The goal is reportedly to protect the national budget from market swings and Western sanctions on energy exports. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the plan is meant to make the budget “more resilient” by cutting the reliance on oil and gas revenues. “We are proposing a reduction in dependence on various constraints, whether price-related or volume-related,” Anton said at a public forum. He’s aiming to cut energy’s share of the budget to 22% next year, down from about 25% in the first eight months of 2025. Russia cuts cut-off price yearly, reinstates budget rule Under the new formula, Russia will lower the oil price cut-off by $1 every year until it hits $55 per barrel in 2030. The current level is $60. Any oil revenues from prices above the cut-off go straight into the reserve fund. When prices fall below that point, the reserve is used to cover the gap. Anton is also pushing to revive the “budget rule,” a mechanism dropped after the war in Ukraine began. It was first introduced by Alexei Kudrin in 2004. Without it, the budget becomes vulnerable to market drops. Russia plans to withdraw 447 billion rubles ($5.39 billion) from the fiscal reserve this year to help cover a budget deficit expected to top 1.7% of GDP. The fund currently holds around 4 trillion rubles ($48.25 billion). The draft budget is set to go to parliament on September 29. It puts the average price of Urals crude at $59 per barrel in 2026. That’s below the cut-off, meaning the reserve likely won’t grow that year. There’s also talk of a VAT hike to plug the deficit, but Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, said the government is still working on the plan. As usual, final numbers will be agreed with Putin before anything gets published. Central bank backs plan as oil market reacts to Fed move Putin isn’t thrilled with the current growth. He told his cabinet this week he’s not satisfied with the slowdown, as GDP is expected to grow just 1% this year, way down from 4.3% in 2024. Standing next to Anton, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said a stronger budget would let the bank cut rates to 12–13% in 2026 from today’s 17%. Oil markets barely moved Thursday. Brent was up 10 cents to $68.05 a barrel, and West Texas Intermediate rose 4 cents to $64.09. Traders are watching how the U.S. economy reacts after Donald Trump’s Fed cut interest rates. At the same time, U.S. crude stockpiles dropped sharply last week. Imports hit a record low, while exports jumped to their highest in almost two years, based on Energy Information Administration data.

It had a $19 million theatrical debut, the largest in Netflix history, after already being on the service for 2 months. Its soundtrack produced eight Billboard Hot 100 hits, including the #1 single “Golden,” and earned acclaim as the first soundtrack in the last three decades to land three Billboard Top 10 Singles. Critics embraced the film as well, awarding K-POP DEMON HUNTERS a 97% Rotten Tomatoes score, making it the top-performing Netflix original film to date. Kang's K-POP DEMON HUNTERS broke from convention by focusing on distinctly Korean influences while simultaneously rejecting a typical “female superhero” mold seen throughout media. Instead, Kang created funny, flawed, and relatable heroines that not only attracted viewers but also led to an immediate and enormous globally dedicated fandom. A veteran of the animation industry, Kang previously served as Head of Story on THE LEGO NINJAGO MOVIE and began her career at DreamWorks, where she contributed as a story artist to the SHREK, KUNG FU PANDA, TROLLS, MADAGASCAR, and CROODS franchises. From Toronto and a graduate of Sheridan College’s classical animation program, she continues to redefine the landscape of animation through cultural authenticity, musical innovation, and groundbreaking global storytelling.

While bullish expectations for Bitcoin continue for October and beyond, one analyst has stated that BTC is in the final stages of the bull run. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler stated in his latest analysis that the Bitcoin bull market continues but has entered its final phase. According to the analyst, Bitcoin futures are trading at a higher premium to its spot price, suggesting that BTC is in the final stages of a bull market. Adler noted that BTC futures prices have been consistently higher than spot prices, and that overheating occurred just before the last FOMC meeting. This premium difference between the futures price and the spot price is a characteristic feature of a late-stage bull market, the analyst noted. Under these conditions, the analyst predicted a 70% probability of a gradual rally or sideways price movement in Bitcoin over the next two weeks. Adler recently said that as the Bitcoin price rises, new long positions may also increase, potentially pushing BTC to a new record high. “If Bitcoin price, base and open interest (OI) show an upward trend in the next few days, it means that new long positions are increasing. This could be a signal that increases the likelihood of a new peak forming.” The analyst's latest analysis is consistent with his previous analysis from early September, when he predicted that the cycle peak could occur between October and November. *This is not investment advice.

The reversal came after seven consecutive sessions of inflows that had fueled optimism among institutional investors. The retreat came just one day after U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded $292.27 million in net inflows on September 16. Bitcoin Spot ETF Loses Momentum While Ethereum Funds Struggle With Persistent Outflows The sudden shift reflects rapid repositioning across major issuers. Fidelity’s FBTC was the hardest hit, posting $116.03 million in daily outflows, despite holding a historical net inflow of $12.56 billion. Grayscale’s flagship GBTC also logged heavy losses, with $62.64 million withdrawn, while Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB shed $32.29 million. Smaller declines were seen at Bitwise’s BITB, which lost $12.58 million. Bitcoin ETFs Flow September 17 Source: SoSoValue Not all funds recorded redemptions, however. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continued to attract capital, pulling in $149.73 million on the day. Grayscale’s lower-fee Bitcoin Mini Trust ($BTC) also posted $22.54 million in inflows, raising its lifetime tally to $1.84 billion. The net outflows left the total assets under management for Bitcoin spot ETFs at $152.45 billion, equivalent to 6.62% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Cumulative net inflows across all products since launch stand at $57.33 billion. Prices tracked lower alongside the shift in flows, with many ETFs ending the day down just over 1%. Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, remain under pressure. On September 17, Ether products saw $1.89 million in net outflows, extending a streak of withdrawals that has persisted since early September. Ethereum ETFs Flow September 17 Source: SoSoValue Fidelity’s FETH was the largest loser, with $29.19 million in redemptions. Bitwise’s ETHW also saw $9.67 million exit the fund. Inflows at BlackRock’s ETHA, which added $25.86 million, and smaller gains at Grayscale’s products were not enough to offset the broader weakness. Total assets under management for Ether ETFs now stand at $29.72 billion, or 5.47% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Cumulative inflows are reported at $13.66 billion. The figures follow a period of heavy selling earlier this month, when Ether ETFs lost more than $1 billion over six consecutive sessions, including a $446.7 million single-day withdrawal on September 9 . By contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have shown stronger resilience. Earlier in September, funds added more than $1.7 billion in inflows over four days, reversing weakness from late August when Bitcoin ETFs posted their first weekly outflows since June. Ether funds continue to bleed assets after a brief rebound mid-month, raising questions about institutional conviction in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin. SEC Approves New Listing Standards, Paving Way for More Crypto Spot ETFs The ETF market has seen renewed institutional interest. A fresh wave of cryptocurrency ETF filings has landed at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), showing the industry’s push beyond traditional Bitcoin and Ether products. On Tuesday, five applications were submitted , ranging from Bitwise’s proposed spot Avalanche ETF to Tuttle’s “Income Blast” funds targeting Bonk, Litecoin, and Sui. Crypto ETF filings flood the SEC with Avalanche, Sui, and Bonk products as 92 applications await October deadlines, testing regulatory limits. #Crypto #ETFs https://t.co/PcKzgVk0hm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 17, 2025 Defiance also filed for ETFs built around Bitcoin and Ethereum basis trades, while T-Rex submitted paperwork for a leveraged 2x Orbs ETF. ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci noted that the industry should brace for “what’s coming over the next few months,” as the number of active applications climbs past 92 , with many facing autumn deadlines. The filings arrive just as REX-Osprey prepares to launch XRP and Dogecoin ETFs on Thursday through the faster 40 Act structure, which bypasses traditional SEC approval bottlenecks. Momentum picked up further on Wednesday when the SEC approved new listing rules for major exchanges , including Nasdaq, Cboe BZX, and NYSE Arca. The SEC has approved new rules allowing Nasdaq, Cboe and NYSE to fast-track crypto spot ETFs, opening the door to wider listings. #SEC #CryptoETFs https://t.co/IfxwJIqJ0K — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 18, 2025 The decision allows generic listing standards for commodity-based trust shares, clearing the way for spot ETFs tied to a wider range of cryptocurrencies. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart described the move as the “crypto ETP framework we’ve been waiting for,” predicting Solana and XRP could be first in line. In a separate development, the regulator cleared Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund, the first multi-asset crypto ETP in the U.S. , providing investors exposure to Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Crypto Steadies as Fed Trims Rates 25 Bps, Bitcoin Eyes $118K Resistance Bitcoin held above $117,000 on Thursday after the Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut since December , trimming the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.00%–4.25%. The cryptocurrency was last trading at $117,173, up 1% over 24 hours and 5.7% in the past two weeks. Ethereum followed with stronger momentum, climbing 1.8% on the day to $4,568, extending gains to 6.2% over 30 days. The Fed cited weaker job growth and a softer economic outlook for the decision, noting that 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the past year than previously reported. Inflation remains at 2.9%, above the bank’s 2% target. Chair Jerome Powell said future cuts would remain data-dependent, while President Donald Trump has pressed for deeper reductions. Market reaction was immediate. More than $105 million in crypto positions were liquidated within an hour of Powell’s remarks, with longs bearing the brunt. $BTC update: FOMC Price Action nailed Boring Monday and Tuesday; Wednesday volatile with the classic retrace of an initial false move. $105M liquidated in 30mins during FOMC, that's what it's important to be aware of this. Absolutely love this market. Probably $120k next. https://t.co/azE7Fg6J10 pic.twitter.com/x3EPCmIlOx — CrypNuevo (@CrypNuevo) September 17, 2025 The global crypto market cap briefly fell 0.9% to $4.08 trillion, while Bitcoin dipped to $115,089 before recovering. On-chain data points to easing sell pressure. Bitcoin exchange inflows dropped to a yearly low , with the 7-day moving average falling to 25,000 BTC, down from 51,000 in July. Average BTC deposits have halved since mid-summer. Ethereum showed similar trends, with inflows sliding to a two-month low of 783,000 ETH . Source: X/Michaël van de Poppe Traders are now focused on the $118,000 resistance level. Analysts say a break above could open the door to retesting Bitcoin’s record high near $124,000.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000430. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000699 and an average trading price of $0.000673 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Floki Inu Token FLOKI Price $0.000101 Market Capitalization $974.22M Trading Volume $117.08M Circulating Supply 9.66T FLOKI All-time High $0.0003462 (Jun 05, 2024) All-time Low $0.00000002 (Aug 08, 2021) 24-hour High $0.0001026 24-hour Low $0.00009493 Floki Inu price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.06% 50-Day SMA $0.000102 14-Day RSI 52.25 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 52 (Neutral) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.00008947 Floki Inu price analysis Key Insights: FLOKI reclaimed the mid-band at $0.0000960, turning it into support. The immediate resistance is $0.0001060, which has repeatedly rejected upside attempts. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of September 18, FLOKI has reclaimed the daily mid-band at $0.0000960, which now acts as immediate support. The price is sitting just above $0.0001000, showing that buyers managed to flip the level after bouncing off the lower band at $0.0000856 last week. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The next obstacle stands at $0.0001060, the upper Bollinger Band, which rejected the last rally. The RSI at 51 is neutral, and the MACD is flattening near the zero line, suggesting momentum is stabilizing but not yet bullish. Holding above $0.0000960 keeps FLOKI’s recovery valid, while a daily close below it would open the door back to $0.0000930–$0.0000856. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, FLOKI is consolidating above $0.0000990, supported by the Alligator averages now stacked beneath price. Volume near 20M backs this defense, though every move higher has been capped under $0.0001060. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView If price clears $0.0001060, the next leg targets $0.0001100–$0.0001120. Failure to break through, however, risks a drift back toward the $0.0000990–$0.0000960 band. Floki Inu technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00009731 BUY SMA 5 $0.00009912 BUY SMA 10 $0.000102 SELL SMA 21 $0.00009737 BUY SMA 50 $0.000102 SELL SMA 100 $0.00009871 BUY SMA 200 $0.00008947 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.00009543 BUY EMA 5 $0.00009517 BUY EMA 10 $0.00009650 BUY EMA 21 $0.0001 BUY EMA 50 $0.000103 SELL EMA 100 $0.0001 BUY EMA 200 $0.000103 SELL What to expect from FLOKI FLOKI is stabilizing after reclaiming key support, but upside remains capped. The coin trades between $0.0000960 and $0.0001060, and whichever side breaks first will set the next trend. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need up to $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 110x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

BoE’s nine-member policy committee (MPC) voted 7-2 to leave rates unchanged. The central bank has also had five rate cuts since summer 2024, including one as recently as last month. Markets were expecting the bank to pause rate cuts this month since the UK’s inflation is well above the BoE’s 2% target, at 3.8% in August. BOE remains alert to the risk of rising inflation The Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 7-2 to keep interest rates at 4%. Find out more: https://t.co/Ed0Amld41X #InterestRates #BankOfEngland #BoE pic.twitter.com/L3iJrM2R03 — Bank of England (@bankofengland) September 18, 2025 The UK’s core CPI rose by an annual 3.6%, compared with 3.8% in the twelve months to July. The central bank said it remains alert to the risk that the increase in inflation could put additional upward pressure on the wage and price-setting process. The BOE also confirmed that upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures remain crucial in the MPC’s outlook assessment. The bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, said in Thursday’s meeting that the BoE held rates at 4%, but expects inflation to return to its 2% target. He also acknowledged that the economy is still not where they want it to be and that the BOE must make future cuts gradually and carefully. Policymakers have been trying to balance the risk of rising inflation, which has been caused by a surge in food prices over the last few months. At the same time, the jobs market has been declining, with unemployment hitting a four-year high. “The Committee remains focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures, to return inflation sustainability to its 2% target in the medium term.” – Andrew Bailey , Governor of the Bank of England. The BOE expects inflation to peak at 4% in September before retreating in the early half of next year. In August, the bank said it was mindful of inflationary pressures but aware of the need to promote growth and investment. The MPC acknowledged that its own estimates indicate employment growth is at zero. The policymakers argued that zero unemployment partly stemmed from increased employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs). According to them, Rachel Reeve’s 25 billion euro NICs increase at last year’s budget ignited backlash from business groups. The central bank said it is mindful of a cooling jobs market and slowing wage growth, which it expects will ease inflationary pressures and could also push for a further rate cut in the coming months. MPC’s Swati Dhingra and Prof Alan Taylor voted this month for another 25 basis point cut. The central bank also noted that underlying disinflation has continued, with the British pound remaining flat against the dollar at $1.3638 following the announcement. Economists at ING said they were eager to see the vote split and forward guidance from the BoE for clues on what the MPC might do at its next meeting in November, despite not expecting a September rate cut. The central bank also acknowledged that the gradual and careful attention to withdrawing monetary policy restraints was still appropriate. Reeves plans to announce tax hikes As Cryptopolitan reported , Reeves is also expected to announce a raft of tax hikes during the government’s November 26 Autumn budget. She said the initiative is meant to eradicate a budget deficit as she seeks to balance the books and reduce borrowing. The BOE will meet on November 6, just before the budget announcement. Isaac Stell, an investment manager at Wealth Club, argued that the central bank faces a dilemma of either easing rates and risking further fueling inflation or raising rates, which can strain an already weak economy. He added that the government is still due to deliver a budget that needs to fix a deficit running into the tens of billions. Stell believes that the real action lies with Reeves and not with the central bank. He argued that the BOE is waiting to see what tax and spending decisions emerge in the budget. Chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, Sanja Raja, mentioned that the good news is that the August inflation data has corrected some of the upside surprises from last month. According to him, the bad news is that inflation has a little further to go before hitting its peak.

Въпреки това, сегашните тенденции показват, че инвеститорите постепенно се отдръпват от активи, базирани единствено на спекулации, и се насочват към токени с по-стабилна основа, реални приложения и силни общности. През следващия растежен цикъл се очаква редица нови проекти да надминат SHIB, предлагайки атрактивни възможности за печалба на тези, които се включат рано. Сред тях изпъкват четири токена: Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), Maxi Doge (MAXI), Dogecoin (DOGE) и Stellar (XLM). Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Революцията в BitcoinFi Bitcoin Hyper съчетава изкуствен интелект, смарт договори и DeFi протоколи, за да отвори ново поколение на BitcoinFi. В момента HYPER е в етап на presale с цена само 0,0002 USD, като вече привлича милиони долари инвестиции. Основният акцент е върху HYPER Vault, който позволява на потребителите да залагат (staking) и да получават пасивни награди, като същевременно подпомага стабилността на цената. Освен това проектът разполага с технология за AI-driven Audit, която гарантира сигурността на смарт договорите и помага за минимизиране на риска. Динамичната общност Hyper Army в Telegram и Twitter организира различни събития като airdrop-и, giveaway кампании и трейдинг състезания, които допринасят за глобалното разпространение. Със своята стабилна основа, HYPER има потенциала да надмине SHIB в предстоящия bull run. Dogecoin (DOGE): Повече от един мемкойн От първоначално замислен като мемкойн, днес Dogecoin вече е приет като средство за плащане от множество компании – включително Tesla. При сегашна цена около 0,42 USD, DOGE продължава да поддържа силна общност и стабилна подкрепа от Илон Мъск. Все по-широкото приемане на DOGE като платежно средство затвърждава позицията му като дългосрочен дигитален актив. Според експерти, DOGE може отново да достигне прага от 1 USD по време на следващия bull run, носейки значителни печалби за търпеливите инвеститори. Stellar (XLM): Бъдещето на трансграничните плащания Stellar е водещ избор за международни преводи, като неговият токен XLM в момента се търгува на 0,23 USD при пазарна капитализация от 7,2 млрд. USD. Най-голямото му предимство са ниските разходи и високата скорост на транзакциите, което го прави привлекателно решение за финансови институции. Освен това Stellar се отличава с големи партньорства и активно развитие. С нарастващото търсене на ефективни трансгранични плащания, се очаква XLM да постигне по-широко приемане, което може да доведе до сериозен ръст в следващия bull run. Maxi Doge (MAXI): Мемкойн за максимални „pump“-ове Maxi Doge изгражда своята марка около високорискова търговия и силна мем общност. С tokenomics, насочен към маркетинг, staking и ликвидност, MAXI привлича инвеститори, които търсят бързи печалби. Акцентът е върху механизма за staking и състезания с награди, при които притежателите могат да получават бонуси чрез участие в събития и общностни предизвикателства. Въпреки характера „high risk – high reward“, Maxi Doge има реален шанс да се превърне в ново поколение мемкойн, способен да се конкурира директно със SHIB в следващия bull run. Защо тези токени могат да надминат Shiba Inu (SHIB)? За разлика от SHIB, който разчита основно на спекулации и мем култура, четирите токена по-горе предлагат реална стойност: Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): пионер в BitcoinFi и AI Auditing Dogecoin (DOGE): огромна общност и реални платежни приложения Stellar (XLM): фокус върху трансгранични плащания Maxi Doge (MAXI): използва силата на мем общността + търговски стратегии Инвеститорите днес търсят проекти с ясни приложения и устойчив потенциал за растеж. Благодарение на тези характеристики, четирите токена могат да се превърнат във водещи на пазара и дори да надминат доходността, която Shiba Inu постигна в миналото.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|DOGE|TRADING|XLM,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 15:43:08

The first mint arrives just days after the trading debut of the STBL token. Franklin Templeton is among the early adopters of the USST stablecoin, which splits the principal and yield components. The fund, which is among the tokenization pioneers on multiple chains, injected $100M into the STBL project. BREAKING: Franklin Templeton partners with STBL, minting $100M in $USST as part of the innovative Stablecoin 2.0 project. pic.twitter.com/HRkgYrnLg9 — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) September 18, 2025 As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, STBL is a stablecoin project by the co-founder of Tether, Reeve Collins. STBL takes yield-bearing products such as money market funds and turns them into stablecoins backed by the principal, as well as YLD tokens reflecting the yield. Franklin Templeton is expected to provide the assets for its first USST mint, as the STBL team announced through its social media. The STBL stablecoins resemble zero-coupon bonds, which split the principal and yield. For STBL users, the option is open to retain each of the components, or sell them to willing third parties. The USST token is still in beta testing, and the partnership with Franklin Templeton will complete the mint after the launch. Franklin Templeton already has experience with tokenizing money market products, but this time the fund will use the infrastructure of STBL. STBL has already built its initial minting demo, where traders will be able to use on-chain RWA to create USST. The ecosystem is still in its pre-launch stage and has yet to show the real demand and activity. The first eligible products to be deposited will be BUIDL tokens by BlackRock and Ondo tokenized assets. STBL trades near all-time high STBL retained most of its post-launch gains. The token is still trading around $0.18, expanding by 323% since its launch. STBL recovered close to its higher range | Source: Coingecko The token still relies on spot markets and has limited derivative positions. Despite the high-profile launch, the token still has only 7,512 holders. Additionally, the low float is raising doubts about the price sustainability. STBL trading also still relies heavily on PancakeSwap. The token’s top trader realized $3.1M in gains after rapid initial selling, while the second-best trader extracted $2.7M. The token still has around $3.2M in its biggest liquidity pool . STBL still awaits more listings, as it only has Binance Alpha status, with no full spot listing. The token expects to significantly increase its float in the next 12 months, to 36% of the total supply. On-chain analysts also noted that the STBL token is not entirely transparent about ownership, locked tokens, and selling pressure. Not all wallets are labeled, and there are signs that some of the market makers sold STBL early, locking in profits. For now, those activities have not crashed STBL, but have been pointed out as a warning. STBL is one of the latest major projects to choose BSC for its launch. The token’s TGE preceded another BNB rally, adding to the bullish factors. Following the launch of several high-profile tokens, Binance’s native coin broke its record at over $1,003. Recently, Franklin Templeton also announced a partnership with Binance, expanding the reach of tokenized funds.

A trial run is scheduled in Colombia before MoneyGram expands to other markets. It’s a carefully planned decision, as most remittances in Colombia come from abroad, usually in USD. The underlying blockchain is powered by Stellar and Crossmint , with customer balances held in Circle’s USDC. While MoneyGram’s new wallet appears to be a good way to bring existing MoneyGram customers into stablecoins, support for other cryptocurrencies is limited. So, it’s a bit of a stretch to say MoneyGram has launched a new digital crypto wallet – it’s more like a cross-border remittance tool that uses USDC as the main currency, similar to how Ripple operates for large banks. MoneyGram’s tool seems less capable than a true digital wallet like Best Wallet . Not only can Best Wallet handle stablecoins and fiat payments, but it also supports a wide range of crypto assets across multiple blockchains. Let’s look more closely at what makes Best Wallet so useful. Best Wallet – A Mobile-First Crypto App Connecting Multiple Blockchains Best Wallet aims to be the only crypto wallet you’ll ever need. It allows you to manage your entire crypto portfolio from a single, easy-to-use mobile interface, even if you’ve never used crypto before. Managing multiple blockchains can be confusing. Even with popular crypto wallets like MetaMask, it can be hard to know exactly what assets you own. Best Wallet simplifies managing, buying, and selling your crypto within a single ecosystem. That means you can make cross-chain swaps between platforms like Solana and BNB without leaving the app. Even if you’re searching for presale tokens, Best Wallet offers an entire marketplace full of vetted presales to choose from, all of which integrate directly with the app. Best Wallet isn’t just convenient, it also uses innovative security features. Your wallet is protected by Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology, so even if you lose your phone, you can download a secure cloud backup to Best Wallet without risking your assets. While you wait for MoneyGram’s digital app to expand coverage to your area, Best Wallet is available now. You can visit the official Best Wallet site for a download link, or if you’re interested in learning more, you can go to our ‘What is the Best Wallet Token’ guide . That’s right: Best Wallet even features its own unique utility token, $BEST . It’s an asset all on its own, but it can also be used to reduce your transaction fees when you swap crypto across the Best Wallet network. That’s especially useful when you’re swapping for new presales, where $BEST will boost your margins. In fact, $BEST holders also gain exclusive access to some presales before they become available to the rest of the market, guaranteeing you’ll be among the first to get cheap tokens before a crypto project takes off. That’s not all. Holding $BEST also grants you the right to participate in the Best Wallet DAO, allowing you to help shape the future of the Best Wallet project. If there’s a feature or blockchain you’d like to see added to the app, this is the best way to make your voice heard. You can download Best Wallet today, but the $BEST token is still in the presale phase. If you buy now, you can secure annual staking rewards of up to 83%. It’s worth holding onto, as our Best Wallet Token price predictions indicate $BEST could reach $0.62 by the end of 2026. Don’t wait, as the $BEST presale has already raised nearly $16M in token sales. So far, the price has reached $0.025655, with an end-of-year release planned for the token. It’s a dynamic presale, so the price will change over time. Purchase $BEST today before the presale ends. All crypto products are volatile. Make sure to always do your own research before investing and only invest what you’re prepared to lose. This article is not financial advice.

This bold prediction has sent waves through the market. The current ETH price has investors considering the possibility that the bullish outlook might unfold based on rising institutional demand, inflows into ETFs, and increased network adoption. This latest Ethereum price prediction has reignited debate over how high ETH could climb before 2026. Ethereum Price Prediction Sees Breakout Beyond $4,866 Ethereum stays firm around $4,500, as traders await the next report by the Federal Reserve on its new rates. Despite short-term volatility, confidence around the network remains strong. ETH Price today reflects cautious optimism as institutional flows continue to climb. Recent Ethereum News shows that treasury firms and ETFs have accumulated nearly 3.8% of all Ether since June, providing a strong base for further growth. Standard Chartered has updated its Ethereum Price Prediction, raising its year-end target to $7,500, citing rising enterprise adoption and robust demand for stablecoins built on Ethereum. Analysts argue that the surge in tokenization and on-chain activity could push the ETH Price beyond previous highs of $4,866 before the end of Q3. While Citi takes a more conservative view at $4,300, the broader narrative favors upside momentum. With Ethereum News highlighting institutional confidence, the path toward new highs looks increasingly likely. Remittix Emerges As A Long-Term Contender Beside Ethereum Remittix is fast becoming one of the standout PayFi projects of 2025. While Standard Chartered’s latest Ethereum Price Prediction calls for a surge toward $7,500 by year-end, analysts argue that emerging projects like Remittix could capture just as much attention.

Imagine a scenario where the very activity on a platform directly benefits its token holders. This isn’t just a dream; the BounceBit Foundation is actively considering directing platform fees towards strategic BB buybacks . What Exactly Are BB Buybacks and How Will They Work? At its core, a BB buyback involves a protocol using its generated revenue to repurchase its own tokens from the open market. In BounceBit’s case, the Foundation is exploring a ‘fee switch’ on BounceBit Trade. This mechanism would essentially divert a portion of the trading fees collected on the platform. Instead of these fees being used for other operational expenses or distributed differently, they would be used to buy back BB tokens. These repurchased tokens can then be ‘burned’ (permanently removed from circulation) or held in a treasury, both of which aim to reduce the total circulating supply. Why Are BB Buybacks a Potential Game-Changer for BB Token Holders? The prospect of consistent BB buybacks holds significant promise for the BounceBit ecosystem and its token holders. This strategy often creates a positive feedback loop, enhancing the token’s value over time. Here are some key benefits: Increased Scarcity: By reducing the total supply of BB tokens, each remaining token theoretically becomes more valuable. Enhanced Demand: A continuous buying pressure from the Foundation can stabilize and even push up the token’s price. Investor Confidence: It signals a strong commitment from the project to its token’s long-term health and value. Sustainable Growth: Tying token value directly to platform activity creates a robust, self-sustaining economic model. What Challenges Might BounceBit Face in Implementing BB Buybacks? While the concept of BB buybacks is exciting, implementing such a significant change requires careful planning and consideration. The BounceBit Foundation is currently reviewing its revenue sharing model to ensure a smooth transition. Key areas of focus include: Technical Implementation: Ensuring the fee switch and buyback mechanism are secure and efficient. Community Consensus: Gaining widespread support from the BB token holder community, as these changes often involve governance proposals. Market Dynamics: Strategically executing buybacks to minimize market manipulation and maximize positive impact. Transparency: Clearly communicating the process and results of the buybacks to maintain trust. What Are the Next Steps for BounceBit’s Buyback Initiative? The BounceBit Foundation’s announcement is an initial step, signaling its serious intent to pursue BB buybacks . The next phase involves a thorough review of their existing revenue sharing model. This detailed examination will help identify the most effective and equitable channels for directing platform fees towards buybacks. Community feedback and engagement will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the final implementation. Ultimately, the goal is to create a more robust and rewarding ecosystem for all participants, with the potential for increased value driven by the platform’s success. In summary, BounceBit’s exploration of using trade fees for BB buybacks represents a forward-thinking approach to tokenomics. If successfully implemented, this strategy could significantly enhance the value proposition of the BB token, fostering greater investor confidence and creating a more sustainable growth trajectory for the entire BounceBit ecosystem. It’s a compelling development that many in the crypto space will be watching closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BB buybacks? BB buybacks refer to the process where the BounceBit Foundation uses a portion of the trading fees generated on its platform, BounceBit Trade, to repurchase BB tokens from the open market. This reduces the circulating supply of the token. How do BB buybacks benefit token holders? By reducing the supply of BB tokens, buybacks can increase scarcity, potentially driving up the token’s price. They also demonstrate the project’s commitment to long-term value, which can boost investor confidence. When will BounceBit implement the fee switch for BB buybacks? The BounceBit Foundation is currently reviewing its revenue sharing model and the specific channels for implementation. A definitive timeline has not yet been announced, but it is an active consideration. What is BounceBit Trade? BounceBit Trade is a platform within the BounceBit ecosystem where users can engage in trading activities, generating fees that the Foundation now plans to potentially redirect towards BB token buybacks. Will all trade fees go towards BB buybacks? The Foundation is considering a ‘fee switch,’ which implies a portion of the platform fees would be directed towards buybacks. The exact percentage or model is part of their ongoing review. What are your thoughts on BounceBit’s plan for BB buybacks?

Big moves around Hydra, growing DeFi activity, and speculation about regulatory clarity are reinforcing the belief that ADA could reclaim its all-time high. Remittix also enters the discussion, not as a direct competitor in adoption scale yet, but offering a different growth profile built on utility, security, and early traction that some experts think could outperform ADA if current trends continue. Cardano Price Prediction: Institutional Momentum and Upside Potential Cardano’s network has shown recent signs of institutional confidence. ADA has attracted hundreds of millions in inflows this year, especially as large asset managers explore potential ETF products and institutional portfolios look for long-term smart contract platforms. More bullish scenarios see $3 or slightly above, but those depend heavily on catalysts such as ETF approvals, regulatory support, and successful upgrades like Hydra. Risks include competition from Solana and Ethereum, delayed deployments, and macroeconomic headwinds. Why Some Analysts Think Remittix May Outshine Cardano Remittix offers a different angle when comparing potential growth and risk. While Cardano draws strength from institutional moves and established network credibility, Remittix is being built from the ground up with product features and metrics that suggest a higher growth ceiling for early backers. It has sold over 665 million tokens, is priced at $0.1080, and has raised over $26 million. More than that, its trust signals and early infrastructure are attractive for those seeking upside beyond what more mature projects might offer. Remittix has been fully verified by CertiK and now ranks #1 among pre-launch tokens for security and transparency. Its beta wallet launch is underway, and community testers are actively evaluating it. A 15% USDT referral program rewards those who help expand adoption. Remittix already has two centralized exchange listings (BitMart and LBank) secured, with a third listing in view. Remittix is also running a $250,000 giveaway to boost engagement and visibility. Here are features that give Remittix distinct potential relative to ADA: ● Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency● Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem● Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd● Utility first token powering real transaction volume● Global payout rails are already integrated and expanding These features reinforce that Remittix is not just riding hype but executing in ways that could enable performance that exceeds Cardano’s during certain market phases. Its early stage status gives risk, but also an opportunity that many see as offering higher return potential. ADA’s Forecast vs Remittix’s Promise Cardano price prediction for 2025 includes scenarios where ADA reaches $2.05 and, under ideal conditions, climbs toward $3, supported by institutional moves, technical upgrades, and positive market sentiment. On the other hand, Remittix’s CertiK verification, active beta wallet, robust referral incentives, and multiple exchange listings suggest it could outshine Cardano in terms of upside early entrants might realize. For those charting investments with growth in mind, ADA remains a strong bet; Remittix may be the sleeper hit to watch.

On its very first day of trading, this new XRP ETF astonishingly surpassed $24 million in trading volume. This figure has not just met, but significantly exceeded, market expectations, according to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. It’s a remarkable start that has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. What Makes This XRP ETF Debut So Significant? This impressive trading volume is a clear indicator of strong market interest. Balchunas highlighted that the XRPR’s first-day performance is five times greater than the volume recorded by the XRP futures ETF on its own debut. This stark comparison underscores the immediate impact and demand for this spot-backed XRP ETF product. The substantial volume suggests a growing appetite among institutional and retail investors for regulated investment vehicles tied directly to XRP. It represents a significant step forward in the mainstream acceptance and accessibility of the digital asset. Understanding the XRP ETF: A Gateway to Digital Assets For those new to the concept, an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities. In this case, an XRP ETF directly holds XRP, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without needing to buy and store the digital asset themselves. This simplifies the investment process and often appeals to traditional investors. ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, offering liquidity and regulatory oversight. The introduction of a spot XRP ETF like XRPR provides a regulated and accessible pathway for a broader range of investors to participate in the XRP market, potentially driving further adoption and price stability. Why the Surge in XRP ETF Interest? Several factors likely contribute to the overwhelming interest in the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF . Firstly, there’s the ongoing anticipation surrounding XRP’s regulatory clarity. Recent legal developments have fueled optimism, leading many to view XRP as a more viable investment. Secondly, the broader trend of institutional adoption in the crypto space is undeniable. Large financial players are increasingly looking for compliant and secure ways to allocate capital into digital assets. An ETF provides exactly that, reducing the complexities and risks associated with direct crypto ownership. Finally, the impressive performance of other spot crypto ETFs, such as those tracking Bitcoin, has set a precedent. Investors are now more familiar and comfortable with these products, leading to a quicker uptake for new offerings like the XRPR. Navigating the Future: Potential Impact of the XRP ETF The immediate success of the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF could have far-reaching implications for both XRP and the wider cryptocurrency market. A sustained high trading volume might signal increased liquidity for XRP, potentially leading to greater price stability and less volatility in the long run. Moreover, the success of XRPR could pave the way for more crypto-backed ETFs to launch. This would further integrate digital assets into traditional finance, making them more accessible and legitimate in the eyes of mainstream investors. It also adds a layer of validation to XRP as a digital asset. However, it’s important to consider potential challenges. Regulatory environments can shift, and market sentiment remains a powerful force. While the initial volume is exciting, long-term performance will depend on continued investor confidence and broader market trends. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts For those interested in the evolving crypto landscape, the debut of the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF offers several key takeaways. It highlights the growing demand for regulated crypto investment products. Keep an eye on how the trading volume evolves over the coming weeks and months, as this will be a crucial indicator of sustained interest. Key aspects to monitor: Volume Trends: Is the high trading volume sustainable, or will it normalize? Market Reaction: How does XRP’s price react to the ETF’s performance? Regulatory Updates: Any new developments regarding XRP’s legal status will continue to influence investor sentiment. Comparative Performance: How does XRPR stack up against other crypto ETFs over time? A New Era for XRP Investment The impressive $24 million trading volume for the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF on its first day is undeniably a landmark event. It not only showcases a robust demand for regulated XRP exposure but also signals a maturing cryptocurrency market. This strong debut could be a harbinger of deeper institutional integration and broader investor participation in the digital asset space. The future of XRP investment looks brighter than ever, opening up exciting possibilities for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR)? The Rex-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) is an Exchange Traded Fund that holds XRP directly, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency through a regulated financial product traded on traditional exchanges. How much trading volume did the XRP ETF achieve on its first day? The Rex-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) achieved over $24 million in trading volume on its debut, significantly exceeding market expectations. Why is the high trading volume of the XRP ETF important? High trading volume indicates strong investor demand and interest in regulated XRP investment products.

Spot ETFs typically offer more direct price exposure. What are the potential benefits of investing in an XRP ETF? Benefits include easier access to XRP exposure without direct crypto ownership, regulatory oversight, and liquidity through traditional exchange trading.

51932292,584683,1758210685,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51932292.jpeg,Инвеститорите в Dogecoin насочват вниманието си към нова монета – прогноза за ръст 93 пъти,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-stars-93x-growth-bg/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) премина през значителни колебания през последните седмици. Междувременно „китовете“ – големите инвеститори – активно търсят нови възможности за диверсификация на портфейлите си. Анализ на ценовата тенденция на Dogecoin Първоначално възприеман като развлекателен проект, Dogecoin днес е седмата по пазарна капитализация криптовалута сред мемкойните. Наскоро DOGE достигна най-високата си стойност за последните 3 години – 0,43 USD, но след това претърпя лека корекция. В момента DOGE се търгува около 0,3832 USD, което е спад с 2% за последните 24 часа и 5% за седмицата, след силен ръст преди това. Това кара големите инвеститори да започнат да търсят възможности в нововъзникващи проекти. Китове, фокусирани върху нов проект Целият пазар на мемкойни е в корекционна фаза, като много токени поевтиняват, включително Floki (FLOKI). В този контекст един проект предизвиква сериозно внимание – Crypto All-Stars (STARS) – платформа, разработваща MemeVault, първия агрегаторен staking протокол, създаден специално за мемкойни. Само за 3 месеца от ICO-то си STARS е събрал над 18 млн. USD, със среден дневен капиталов приток от около 200 000 USD. Възможността за покупка в пресейл е отворена до 20 декември, при текуща цена от едва 0,0016782 USD. Според прогнозите, след листването STARS може да нарасне 11 пъти в краткосрочен план и дори да достигне ръст от 93 пъти до януари 2025 г. Акцент: Уникална staking платформа Crypto All-Stars привлича внимание с MemeVault – първата платформа, която позволява на инвеститорите да stake-ват няколко мемкойна едновременно и да получават награди. В момента родният staking на STARS носи APY доходност от 376% – изключително атрактивна за общността. Копаене и пазарни тенденции Междувременно Dogecoin печели от обединеното копаене с Litecoin, което подобрява доходността на миньорите, но същевременно създава и сериозен натиск за продажби. Паралелно с това Bitcoin се приближава до историческото ниво от 100 000 USD, надминавайки алткойните, което кара инвеститорите да бъдат по-внимателни при оценката на краткосрочния потенциал на DOGE. Защо Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) може да бъде следващият ви избор Докато Dogecoin, Stellar и Maxi Doge запазват своята привлекателност, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) доказва, че може да се превърне в доминиращо име в предстоящата вълна BitcoinFi. За разлика от мемкойните, които разчитат единствено на общността, HYPER предлага реална екосистема, съчетаваща AI, DeFi и staking, за да създаде устойчивa стойност. С текуща пресейл цена от едва 0,0002 USD, HYPER предоставя рядка възможност за ранните инвеститори – преди листването му на големите борси. Освен това, общността Hyper Army бързо се разраства, организирайки събития, giveaway кампании и staking програми, превръщайки HYPER не просто в токен, а в глобално движение. Ако търсите проект с огромен потенциал за растеж по време на bull run през 2025 г., Bitcoin Hyper е шанс, който не бива да пропускате.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|BTC|FLOKI|LTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 15:51:25

These moves are adding fuel to the argument that SOL is heading toward $300+ levels. Remittix (RTX) enters the picture as a token that, while smaller, is laying down foundations such as security, community incentives, upcoming wallet beta, and CEX listings that may contrast sharply with SOL’s institutional momentum. Comparing both helps highlight what makes Remittix attractive at this moment. Solana Powered by Institutional Capital and Technical Breakouts Solana’s chart action is showing resistance around the $245 to $250 zone, and analysts are watching for a clean breakout past that barrier. Technical signals from Solana’s accumulation, decreasing exchange reserves, and trendline strength support the view that SOL could be targeting $300 in the next few months. Remittix Stakes Its Claim in the Same Rally Narrative When comparing Remittix to Solana now, several differences stand out. SOL’s strength comes from massive institutional capital flows and technical setups. Remittix offers an angle of grassroots momentum plus structural features such as security verification, community incentives, and fast-moving tokenomics. Remittix has sold over 665 million tokens, is priced at $0.1080, and has raised over $26 million in funding. On top of that, Remittix has just unlocked its 15% USDT referral program for everyone who refers new token buyers, claimable every 24 hours via the Remittix dashboard. The Remittix team is now verified by CertiK, ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens on their platform, adding trust. Remittix wallet beta is live, with community members actively testing. A $250,000 giveaway is underway. Remittix has secured two CEX listings at the $20 million and $22 million raised thresholds. A third centralized exchange listing is in view. Here are features that set Remittix apart: ● Audited by CertiK, trust and transparency are foundations being built into every layer● Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries widen utility beyond speculative trading● Officially RANKED #1 on CertiK for Pre-Launch Tokens● Mass market appeal beyond just crypto natives opens a broader audience● Solving a real-world $19T payments problem Where SOL and Remittix May Land In This Bull Run Solana appears set for serious upside if it breaks above resistance around $250 and holds support near $210 to $220, with $300+ becoming a realistic target if momentum continues. Remittixpositions itself as a strong alternative for those seeking low-entry opportunities. As SOL rides institution backing and technical breakout signals, Remittix offers a fresh angle for those looking beyond major tokens, blending incentives, infrastructure, and community in its growth path.

The platform is a new DeFi protocol that’s reshaping crypto lending and borrowing. Mutuum Finance has had 5 presales to date with the sixth live now at a price of $0.035. The presale of MUTM currently has 16370 investors and has raised more than $15.9 million. Whereas DOGE surfs on memecoin popularity and hype community-based, Mutuum Finance is different as it provides actual utility and long-term growth opportunities from its unique on-chain financial system. This volatility dichotomy of hype and utility-led innovation is driving speculation that capital may flow from Dogecoin into Mutuum Finance as the market looks for sustainable alternatives. Dogecoin Poised to Record Potential Pullback Below $0.20 Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.2678 currently, showing minor decline over the last day as recent gains are observed slowing. The intense surge over the last week has pushed price towards resistance levels, and on-chain metrics signal that profit-taking is gaining speed. Support levels of $0.22-$0.25 will be one to watch; breaking below would offer room for further retracements. Compared to meme-driven volatility within DOGE, Mutuum Finance is being considered by more investors as having more solid structural potential for returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance has registered gargantuan presale momentum with more than 16,370 investors buying coins and a total of more than $15.9 million raised to date. Tokens can be bought in Phase 6 at the rate of $0.035 per token. Its multi-phase pricing mechanism is an incentives program and people who enter early get maximum ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program, inviting developers, security researchers and ethical hackers to come and test its security. They get rewarded for discovering and reporting bugs that have the potential to jeopardize the security of the protocol. The reward and incentive will be proportionate to the severity of the problem, from small bugs to severe vulnerabilities. This will benefit not just the protocol but also users and create trust from investors. Liquidity Management, Volatility and Market risk Mutuum Finance has adopted a new paradigm in an attempt to reduce market risk, volatility, and stability of their systems even under conditions of liquidity stress. Liquidity depth and Loan to Value (LTV) will be varied based on the condition of the market. Policies are firm under conditions of high volatility in an attempt to reduce exposure to risks and elastic in stability. The use of reserve funds also covers, and it increases with the proportion of risks so that it can protect the stakeholders. Establishing a Borderless, Interoperable and Open-source Ecosystem Besides system security, Mutuum Finance will also be a community-focused DeFi platform. Presale buy, reward plans and system security audit are all targeted towards the duality of the venture, ensuring long-term stability and collaborative community efforts. Mutuum Finance is a secure and scalable DeFi platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is dominating investor interest as Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing weakness. DOGE risks a potential pullback below $0.20, but MUTM continues to gain momentum with 16,370+ buyers and over $15.9M raised in its presale. Stage 6 tokens are now at $0.035, to increase in the next stage, giving early investors the perfect entry point. With a backing of a $50K CertiK bug bounty, good liquidity control, and community-driven DeFi ecosystem, MUTM offers long-term utility over hype. Lock in your tokens now in Stage 6 before prices increase.

Even though BTC experienced price fluctuations, there was still a significant buying pressure observed among retail and institutional investors in the market. Market Bets On Bitcoin Are Heavily Heating Up Bitcoin’s renewed upward strength may have slowed down, but investors’ sentiment was not thwarted by the negative price action. CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain data analytics platform, has released a report indicating that buying pressure has experienced a significant surge despite a slight pullback in BTC’s price . In the quick-take post, Burak Kesmeci, a market expert, highlighted that Bitcoin is witnessing a sharp surge of inflows into accumulation addresses . These accumulation addresses, which are frequently regarded as powerful players in the market, are consuming huge quantities of BTC even in the face of persistent macroeconomic uncertainty. According to the report, this powerful wave of accumulation was identified prior to the United States Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision . Such a buying spree ahead of the Fed’s decision suggests that market players are acting strategically by choosing to stack more BTC in anticipation of increased volatility and possible macroeconomic changes. Burak Kesmeci noted that over 29,685 BTC were seen flowing into accumulation addresses just hours before the Fed’s rate decision. Data shared by the expert reveals that the massive inflows mark the second-largest single-day inflow of 2025. With long-term holders placing themselves ahead of potential catalysts that could define the next phase of the market cycle, this pattern is indicative of growing confidence in Bitcoin’s resiliency. Following this buying spree by key investors, the total amount of BTC held in accumulation addresses has now reached approximately 2.84 million BTC. At the same time, the average realized price cost basis of these addresses has increased to $72,437 per BTC. A Rapid Buying In The Option Market The ongoing buying pressure currently observed around Bitcoin is also displayed in other key metrics. In a recent post on the X platform, Glassnode, a financial and on-chain platform, reported that the Bitcoin options market is booming as traders scramble to get positions. Glassnode revealed this wave of fresh optimism after examining the BTC Options Net Premium Strike Heatmap. BTC’s buying pressure comes as the flagship asset gains traction, with its price only 6.8% away from its all-time high, heading into the most anticipated FOMC meeting of this cycle. In the meantime, Glassnode highlighted that options traders are rapidly buying options in order to protect or position themselves for a volatility spike. This trend reflects the uncertainty of the market and the anticipation of a major move in the future.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|BTC Options Net Premium Strike Heatmap|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Burak Kesmeci|CryptoQuant|Fed|Federal Reserve|FOMC meeting|Glassnode,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 16:00:07

Între timp, „balenele” – marii investitori – caută activ noi oportunități pentru d...",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-stars-93x-bitcoin-hyper-2025-ro/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) a trecut prin fluctuații semnificative în ultimele săptămâni. Între timp, „balenele” – marii investitori – caută activ noi oportunități pentru diversificarea portofoliilor. Analiza tendinței prețului Dogecoin Inițial perceput ca un proiect de divertisment, Dogecoin a ajuns astăzi să fie a șaptea criptomonedă ca capitalizare de piață între meme coin-uri. Recent, DOGE a atins cel mai ridicat nivel din ultimii 3 ani – 0,43 USD, dar ulterior a suferit o ușoară corecție. În prezent, DOGE se tranzacționează în jur de 0,3832 USD, ceea ce reprezintă o scădere de 2% în ultimele 24 de ore și 5% în ultima săptămână, după o creștere puternică anterioară. Această evoluție îi determină pe marii investitori să caute oportunități în proiecte emergente. Balenele, concentrate pe un nou proiect Întreaga piață a meme coin-urilor se află într-o fază de corecție, multe tokenuri ieftinindu-se, inclusiv Floki (FLOKI). În acest context, un proiect atrage atenția în mod deosebit – Crypto All-Stars (STARS) – o platformă care dezvoltă MemeVault, primul protocol de staking agregator dedicat meme coin-urilor. Doar în 3 luni de la ICO, STARS a strâns peste 18 milioane USD, cu un flux mediu zilnic de capital de aproximativ 200.000 USD. Posibilitatea de a cumpăra în presale rămâne deschisă până la 20 decembrie, la un preț actual de doar 0,0016782 USD. Conform prognozelor, după listare, STARS ar putea crește de 11 ori pe termen scurt și chiar să atingă o creștere de 93 de ori până în ianuarie 2025. Punctul forte: Platformă unică de staking Crypto All-Stars atrage atenția prin MemeVault – prima platformă care le permite investitorilor să facă staking cu mai multe meme coin-uri simultan și să primească recompense. În prezent, staking-ul nativ al STARS oferă un randament APY de 376% – un procent extrem de atractiv pentru comunitate. Minerit și tendințele pieței Între timp, Dogecoin beneficiază de pe urma mineritului combinat cu Litecoin, ceea ce îmbunătățește profitabilitatea minerilor, dar în același timp generează și o presiune semnificativă la vânzare. În paralel, Bitcoin se apropie de nivelul istoric de 100.000 USD, depășind altcoin-urile, fapt ce îi face pe investitori mai prudenți în evaluarea potențialului pe termen scurt al DOGE. De ce Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) poate fi următoarea ta alegere În timp ce Dogecoin, Stellar și Maxi Doge își păstrează atractivitatea, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) demonstrează că poate deveni un nume dominant în valul BitcoinFi care urmează. Spre deosebire de meme coin-urile care se bazează exclusiv pe comunitate, HYPER oferă un ecosistem real, combinând AI, DeFi și staking, pentru a crea valoare sustenabilă. Cu un preț de presale de doar 0,0002 USD, HYPER oferă o oportunitate rară pentru investitorii timpurii – înainte de listarea pe marile burse. În plus, comunitatea Hyper Army se extinde rapid, organizând evenimente, campanii giveaway și programe de staking, transformând HYPER nu doar într-un token, ci într-o mișcare globală. Dacă ești în căutarea unui proiect cu un potențial uriaș de creștere în timpul bull run-ului din 2025, Bitcoin Hyper este o oportunitate pe care nu ar trebui să o ratezi.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|FLOKI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 16:00:08

This announcement, while not disclosing the exact size of the acquisition, marks a pivotal moment for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency market. For many, this strategic decision by a publicly traded entity underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as a valuable asset. It’s a development that will undoubtedly spark discussions among investors and market watchers alike. Why is Reliance Global Group’s ETH Purchase Significant? When a Nasdaq-listed company like Reliance Global Group ventures into cryptocurrency, it sends a powerful message. This isn’t just another speculative investment; it represents a calculated step by a traditional financial player into the digital economy. Validation of Ethereum: An institutional ETH purchase lends credibility to Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Broadening Adoption: It suggests that more traditional companies are exploring ways to integrate digital assets into their balance sheets or operational strategies. Market Confidence: Such an acquisition can bolster investor confidence, potentially attracting more institutional capital into the crypto market. The decision to invest in ETH specifically, rather than other cryptocurrencies, highlights Ethereum’s established network, smart contract capabilities, and its ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and its subsequent upgrades), which promises greater scalability and efficiency. What Does This ETH Purchase Mean for Institutional Adoption? The trend of institutional adoption has been a key narrative in the crypto world for years. While Bitcoin often grabs headlines for corporate treasury allocations, an ETH purchase by a public company broadens the scope of this institutional interest. This move by Reliance Global Group could serve as a blueprint for other companies considering similar ventures. It demonstrates that the regulatory and operational hurdles, while present, are not insurmountable for those willing to innovate. Key Considerations for Companies: Risk Management: Integrating volatile assets like ETH requires robust risk management frameworks. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial for any institutional crypto involvement. Long-Term Strategy: An ETH purchase is often part of a broader, long-term strategy rather than a short-term speculative play. The company’s decision not to disclose the size of the acquisition is also noteworthy. It suggests a cautious, yet firm, entry into the market, perhaps to test the waters before making larger commitments. Navigating the Future: The Impact of Institutional ETH Purchase The entry of more traditional players like Reliance Global Group into the Ethereum ecosystem has several potential long-term impacts. It could lead to increased liquidity, greater market stability, and the development of more sophisticated financial products around Ethereum. This strategic ETH purchase is a testament to the evolving perception of digital assets. They are no longer solely seen as speculative instruments but as legitimate components of a diversified investment portfolio, even for publicly traded companies. In conclusion, Reliance Global Group’s first ETH purchase is more than just a transaction; it’s a significant milestone that underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the undeniable pull of decentralized finance for institutional players. As more companies follow suit, we can expect to see further integration of digital assets into the global financial landscape.

According to him, these shifts put XRP in a rare position to rise above other digital assets. Global rules and banking standards are also moving in Ripple’s favor at the same time. Pundit: Institutional Rails And Legal Clarity Cement XRP’s Role Pumpius stresses that Ripple’s victory in its long fight with the SEC is not just a legal win but a turning point. After years in court, XRP now has the strongest legal clarity of any cryptocurrency in the U.S. Related Reading: Market Expert Says XRP Price At $1,000 Will Happen, But The Timeline Is Different He also points to Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, its enterprise stablecoin backed by reserves at BNY Mellon. Pumpius notes that this connection matters because BNY Mellon safeguards trillions in assets for global giants, including BlackRock and the U.S. Treasury. Tying a stablecoin to XRP’s payment rails creates what he calls a “stable reserve army” that strengthens trust in Ripple’s network. On the banking front, Pumpius explains that Ripple is not only licensed as a money service business but has also applied for the highly difficult New York banking charter. He adds that Ripple has taken it a step further by applying for a Federal Reserve master account, the highest privilege in the U.S. banking system. If granted, Ripple would not just compete with banks but effectively act as one, placing XRP at the center of financial settlements. XRP ETFs, Ripple’s Global Standards, And Tech Drive Convergence Pumpius notes that nearly 20 XRP spot ETFs are awaiting approval. If greenlit, these funds could open the doors to trillions of dollars from institutional investors and push XRP into the ranks of Wall Street assets overnight. Another major shift is the migration to ISO 20022, a global messaging standard that all major banks must adhere to by November. Pumpius points out that XRP has been ready for this for years, meaning RippleNet can easily connect with traditional banking rails the moment the change takes effect.

At the same time, he notes that the DNA Protocol is quietly developing biometric and genomic identity tools on the XRP Ledger. This step could solve Know Your Customer checks at the deepest level, blending finance and digital identity in a way no other blockchain has achieved. Ripple benefits as he notes the rise of a supportive political environment. A pro-crypto administration is pushing laws that fit Ripple’s long-term playbook. With regulators and policymakers leaning in the same direction, he believes the stage is set for XRP to move into its endgame.

They often require time to gain investor awareness and trust. However, the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF defied these norms, demonstrating an instant, powerful demand. This unprecedented volume in such a short timeframe underscores a growing appetite among investors for regulated exposure to digital assets, even those considered more speculative like Dogecoin. Surprising Volume: $6 million in one hour significantly surpasses the typical first-day performance of most ETFs. Meme Coin Legitimacy: The strong debut suggests increasing acceptance and interest in meme coins through regulated investment vehicles. Investor Confidence: It indicates a rising confidence in the potential of cryptocurrencies, even Dogecoin, when offered in a familiar, accessible format like an ETF. Why Does a DOGE ETF Matter for Dogecoin’s Future? Dogecoin, famously started as a joke, has matured into a significant cryptocurrency with a loyal community. The introduction of a dedicated DOGE ETF provides a new layer of legitimacy and accessibility. Traditional investors, who might be hesitant to buy Dogecoin directly on crypto exchanges, can now gain exposure through their brokerage accounts. This move simplifies the investment process, potentially attracting a wave of new capital into the Dogecoin ecosystem. Furthermore, an ETF listing often brings increased visibility and institutional scrutiny. While Dogecoin’s price has always been susceptible to social media trends and celebrity endorsements, a regulated investment product like the DOGE ETF could introduce more stability and a more mature investment narrative. This development might encourage more analytical approaches to Dogecoin’s market movements, moving beyond pure speculation. The Broader Impact: Paving the Way for More Crypto ETFs? The spectacular launch of the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF could serve as a powerful precedent for the broader cryptocurrency market. Following the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the strong performance of a meme coin ETF suggests that regulatory bodies and financial institutions are becoming more comfortable with a wider range of digital assets. This could accelerate the approval and launch of ETFs for other altcoins, opening up diverse investment opportunities for mainstream investors. The benefits of such products are clear: Enhanced Accessibility: ETFs remove many of the technical barriers associated with direct crypto ownership. Regulatory Oversight: They offer a regulated environment, providing a layer of protection and familiarity for investors. Diversification: More crypto ETFs allow investors to diversify their portfolios across different digital assets with ease. However, challenges remain. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins, means that investors in a DOGE ETF must be prepared for potential price swings. Regulatory landscapes are also continuously evolving, which could impact future crypto ETF offerings. What’s Next for the DOGE ETF and Crypto Investments? The initial success of the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF is a strong indicator of market demand. Looking ahead, it will be crucial to observe how this ETF performs over a longer period. Sustained high volume and consistent investor interest could solidify Dogecoin’s position within the mainstream investment landscape. This could also inspire other financial innovators to explore similar products for other unique digital assets, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized world of crypto. For investors, the availability of a DOGE ETF presents an actionable insight: consider your risk tolerance. While it offers a convenient way to gain exposure, understanding Dogecoin’s fundamentals and market dynamics remains vital. This new product provides a valuable tool, but careful research is always paramount. Summary: A New Era for Meme Coins and Crypto ETFs The Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF has not just launched; it has exploded onto the scene, capturing significant investor attention and demonstrating robust demand. Its remarkable $6 million first-hour volume is a testament to the evolving acceptance of cryptocurrencies, even those born from internet culture, within traditional finance. This event marks a pivotal moment, potentially heralding a new era where meme coins gain broader institutional legitimacy and pave the way for a more diverse range of crypto ETFs. It’s an exciting time for digital asset investments, offering both unprecedented opportunities and familiar challenges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF?

This indicates exceptionally high initial investor interest and demand for the DOGE ETF . 3. How does a DOGE ETF benefit Dogecoin? A DOGE ETF provides Dogecoin with increased legitimacy and accessibility. It allows traditional investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin through regulated financial products, potentially attracting new capital and fostering a more stable investment narrative for the meme coin. 4.

The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, trading under the ticker XRPR, began trading today at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, marking a historic milestone for both Ripple’s XRP and the broader digital-asset market. The debut, highlighted on X by Xoom, has since been confirmed in official filings and issuer statements. What Backs the XRPR ETF According to its SEC-filed prospectus, XRPR is designed to give investors regulated, brokerage-account access to the price of XRP. The fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in XRP itself or in instruments providing direct exposure to XRP’s price. To maintain liquidity and meet regulatory requirements, the fund also holds a minimum of 40% of its assets in other exchange-traded funds or products that track XRP. This creates a dual exposure model: primarily direct XRP holdings, supplemented by positions in related ETFs and ETPs to ensure smooth trading and compliance. The first US-listed ETF with direct spot exposure to XRP is now live, here’s whats backing the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) at launch. https://t.co/lvdX5L686h pic.twitter.com/u2bFbla80u — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) September 18, 2025 Custody and Operations REX-Osprey employs a layered structure to safeguard and manage these assets. U.S. Bank, N.A. handles traditional fund accounting and securities custody, while Anchorage Digital Bank, N.A., serves as custodian for the digital-asset holdings. For sourcing XRP liquidity, the fund taps regulated crypto marketplaces such as Coinbase and Kraken, ensuring transparent, onshore trading routes. The prospectus also allows the use of a Cayman Islands subsidiary, a common approach for managing tax obligations and preserving regulated investment company (RIC) status. Why the Structure Matters This hybrid arrangement—direct XRP holdings combined with substantial ETF/ETP allocations—sets XRPR apart from a simple “vault-only” crypto trust. It balances investor demand for spot exposure with the diversification, tax efficiency, and operational safeguards required of U.S.-registered funds. The launch highlights the significant progress the market has made in incorporating digital assets into conventional financial offerings, reflecting a notable shift toward greater integration. With the SEC clearing a path for more spot crypto ETFs this year, XRPR provides a regulated, brokerage-friendly gateway for those seeking XRP exposure without managing private wallets or exchange accounts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Milestone for the XRP Market Xoom’s report captured the anticipation that surrounded today’s debut . For XRP advocates, XRPR represents not just another investment vehicle but a key step toward broader institutional adoption and liquidity. By providing traditional investors with a straightforward exchange-traded access point to XRP, the ETF is poised to increase market participation and further cement XRP’s role in the expanding digital asset environment. Investors considering XRPR should, however, review the official prospectus and risk disclosures. The ETF’s structure—while designed for compliance and accessibility—introduces elements such as subsidiary management and custodial counterparty risk that are worth understanding before allocation. With trading now underway, the REX-Osprey XRP ETF stands as the first U.S. spot product of its kind , signaling a new chapter for regulated XRP investment on Wall Street.

Totuși, analiștii prognozează că Ethereum ar putea atinge pragul important de 5.000 USD în perioada următoare. Această așteptare de creștere atrage deja fluxuri de capital din partea investitorilor către alte altcoin-uri de top. Altcoin-urile de top care atrag atenția Deși piața cripto continuă să se afle într-o fază de corecție încă de la sfârșitul anului 2024, cele cinci monede de mai jos rămân în centrul interesului investitorilor: Ripple (XRP) XRP se tranzacționează în prezent la 2,41 USD, cu o creștere de 14,62% în ultima lună. Problemele juridice cu SEC (Comisia pentru Valori Mobiliare și Burse din SUA) dau semne pozitive, în timp ce utilizarea XRP pentru plăți transfrontaliere accelerează. Ripple își extinde, de asemenea, parteneriatele cu instituții financiare, în special în regiunea Asia-Pacific, menținând o capitalizare de piață de 138 miliarde USD. Serviciul de On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) a contribuit la reducerea semnificativă a timpului de procesare și a costurilor pentru plăți corporative. BNB BNB se menține la un preț de 700,27 USD, cu o capitalizare de piață de 100,8 miliarde USD. Fiind tokenul nativ al platformei Binance – cea mai mare bursă de criptomonede din lume – BNB este utilizat din ce în ce mai mult în proiecte de tip DEX și DeFi. Datorită nivelului ridicat de securitate și a unui mediu stabil de tranzacționare, BNB se bucură de încrederea solidă a investitorilor instituționali. Ecosistemul BNB Chain trece printr-o adevărată explozie de noi proiecte. Solana (SOL) SOL se tranzacționează în prezent la 198,56 USD, cu o creștere de 3,79% în ultima lună. Datorită expansiunii puternice în domeniul NFT și DeFi, Solana se afirmă ca un concurent redutabil pentru Ethereum (ETH). Numărul tot mai mare de dezvoltatori, împreună cu volumul crescând al tranzacțiilor pe DEX-uri, au dus capitalizarea Solana la 95,8 miliarde USD. În special, stabilitatea rețelei mainnet și extinderea ecosistemului au fost apreciate de comunitate și de investitori. Dogecoin (DOGE) DOGE se tranzacționează la 0,3322 USD, în creștere cu 4,15% în ultima lună. Ca principal meme coin, Dogecoin continuă să atragă interesul investitorilor mari, ducând capitalizarea sa de piață la 48,9 miliarde USD. Sprijinul constant din partea lui Elon Musk, CEO Tesla, menține interesul pentru DOGE, în timp ce adoptarea acestuia ca mijloc de plată avansează tot mai mult. Punctul forte al Dogecoin rămâne comunitatea solidă și aplicabilitatea practică în creștere. Noul token care atrage atenția: Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) În contextul actual al pieței, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) se evidențiază ca un proiect promițător care atrage mult interes. Dezvoltat pe rețeaua Ethereum, acest proiect combină iconicul meme Pepe cu strategiile de tranzacționare de pe Wall Street, rezultând într-un concept unic. Ceea ce îl face special este faptul că WEPE nu se limitează doar la rolul de meme coin, ci are și aplicabilitate practică. Deținătorii de tokeni primesc acces la informații exclusive de tranzacționare și analize de piață, care contribuie la îmbunătățirea abilităților de investiții ale comunității.

Oferta totală a proiectului este fixată la 200 de miliarde de tokeni, iar în prezent se află în faza de presale, la un preț de pornire de doar 0,0002 USD. Prin intermediul comunității sale dedicate, „Wepe Army”, proiectul organizează activități dinamice, precum schimb de strategii de tranzacționare și concursuri săptămânale de trading.

For those tracking the pulse of the crypto world, understanding the bedrock of technological progress, especially in AI chips , is crucial. This is particularly relevant as the industry gears up for events like Bitcoin World, where cutting-edge tech often takes center stage. A recent seismic shift in the semiconductor industry promises to accelerate this evolution: Nvidia’s monumental $5 billion investment in Intel, forging a powerful alliance set to redefine the future of AI. Unpacking the Monumental Nvidia Intel Deal The technology world is abuzz with the news: Nvidia, a titan in accelerated computing, has agreed to acquire a substantial $5 billion stake in Intel, the long-standing chip manufacturing giant. This isn’t merely a financial transaction; it signals a profound strategic partnership aimed at developing “multiple generations” of advanced data center and PC products. Nvidia will secure approximately 4% of Intel’s shares at $23.28 each, instantly positioning itself as one of Intel’s most significant shareholders. The market reacted swiftly, with Intel shares surging by as much as 30% in early trading, underscoring the perceived value and potential of this collaboration. This Nvidia Intel deal is poised to create a formidable force, combining Nvidia’s AI leadership with Intel’s foundational x86 architecture and manufacturing prowess. Revolutionizing Data Center AI with Integrated Power At the core of this partnership lies a shared vision to propel data center AI capabilities to unprecedented levels. A key technological enabler will be Nvidia’s proprietary NVLink interface. Unlike conventional standards such as PCI Express, NVLink facilitates significantly faster data and control code transfers between CPUs and GPUs. This accelerated communication is absolutely critical for complex AI applications, which demand seamless, high-speed interaction across numerous GPUs to process immense workloads efficiently. For enterprise and hyperscale customers, this means a new era of performance. Intel is set to manufacture a bespoke line of x86 CPUs, specifically optimized to integrate flawlessly with Nvidia’s cutting-edge AI infrastructure platforms. This tailored approach promises to unlock new benchmarks in AI training and inference, providing a compelling solution for the most demanding computational environments. Elevating Consumer Computing with GPU Innovation The impact of this alliance extends beyond the high-stakes world of data centers, reaching directly into the consumer PC segment. The collaboration envisions the creation of groundbreaking “x86 RTX SoCs” – system-on-chips where Intel’s robust x86 architecture will incorporate chiplets featuring Nvidia’s acclaimed RTX GPUs. This strategic move represents a significant leap in integrated graphics performance for mainstream PCs. Nvidia’s RTX technology is renowned for its ray tracing and AI-powered DLSS capabilities, offering superior visual fidelity and gaming experiences. By embedding these powerful GPU elements directly into Intel’s CPUs, the companies aim to deliver a “wide range of PCs” with unparalleled graphical prowess. This direct integration is expected to give Intel a substantial competitive advantage over rival AMD’s integrated CPU solutions, driving significant GPU innovation across the market. Shifting Dynamics in the Semiconductor Market This landmark agreement comes at a pivotal time for both companies and the broader semiconductor market . Intel has navigated a challenging period, struggling to fully capitalize on the explosive growth in AI chip demand, a stark contrast to Nvidia’s meteoric rise. Intel’s recent history includes leadership changes, significant layoffs, and a re-evaluation of manufacturing projects to prioritize capital expenditure discipline. Meanwhile, Nvidia has enjoyed record-breaking quarters, solidifying its position as not only the most valuable semiconductor company but also one of the world’s largest companies by market capitalization. The synergy between Intel’s established manufacturing capabilities and x86 leadership, and Nvidia’s dominance in AI and accelerated computing, is designed to reverse Intel’s fortunes and bolster Nvidia’s ecosystem.

PYUSD is now live on Stellar. Welcome to low-fee transfers, ~5s finality, anchors for fiat ramps, and Stellar Asset Contract-compatible contracts – built for real payments. #PYUSD #stablecoin https://t.co/qSUmT4GuXM — PayPal Developer (@paypaldev) September 18, 2025 The launch marks a milestone for both PayPal and Stellar, extending PYUSD’s reach into new wallets, platforms, and business use cases across global payments. The announcement was made at the Stellar Meridian event in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, on September 18, a flagship annual gathering of blockchain leaders, investors, and policymakers. Expanding Access Through Stellar’s Ecosystem By deploying on Stellar, PYUSD integrates with wallets and platforms including Bitcoin.com, Chipper Cash, Decaf, Arculus, Meru, CiNKO, COCA, Lobstr, and others. This expansion alllows millions of users to access a stablecoin option designed for low-cost payments. “Expanding PYUSD to the Stellar network is an exciting step toward making stable, trusted digital dollars more accessible and useful worldwide,” said Corbin Fraser, CEO of Bitcoin.com. “By supporting PYUSD on Stellar, we’re enabling our millions of users to enjoy fast, low-cost transfers while strengthening the role of stablecoins in real-world payments.” Empowering Businesses and SMEs Beyond consumer payments, PYUSD on Stellar offers small and medium-sized businesses access to near-instant settlement and real-time working capital. Companies can use PYUSD to pay suppliers, manage inventory, or cover operational costs without the delays typically associated with traditional finance. According to Paypal liquidity providers can participate by backing these financing opportunities and earning potential returns linked to real-world commerce. This creates a virtuous cycle of faster payments, improved liquidity, and enhanced financial inclusion, explains PayPal. PYUSD’s fully backed reserves—held in U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents—add trust and transparency. Oversight from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) ensures a high regulatory standard. PayPal Deepens Onchain Presence “PayPal continues to be at the forefront of payments, meeting our customers where they are — online, offline, and now onchain,” said May Zabaneh, Vice President of Crypto at PayPal. “Expanding PYUSD to Stellar broadens access to PYUSD and opens up new use cases and opportunities for seamless transactions for customers.” With this move, PayPal strengthens its role in the stablecoin ecosystem, offering consumers and enterprises a digital currency that bridges traditional finance with blockchain-powered efficiency. Stellar’s Growing Role in Digital Payments Stellar, which has processed over 20 billion operations across nearly 10 million accounts, provides a proven network for innovation in payments. Developers can integrate PYUSD into programmable payment solutions and enterprise-grade platforms using Stellar’s open-source SDKs and Soroban smart contracts. “Having a global leader like PayPal bring PYUSD to the Stellar network is a major step forward in how stablecoins can power real-world payments,” said Denelle Dixon, CEO of the Stellar Development Foundation. “This milestone sets the stage for broader adoption and innovation.” The post PayPal USD Goes Live on Stellar, Expanding Access to Stablecoin Payments appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|News|PayPal|Stablecoin|Stellar,EN,0,0,PYUSD|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XLM|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-18 17:00:32

The second-largest cryptocurrency has maintained a bullish structure, but buyers are now struggling to break past the $4,750 resistance zone, a level that has become a critical short-term test. While fundamentals remain solid, the hesitation at this threshold has prompted some analysts to warn of growing risks as Ethereum approaches historically significant levels. Data from CryptoQuant adds weight to this cautious outlook. The firm reports that the unrealized profit of Ethereum wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH has surged to levels not seen since November 2021, when ETH reached its all-time high. This means mid-sized whales are now sitting on significant paper gains, similar to conditions observed at the last cycle’s peak. With bullish enthusiasm still strong but profit-taking risks rising, Ethereum’s next moves could prove decisive. A breakout above $4,750 may open the door to new highs, while rejection could trigger a sharp correction. Ethereum Whales Signal Critical Stage Ethereum has entered a pivotal phase as mid-sized whales are now sitting on significant unrealized profits . These paper gains have reached levels comparable to those seen at the November 2021 peak, when Ethereum touched its all-time high. The similarity in profit conditions has raised concerns among analysts, as such moments in previous cycles often preceded periods of profit-taking or heightened selling pressure. Historically, when unrealized profits for mid-sized whales reached such elevated levels, markets tended to experience increased volatility. Some holders opted to lock in their gains, triggering a cascade of selling that weighed on prices. This behavior doesn’t guarantee an immediate correction, but it underscores the psychological pressure investors face when sitting on substantial profits. Market participants, especially larger holders, often influence broader sentiment and liquidity, creating ripple effects across exchanges and trading desks. At the same time, Ethereum remains fundamentally strong. Institutional inflows, network activity, and the broader optimism in crypto markets could temper aggressive selling and extend the rally. Still, analysts caution that the balance between bullish momentum and profit-taking behavior will determine Ethereum’s trajectory. The coming weeks are decisive. A successful push above resistance could reignite momentum and test new highs, while increased selling pressure may trigger a consolidation phase or sharper correction. Ethereum’s fate now hinges on whether whales choose to hold for higher valuations or realize gains at current levels. Technical Insights: Key Levels To Watch Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $4,599, showing resilience above the $4,500 support level. The chart highlights a period of consolidation after ETH failed to sustain momentum above the $4,750 resistance zone, where selling pressure has repeatedly capped rallies. Despite this, the overall trend remains constructive, with ETH maintaining higher lows since early September. The 50-day SMA (blue) is trending upward and sits close to $4,307, providing dynamic support that has cushioned recent pullbacks. Meanwhile, the 100-day SMA (green) at $3,614 and the 200-day SMA (red) at $2,846 reflect the broader bullish structure, suggesting that the market remains in a long-term uptrend. The moving averages are aligned in bullish order, further reinforcing positive momentum. However, ETH is encountering strong resistance near $4,750, which remains the key barrier before a potential retest of all-time highs. A decisive breakout above this level, accompanied by rising volumes, could open the path toward $5,000 and beyond. On the downside, a failure to hold $4,500 may trigger a correction toward $4,300 or even the $4,000 psychological support.

Even the GBTC ETF has regained AUM momentum, but it remains less attractive due to its 1.50% expense ratio. Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing record inflows. In my view, this signals growing institutional and retail interest in BTC as a maturing global reserve asset. Despite being technically superior over gold, BTC remains volatile and underperformed gold YTD; investors should size exposure to their risk tolerance. I recommend a HOLD for existing GBTC holders (for example, to avoid taxable events), but new investors should consider lower-cost alternatives like BTC or IBIT for Bitcoin exposure. Between the end of 2024 and earlier this year, I covered most Bitcoin ETFs as part of my “Bitcoin ETFs Showdown” series . Back then, I found the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) to be a sub-par choice , given its hefty expense ratio and deteriorating liquidity metrics. Yet, to my surprise, GBTC has actually seen an increase in popularity. After losing its crown as the most capitalized Bitcoin ETF earlier in 2025, its Assets Under Management [AUM] have increased again in the last few months. This is illustrated in my table below (column ""AUM Δ P6M""), with data updated as of July 2025. Top BTC ETFs, Comparison (Author's Work) This trend fits the overall growth of Bitcoin ETFs, which have reached record AUMs last month. This is what I will cover in this article, coming back to GBTC as a potential vehicle for investment, together with its “little brother,” the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF ( BTC ). The Gold vs. Bitcoin debate: my thoughts Bitcoin ETFs have shown steady growth in AUM since their launch. To the point that their total AUM is now approaching that of gold ETFs (see chart below). Gold vs. BTC ETF AUM (Bespoke Investment Group) Does this mean Bitcoin is taking over gold? Let me be clear - I do not think Bitcoin and Gold are mutually exclusive. I believe there is more than enough room for both assets , especially considering the current state of the US and world economy, with rampant currency debasement, fiscal recklessness and a return to lower interest rates. Merely from a technical standpoint, I do believe that Bitcoin is superior to gold - something I covered extensively in my past articles about the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has better durability (as it doesn’t decay), portability (moving gold from country to country can prove very difficult), divisibility (it can be divided in 100 million parts) and verifiability (it cannot be faked). Bitcoin has roughly the same fungibility of gold but, more importantly, it is scarcer than gold by a completely different order of magnitude. Gold is present in nature at just above 3 parts per million, while only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist. On the scale of humanity’s history, I do believe gold is set to eventually become obsolete. The moment sufficient advancements in technology will allow us to access gold in space , gold will have lost its scarcity relative to humanity’s scale. If humanity ever evolves to become a multi-planetary species, I cannot see that being compatible with using gold as a reserve asset. However, within our lifetimes, I think both gold and Bitcoin will be able to thrive in the current geopolitical and macro context. The state of Bitcoin: BTC ETFs inflows at odds with BTC on exchanges The fact Bitcoin possesses great technical characteristics does not mean, of course, it will actually replace or match gold in market capitalization - not within our lifetime, nor possibly ever. For that to happen, institutions and retail investors alike actually need to buy and hold Bitcoin long term, believing in the investment thesis. And here’s why I find the new AUM highs as confirming for my bullish thesis: this proves that interest is out there and more and more people decide to hold BTC. This is compatible with Bitcoin maturing as a global reserve asset (and not a currency ). However, this trend may appear to go against other trends that I have observed and discussed in my past coverage of BTC. Most of all, the decline of Bitcoin held in exchanges. Bitcoin exchange balance has been on a steady decline since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs (see chart below). This means that increasingly more Bitcoin is held in self storage on hard or paper wallets than on crypto exchanges. BTC In Exchanges, Chart (MacroMicro) This is a trend that I find as somewhat puzzling, considering how most BTC ETFs use Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) as custodian, meaning that (at least in theory) their Bitcoins should appear on exchanges. I personally explain this apparent paradox with the following dynamics: The rate of holders switching from exchanges (or ETFs) to self-custody outpaces ETF inflows. Some of the Bitcoin held by ETF custodians is moved outside of the exchanges in cold storage by the custodians themselves, and may not appear in these charts. Some Bitcoin ETFs use self-custody rather than a custodian, and their wallets may at least partially appear as off-exchanges. What matters, however, is that both dynamics are bullish in the context of Bitcoin maturing into a global reserve asset: more inflows into ETFs showcase retail (and institutional) interest. Less Bitcoin on exchanges indicates long term holders are prevailing short-term traders, and may even signal an incoming supply shock. While I find the latter dynamic the more bullish one, I welcome ETF inflows as a sign of maturity of Bitcoin. This article is not focused only on Bitcoin, therefore, I am not going to go further with my full investment thesis. I do, however, invite curious readers to go through my extensive coverage of this cryptocurrency on Seeking Alpha. Risks of investing in Bitcoin today Bitcoin remains a volatile asset, and it is worth noting it underperformed gold YTD. As I stated, even if Bitcoin has all the technical characteristics to become a global reserve asset, this is far from a certainty in itself. I think investors should only be exposed to Bitcoin to the extent they can tolerate high volatility, and be very wary of the chance that Bitcoin remains “stuck” at levels near where it is today for the foreseeable future. In my past Bitcoin coverage , I did discuss a bearish thesis on Bitcoin that sees it remaining a sort of “online casino”, with its only value derived from volatility and short term trading. This outcome is still a possibility at the time of writing and should be kept in mind by investors. Conclusion: Should you invest in GBTC (and the BTC ETF)? When I analyze investment funds, I always try to go back to the fundamental reason why they were launched in the first place. Among Bitcoin ETFs, GBTC has one of the most peculiar stories. The fund was launched in 2013 as a private, open-ended fund that invested in Bitcoin. Back then, GBTC represented the only way to gain exposure to Bitcoin via a listed instrument in the stock market. It was also a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin while being technically under the SEC jurisdiction. Given that regulatory framework, a somewhat hefty management fee was justified. Today, with a dozen more Bitcoin ETFs to choose from, it is difficult for new investors to justify being exposed to an ETF that costs more than five times its peers. GBTC has started slightly lagging behind its competition since last year, as shown by the chart below. GBTC vs. IBIT, P1Y (Seeking Alpha) Unsurprisingly, GBTC has lost much of its AUM since its conversion to an ETF. Not last because many investors were in GBTC to cash out its (now long gone) mNAV discount pre-ETF conversion. Today, GBTC keeps existing as is because, in my view, it provides a good revenue stream for its issuer, Grayscale. Rather than simply lowering its expense ratio to match rivals, Grayscale has decided to launch an alternative Bitcoin ETF to be competitive on the market. This is the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF. A plateau of AUM for GBTC of is understandable, as people may still stay invested for different reasons: To avoid having to pay capital gains. For lack of access to other funds in some specific situations (e.g., retirement accounts managed by Grayscale). For ignorance about better options or simple laziness. Personally, I once again find myself recommending other funds for Bitcoin exposure, due to GBTC’s hefty expense ratio at 1.50%. These include BTC, the “little brother” of GBTC, with its competitive 0.15% expense ratio, as well as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), my favorite Bitcoin ETF. However, for investors who already have GBTC in their portfolio and fall within the first two cases I mentioned above, I recommend a HOLD .",GBTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-18 17:04:29

The Finish Line Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-to-xrp-holders-keep-your-xrp-safe-the-finish-line-is-coming/,"Digital Asset Investor, a widely followed crypto market commentator, is urging XRP holders to stay vigilant and safeguard their tokens. His latest post—“Keep your XRP Safe! The finish line is coming”—comes as Ripple unveils a groundbreaking partnership with Singapore’s DBS Bank and Franklin Templeton (through its Franklin Templeton Investments Global, or FTI Global, arm). The initiative aims to create tokenized repo markets driven by stablecoins and on-chain collateral, marking a significant step into a new phase of regulated digital finance. At the same time, it highlights the importance of investors making thoughtful decisions about custody arrangements, given the evolving landscape. Ripple’s Partnership With DBS and Franklin Templeton Ripple announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with DBS and Franklin Templeton to pilot institutional trading of tokenized money-market funds and repurchase (repo) agreements on the XRP Ledger. According to Ripple’s official release , the collaboration will allow DBS Digital Exchange to list Franklin Templeton’s sgBENJI token alongside Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. This configuration permits qualified investors to transition smoothly between a yield-generating tokenized money-market fund and a regulated stablecoin, achieving settlement within minutes. The parties will also explore using these tokenized assets as collateral for repo transactions, creating a new, blockchain-powered market infrastructure. This is why I keep saying stay focused on keeping your XRP safe for now. The yield and being able to borrow against your XRP will come from every direction soon but it will be from every regulated direction after the Clarity Act. Keep your XRP Safe! The finish liine is coming. https://t.co/DtlbrodFpD pic.twitter.com/5sDyH7FFn1 — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) September 18, 2025 What This Means for Tokenized Finance By linking a major Asian bank, a global asset manager, and a payments-focused blockchain network, the partnership offers a practical blueprint for large-scale, regulated on-chain finance. Institutions will be able to use tokenized fund shares as collateral, settle trades almost instantly, and access round-the-clock liquidity. These efficiencies could compress settlement times, reduce costs, and expand the reach of repo markets to participants who were previously limited by traditional infrastructure. This represents a crucial move toward widespread integration of tokenized assets within the global financial system, marking significant progress toward broader acceptance. Why Caution Remains Essential Despite the excitement, Digital Asset Investor’s caution is well-placed. As tokenized collateral and on-chain repo markets grow, custody arrangements and legal safeguards become critical. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Public filings and trust prospectuses indicate that certain custodians and fund sponsors might permit encumbrances or liens on held assets, but only under specific and limited conditions, highlighting a potential aspect of their operational policies. This introduces counterparty and rehypothecation risks for anyone who places XRP or other digital assets with third parties. For retail investors who value full control, secure self-custody—combined with strict key-management practices—remains the best way to maintain ownership and avoid exposure to contractual uncertainties. The Path Toward Regulatory Clarity The push toward regulated tokenized finance aligns with legislative efforts such as the U.S. Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act, which aims to define how digital assets can be used as collateral and how stablecoins and other tokenized products are governed. Once such regulations take full effect, borrowing against XRP or earning yield through regulated platforms will likely become commonplace. Until that clarity is fully realized, however, Digital Asset Investor advises holders to resist the temptation of early yield opportunities and focus instead on preserving their holdings. Ripple’s collaboration with DBS and Franklin Templeton underscores the swift evolution and growing sophistication of the infrastructure supporting institutional blockchain finance, reflecting a rapidly advancing landscape. Yet, as Digital Asset Investor reminds the community, safeguarding XRP today ensures that holders can fully benefit when the regulated, yield-generating ecosystem finally arrives.

From ~$10 in 2017 to $4,800 in 2021, early wallets transformed tiny investments into fortunes, one of the biggest crypto wins ever. Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Its skyrocketing presale, daring roadmap, and game-changing flair in the meme coin scene position it as the next decade’s generation-defining digital asset. Ethereum’s Path: The Blueprint for Explosive Wealth Ethereum’s first investors prospered due to: Innovation: Smart contracts and dApps added real-world value. Network Effects: Users, developers, and funds accelerated expansion. Early Timing: Getting in before mass adoption boosted gains. This created significant wealth. The big question now is: what follows Ethereum? Some believe it’s Little Pepe. Why Little Pepe Could Be Life-Changing Little Pepe is not just a meme coin; it’s a Layer-2 blockchain dedicated to meme culture and community-driven innovation. While most meme coins survive on hype alone, LILPEPE has engineered utility, infrastructure, and unique advantages that position it for exponential growth. Key differentiators include: Meme Coin Launchpad – Incubator for 100x meme tokens, keeps the chain buzzing 24/7. Fastest and Cheapest Transactions – LILPEPE is all about speed, scale, and low fees. Sniper Bot Resistance – A first in crypto, ensuring fair launches without exploitative bots. CertiK Audit Score of 95.49% – Providing investors with confidence in security and transparency. Zero Taxes – Keeping trades frictionless and DeFi-friendly. Just as Ethereum became the go-to platform for smart contracts, Little Pepe is building the go-to chain for meme coins. Presale Frenzy: Momentum Builds Ahead of Exchange Listings The ongoing LILPEPE presale has already raised more than $25 million, making it one of the most successful token launches of 2025. With Stage 12 nearly sold out at $0.0021 per token, prices are expected to rise to $0.0022 in the next stage. This presale momentum mirrors Ethereum’s early days, when believers bought ETH for pennies before it became a global powerhouse. For those who missed out on DOGE, SHIB, and ETH’s early runs, LILPEPE represents a second chance. Tokenomics Designed for Growth LILPEPE’s supply distribution demonstrates careful planning: 26.5% Presale – Rewarding early backers. 30% Chain Reserves – Powering long-term blockchain stability. 10% Liquidity – Ensuring smooth trading on exchanges. 13.5% Staking & Rewards – Incentivizing long-term holders. 10% Marketing – Driving global awareness with viral campaigns. 10% DEX Allocation – Readiness for decentralized exchange listings. 0% Tax – True to DeFi’s spirit of freedom. This structure ensures deep liquidity, sustainable growth, and powerful incentives for community engagement. Exchange Listings: The Spark for Parabolic Growth Ethereum’s breakout moment came when major exchanges adopted it, opening the floodgates of global liquidity. LILPEPE is on track for a similar surge, with confirmed listings on two top centralized exchanges at launch. Insiders also hint at plans to list on the largest global exchange, which could catalyze LILPEPE’s breakout rally. Early holders benefit most when trading begins on these high-volume platforms. Meme Culture Meets Blockchain Utility Ethereum succeeded because it combined technological innovation with widespread adoption. Little Pepe is taking the same approach, but with the power of meme virality. Meme coins like DOGE and SHIB have already proved the internet memes’ cultural and financial firepower. What sets Little Pepe apart is that it anchors memes to a scalable, secure Layer-2 chain, combining fun, community, and real blockchain utility. This blend creates the perfect storm for explosive growth, just as Ethereum once did by merging developer utility with mainstream hype. The 7500% Growth Forecast Analysts suggest Little Pepe could surge 7,500% from its presale levels, making million-dollar portfolios achievable for early backers. If the predictions are right, a $1,000 investment could grow to $76,000. This estimate is similar to how Ethereum grew in its early days and is supported by strong presale interest, good security, and proven Layer-2 utility. Final Thoughts: A Rare, Life-Changing Window Ethereum rewarded early believers with wealth beyond imagination. Today, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is offering a comparable chance at life-changing growth. The project is already generating serious momentum with a booming presale, CertiK-backed security, meme coin launchpad, and upcoming exchange listings. For investors who missed ETH at $10 or SHIB before its breakout, Little Pepe may be the golden ticket of 2025. Don’t miss the presale.

The move was supported by heavy accumulation early in the session, where HBAR established a firm base around $0.23 before steadily advancing toward key resistance levels. Momentum accelerated during the morning window between 07:00 and 09:00, with volumes peaking at 119 million tokens traded — nearly double the 24-hour average of 67.5 million. This breakout through multiple resistance zones suggested heightened institutional activity and reinforced the bullish case for further price discovery. HBAR ultimately tested resistance near $0.25 in late trading, where selling pressure began to weigh. Despite this, the token maintained support at the same level during the final hour of the session, signaling resilience and sustained investor interest. With elevated volumes and consistent buy-side pressure, HBAR appears positioned for continued upside. Technical Indicators Signal Sustained Strength HBAR exhibited robust bullish momentum throughout the 23-hour period from 17 September 17:00 to 18 September 16:00, advancing from $0.24 to $0.25 with an overall range of $0.02 representing 7% volatility. The cryptocurrency featured a notable surge at 08:00 achieving a $0.25 peak before consolidating around the $0.25 resistance threshold. HBAR maintained its robust bullish momentum during the final 60 minutes from 18 September 15:05 to 16:04, establishing a defined ascending channel between $0.25 support and $0.25 resistance with multiple successful breakout attempts. The cryptocurrency demonstrated pronounced institutional buying interest with significant volume spikes exceeding 2.50 million during critical resistance breaches at 15:33 and 15:54. HBAR preserved consistent higher lows throughout the session, confirming the continuation of the established uptrend and positioning HBAR favourably for further gains beyond the $0.25 resistance level.

The project, named basketball.fun, will debut in October ahead of the NBA season and will attempt to gamify the way fans interact with players and games, Thompson announced. It has been developed on Somnia, a layer 1 blockchain that went live at the start of this month, already notching billions of dollars worth of trading volume in its first two weeks. “This is how we experience moments together, it’s not just about basketball,” Tristan Thompson said in a press release. “We’re creating something for the fans that lives beyond the game, where your presence, passion, and play actually matter.” Tokenized NBA players Unlike traditional fantasy sports or fan tokens, the platform will tokenize NBA players with values that fluctuate in real time based on sentiment and performance. Fans will be able to assemble rosters, speculate on rising talent, and earn rewards tied to their predictions and engagement. “The way fans value and perceive players should be different than owners and news networks,” Teherany said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We’re trying to give power back to the fan — not just to predict who they think is great, but to actually earn incentives from it. Imagine being able to prove that the fan consensus on a rookie’s potential is more accurate than a team’s front office.” Teherany stressed that the app won’t launch with a native token, distancing itself from projects like Socios that hinge on token price. Instead, players will hold in-app value that reflects fan sentiment and game outcomes. Why Somnia, Not Solana? Asked why the team chose to build on Somnia instead of more established chains like Solana or Avalanche, Teherany pointed to both relationships and philosophy. “Everything in this industry comes from authentic relationships,” he said. “When we met Herman Narula, it was an alignment of vision. He’s not chasing short-term token hype but is committed to building sports and entertainment on-chain for the long term. That gave us confidence that this wouldn’t just be valued on market speculation.” The decision also came after lessons learned from a previous project, TracyAI , which Teherany said became too dependent on token performance. This time, the focus is on infrastructure, gamification, and sustainability. Somnia’s Technical Edge Somnia went live on Sep. 2, following a six-month testnet that processed over 10 billion transactions and onboarded 118 million wallets. Backed by UK-based metaverse company Improbable, the network is positioning itself as the fastest EVM-compatible chain, claiming to handle more than one million transactions per second with sub-second finality. At launch, Somnia onboarded 60 validators , including Google Cloud, and has integrated with protocols like LayerZero, Sequence, and Thirdweb. Its native token, SOMI, has nearly doubled in value since launch and is already processing billions in daily volume. For Teherany, Somnia’s traction adds credibility: “They’ve done billions in daily volume, bigger than some of the major exchanges. That’s a testament to what they’re building—and what we’re building on top of it.” Road to Tip-Off The project’s first major reveal is scheduled for Korea Blockchain Week, where Thompson will share his vision alongside Narula and Teherany. Attendees of Somnia House, the network’s flagship side event in Seoul on September 23, will get an early look at the app and roadmap. “We want to make this as approachable as possible,” Teherany said. “The blockchain layer should feel invisible. Whether you’re a crypto native or just a basketball fan, you’ll be able to join, play, and help define the narrative of the sport.”",Finance|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|SPONSORED|TRADING|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-18 17:09:56

According to Nansen data , the top 100 PEPE wallets have added 430 billion PEPE in the past 24 hours, bringing weekly inflows to 4.32 trillion. This smart money activity closely follows the U.S. macro narrative, with Tuesday delivering on anticipations of interest rate cuts, fuelling fresh capital rotation into riskier plays like Pepe.

The continuation pattern stands to see the pepe price continue its August bull run, free from its consolidation. PEPE / USDT 1-day chart, bull flag pattern breakout continues. Source: TradingView. $0.00001 now serves as a launchpad for the next leg higher, with buyers showing clear resilience. The RSI has rebounded off the neutral line, a sign that buyers are driving the wider trend. More so, the MACD line continues to widen its lead over the signal line, suggesting that upward momentum is building despite early-week sell pressure. With this setup, PEPE looks primed to fully realize the wedge breakout, targeting $0.000016 for a 40% move from current levels. But as the bull market matures, a stronger rally, supported consistent rate cuts headed into 2026, could extend the run toward $0.000040 for an explosive 255% gain.

Intel stock surged above 28% today following the announcement, which forms part of a range of agreements. The collaboration deal gives Nvidia approximately 4% stake in Intel at $23.28 per share. The investment is part of several collaborations Intel has formed to reverse its competitiveness in the semiconductor business. The Trump administration invested in the company, taking a 10% stake worth $8.9 billion in August, while Japan’s SoftBank committed $2 billion. Nvidia partners with Intel to co-develop AI data center and PC chips Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s new CEO, appointed in March, has played a major role in reversing the years lost in declining competitiveness. However, he has faced criticism from political officials, including President Donald Trump, who was seeking his resignation, citing his close ties to China. Trump has, however, reversed that course as Cryptopolitan reported. The President met with Lip-Bu Tan and praised his leadership. He described their discussion as interesting and considered Tan’s career an amazing story. Tan’s strategy continues to steer the company through steep losses, cost cuts, and canceled projects, seeking to turn around the company’s competitiveness.

According to the agreement details, Intel will design custom x86 processors to pair with Nvidia’s graphics processors in several AI applications. Nvidia will additionally provide custom graphics chips that the U.S. semiconductor firm can integrate with its PC CPUs. Both firms highlighted that their technologies connect in a proprietary design to transfer data between CPUs and GPUs and produce multiple generations of future products under the partnership. The collaboration does not include Intel’s manufacturing unit producing chips for the AI chip maker. Some analysts revealed that Intel’s foundry business still requires large customers such as Apple and Qualcomm to achieve viability. Chris Caso, a researcher at Wolfe Research, noted that the important question should be whether the collaboration forms a genuine operational integration or is just a political and financial alignment. Intel’s stock surged above 28%, trading at $31.48, with a day range of $30.44 – $32.08 and a previous close of $24.9. The stock YTD has jumped to 59.7%, with a year range of $17.67 – $32.08, showing a possible turnaround for the stock as more developments are expected. On the other hand, Nvidia’s stock experienced a positive change with a 3.2% rise, trading at $175.56 at the time of writing, with a day range of $172.96 – $176.57. The stock closed at $170.29 before reacting to the collaboration news today. AMD stock falls in fear of a possible competitive landscape The market shifts extended beyond the two chip-making firms. AMD stock fell more than 2.5% today due to possible competition from the struggling chip-maker. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSCM stock maintained a 1.4% rise, showing that competitors fear a longer-term impact if Nvidia shifts production from TSCM. Nvidia has struggled amid the restrictions placed on its H20 AI chips in China following the imposed licensing conditions in exchange for a 15% cut of sales by the U.S. government. Some analysts have noted that choosing to align with the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing firm, in which the government has a 10% stake, could help push the removal of the restrictions and improve Nvidia’s political standing. Jensen Huang said the collaboration will expand the ecosystem by laying the foundation for the next era of computing. Lip Bu Tan insisted on the partnership’s complementary nature, saying Intel’s x86 architecture forms the foundation of modern computing, and combining it with Nvidia’s AI leadership would open more doors for the company. Neither firm shared the deal’s details, but confirmed that the existing roadmaps remain unchanged. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The asset showed a sharp recovery following early weakness, with strong volume-driven advances at $0.39 around 19:00 and again at $0.40 near 15:00. Transaction volumes of 40.04 million and 33.80 million at these levels both exceeded the 24-hour average of 30.47 million, underscoring firm buying interest. Repeated testing of the $0.40 resistance zone highlighted the threshold as a key battleground, while support consolidated just below, pointing to steady accumulation. The final hour of trading proved particularly strong, with XLM rising from $0.40 to a session high of $0.40 at 15:36, backed by a surge in volume to 7.50 million—roughly 24 times the typical hourly level. This outsized activity reinforced a breakout move, with buyers consistently defending the $0.40 level. Market behavior suggested sustained institutional participation, laying the foundation for an extension of the 24-hour uptrend. Across the period, XLM appreciated nearly 4%, climbing from $0.38 to $0.40. Trading data pointed to steady institutional positioning, with high-volume moves suggesting longer-term accumulation strategies rather than short-term speculative flows. The ability to hold higher support levels while repeatedly probing resistance zones further confirmed bullish momentum. Technical Indicators Signal Continued Strength Trading corridor of $0.02 constituting 5% differential between $0.38 floor and $0.40 ceiling during 24-hour session.

Executives at Axel Springer, Fox Corporation and News Corp have all been sounded out in recent months, according to people briefed on the matter. While the discussions remain at an early stage, they suggest Meta is once again weighing the value of professional journalism in its ecosystem. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram has long had a stop-start relationship with news providers. To feature articles from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post in its news tab, Meta was paying millions of dollars in pre-Covid era. However, in 2022 they stopped the payments and reduced the prominence of journalism across its platforms. The changing operations of tech firms like Meta The reduced prominence resulted in sharp falls in traffic of referrals for many publishers, but some have said they are seeing a modest rebound in visits from Facebook although they are still below pre-Covid peaks. The rise of AI has shaken up the publishing business yet again. Tech companies have been scraping websites to feed their large language models , while new search tools powered by those models have begun diverting readers away from traditional news outlets. Some publishers have tried to push back by blocking AI crawlers from trawling their sites unless compensation is paid. One of the largest providers of web security, Cloudflare, has changed its default settings to prevent unpaid scraping. Reports say it is against this move that Meta has decided to pay for licensed material, and last October, it struck a deal with Reuters. However, discussions with other publishers only broadened in previous months. A spokesperson for Axel Springer declined to comment. Meta, Fox and News Corp did not respond to requests for comment. The move also comes as AI firms and news publishers have been at each other’s throats over copyright infringement and plagiarism. The recent case involves Perplexity, where Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster are suing the AI firm on allegations of copyright and trademark infringement. The publishers, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan are claiming that Perplexity’s “answers engine” plagiarizes their content and diverts web traffic, as well as misleading users with inaccurate outputs. Tech rivals are also gearing up The challenge is not affecting Meta alone but is prevalent across AI firms. OpenAI has already penned agreements with publishers including News Corp, Axel Springer, and Dotdash Meredith, which owns the People magazine. Earlier this year, Amazon also signed a contract with the New York Times allowing its Alexa voice assistant to draw directly from the paper’s journalism. In the meantime, Google has started adding AI features to its research engine which shows the sources used in an effort meant to credit publishers and deflect criticism over using content without permission. Observers opine that Meta’s move is not surprising given the surge in AI chatbots, and therefore the need for reliable and up-to-date news content to remain competitive. “The company wants its AI products to feel relevant to what’s happening in the world,” said one person familiar with the talks. The push also comes as Meta reshapes its research efforts under the banner of Superintelligence Labs , after the company experienced an exodus of senior staff as well as muted reaction to its latest open-source model, Llama 4. Despite falling behind peers in the AI race, the social media giant has sought to aggressively hire new staff to play catch-up. However, with this latest deal with publishers, Meta is expected to add another layer of competitiveness by enabling chatbots to give breaking news and light analysis, in addition to entertainment. Whether those agreements materialise remains to be seen, as people close to the talks cautioned that negotiations could yet falter. Still, the fact that Meta is back at the table marks a notable shift from its recent hands-off approach to journalism. Shares in Meta rose 0.53 percent on Thursday, reversing a small decline the day before. The stock has rallied nearly 33 percent since January and close to 39 percent over the past year. Investors appear to be betting that its AI strategy, despite a slow start, could eventually bear fruit, particularly if it can secure the credibility of established newsrooms to underpin its next wave of digital products.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) shared his feelings in a statement on social media: It's impossible to explain in words how BNB has grown from an initial coin offering (ICO) price of $0.10 8 years ago to $1000 today. As a community member and BNB holder, I'd like to thank everyone in the BNB and crypto ecosystem. We had our challenges, but we worked, we built, and we didn't sell. This is pure community success. This is just the beginning, together we'll reach the next 10,000x. Related News: Coinbase Announces Collaboration with This Altcoin, Price Volatility High! The rise in BNB has also seen early investors reap extraordinary rewards. On-chain data reveals that a “diamond-handed” investor with address 0x8503 purchased 999 BNB for less than $1,000 approximately eight years ago. Today, that amount is worth approximately $1 million, and the investor has made a 1,000x return. Even more striking is another long-term investor who holds 29,440 BNB (approximately $29.28 million). This whale has made $28.8 million in profits from holding the assets for seven years. This investor, who previously withdrew 71,861 BNB from Binance for approximately $1 million, later reinvested 42,421 BNB back into the exchange. *This is not investment advice.

PYUSD0 on TRON reflects PayPal and LayerZero’s work to drive greater availability of PYUSD, enabling the stablecoin to reach the markets that demand it and the users who want it through LayerZero’s distribution network. “Stablecoins are one of the clearest examples of real-world adoption in crypto, driving everything from payments to remittances,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “The launch of PYUSD0 on TRON gives both users and institutions greater accessibility, and reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting assets that bring trust, efficiency, and broader access to the digital economy.” “The US dollar is the foundation of finance. Stablecoins are the killer app within the crypto ecosystem,” said Bryan Pellegrino, Co-Founder and CEO, LayerZero Labs. With PYUSD0, PayPal USD expands its reach and flexibility to work across today’s networks and tomorrow’s. Launches like this make it obvious that we are at the start of a global financial market that breaks down borders and works around the clock.” This integration builds on LayerZero’s acquisition of Stargate. Stargate pioneered the Hydra model for extending assets from a hub blockchain to spoke blockchains. With Stargate integrated into LayerZero, the Hydra model is now applied directly to extend PYUSD to TRON and other blockchains. No action will be required by end users and whether someone holds PYUSD or PYUSD0, it is one unified PayPal USD stablecoin: fully fungible and interoperable across blockchains. The integration is closely aligned with TRON’s mission to deliver efficient, accessible, and secure settlement infrastructure for users and institutions worldwide. TRON has evolved into a core component of the global digital financial infrastructure, dedicated to expanding access and inclusion, with a cumulative transfer volume exceeding $21 trillion since its mainnet launch in 2018. TRON currently hosts over 332 million user accounts on the blockchain, with over $28 billion in total value locked across the ecosystem. On average, the TRON processes around 9 million transactions daily with over 2.83 million daily active accounts. Furthermore, TRON generated nearly $1 billion in protocol revenue driven by real-world activity across the network in each of the first two quarters of 2025, establishing a new all-time high. This integration points to a future where established payment systems, advanced interoperability frameworks, and scalable blockchain networks converge to build the next generation of global financial infrastructure. By aligning PayPal’s expertise in digital payments, LayerZero’s cross-chain architecture, and the TRON blockchain’s scale and global reach, the initiative drives the development of financial systems that are secure, transparent, and inclusive for users worldwide About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. Until recently, TRON hosted the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, which currently exceeds $76 billion. As of September 2025, the TRON blockchain has recorded over 332 million in total user accounts, more than 11 billion in total transactions, and over $28 billion in total value locked (TVL), based on TRONSCAN. Recognized as the global settlement layer for stablecoin transactions and everyday purchases with proven success, TRON is “Moving Trillions, Empowering Billions.” TRONNetwork | TRONDAO | X | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum ContactYeweon Parkpress@tron.network Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

While Cardano (ADA) has been the long-term smart contract challenger for years, a newer player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a buzz with its lending and borrowing protocol to unlock sustainable on-chain liquidity. Mutuum Finance is cheap at $0.035 currently and gaining increasing popularity among investors who are seeking higher returns on investment. The project presale has already surpassed over $15.9 million and has over 16370 supporters. Unlike tokens with speculative cycle dependence, Mutuum Finance is building a measured utility system. Cardano Consolidates as Market Waits for Next Altseason Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.87, with price action consistent to its consolidation as investors wait for potential Q4 altseason. The network continues to build interest for its steady focus on scalability and governance as these remain fundamental tenets of its long-term roadmap. As ADA has remained a consistent contender for leading smart contract platforms, the chatter is now also beginning to overflow into new protocols with obvious utility within decentralized finance. Among these, Mutuum Finance is causing a stir for building a lending and borrowing ecosystem that experts believe can provide a sharper edge to profiting from momentum this cycle. Mutuum Finance Presale Buzzes Round 6 presale of MUTM presale shows that the project is gaining traction among investors. It has already surpassed $15.9 million and also has over 16370 holders. Buyers who are investing in this phase will be able to gain massive profits when the token will be listed for trading. Mutuum Finance is building a strong ecosystem, with a stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain, which will provide security and stability to the users. In an effort to drive the security of the platform, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The program is presented to security developers, white-hat hackers, and researchers as an opportunity to report bugs. The bugs are ranked by risk and effort put in; risk, critical, major, minor, and low. The program enhances the protocol, safeguards user balances, and drives investor trust. Mutuum Finance has also launched a $100,000 giveaway as an investor attraction measure. It will have ten winners of $10,000 MUTM tokens each, which means that the project cares about its community and is ready to grow the ecosystem in the long term. Liquidity Management, Market Risk and Volatility The protocol is aggressive under market exposure and illiquidity treatment, so there are liquidation thresholds, close thresholds, and liquidator incentives. Asset volatility directly influences Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and liquidation rules: the asset volatility is higher, the tighter risk parameters, the tighter lending rules can be. Apart from this, the reserve multipliers are also risk-weighted on assets and renders the protocol stable, secure, and resilient in any kind of market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast emerging as one of the most powerful altcoin prospects to steal market share from Cardano (ADA) in the next Q4 altseason. Stage 6 presale tokens are being offered at $0.035, and the project has already raised over $15.9M, with 16,370+ investors onboard. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a $100K community giveaway, and an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, Mutuum is building actual DeFi utility with its double lending model and solid risk management. As ADA drops to around $0.87, MUTM’s rapid development, security protocols, and people-first mentality show its potential to surpass the legacy chains.

Besides exposure to the world’s leading coin, the product is expected to provide greater acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Polish finance. The product debuts at a time when the country is updating its crypto asset regulations in accordance with the latest EU standards. Polish Bitcoin ETF trades on Eastern Europe’s largest stock exchange The Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) announced this week the listing of Poland’s first Bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF). “The ETF gives investors exposure to the cryptocurrency market in regulated trading on the stock exchange,” WSE said in a press release on its website. With the new “Bitcoin BETA ETF,” the Polish exchange joins some of the largest capital markets in what has become a global trend – to offer investment products linked to decentralized digital assets. Founded in the early 19th century, the Warsaw Stock Exchange is also known as GPW, the abbreviation of its name in Polish, “Giełda Papierów Wartościowych w Warszawie.” More than 400 companies, with a total market capitalization nearing 2.2 trillion Polish złoty (over $600 billion), are quoted on it, which makes it the largest in Central and Eastern Europe. WSE already lists 16 ETFs. Commenting on the latest, Michał Kobza, member of its management board, noted the exchange is addressing investor expectations. He was also quoted as stating: “Offering exposure to Bitcoin through an ETF listed on GPW increases safety of trading as investors can participate in the cryptocurrency market using an instrument which is supervised and subject to the transparency standards applicable to a regulated capital market.” The Bitcoin ETF is managed by the licensed investment fund company AgioFunds. Its offering was approved by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) in mid-June. Exposure to Bitcoin is provided through futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The Polish brokerage DM BOŚ serves as market maker, ensuring liquidity. The fund aims for returns reflecting the changes in the Bitcoin futures contract, regardless of price changes. It redeems investments at request, with a fee of up to 1%. Foreign currency exchange risk is hedged using forward contracts, mitigating the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the złoty and the U.S. dollar. Kazimierz Szpak, BETA ETF asset manager at AgioFunds, emphasized: “The ETF is our response to the growing demand from investors for new asset classes. I believe that the Bitcoin BETA ETF will meet market expectations and will be welcomed.” Bitcoin ETF launched amid controversial regulatory efforts The Polish crypto news outlet Bitcoin.pl, which quoted the announcement and provided more details, described the launch of the Bitcoin ETF as a historic moment. It wrote in an article: “We finally have our first ETF based on BTC, and this is the first step towards the WSE’s broader opening to digital assets. The Warsaw Stock Exchange is entering the cryptocurrency game.” The Bitcoin portal also described the offering as a move toward greater acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Poland’s financial system and a positive signal for its crypto ecosystem. The Bitcoin ETF will not only boost the popularity of Bitcoin as an investment , but it will open doors for traditional investors as well, who have until now shied away from the cryptocurrency space. Its debut comes at a moment when the region’s largest crypto market is preparing to face new regulations reflecting the provisions of the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets ( MiCA ) law. Some of the Polish draft proposals have so far proved controversial , to say the least, while others are threatening to either kill or chase away domestic crypto businesses.

51936314,https://nulltx.com/?p=152160,1758217165,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,LivLive Offers a New Take on Artificial Intelligence-Based Crypto,https://nulltx.com/livlive-offers-a-new-take-on-artificial-intelligence-based-crypto/,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is everywhere. Every company, project & platform is trying to rebrand as an AI leader, and with that, an ongoing effort from buyers to find top AI projects. LivLive’s new crypto presale is vying to become a leader in the AI-crypto niche. The $LIVE token is trading for $0.02 during the presale, with the launch price set at $0.25, offering just over a 12x return. Trillions of dollars have poured into AI ventures, and the AI niche in crypto has produced some impressive success stories. But what is this crossover really about? Is it just hype—or is there genuine utility waiting to be unlocked? LivLive is one of the few projects proving that AI in crypto goes beyond the buzz. Its protocol uses AI to make its augmented reality (AR) game more personal, dynamic, and valuable to both users and businesses. By merging AI with AR, blockchain, and move-to-earn (M2E) elements, LivLive is building a next-generation digital ecosystem. The LivLive presale offers users early access to this world, with bonus $LIVE token distributions included. Some believe this marks the beginning of one of the most meaningful AI-crypto crossovers since ChatGPT launched the AI hype cycle. AI In Crypto: The Next Trillion Market? AI wasn’t just a flash in the pan. When ChatGPT first went live, many analysts assumed it would be another tech bubble that would eventually burst, leaving investors and companies with nothing. That hasn’t been the case. Over the past couple of years, AI has become one of the most discussed technologies in the world and possibly the most valuable digital asset held by companies and even governments. The rise of AI has supercharged the valuations of tech giants like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Alphabet. NVIDIA, in particular, has passed the $3 trillion mark in market capitalization, largely driven by the demand for its AI-focused hardware. In crypto, the AI narrative has also drawn serious capital. Billions of dollars have flowed into the market in search of the most promising AI-crypto projects, with tokens like Render (RNDR), Fetch.ai (FET), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) capturing investor attention. AI integration in crypto is widely seen as a massive opportunity. Decentralized platforms offer unique ways to train, distribute, and apply AI models in secure, permissionless environments. From personal assistants to intelligent DeFi tools, the potential use cases are vast. However, most AI-crypto projects have yet to deliver game-changing results. Many rely on vague roadmaps or superficial tech, meaning a true breakthrough has yet to emerge. That’s why projects offering tangible, on-chain AI utility like LivLive are drawing growing interest as investors look for the first real winner in the space. LivLive’s Augmented Reality Ecosystem Explained LivLive is an example of how AI can be leveraged within the crypto economy. LivLive is primarily an augmented reality (AR) project. It’s a gamified digital layer projected over the physical world using an application where players’ movements and actions are tracked in exchange for rewards. This AR layer transforms real-world environments into interactive gaming zones. Every street, shop, or public community space becomes part of the LivLive world. Players can discover hidden treasures, complete location-based quests, and unlock unique experiences that reward them with $LIVE tokens. It gamifies real life in a way that feels immersive, fun, and meaningful. But LivLive is more than just a basic move-to-earn (M2E) application. One of its standout features is how it brings businesses into the ecosystem. Companies can launch branded quests, turning foot traffic and reviews into powerful marketing campaigns. For example, a new coffee shop might offer $LIVE tokens to players who visit, leave a review, or share their experience online. This entire model is powered by data. The platform tracks user behavior, movements, preferences, and interactions. That data determines how much players are rewarded and which quests they qualify for. The challenge is that these datasets are massive and difficult to interpret. That’s where LivLive’s AI comes in. The protocol uses machine learning to process raw user data, personalize experiences, and optimize campaigns for businesses. AI ensures that the game isn’t just fun, but also smart, personalized, and adaptive for users and brands alike. Integrating AI into AR and Crypto with LivLive LivLive has built an AI solution for its data. The idea is that through proper analysis of user data, each experience can be personalized, improving the LivLive protocol for both players and companies looking to run marketing campaigns through quests. The AI system processes physical movement, in-app behavior, preferences, and user social interactions to tailor quests and rewards. If a user regularly visits cafés and walks a specific route, LivLive’s AI can offer quests that align with those habits, increasing engagement and satisfaction. For users, this means a highly personalized gaming experience where rewards feel relevant and timely. For businesses, the benefits include precision-targeted marketing and loyalty. For example, a new café can sponsor a quest that is only shown to users who frequent similar places, dramatically improving conversion and visibility. This fusion of AI and AR ensures that every interaction has value and purpose. Useful Link Telegram Discord X Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

BullZilla Positioned as the Top 100x Crypto Presale for 2025, With World Liberty Financial in Focus",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-cash-targets-1200-bullzilla-positioned-as-the-top-100x/,"Can the newest altcoin presales still produce the next 1000x winner, or has the market matured past its wildest gains? As 2025 approaches, investors seeking the top 100x crypto presales in 2025 are closely monitoring global politics and market signals with caution. The U.S. Treasury’s recent announcement that it sanctioned two Iranian nationals for allegedly using cryptocurrency to move over $100 million, including oil revenues benefiting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force, shows how geopolitics can suddenly reshape the entire digital asset landscape. These OFAC designations highlight that even as adoption accelerates, regulatory crosswinds remain intense. Despite those headwinds, traders continue to chase the top 100x crypto presales in 2025, with particular focus on Bitcoin Cash, the explosive BullZilla Presale, and the rising World Liberty Financial (WLFI) project. Each of these plays offers a distinct narrative: a proven peer-to-peer payment coin, a next-generation meme token promising a Bull Zilla next 1000x, and an experimental financial education platform moving onto blockchain rails. Together, they embody how diverse the “best crypto to buy today” conversation has become. Below, we break down why these three coins are drawing attention among altcoin presales 2025 watchers, how the macro headlines affect them, and why the BullZilla vs Ethereum and BullZilla vs WLFI debates are heating up. Bitcoin Cash: Classic Payments Meet Fresh Demand Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to carve out its own identity apart from Bitcoin, emphasizing low-fee, high-speed transactions. As DeFi and NFT platforms integrate cheaper layer-1 alternatives, BCH has quietly built merchant acceptance and cross-border payment use cases that make it more than just a forked relic. Its stability makes it a surprising contender in lists of the top 100x crypto presales in 2025, because some analysts see a slow-burn upside fueled by payment adoption. The latest OFAC sanctions remind investors that decentralized, censorship-resistant payment networks like BCH are both valuable and scrutinized. BCH developers have responded with continued upgrades to privacy-enhanced features, hoping to remain compliant while safeguarding users. This dual push, real-world utility and regulatory adaptability helps keep BCH on the radar of those seeking the best crypto to buy today. Marketwise, BCH has mirrored broader crypto cycles but remains liquid and institutionally recognized. Its presence alongside high-risk presales in discussions of altcoin presales 2025 underscores how investors often balance proven names with speculative plays like BullZilla for portfolio diversification. BullZilla: Presale Frenzy and the Quest for the Next 1000x The undisputed star of the top 100x crypto presales in 2025 conversation is the BullZilla ($BZIL) Presale. Currently in Stage 3 (Phase 2), BullZilla trades at $0.00006574, with over $500k raised, 27 B tokens sold, and a reported current ROI of 7,918.57% from Stage 3B to its planned listing price of $0.00527. Early joiners already eye a 1,043.30% paper return, and a $1,000 stake equals roughly 15.211 million $BZIL tokens. A scheduled 10.14% price bump to $0.00007241 at Stage 3C adds urgency for those chasing the BullZilla next 1000x. Community buzz compares BullZilla vs Ethereum and BullZilla vs WLFI, but the presale’s appeal lies in its hybrid identity: a meme coin with utility. Staking through the BullZilla dApp, NFT integrations, and aggressive social campaigns give it a roadmap beyond speculation. Influencers have labeled it one of the best cryptos to buy today, aligning with narratives like “meme coin investment 2025” and “altcoin presales 2025.” How to Buy BullZilla: Create a compatible crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask). Fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Visit the official BullZilla Presale portal. Connect the wallet, select the desired allocation, and confirm the transaction. After the presale concludes, claim tokens for staking or exchange listing. For investors determined to capture the top 100x crypto presales in 2025, BullZilla stands out as the bold, high-reward candidate albeit with the high risk inherent in any early-stage meme token. World Liberty Financial: Education Meets Decentralization World Liberty Financial (WLFI) represents a different corner of the top 100x crypto presales in the 2025 universe. Trading around $0.0002951, WLFI operates as a financial education and empowerment ecosystem with a blockchain backbone. Though still a micro-cap, its mission resonates in a post-sanctions environment where financial literacy and decentralized access matter more than ever. The project’s educational platform, token-gated learning modules, and planned decentralized finance products make it more than a speculative meme. Analysts who weigh BullZilla vs WLFI note that WLFI aims to capture a long-term niche rather than short-term hype, providing balance for those who also hold volatile assets like BullZilla. Recent liquidity injections and gradual listings on emerging decentralized exchanges have inched WLFI toward mainstream awareness. For seekers of best crypto to buy today, it delivers a socially conscious narrative that some investors find compelling within the altcoin presales 2025 landscape. Conclusion The crypto market of 2025 proves that excitement isn’t confined to one narrative. Bitcoin Cash offers a battle-tested, payment-oriented blockchain that continues to evolve under regulatory watch. BullZilla electrifies the scene as perhaps the most headline-grabbing of the top 100x crypto presales in 2025, promising a potential BullZilla next 1000x outcome for early believers. World Liberty Financial quietly builds a purpose-driven ecosystem, aiming to fuse education and decentralized finance in an era demanding transparency and empowerment. Macroeconomic tension, from the U.S. Treasury sanctions on Iranian facilitators to ongoing ETF inflows frames these opportunities. Savvy investors balance risk and reward, mixing speculative meme coin presales like BullZilla with steadier plays such as BCH or WLFI. In the relentless hunt for the best crypto to buy today, these three represent very different but equally intriguing roads to potential outsized gains. Ultimately, lists of the top 100x crypto presales in 2025 are less about prediction than preparation. Whether you favor the explosive energy of BullZilla, the proven utility of Bitcoin Cash, or the mission-driven WLFI, careful due diligence and position sizing remain key. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions What makes BullZilla different from other meme coins? Its structured presale stages, staking options, and ambitious NFT roadmap create a utility-driven approach uncommon in meme projects. Is Bitcoin Cash still relevant in 2025? Yes. Its low fees and payment-oriented updates make it attractive for merchants and those involved in cross-border transactions. How risky are early-stage presales, such as BullZilla or WLFI? Very. Prices can fluctuate dramatically, and projects may fail; invest only what you can afford to lose. Where can I purchase BullZilla tokens?

REX-Osprey announced the official listing of two spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of XRP and Dogecoin in the United States. The new crypto funds are available for US investors on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF is trading with ticker XRPR, while the DOGE ETF is listed with ticker DOJE. The first XRP and DOGE ETFs were listed today, and they provide direct spot exposure to Dogecoin and XRP. XRPR and DOJE are gates to crypto exposure XRPR provides exposure to XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, which is a blockchain that enables fast and low-cost cross-border transactions. DOJE, on the other hand, is the first-ever Dogecoin ETF. It offers investors regulated access to the first memecoin that built global recognition through its Shiba Inu mascot and active online community. Both funds use a structure under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which governs open-end mutual funds and ETFs in the US. This law was designed to protect investors from fraud, conflicts of interest, and poor oversight. This route gives investors the protections of a regulated open-end ETF. Each fund will hold a majority of its assets in spot XRP or DOGE, while also investing at least 40% in other crypto ETFs and ETPs, including those traded outside the United States. According to the SEC filing , XRPR charges an expense ratio of 0.75%, while DOJE charges 1.50%. The funds may also use a Cayman Islands subsidiary to buy crypto directly. This setup copies REX-Osprey’s Solana + Staking ETF (SSK), which launched in July and quickly grew past $275 million in assets. Greg King, the CEO and founder of REX Financial and Osprey Funds, said, “Investors look to ETFs as trading and access vehicles. The digital asset revolution is already underway, and to be able to offer exposure to some of the most popular digital assets within the protections of the US ’40 Act ETF regime is something REX-Osprey is proud of and has worked diligently to achieve.” REX Shares and Osprey Funds are two separate entities that work together on issuing cryptocurrency ETFs, giving more people exposure to the crypto and blockchain space. Cboe lists XRPR and DOJE ETFs on September 18, 2025. Source: Cboe US Equities Exchanges . Other crypto ETFs lag behind Several ETF issuers are still waiting. Bitwise, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Canary have XRP ETFs and ETPs proposals on Cboe BZX that were filed as Commodity-Based Trust Shares under the Securities Act of 1933. These filings went through the 19b-4 process and remain pending or under extended review. This path differs from REX-Osprey’s 1940 Act route. The 1933 Act trust model needed an exchange rule change and separate registration, which created longer timelines and staged decisions. On the other hand, the REX-Osprey listed XRPR and DOJE on Cboe BZX as ’40 Act ETFs with their own prospectuses, and they began trading today. Yesterday, the SEC approved generic listing standards that let NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe list spot commodity ETPs. This includes listing crypto funds and products, without case-by-case 19b-4 approvals if they meet the new criteria. This policy is expected to shorten approval windows and standardize requirements for future crypto products.

Grayscale may create a precedent of using its significant ETH holdings to receive rewards. Grayscale may be looking at millions in passive income if it stakes its ETH holdings. On-chain analysts have noticed movements from some of Grayscale’s wallets, suggesting the company may finally become a staker, after years of passively holding ETH. Public wallets began moving funds Grayscale’s public wallets started moving tranches of exactly 3.2K ETH to new unidentified wallets. The company moved 40K ETH in an hour, with the potential to stake 1.5M ETH. Until recently, Grayscale was among the biggest holders, mostly due to its ETHE ETP, which was later transformed into a full ETF. At one point, Grayscale also acquired a vast reserve of ETH at extremely low prices, even buying at $90. Afterward, Grayscale sold a significant part of its holdings, still retaining 1.51M ETH. Over time, the new ETF balances flowed into Grayscale’s wallets, as investors flocked to ETH. Grayscale may expect rewards of 45K to 60K ETH per year, while potentially learning to use liquid staking tokens. Grayscale alone will add 45,785 validators if all of its ETH reserves are staked. The fund may be the first to build a staking ETF, following BlackRock’s pressure to create this type of investment vehicle. The coin movements happened after Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETP received permission to trade as an ETF, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. ETH breaks above $4,600 Following the news of the eventual Grayscale stake, ETH continued its recovery, breaking to $4,632.07. ETH is still trading with expectations for a breakout to a higher range, based on demand from treasury companies and ETFs. ETH open interest remained above $27B, with a slight increase in short positions. ETH also faces significant liquidity in the $4,440 range, which may be attacked and lead to a short-term dip. ETH staking queue shows another exit wave The ETH validator queue showed increased activity in the past week. In the past days, the queue expanded, with 2,484,285 ETH waiting to be unstaked. Another 462,882 ETH are waiting to enter the Beacon Chain contract. ETH validators are rapidly moving coins, with another spike in requests to unstake tokens. | Source: Validator Queue Currently, 350,715,709 ETH is staked, an all-time peak, spread over 1,049,460 validators. The number of validators has been falling gradually since July. The ETH network is more active, though it remains inflationary. The token supply has increased to 121,067,568 ETH after a low of around 120M during the Ethereum deflationary phase. Increased demand for DeFi once again raised fees to $3-$5 for the most common swaps and on-chain operations.

The historic milestone prompted former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) to declare “ To the next 10,000x together ” after witnessing the token’s journey from $0.10 ICO price eight years ago. Technical analysis reveals BNB completing a five-wave Elliott Wave structure with Fibonacci projections targeting $1,200 as the next major resistance level. The breakout coincides with reports of Binance nearing a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice to potentially end court-appointed monitoring requirements from its 2023 settlement. Watching #BNB go from $0.10 ICO price 8 years ago to today's $1000 is something words cannot explain. I, not representing any entity or title, as just a community member and a #BNB holder, thank everyone in the #BNB and crypto ecosystem, for your support. We had our challenges… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) September 18, 2025 DOJ Settlement Resolution Fuels Institutional Confidence Binance is reportedly negotiating with the U.S. Department of Justice to eliminate its court-appointed monitor requirement from the $4.3 billion 2023 settlement for anti-money laundering violations. Federal prosecutors are discussing ending the three-year oversight obligation that has operated since the compliance agreement. The Trump administration has already terminated monitors for three companies appointed during the Biden era, including two Glencore units that accumulated $142 million in combined oversight costs. Enhanced compliance reporting requirements would replace external monitoring before DOJ approval. CZ changed his Twitter bio from “ ex-binance ” back to “ @binance ,” sparking speculation about a potential leadership return. Source: X/@cz_binance While no official indication exists regarding his reentry into operations, the crypto community views the narrative as momentum-building for BNB’s continued advance. The wider crypto market gained approximately 3% following the Federal Reserve’s anticipated 25 basis point rate cut. Notably, a long-term investor’s $1,000 BNB investment from 2017 reached over $1 million in value, representing a 1,000-fold return over eight years. BNB just broke $1,000 today! @cz_binance Diamond Hand 0x8503 spent less than $1K to buy 999 $BNB eight years ago, when the price was only ~$1. Now, those 999 $BNB are worth ~$1M, a 1,000x return. https://t.co/DIkr8auXWA pic.twitter.com/4qZElFjyt5 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 18, 2025 BNB also reclaimed its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, edging past Solana with its $140 billion valuation. The milestone coincides with growing institutional interest as digital asset treasuries (DATs) focus on high-quality assets with proven utility and revenue generation. Elliott Wave Completion Points to $1,200 Target BNB’s 4-hour chart displays completion of a five-wave Elliott Wave impulse sequence from July lows around $400. According to MoreCryptoOnline analyst, the wave structure shows clear progression through waves 1-5, with the recent explosive move representing completion of wave 5 in a larger degree impulse pattern. Source: X/@Morecryptoonl Fibonacci extension levels provide crucial upside guidance, with the 23.6% extension at $962 already achieved and current consolidation around $994. The 50% extension projects toward $1,200, representing approximately 20% upside from current levels with a strong technical foundation. The golden zone between $764-832 represents deeper retracement levels should a significant correction materialize. However, the $918 level serves as immediate support for trend continuation, aligning with the analyst’s noted crucial support threshold. Sub-wave markers indicate potential for further subdivision if current consolidation evolves into more complex corrective patterns. The overall structure remains bullish for higher degree targets despite potential near-term consolidation following the historic breakout achievement. Transaction Dominance Creates Fundamental Value Support BNB Chain processes over 10 million daily transactions, maintaining 2-3 times the volume of nearest EVM competitors, including Polygon, Avalanche, and Ethereum Layer-2 solutions. Source: X/@crypto_rand This transaction dominance creates natural buying pressure for BNB tokens required for gas fees and network participation. The 7-day moving average shows consistent leadership throughout 2025, with peak transaction counts reaching 16-17 million during high-activity periods. To take it even further, the weekly timeframe analysis emphasizes the significance of the $1,000 breakout in the historical context. $BNB smashing the $1,000 and setting a historical All Time High. Let's go! pic.twitter.com/NkY59d6xib — Rand (@crypto_rand) September 18, 2025 The decisive move above multi-year resistance levels suggests a fundamental shift in market perception rather than a temporary speculation-driven advance. Successful retests of previous resistance levels have converted to support, creating a strong foundation for continued advancement. The ascending trendline structure since early 2023 shows a consistent uptrend, with the recent breakout representing the acceleration of the established pattern. BNB’s next clear trajectory depends on maintaining support above $950-$980 levels while building momentum toward the projected $1,200-$1,300 resistance zone. Success at these levels could trigger extended moves toward $1,500, while failure might prompt retracement to the $850-$900 golden pocket before resuming upward momentum. Is Maxi Doge the Next 1000x Meme Coin Everyone’s Buying? While BNB targets new highs above $1,000, this gym-themed meme coin is building strong presale momentum. Smart traders know that finding the right meme project early can lead to massive returns during alt seasons. Maxi Doge is getting attention because it combines Dogecoin’s meme appeal with max leverage trading culture. The project has raised over $2 million in presale with 157% staking rewards. The token targets traders shifting from mature meme coins into newer projects with higher growth potential. Early buyers can earn passive income while waiting for exchange listings. Just like the way BNB is winning the utility game, the best meme coins get discovered fast once the community starts talking about them. Maxi Doge plans Uniswap listing after presale with major exchange applications underway. This means you should buy soon if you want presale pricing. You can buy MAXI tokens on their website using ETH, USDT, or credit cards.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and three-litters (SHIB) continue to dominate the headlines, supported by active communities and technical momentum. Yet, a fresh contender is emerging, with MAGACOIN FINANCE gaining recognition for prioritizing what many meme coins lack — audit-backed security and sustainable tokenomics. As traders rotate into meme coins for potential upside, analysts emphasize the importance of balancing hype with real safeguards. This balance is defining the list of best meme coins to buy now. Dogecoin (DOGE): Momentum From Channel Support Dogecoin, the largest meme coin in terms of market cap, was trading at $0.3035, up 8.17% in the last 24h. It reports a 31% rise in its weekly chart with a meteoric increase in trading volume up to $5.17 billion. Market cap is now at $42.79 billion,indicating strong demand. Analysts see DOGE is respecting its long-term ascending channel. The lower boundary around $0.13 has supported past rallies very well. After bouncing strongly, DOGE now aims at the mid-channel zone. Resistance near $0.34 is very critical. If broken analysts expect acceleration towards higher levels over $0.70. As long as price holds above $0.13 the bullish structure is intact which reinforces the optimism around $0.30. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Recovery After Shibarium Exploit Shiba Inu recently broke out of a multi-month symmetrical triangle, trading above $0.0000144. This move comes following turbulence in the wake of the Shibarium bridge exploit. Developers froze 4.6 M BONEs associated with the attack following suspicious user activity from validators flagged by PeckShield. The quick response increased confidence. BONE spiked 41% in a single 24-hour period, but SHIB increased more than 15%, demonstrating how markets were rewarding the defense. Shiba Inu temporarily suspended the staking, moved some funds to a multisig wallet and hired major cybersecurity companies. Ecosystem upgrades are also progressing. These include LEASH V2 migration, ShibaSwap improvements for multi-chain trading and community guidance against phishing scams. The Shibarium bridge remains central and allows for cheaper transactions through all of Ethereum and Shibarium while supporting DeFi, gaming and metaverse projects. Technically, SHIB trades above its 50-day EMA at $0.0000128 and is testing its 200-day EMA near $0.0000150. A bullish reversal candlestick pattern has formed, and RSI is at 69. Resistance levels are $0.0000156, $0.0000170, and $0.0000183 and the support is at around $0.0000141. Sustained buying may trigger the next leg higher. MAGACOIN FINANCE Brings Security and Growth in the Meme Coin Arena As investors dust off their portfolios for meme coins again, security and sustainability are becoming definite factors. While DOGE and SHIB have led the sector for years, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention for offering something most meme coins lack — audit-backed security and long-term growth tokenomics. The project has been able to go through audits with reputable firms, giving investors confidence in the safety and transparency of this project. This emphasis on security stands out in a market that usually is criticized for risky launches. MAGACOIN FINANCE is also joining the meme coin space but with a strong sustainability focus.Its tokenomics are structured to prioritize scarcity and long-term value appreciation rather than short-term hype. Analysts argue this balance between community-driven energy and built-in safeguards makes it one of the most promising meme coins to watch right now . By offering what most meme coins cannot — security, utility, and growth design — MAGACOIN FINANCE is poised to become a serious contender alongside DOGE and SHIB. Conclusion Dogecoin continues to thrive in its channel, and Shiba Inu demonstrates resilience following its Shibarium exploit. Both remain dominant players with great communities and market momentum. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving that it is possible for new entrants to compete with others by ensuring security and sustainable tokenomics. With perfect audit scores and DeFi driven potential, it gives investors a rare combination of meme appeal and confidence in the long term. Analysts agree: MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just another meme coin — it is a rising contender built for growth.

51937110,584139,1758218406,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,BlackRock And Other Institutions Stacking XRP? Why A Major Supply Shock Could Be In The Works,https://bitcoinist.com/big-institutions-stacking-xrp/,"Crypto analyst Versan Aljarrah has made a bullish case for XRP, stating that a major supply shock is inevitable. He claimed that BlackRock and other major institutions have been quietly accumulating for a while, which is why he believes investors should not sell their XRP. Analyst Claims BlackRock and Other Institutions Are Stacking XRP In an X post , Aljarrah stated that an XRP supply shock is inevitable, as JPMorgan, BlackRock, and major institutions have been quietly buying for years, while retail investors are being shaken out. He added that the Fed, stablecoins, and tokenized assets are all part of the same play and that this is digital gold, in reference to XRP, in motion. In a YouTube video , he further explained how he expects a significant amount of the world’s liquidity to pass through XRP. He noted that the altcoin and its ecosystem are built for infinite scalability. As such, he expects tokenization, stablecoins, and other on-chain activities to primarily take place on the XRP Ledger , which increases XRP’s utility. Aljarrah asserted that there is no ceiling for the XRP price and that it all depends on the demand for the altcoin. He remarked that the price will have to continue rising to accommodate this increasing demand. The analyst described market cap as nothing and that price action is simply determined by utility. It is worth mentioning that he recently declared that XRP’s circulating supply is smaller than market participants think. Another analyst, David, who was on the podcast with Aljarrah, said that those who keep alluding to XRP’s market cap as the reason it cannot reach these ambitious targets are short-sighted. He noted how years ago, no one would have imagined that a single company would be valued in trillions of dollars. As such, he believes there is no reason why XRP cannot reach such heights at some point. How The XRP Rally Will Happen In another X post , Aljarrah said that for XRP to reach $100 , it will start with these big players quietly accumulating. He again asserted that banks, financial institutions, and investors have been building positions for years and buying billions of XRP, while retail investors are being shaken out. The analyst explained that this accumulation reduces circulating supply and triggers the first real supply shock. Furthermore, he explained that the XRP rally from $100 to $1,000 requires widespread integration into the global financial system. Aljarrah remarked that at this level, the altcoin shifts from being a retail speculative asset to a functional utility as it becomes the preferred settlement mechanism for banks, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. The analyst also believes XRP will reach $10,000 once it can absorb the global liquidity. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.08, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Altcoin|BlackRock|Coinmarketcap|David|Fed|JPMorgan|ripple|stablecoin|Versan Aljarrah|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 18:00:06
51937626,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=812349,1758218410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51937626.jpeg,Tech CEOs pressured as Trump tightens grip on private firms,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/intel-rally-trumps-stake-by-4-9-billion/,"Intel shares blew through the roof Thursday after Nvidia dropped $5 billion into the struggling chipmaker, handing Donald Trump a fresh $4.9 billion paper gain tied to a government stake he pushed through weeks earlier. The rally, which is by the way Intel’s biggest one-day surge in nearly 40 years, shot the stock to $31.79 and instantly spiked the value of Washington’s equity from $9 billion to around $14 billion. As Cryptopolitan reported , that deal was quietly sealed in August when Trump authorized the purchase of 433.3 million shares at $20.47 a piece. Intel confirmed that 274.6 million of those shares were handed over to the Department of Commerce. The remaining 158.7 million is being held in escrow and will be unlocked in stages as the government makes payments to Intel under the Chips Act. At press time, Intel shares were still trading high at $30.79, up 24% on the day. Trump’s fingerprints were all over the setup, and now the move is drawing fire from across the aisle. What started as a government-backed investment in a legacy tech firm has turned into a national debate about who controls what, and why the leader of the free world is dabbling in billion-dollar equity deals with private firms. Trump pushes deal-making further with defense firms in the crosshairs Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had told CNBC on air that the Pentagon is now actively considering buying equity in America’s largest defense contractors. The remarks came just days after Trump signed off on the Intel purchase. When asked whether Trump would use the same playbook with other firms, Howard responded, “Oh, there’s a monstrous discussion about defense.” Howard said companies like Lockheed Martin, which gets most of its revenue from federal contracts, are “basically an arm of the U.S. government.” He said decisions on future equity stakes would rest with the Secretary of Defense and his deputy, but made it clear that Trump is reviewing how America pays for war and weapons. “I tell you, the way it has been done has been a giveaway,” Howard said, hinting that Trump might completely change how defense budgets are structured and approved by Congress. Lockheed, the top defense company globally by revenue, issued a statement later saying it is maintaining its partnership with the Trump administration. “As we did in his first term, we are continuing our strong working relationship with President Trump and his Administration to strengthen our national defense,” a Lockheed spokesperson said . Other major players like RTX, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman are all likely to be part of Trump’s deeper push into direct state involvement with military contractors. Tech CEOs pressured as Trump tightens grip on private firms Multiple executives say Trump met privately with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in the weeks leading up to both deals. Several Intel officials have openly said they were uncomfortable with the president’s involvement. At first, Trump wanted Lip-Bu fired before he eventually agreed to the government stake. This kind of pressure has defined Trump’s second term: assert control, cut checks, and call the shots, publicly or privately. But Trump is unbothered by the backlash. He told reporters recently, “I would make these kinds of deals all day long.” His plan seems to be more of the same; identify key companies, buy big, and use government influence to boost outcomes. But critics are now sounding alarms over what they see as political interference in public markets. Cato Institute economist Scott Lincicome, writing in the Washington Post, said, “The most immediate risk is that Intel’s decisions will increasingly be driven by political rather than commercial considerations.” Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky posted on X, “If socialism is government owning the means of production, wouldn’t the government owning part of Intel be a step toward socialism?” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",News|Intel|Nvidia,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-18 18:00:10

With buyers regaining control after recent volatility, this breakout could open the path toward $120,000 and beyond. Pullback Seen As Final Shakeout Before Rally Crypto VIP Signal, in a recent update, pointed out that Bitcoin experienced a sharp pullback yesterday after news of a rate cut, coupled with remarks from Jerome Powell, triggered a wave of volatility. The decline caught the attention of traders across the market, but the expert’s analysis suggests that this movement is more likely a final shakeout rather than the start of a broader correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Turns Bullish Above $114,000 With Hidden Divergence Forming Interestingly, despite the pullback, Bitcoin has quickly shown signs of resilience. This recovery suggests that the underlying demand for BTC remains intact, and market participants are still confident about its bullish trajectory. Crypto VIP Signal emphasized that the most critical level to watch in the short term is $118,000. A successful breakout above this resistance would serve as a strong bullish confirmation, potentially accelerating the rally toward $120,000. If achieved, this would not only mark another key milestone but also signal that Bitcoin remains firmly within a bullish cycle, raising the likelihood of a new all-time high on the horizon. Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Signal Possible Path To $120,000 Based on the latest BTC update from EGRAG CRYPTO, the bullish outlook for Bitcoin is being reinforced by key technical indicators. The report highlights that a decisive close above the middle upper section of the Bollinger Bands (BB) could be the catalyst needed to propel the price higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trend Constructive As Long As This Metric Holds, Glassnode Says Analysts often interpret this technical formation as a sign of building momentum and can spark a breakout from a period of consolidation. If Bitcoin successfully achieves this, it would pave the way for a run toward the significant $120,000 resistance level. The update paints a highly optimistic picture for the short term, suggesting that a new record could be within reach. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, should BTC manage to break through and sustain a price above $120,000 today, it may set a new all-time high. Basically, this milestone might trigger a fresh wave of investor excitement and market liquidity as the price moves into uncharted territory. Despite the strong bullish sentiment, the analysis includes a critical warning for traders. The $117,300 mark is identified as a crucial level to watch. If the price encounters a strong rejection at this point, it could trigger a temporary reversal to the $113,300 support level.

Analyst Sets Technical Price Target,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-falling-wedge-breaks-out-in-full-force-analyst-sets-technical-price-target/,"Prominent market watcher Steph Is Crypto ignited fresh excitement on X with a bold declaration: “XRP falling wedge breakout in full force. Technical Target: $3.60.” His accompanying chart displayed a textbook falling-wedge formation that had just resolved to the upside. Within hours, other analysts echoed the call, noting that XRP’s chart now reflects a decisive shift in momentum. A falling wedge occurs when prices compress between downward-sloping trendlines, signaling a potential bullish reversal. In XRP’s case, the pattern has been forming for months. According to Steph Is Crypto, the breakout gained credibility when XRP closed several consecutive daily candles above the upper trendline—a key confirmation many traders require before acting. Technical analysts agree that the first measured move from such a breakout point is toward the $3.60 level. #XRP FALLING WEDGE BREAKOUT IN FULL FORCE. TECHNICAL TARGET: $3.60 pic.twitter.com/OMqMDEaBDV — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 18, 2025 Price Action and Market Response As of report time, XRP is trading slightly above the $3 mark after rallying from sub-$3 territory earlier this week. Intraday data across major exchanges shows a steady price increase, with buying pressure and trading volume rising since the breakout signal appeared. Market participants are watching for continued daily closes above the former resistance line, a sign that the new uptrend is gaining traction. Why $3.60 Matters The $3.60 target is not arbitrary. It reflects the vertical height of the wedge added to the breakout point, a classic method of estimating a first objective. Technical traders also point to historical resistance near this level, which makes it a logical zone for profit-taking or potential consolidation. Should momentum persist and volume remain strong, analysts suggest that secondary targets above $3.60 could emerge if the breakout structure holds . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Macro Backdrop and Caution This technical upswing aligns with a wider risk-on sentiment prevailing in the crypto market, bolstered by recent macroeconomic trends, including the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates earlier this week. While such factors can accelerate bullish moves, they also introduce volatility. Traders are therefore urged to manage risk carefully, keeping stop-loss orders below the wedge’s lower boundary and monitoring volume for sustained confirmation. Bottom Line Steph Is Crypto’s timely analysis has sharpened focus on XRP’s chart at a critical juncture. With a well-defined falling-wedge breakout and a clear first target of $3.60, the setup offers an attractive technical roadmap. Yet the trade remains contingent on follow-through: daily closes above the breakout line and strong volume are essential to validate the move. Without those signals, the pattern could quickly fail, reminding traders that even the strongest technical formations demand disciplined risk management.

The offering, which was oversubscribed, is backed by ARK Invest, the Solana Foundation, early Solana backers RockawayX, and prominent UAE investors. The deal was sponsored by UAE-based Pulsar Group, a blockchain advisory and investment firm. UAE to Host First Solana Validator as Solmate Expands Beyond Token Accumulation The rebranded Solmate will pursue a dual listing on Nasdaq and a UAE exchange while continuing to operate Brera’s existing multi-club sports ownership business. According to the company, Solmate will focus on accumulating and staking Solana’s native token, SOL, alongside building new revenue streams from Solana-based infrastructure. JUST IN: Brera Holdings (NASDAQ: BREA) will rebrand as Solmate after closing an oversubscribed $300M PIPE backed by @ARKInvest , @Rockaway_X , Pulsar Group, and the @SolanaFndn . The Solana DAT will be led by Marco Santori as CEO in the UAE. pic.twitter.com/Qrlt2DB4yW — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) September 18, 2025 Marco Santori, former Chief Legal Officer at Kraken and a long-time figure in digital asset law, has been named Solmate’s Chief Executive Officer. Santori is known as one of the earliest pioneers of digital asset treasury companies, having helped launch the first altcoin treasury listed on Nasdaq. The Solmate board will include Dr. Arthur Laffer, the economist credited with creating the “Laffer Curve,” and Viktor Fischer, CEO of RockawayX, a digital asset investment firm managing around $2 billion. The Solana Foundation will also have the right to appoint two directors. The company said its long-term strategy includes building Solana validator infrastructure in Abu Dhabi. This will allow regional investors direct access to Solana’s native yield through a high-performance validator, marking the first of its kind in the Middle East. Solmate stated that deploying bare metal servers in the UAE will set it apart from traditional digital asset treasuries, which typically rely only on token accumulation. Solmate emphasized that the $300 million will not only fuel the acquisition of SOL but also drive the establishment of yield-generating projects in the region. The initiative aligns with the UAE’s broader digital transformation agenda, which has made blockchain technology a strategic priority. Solana has gained recognition as one of the fastest-growing blockchains globally, with more on-chain revenue and processed transactions than any other network. Unlike Bitcoin, Solana offers native yield opportunities through staking, a feature Solmate aims to capitalize on as part of its strategy. Industry forecasts suggest that Solana could outpace both Bitcoin and Ethereum over the next three years as developer activity on the network continues to accelerate. In a statement, Solmate’s leadership underscored their confidence in Solana’s ecosystem. “Our stakeholders have deep, long-term conviction in Solana and will demand that we accumulate SOL through bull and bear markets alike,” Santori said. Corporate Solana Treasuries Surpass $4B as Galaxy and Forward Drive Buying Spree Corporate treasuries holding Solana have crossed the $4 billion mark, according to data from the Strategic Solana Reserve (SSR). The tracker shows that 16 institutions now hold a combined 15.83 million SOL, representing 2.75% of the token’s circulating supply. Source: SSR Forward Industries leads with more than 6.8 million SOL, valued at $1.61 billion, positioning itself as the largest Solana treasury holder. Other companies such as Sharps Technology, DeFi Development Corp., and Upexi each hold close to 2 million SOL, worth over $400 million apiece. The wave of accumulation is being fueled by aggressive moves from major players. On September 15, Galaxy Digital bought $306 million worth of Solana in a single day, acquiring 1.2 million tokens that were transferred to custody provider Fireblocks. @GalaxyDigital has reportedly acquired 2.31 million Solana (SOL) tokens, valued at nearly $536 million, according to blockchain data. #Solana #Galaxy https://t.co/5L1ltcaqJE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 12, 2025 In September, Over five days, Galaxy amassed 6.5 million SOL, valued at $1.55 billion , making it one of the most active corporate buyers. Forward Industries has doubled down on its Solana strategy, filing a $4 billion at-the-market equity program with the U.S . Securities and Exchange Commission on September 17. The program, handled by Cantor Fitzgerald, will raise funds for further Solana purchases and general corporate purposes. Earlier this month, Forward closed a $1.65 billion private placement that funded its initial 6.8 million SOL acquisition. Other firms are also entering the market. Canada’s SOL Strategies debuted on Nasdaq under the ticker STKE with $94 million in holdings, becoming the first Solana-focused public company in the U.S. Meanwhile, Helius Medical Technologies announced a $500 million private investment led by Pantera Capital, with warrants potentially lifting its Solana treasury to $1.25 billion.

Inflows show that smaller transactions dominate. Retail Traders Dominate BTC In its latest report, CryptoQuant revealed that inflows of 0-0.001 BTC recorded nearly 97,000 BTC, and those in the 0.001-0.01 BTC range amounted to about 719,000 BTC. This breakdown highlighted the retail-driven nature of the market, where numerous small contributions are providing liquidity and balance. Despite the relatively modest size of these inflows, their collective weight has been sufficient to keep Bitcoin steady at the current levels. At the same time, the absence of large whale inflows, specifically transactions of 100 BTC or more, is notable. This lack of large-wallet activity indicates that the market is not being swayed by concentrated buying power but instead by broader retail participation. On the positive side, such a pattern reduces the immediate risk of a sharp downturn often associated with whale selling, and gives Bitcoin a firmer footing in the short term. However, the dependence on retail activity also highlights a structural fragility since, if enthusiasm among smaller investors wanes or if whales suddenly re-enter with significant inflows, the market could face abrupt volatility. For now, the balance between consistent retail inflows and muted whale activity has created a period of relative calm, which has allowed Bitcoin to consolidate near its highs. If this trend continues, the market could gradually build momentum toward testing the $120,000 level. Despite this, there is still the looming possibility of whale intervention, which is capable of either accelerating upward momentum or triggering a rapid correction. Supportive Setup The retail flows come in the backdrop of the US Federal Reserve making the first interest rate cut for 2025. Kushal Manupati of Binance said the 25 bp cut creates a supportive setup for crypto, which would boost BTC, ETH, and potentially large-cap alts if funding and ETF inflows remain stable. In a statement to CryptoPotato , the exec said “In crypto, that setup typically sustains demand for BTC and ETH and can expand to high-quality large-cap alts if funding and futures basis remain stable. Watch ETF inflows and on-exchange depth; if those stay firm, market breadth should improve rather than fade. From here, labor and inflation data will determine whether another cut is likely this year or whether the Fed pauses. If Fed communication stays consistent, cross-border participation should increase across trading sessions.” The post Retail Traders Keep Bitcoin Floating Above $117K, But One Whale Move Could Change Everything appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-09-18 18:10:47

Most analyst price prediction for PI coin have leaned bearish, and the chart hasn’t given much reason to think otherwise. Still, the Pi Core Team is pushing ahead with network upgrades. The latest Pi Node Docker now includes Stellar Core v23 and Horizon v23, confirming Pi Network has started rolling out its V23 upgrade. This boosts both performance and compliance. Pi’s official account also noted that “Testnet1 blockchain has been upgraded from protocol version 19 to version 22,” calling it the first step toward unlocking new layers of functionality and control. Progress update on protocol upgrades: the Testnet1 blockchain has been upgraded from protocol version 19 to version 22, marking the first step towards enabling new layers of functionality and control on the blockchain. Work is underway to upgrade Testnet1 to version 23, followed… pic.twitter.com/n9ainv06Hi — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) September 16, 2025 This news sparked only a small bounce, with PI coin up about 3% in the past 24 hours and 4% on the week. Encouraging, maybe, but the chart tells a different story. A clear bearish Head-and-Shoulders pattern is forming, and with the network expected to temporarily go offline during the upgrade, price pressure could easily increase, something history has shown again and again in crypto. PI Coin Price Prediction: Bearish Chart Signals Trouble Ahead Source: PIUSD / TradingView The PI coin chart is throwing a clean head and shoulders, the classic bearish vibe. The right shoulder looks done after that bounce, and the neckline is sitting right at $0.33. If price slips under it, its probably heading for $0.31, which would mark a new all-time low. For bulls to fight back, PI needs to reclaim $0.37 with solid volume. Until that happens, every bounce is more like a trap than a rally, setting things up for another leg down. Backing this up, the RSI is sitting mid-range around 44, not oversold yet, so there is room for more downside. MACD is flat to leaning bearish too, which lines up perfectly with the breakdown scenario. Snorter Bot Could Be Solana’s Next Big Thing Wall Street has been dropping billions into Solana treasuries , showing how fast new money and narratives can shift markets. Same thing is firing up in presales, and Snorter Bot is the one catching all the early hype. It’s already smashed past $4.00M with whales and retail racing to grab a spot before launch. Unlike PI, where traders are stuck waiting on an upgrade bounce that might break lower, Snorter’s got momentum flowing in the right direction. Built inside Telegram with instant wallet mirroring, MEV protection, honeypot scans, and a fat 117 % staking APY, SNORT stacks utility on top of hype. With fresh capital pouring in and nearly $4M raised, it’s shaping up as one of 2025’s sharpest presale plays, a breakout setup while PI still wrestles with breakdown signals.

Currently, 2,489,358 ETH sits in the exit queue facing a 43-day wait, while 35.6 million ETH are staked across 1,048,413 active validators earning 2.87% APR, as per ValidatorQueue’s data . Buterin responded to developer Robert Sags’ criticism that withdrawal delays exceed traditional banking timeframes and harm user experience for retail investors. “It’s more like a soldier deciding to quit the army. Staking is about taking on a solemn duty to defend the chain,” Buterin wrote on X , emphasizing that “friction in quitting is part of the deal.” Ethereum Validator Queue (Source: ValidatorQueue ) Developer Tensions Over User Experience The exchange highlighted growing tensions between Ethereum’s technical design priorities and mainstream user expectations for digital asset liquidity. Sags criticized the disconnect between wallet messaging that promotes “easy yield” and the reality of unpredictable withdrawal delays that can trap funds when users need them most. “What about the average user who is suffering with the delay and needs to pay bills?” Sags questioned, arguing that clearer disclosure about redemption periods would help users make informed decisions. Sure, we all get that – but what about the average user who is suffering with the delay and needs to pay bills? As remember what they were told by the wallet when they staked: “Click here to stake your ETH and earn. Unstaking is not immediate and may take days.” Sorry,… — Robert Sags (@RobertSagurton) September 17, 2025 Buterin acknowledged these UX concerns, admitting the Ethereum Foundation “needs to be more active at the UX layer” and has been working to address usability issues over recent months. The Ethereum founder argued that reducing exit delays would make the chain “much less trustworthy from the PoV of any node that does not go online very frequently,” positioning the delays as essential for maintaining network stability. Queue Dynamics Create Market Tension The current validator queue mechanics operate through strict churn limits of 256 validators per epoch, creating bottlenecks when exit demand surges beyond the network’s processing capacity. Recent market data shows the exit queue peaked at over 1 million ETH worth approximately $5 billion in late August, before settling to current levels, still requiring 43 days to clear completely. Meanwhile, the entry queue containing 432,077 ETH faces just a 7-day wait, creating an asymmetric dynamic that traps more supply than it releases in the short term. Ethereum Queue Wait Time (Source: ValidatorQueue ) This imbalance has created what analysts describe as artificial supply shortages, with previous Cryptonews reports highlighting how 833,000 ETH trapped in queues reduced available trading supply. The 9.1-day sweep delay adds additional friction to the exit process, meaning validators face multiple layers of waiting even after initiating unstaking requests. Exchange flow data reveals these queue dynamics are reducing sell pressure, with Bitcoin and Ethereum inflows hitting 1-year lows as larger holders avoid moving assets to trading platforms. Staking demand has continued growing despite the exit delays, with the queue reaching $3.7 billion in early September , its highest level since the Shanghai upgrade enabled withdrawals in 2023. Security Versus Liquidity Trade-offs Spark Broader Debate Notably, the unstaking controversy is a fundamental tension between blockchain security models and modern financial expectations for asset liquidity. Buterin’s military analogy reflects Ethereum’s proof-of-stake design philosophy, where validator commitments must be sticky enough to prevent coordinated attacks or mass exodus events that could destabilize consensus. Critics argue this creates a dangerous precedent where large holders face material liquidity constraints, potentially amplifying sell pressure when exits do occur or forcing investors toward liquid staking derivatives. The debate has sparked discussions about potential protocol modifications, including proposals for faster validator key switching that would allow repositioning without full exits. One X user suggested implementing “a faster process to unstake and restake with different clients that’s not adding to the queue” to improve client diversity without compromising security guarantees. Buterin responded favorably to a “switch your keys” function where validators would remain vulnerable to slashing from old keys temporarily while continuing to stake, describing it as something that “would only help, and would not hurt any guarantees.” There should be a ""switch your keys"" function, where you continue to be vulnerable to slashing from your old key for some time but otherwise keep staking. That seems like something that would only help, and would not hurt any guarantees. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 18, 2025 However, any changes to the current queue system would require broad consensus among Ethereum developers and stakeholders, given the security implications of reducing validator commitment friction.

Technical indicators give bullish signals, and the price charts also project a bullish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as buying momentum took hold, bringing the price to $3.11 during the day. The RSI increased to 58.61 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.22 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $21.95 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported on Canary Capital’s updated S-1 for XRP spot ETF with SEC. The ETF will hold XRP directly and trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange if it gets approval. This move is also perceived as a major milestone for XRP, making it to the mainstream in US markets. XRP price prediction September 2025 According to XRP price prediction, in September 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $3.39. The average trading price is expected to be $2.92 for the month, while the lowest it can go, as per XRP cost estimation, is $2.40, considering the current XRP sentiment.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In September, XRP is trending near the $2.8 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-18 18:21:18

Instead of piling into established tokens, market chatter is now centered on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi protocol designed with real-world lending and borrowing capabilities. Mutuum Finance has a potential of up to 16,700% returns looming on the horizon. The project is promising to be a coin for disruption in decentralized finance, leaving many questioning whether traditional darlings such as XRP can remain relevant as innovation-driven platforms continue to hog the spotlight. XRP Price Update XRP is trading at $2.98 currently, with the price fluctuating slightly from that level over the past 24 hours. It remains in consolidation mode, with support around the $2.80-$3.00 level and resistance around slightly more than $3.10. Trading volume has remained stable, with ongoing interest but no apparent breakout. Compared to XRP’s steadier performance, fresh DeFi token Mutuum Finance, is being viewed by investors as holding greater potential for upside in the current day’s market. Mutuum Finance Skyrockets into 6th Presale Stage Mutuum Finance presale has hit above $15.9 million and more than 16,370 investors have already signed up. Stage 6 is now available for as low as $0.035 per token. Mutuum Finance’s long-term plan is top-tier exchange listings for real-world applications and liquidity creation. Separately, the project is encouraging early adoption by conducting a $100,000 giveaway campaign, where 10 individuals receive $10,000 MUTM each. Mutuum Finance and CertiK run a live Bug Bounty Program with a reward pool of $50,000 USDT. The Bug Bounty Program is designed to invite white-hat hackers and security researchers to find bugs in the project codebase. Bugs are categorized based on the level of severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, and rewards given accordingly. The program is designed to make the platform secure, protect the investors, and secure the users across the ecosystem. Dynamic Interest and Liquidity Models Mutuum Finance has a dynamic interest rate model balanced by liquidity. Borrowing is desirable during the periods of low interest, with rising utilization and borrowing. Rising rates stimulate repayments, as do follow-up funding inputs. Fixed interest rates are appropriate for very liquid assets, stabilizing and renegotiable in terms of market volatility. As a fully decentralized system, control rights belong to MUTM token holders such that lending and borrowing are self-governing. The interest rate mechanism rewards long-term efficiency, encourages automatic portfolio diversification, and scales to keep pace with the changing DeFi ecosystem. Correct Price Discovery Sufficient pricing allows for lending, borrowing, and liquidation transactions. Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles to deliver USD and natively supported currencies such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX prices. The site utilizes fallback oracles, composite feeds, and time-weighted averages of decentralized exchanges to deliver reliable valuations even during distressed market conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight from Ripple (XRP) as whales and retail investors target more upside potential. Sitting in Stage 6 of its presale at $0.035, the project has attracted more than $15.9M in capital and 16,370+ investors, signaling strong demand. Experts predict up to 16,700% gains, much greater than the XRP consolidation at $2.98. With a $100K giveaway, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and dynamic interest models and oracle-based price discovery features, MUTM is building real DeFi utility with massive growth potential. Join presale stage 6 ahead of the next price spike in Stage 7.

Snorter is Solana-native by design, which gives it faster speeds and lower transaction costs than Ethereum-based rivals that remain weighed down by that network’s limitations, even as they expand multichain. The latest updates show pieces of the roadmap now becoming reality, with features like MEV protection, automated copy trading, and expanded DEX support already taking shape. The presale remains ongoing, with the current round pricing SNORT at $0.1047 per token for the next 20 hours before the price moves higher in the following round. Snorter Expands From Raydium to Pump.fun and PumpSwap for Earlier Entries The main value of Snorter lies in its ability to spot tokens before the moonshot begins. It achieves this through dedicated RPC endpoints – essentially private data highways that connect directly to the blockchain – giving it faster visibility into the mempool, where pending transactions appear before reaching public order books. By tracking liquidity injections, wallet flows, and new contract deployments in real time, the bot identifies tokens showing breakout potential and executes sub-second swaps directly inside Telegram. This gives retail traders a rare chance to act before the wider market catches on. Until recently, most of that trading happened on Raydium, Solana’s primary DEX, which meant Snorter’s reach was limited to a fraction of the opportunities. The latest update – first shared by the team on August 22 – expands support to Pump.fun and PumpSwap, Solana’s busiest launchpads for new meme coins. With this integration, Snor t er can now plug directly into their smart contracts, scanning fresh pools and routing trades instantly. In practice, this widens coverage so retail users can catch plays at the very start of a coin’s lifecycle, when the upside is often greatest. The updates also make trading more hands-off for users. Automated trading now runs on smarter infrastructure that watches the market continuously and pulls the trigger when targets are met, with real-time notifications sent the moment trades go through. Copy-trading has been upgraded as well, with faster wallet mirroring that lets users reliably follow top traders without missing a move. Source: https://snortertoken.com/en/updates/6 Snorter is Fine-Tuning Withdrawals and Copy-Trading to Protect Retail Profits On September 11, the project released new updates that show the team fine-tuning some of Snorter’s core features. Withdrawals are now in testing, with added security checks and fee calculations being refined to ensure smooth transfers of SOL and other tokens to third-party wallets. Copy-trading is also undergoing early testing, with the team refining mirror logic to ensure trades from tracked wallets are matched smoothly and accurately. At the same time, reliability upgrades are being implemented to strengthen failover systems and improve transaction handling, keeping the bot consistent even under heavy load. These refinements matter because they push Snorter beyond raw speed and early detection. In crypto – where retail often struggles with failed transactions, unreliable copy-trading, or clunky withdrawal processes – stability and security can make the difference between securing profits and losing them. Why Traders See 30x Potential in SNORT Taken together, these updates show that Snorter is progressing from concept to a fully operational system tailored for retail traders. They lay the foundation for a bot built to give smaller players the same kind of edge whales have long enjoyed, packaged in a tool that runs accessibly inside Telegram. Investor interest in the presale reflects that potential as $4 million could be hit in a matter of hours. Traders see Snorter as a rare chance to back a bot that could soon rival – or even surpass – incumbents like Banana Gun, Maestro, and Trojan. And at the center of it all is the SNORT token, which powers the ecosystem by unlocking the lowest fees in the market at just 0.85%, while also serving as the currency for staking rewards, governance, and advanced features that make the bot more effective. It’s no surprise then that top crypto news outlets like Cryptonews have already predicted SNORT could deliver a 30x return once it launches.

The initiative, announced in partnership with fundraising platform Legion, marks one of Kraken’s most ambitious steps yet toward reshaping how digital assets are introduced to the market. Kraken Launch Targets Retail Access to Early-Stage Tokens Under EU Rules For more than a decade, one of the challenges in crypto has been the lack of fair access to token launches. Retail users often only gain exposure once tokens begin trading openly, long after early backers and insiders have secured allocations. Kraken Launch is intended to change that dynamic by offering a model it describes as “IPO-style” token sales, ensuring greater transparency, equal access, and regulatory clarity. We’re partnering with @Legiondotcc to launch Kraken Launch, a new platform for exclusive token sales. Fair access. Clear disclosures. Backed by Kraken’s 14 years of trust. First sale coming soon https://t.co/xSD1QnncfN but wait, there’s more pic.twitter.com/cy5KxmMikF — Kraken (@krakenfx) September 18, 2025 The product arrives as Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework begins to take effect, with Kraken emphasizing that all sales conducted through the platform will adhere to clear regulatory requirements. According to the company, participants will have access to all necessary information, free from hidden allocations or insider deals, while enjoying the security and compliance infrastructure of the Kraken exchange. “Kraken is building the foundation of tomorrow’s financial infrastructure with crypto at its core,” said Brett McLain, the exchange’s Head of Payments and Blockchain. He added that the partnership with Legion would help democratize token sales by aligning communities with project builders, setting what he called a “higher standard” for the next generation of fundraising. Legion, which has built a reputation for its compliance-focused fundraising technology, will serve as the backbone of the initiative. Its system evaluates participants based on on-chain history, social activity, and developer contributions, ensuring that a portion of token allocations go to those who have meaningfully contributed to the ecosystem. The rest of the sales will be open on a first-come, first-served basis, both on Kraken Launch and Legion. Matt O’Connor, co-founder of Legion, framed the partnership as a step toward transforming capital markets. “The next Figma or Reddit won’t IPO. It’ll launch to its community on-chain,” he said. The announcement comes as Kraken continues to report strong financial performance despite market volatility. In its Q1 2025 update, the exchange disclosed $472 million in revenue and $187 million in adjusted EBITDA , a 19% year-on-year increase in revenue and a 1% rise in EBITDA. Trading volumes grew 29% compared with the previous year, while funded accounts increased by 26%. Kraken’s second-quarter figures showed a similar trend. Revenue climbed 18% year-on-year to $411.6 million, though adjusted EBITDA fell 7% to $79.7 million as weaker volumes followed a strong first quarter. Crypto exchange @krakenfx reported $411.6 million in revenue for the second quarter, marking an 18% year-on-year increase. #Kraken #Crypto https://t.co/WQ5PVTbM3p — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 31, 2025 Total exchange volume reached $186.8 billion, up 19% year-on-year but down 11% from Q1. Assets on the platform rose sharply, increasing 47% over the year to $43.2 billion by June. The launch of Kraken’s new product also comes amid reports that the company is preparing to raise $500 million at a $15 billion valuation ahead of a long-anticipated initial public offering scheduled for early 2026. Co-CEO Arjun Sethi has said the raise could help solidify investor confidence before the listing. Kraken Launches Tokenized Stock Trading for European Investors Crypto exchange Kraken has introduced xStocks, a tokenized securities trading product aimed at giving European investors access to leading U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The service, launched on September 10 through Kraken’s PEDSL-CY entity , is restricted to EU clients who pass an appropriateness test or qualify as professional investors. U.S. residents are excluded, as xStocks are not registered under the Securities Act. Launched in May, xStocks operate as tokenized certificates that mirror the market price of real-world securities, issued on-chain as SPL or BNB tokens. Each is backed 1:1 by the underlying asset and issued by Jersey-based Backed Assets (JE) Limited. @Krakenfx launches xStocks — tokenized securities trading for EU investors, offering access to top U.S. stocks & ETFs on-chain. #Kraken #Europe https://t.co/ctgJXC9hxc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 10, 2025 Holders gain exposure to price movements but do not receive shareholder rights such as voting or dividends. At launch, Kraken listed 60 assets, including Tesla, Apple, and GameStop. The move follows increasing regulatory scrutiny of tokenized equities. In August, representatives from Kraken met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to discuss tokenized trading frameworks, disclosure standards, and investor protections. Regulators worldwide have warned that tokenized stocks often lack the safeguards present in traditional equity markets, despite their 24/7 availability. Kraken has also been expanding its tokenization partnerships. In July, i t teamed up with Backed Finance and BNB Chain to extend xStocks as BEP-20 tokens, enabling broader access within decentralized finance. The rollout shows Kraken’s strategy to bridge traditional finance and blockchain. By bringing equities on-chain, the exchange is positioning tokenized securities as a new frontier in digital asset trading.

The sudden activity even revived the FTT token, which rallied beyond $1. The X account of Sam Bankman-Fried was activated after months of no posting. The account started following others, raising questions on whether Bankman-Fried was still interested in crypto from prison, or could be looking at an early release. So far, there is no official news of an eventual release. The FTX bankruptcy procedure is going according to plan, with another distribution to creditors on September 30. Based on suspected on-chain activity, Bankman-Fried has no dry powder for trades, as one of the meme trading wallets is now down to only 0.67 SOL . However, wallets linked to Alameda Research still receive SOL from their early allocation, though the funds are going toward bankruptcy settlements. Who did SBF follow? SBF followed a mix of accounts. Some looked automated, reposting the latest developments of American politics. Among the accounts followed was also a crypto user, Daniel Keller, who had made statements in support of a pardon for SBF. genuinely think there is a pretty airtight ethical argument to excuse SBF for all of the sloppy and illegal stuff he did considering how outsized the wins turned out to be. I totally get why he believes his biggest mistake was the bankruptcy and not the crimes. https://t.co/D0Fbo3Aec9 — Daniel Keller (@dnlklr) May 16, 2025 Other accounts included developers , a meme trench appreciator, and others seemingly connected to Web3. Previously, SBF has followed accounts in batches. This batch also shows he is still interested in crypto discourse. Most of the accounts were surprised by the following. The influence of SBF was shown once again on social media, as only a few follows put the account back in the spotlight. Previously, SBF has followed other accounts posting in favor of an early release or a full pardon. FTT token awakens with a rally to $1 The native token of the FTX exchange has gone through another irrational pump. FTT expanded from its usual range at $0.80 to $1.21, later dropping back below $1. FTT tokens had a sudden rally after months of sideways trading, reacting immediately to the activity of the SBF X account. | Source: Coingecko Despite the exchange’s bankruptcy, FTT is still traded on Binance, and seemingly quickly reacts to news. However, the token has minimal market depth, and its trading is mostly a meme-like event. FTT sees no serious investments or liquidity. In theory, Bankman-Fried is seen as a potential candidate for a Presidential pardon . The successful recovery of funds and compensation for creditors is in an advanced stage. For now, there is no consensus on whether Bankman-Fried will complete his sentence. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years without parole, starting in March 2024. In November, Bankman-Fried will have another appeal hearing, with the potential to alter the sentence. Based on prediction markets, a pardon is seen as relatively low-probability. Only 9% of Polymarket traders bet on a pardon by the end of 2025. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This came just one day after Lisa sat in on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where the Fed voted to cut the benchmark overnight rate by 0.25% . Cryptopolitan reported. Trump announced on August 25 that he was firing Lisa from her role on the seven-member Fed board, accusing her of mortgage fraud involving two properties she owns in Michigan and Georgia. Trump claimed Lisa made conflicting statements in two different mortgage applications, declaring both homes to be her primary residence. He argued that this conduct was both deceitful and potentially criminal, and he believed it showed a clear lack of fitness to serve on the board of the U.S. central bank. Federal judge blocks Trump as Cook sues to keep seat Lisa denied the allegations and sued Trump, saying he had no legal grounds to remove her. On September 9, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. ruled in her favor, for now. The judge issued a preliminary injunction that barred Trump from firing her while the lawsuit goes through the courts. The Justice Department tried to get around that order by going to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, asking a three-judge panel to block the ruling before the Fed met to decide rates. But on Monday night, the appeals court said no. In a 2-1 decision, the panel refused to pause the injunction, which meant Lisa was allowed to join the Fed’s internal meeting and vote. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who wrote the Supreme Court application, said Trump was being blocked from using powers that belong to the presidency. “This application involves yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President’s removal authority – here, interference with the President’s authority to remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause,” Sauer wrote. Sauer argued that Lisa has no Fifth Amendment property interest in staying on the Fed board and that her job isn’t protected by due process. He also rejected the judge’s view that Trump’s justification was invalid because the alleged misconduct happened before she was appointed. “The Federal Reserve Act’s broad ‘for cause’ provision rules out removal for no reason at all, or for policy disagreement,” Sauer said . “But so long as the President identifies a cause, the determination of ‘some cause relating to the conduct, ability, fitness, or competence of the officer’ is within the President’s unreviewable discretion.” Justice Department says reinstatement overstepped judicial power The filing claims Lisa misled mortgage lenders on both properties. Sauer wrote, “Cook had made contradictory representations in two mortgage agreements a short time apart, claiming that both a property in Michigan and a property in Georgia would simultaneously serve as her principal residence.” He added that the agreements described the declarations as material to the lender, because mortgages for a primary home usually come with lower interest rates due to reduced risk. Sauer said that when Trump found out about the issue, he decided Lisa’s “deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter” showed she was “unfit to continue serving on the Federal Reserve Board,” and that her actions were at least “the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into question [her] competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator.” He also slammed the district court’s move to reinstate Lisa to the Fed board. “The district court judge lacked authority to order reinstatement as an equitable remedy for the removal of an officer of the United States, as we have discussed in several recent stay applications,” Sauer wrote. The Justice Department is now asking the Supreme Court to wipe out the lower court’s ruling and let Trump fire Lisa immediately. If the court agrees with Trump, he’ll have picked four out of the seven current Fed governors. That number includes Stephen Miran, who was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday. Stephen was a senior official at the White House Council of Economic Advisors, and Trump nominated him to replace Adriana Kugler, who resigned in August without giving a reason. Stephen has already taken his seat, as he joined this week’s FOMC meeting with Lisa. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

That's What Senate Democrats Are Asking,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/09/18/is-binance-cutting-deals-with-team-trump-that-s-what-senate-democrats-are-asking,"Binance, the largest global crypto exchange, is still under the constraints of a massive, $4.3 billion U.S. enforcement action , though Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats are asking the Trump administration about reports that it's easing off on those orders. In 2023, the major digital assets platform agreed to settle with U.S. authorities for sanctions violations, insufficient money-laundering protections and operating without proper licensing, and its leader, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, pleaded guilty to Bank Secrecy Act violations, stepping down from the company and serving a brief prison sentence . Warren and two other senators, Richard Blumenthal and Mazie Hirono questioned Attorney General Pam Bondi in a letter this week, asking about reports by outlets including Bloomberg News that the company has spoken to the U.S. about dropping its independent compliance monitor. The senators also raised the continuing financial ties between the family of President Donald Trump and Binance, through their stake in World Liberty Financial. ""These reports make it more important than ever that the public understand the Trump administration’s interactions with, and relationship to, Binance and its employees,"" they wrote, demanding ""meaningful"" answers to several questions about the U.S. Department of Justice's interactions with Binance, including whether a pardon is being considered for CZ. As the markets contemplated a potential return of CZ, the Binance-tied BNB token rocketed over $1,000 for the first time, leaping over SOL to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The prosecution of Binance in the U.S., where the independent Binance.US arm still operates, occurred under the previous administration, and the arrival of President Trump and his pro-crypto choices to be regulators and law enforcement officials has rapidly shifted the stance of the U.S. government. Many of the efforts of previous officials to address digital assets market risks and the dangers of their use in illicit finance and drug trafficking have been overtaken by the administration's interest in financial innovation and establishing the U.S. as a global crypto hub. In May, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to drop its long-running lawsuit against Binance.

Given the notable performance of their futures market and interest, crucial tools are currently being created to optimize and capture opportunities in the ecosystem. CME Unveils Solana And XRP Futures Options In the ongoing cycle, Solana and XRP futures are receiving more attention in the derivatives market, indicating that both institutional and retail traders are becoming more interested. These assets are becoming more prominent alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in futures trading as liquidity increases and open interest grows. Amid the rising adoption, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group), one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges, has expressed its robust interest in the two leading assets. Specifically, the firm is expanding its crypto offerings with the planned launch of options on Solana and XRP futures. The action indicates that institutional demand for exposure to digital assets besides Bitcoin and Ethereum is increasing. According to the report, the initiative is still pending regulatory approval and is expected to be unveiled on October 13, 2025. Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products, speaking on the move, stated that the introduction of these options contracts builds on the company’s suite of Solana and XRP futures’ notable expansion and rising liquidity. CME Group’s launch of these new products will give clients the ability to trade options on SOL, Micro SOL, XRP, and Micro XRP futures. Once trading begins, expiries will be made available every day of the business week, every month, and every quarter of the year. It is worth noting that these contracts will be available in two different sizes. By introducing new trading instruments tied to Solana and XRP, the CME Group aims to provide investors with improved flexibility in risk management and seizing opportunities . The firm will be partnering with FalconX to enhance market efficiency and increase derivatives liquidity for its clients. Notable Futures Contracts Created On The Platform While options trading is still in the works, the Solana and XRP futures suite from CME Group has grown to be among the business’s most rapidly embraced futures offerings. In the report, the firm highlighted that more than 540,000 SOL futures contracts valued at $22.3 billion have traded since it was introduced on March 17. As of August 2025, the average daily volume (ADV) of SOL futures monthly reached 9,000 contracts, valued at $437.4 million in notional. Meanwhile, the average daily open interest (ADOI) reached 12,500 contracts, valued at $895 million in notional. Such growth has also been observed with its XRP futures, recording more than 370,000 XRP futures contracts worth $16 billion in notional value since launch on May 19. At the same time, the XRP futures saw a record ADOI of 9,300 contracts valued at $942 million in notional value, and a record monthly ADV reached over 6,600 contracts worth $385 million in notional value.",Crypto News|ADOI|ADV|Average Daily Open Interest|Average Daily Volume|CME Group|FalconX|Giovanni Vicioso|Micro SOL|Micro XRP Futures|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana Futures|Solana news|Solana price|solusd|SOLUSDT|XRP|XRP futures,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 19:00:08

Posting a two-month (2M) XRP/BTC chart with Ichimoku overlays and date markers for September/October, November/December and January/February, Dr Cat framed the setup around the position of the Chikou Span (CS) relative to price candles and the Tenkan-sen. “Based on the 2M chart I expect the next monster leg up to start no earlier than 2026,” he wrote. “Because the logical time for CS to get free above the candles is Jan/Feb 2026 on an open basis and March 2026 on a close basis, respectively.” XRP/BTC Breakout Window Opens Only In 2026 In Ichimoku methodology, the CS—price shifted back 26 periods—clearing above historical candles and the Tenkan-sen (conversion line) is used to confirm the transition from equilibrium to trending conditions. That threshold, in Dr Cat’s view, hinges on XRP/BTC defending roughly 2,442 sats (0.00002442 BTC). “As you see, the price needs to hold 2442 so that CS is both above the candles and Tenkan Sen,” he said. Related Reading: Facts Vs. Hype: Analyst Examines XRP Supply Shock Theory Should that condition be met, the analyst sees the market “logically” targeting the next major resistance band first around ~7,000 sats, with an extended 2026 objective in a 7,000–12,000 sats corridor on the highest time frames. “If that happens, solely looking at the 2M timeframe the logical thing is to attack the next resistance at ~7K,” he wrote, before adding: “Otherwise on highest timeframes everything still looks excellent and points to 7K–12K in 2026, until further notice.” The roadmap is not without nearer-term risks. Dr Cat flagged a developing signal on the weekly Ichimoku cloud: “One more thing to keep an eye on till then: the weekly chart. Which, if doesn’t renew the yearly high by November/December will get a bearish kumo twist. Which still may not be the end of the world but still deserves attention. So one more evaluation is needed at late 2025 I guess.” A bearish kumo twist—when Senkou Span A crosses below Senkou Span B—can foreshadow a medium-term loss of momentum or a period of consolidation before trend resumption. The discussion quickly turned to the real-world impact of the satoshi-denominated targets. When asked what ~7,000 sats might mean in dollar terms, the analyst cautioned that the conversion floats with Bitcoin’s price but offered a rough yardstick for today’s market. “In current BTC prices are roughly $7.8,” he replied. The figure is illustrative rather than predictive: XRP’s USD price at any future XRP/BTC level will depend on BTC’s own USD value at that time. The posted chart—which annotates the likely windows for CS clearance as “Jan/Feb open CS free” and “March close” following interim checkpoints in September/October and November/December—underscores the time-based nature of the call. On multi-month Ichimoku settings, the lagging span has to “work off” past price structure before a clean upside trend confirmation is possible; forcing the move earlier would, in this framework, risk a rejection back into the cloud or beneath the Tenkan-sen. Contextually, XRP/BTC has been basing in a broad range since early 2024 after a multi-year downtrend from the 2021 peak, with intermittent upside probes failing to reclaim the more consequential resistances that sit thousands of sats higher. The 2,442-sats area Dr Cat highlights aligns with the need to keep the lagging span above both contemporaneous price and the conversion line, a condition that tends to reduce whipsaws on very high time frames. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Major XRP Warning: Last Chance To Get In As Accumulation Balloons Whether the market ultimately delivers the 7,000–12,000 sats advance in 2026 will, by this read, depend on two things: XRP/BTC’s ability to hold above the ~2,442-sats pivot as the calendar turns through early 2026, and the weekly chart avoiding or quickly invalidating a bearish kumo twist if new yearly highs are not set before November/December. “If that happens… the logical thing is to attack the next resistance at ~7K,” Dr Cat concludes, while stressing that the weekly cloud still “deserves attention.” As with any Ichimoku-driven thesis, the emphasis is on alignment across time frames and the interaction of price with the system’s five lines—Tenkan-sen, Kijun-sen, Senkou Spans A and B (the “kumo” cloud), and the Chikou Span. Dr Cat’s thread leans on the lagging span mechanics to explain why an earlier “monster leg” is statistically less likely, and why the second half of 2025 will be a critical checkpoint before any 2026 trend attempt. For now, the takeaway is a timeline rather than an imminent trigger: the analyst’s base case defers any outsized XRP outperformance versus Bitcoin until after the CS clears historical overhead in early 2026, with interim monitoring of the weekly cloud into year-end. As he summed up, “On highest timeframes everything still looks excellent… until further notice.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.119.

LCX has no formal ties to Ripple or the XRP Ledger (XRPL), making the document an independent, regulator-facing assessment rather than promotional material. The filing is now listed with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and provides a detailed, verifiable account of how the XRPL operates. Independent Regulatory Filing LCX routinely prepares MiCA white papers for various blockchains as part of its exchange-listing process. Its XRP paper outlines XRPL’s consensus mechanism, governance, and energy profile to meet MiCA’s strict disclosure standards. By describing the network’s validator model in a public, regulator-approved document, LCX has given investors and supervisors a transparent source for evaluating decentralization claims. Proof that XRP(L) is decentralised! And is it even more decentralised than blockchains with other consensus mechanisms? LCX released a MiCA (EU crypto regulations) white paper for XRP! Let's take a look at what LCX say and why it's important. 1/6 pic.twitter.com/oZ5nfNvTEZ — Anders (@X__Anderson) September 18, 2025 Consensus Without Financial Rewards Central to LCX’s analysis is XRPL’s federated consensus protocol, known as the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA). Unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, XRPL validators do not earn block rewards or staking income. Their incentive is reputational and functional: businesses and services that depend on the ledger run validators to protect their own operations. LCX concludes that the absence of direct monetary incentives “reduces the risk of manipulation” and enhances decentralization by avoiding the economic concentration often seen when validators are paid in native tokens. How XRPL Compares to Other Networks Debates over decentralization are complex and multi-dimensional. Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks can face challenges such as being slowed down by their high energy requirements and the concentration of mining power in dominant pools. While PoS systems sometimes concentrate power among large token holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Even the Bank for International Settlements has cautioned that certain PoS models may centralize over time. XRPL’s approach sidesteps these token-based incentives, but independent researchers note that decentralization also depends on validator diversity and governance transparency. Critics often point to the historically small default Unique Node List (UNL) and Ripple’s influence in validator selection as factors that merit ongoing scrutiny. Evidence, Not a Final Verdict The LCX white paper offers concrete, regulator-level evidence that XRPL was designed to minimize centralizing economic incentives . It reinforces the long-standing argument that the ledger can remain decentralized without mining or staking rewards, while keeping transaction fees low and predictable. Ultimately, genuine decentralization is determined by the actual distribution of validators and community governance, requiring a consistent assessment that goes beyond a single filing. Anders’s highlight of the LCX MiCA white paper underscores a pivotal point: XRP’s architecture and governance are now documented in a regulatory framework rather than marketing materials. The paper strengthens the case that the XRP Ledger is decentralized by design, but it also invites ongoing analysis of validator participation and network governance. For anyone tracking the debate over which consensus mechanisms best preserve decentralization, the LCX report provides authoritative evidence—and a reminder that the conversation is far from over.

The company’s total investment in the state has surpassed $7 billion as it races to build capacity to meet the needs of companies that want to run AI models. The first data center, in nearby Mount Pleasant, cost around $3.3 billion, with expectations to come online in early 2026. Microsoft’s president and vice chair, Brad Smith, said the first Wisconsin data center will house hundreds of thousands of Nvidia Blackwell GB200 graphics processing units that can handle AI models. Microsoft wants to prevent driving up energy prices in Wisconsin If intelligence is the log of compute… it starts with a lot of compute! And that’s why we’re scaling our GPU fleet faster than anyone else. Just last year, we added over 2 gigawatts of new capacity – roughly the output of 2 nuclear power plants. And today we’re going further,… pic.twitter.com/cZJ3pdN1rX — Satya Nadella (@satyanadella) September 18, 2025 Smith revealed that the second data center will be similar in scale to the first and will come online in 2027 or after that. He added that the company has put a lot of effort into finding what it would build for phase two and how it would build the infrastructure. Microsoft said it will introduce power-efficient alternatives, such as pre-paying for electrical infrastructure, to avoid raising electricity rates in the region. The company also plans to include a state-of-the-art cooling system aimed at tapping into Wisconsin’s cool climate and reducing the data center’s yearly water use to that of an average restaurant. Smith, who spent part of his childhood in Mount Pleasant, said the tech firm will match the amount of energy it consumes from fossil fuel sources with carbon-free energy it will contribute to the grid. He assured residents in the region that Microsoft was doing everything it could to manage the power issue and would ensure they didn’t have to pay more for electricity because of its presence. The company’s president added that a solar farm under construction 150 miles northwest of the data centers will contribute 2250 megawatts of power. He also acknowledged that both data centers might require 900 megawatts for operation. “This is where the next generation of AI will be trained, setting the stage for breakthroughs that will shape the future. New discoveries in medicine, science, and other critical fields will start right here, with the models we train in Wisconsin.” -Brad Smith, President and Vice Chair at Microsoft. The site in Racine County for the second data center was initially the site of a proposed $10 billion manufacturing plant by Foxconn, but those plans were drastically scaled back. Smith disclosed that the second data center will use as much as 2.8 million gallons of water per year, compared to Foxconn’s permitted consumption of over 7 million per day. Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, stated that the company added over 2 gigawatts of new capacity last year, but said the second infrastructure will be the world’s most powerful data center. They said the data center will deliver 10x the performance of the world’s fastest supercomputer, which will enable AI training and faster inference workloads. Microsoft plans new AI investment in UK Nadella revealed that Microsoft’s new infrastructure is just one of several similar sites the company is establishing across more than 70 regions. He said the firm has also deployed over 100 data centers around the world that power AI model training, test-time compute, RL tuning, and real-time inference. The tech company also promised to employ around 500 full-time employees once the first data center is fully operational. The firm hopes the number of staff will grow to around 800 once the second data center is complete. On Tuesday, the tech giant said it would invest $30 billion in the UK by 2028 to establish its artificial intelligence infrastructure in the region. The plans also include an additional $15.5 billion in capital expansion and $15.1 billion in its UK operations. The company hopes the investment will enable it to build a supercomputer with more than 23,000 advanced graphics processing units (GPUs).

Open interest rise supports the bullish case, confirming strong market participation. Powell’s remarks limit risk assets, but Bitcoin maintains resilient upward momentum. By Sholanke Dele ​Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) price extended its advance on Thursday, lifted by the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate cut since 2024. The decision to lower borrowing costs by a quarter point provided a modest boost across risk assets, and the global crypto market cap rose 2% to $4.2 trillion. Bitcoin held firm through the announcement and pushed toward $118,000, marking its highest level in five weeks. The move came after Wednesday’s low near $114,700, which aligned with support at the 50 exponential moving average on the four-hour chart. That technical foundation encouraged dip buying, while a steady increase in open interest added fuel to the rally. By the late Asian session on Thursday, Bitcoin had touched a fresh high close to $118,000, surpassing the previous day’s peak and extending September’s uptrend. Bitcoin price dynamic (Aug - Sept 2025). Source: TradingView The fundamental backdrop was less straightforward. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the cut as a risk management step rather than the start of an aggressive easing cycle. He stressed that policymakers would not rush into deeper cuts, a signal that tempered broader risk sentiment. Traders who had already anticipated a rate trim found little reason to drive a sharp rally across financial markets. Still, Bitcoin managed to sustain its upward trajectory, showing relative resilience compared to other assets. Bitcoin RSI remains bullish, leaving room for further upside extension At the start of the European session on Thursday, Bitcoin was trading near $117,200, up 0.6% on the day. The price action confirms that buyers continue to dominate the near-term structure, keeping momentum tilted higher. The ability to close above $118,000 would further strengthen bullish conviction, potentially clearing the path toward the $120,000 threshold. This level stands as the next psychological marker for traders watching Bitcoin’s expansion through September. Technical conditions continue to support the outlook. The daily Relative Strength Index remains in bullish territory but has not yet crossed into overbought levels, leaving room for additional upside without immediate risk of exhaustion. Combined with steady participation through rising open interest, this indicates that buyers are still confident in testing higher ground. Overall, Bitcoin’s resilience following the Fed decision tells the strength of its trend. While Powell’s cautious remarks limited enthusiasm across traditional risk assets, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain momentum suggests that the market is pricing in not just the current cut but the possibility of easier conditions through the months ahead. The near-term challenge lies in holding above $118,000 to confirm the breakout, after which $120,000 becomes the next target for traders. Bitcoin traded above $116,800 as FOMC decision dominated market focus . At the same time, open interest rise confirmed capital inflows supporting the rally.

Crypto analysts have now revealed that PENGU has triggered a bullish retest to resume its rally to around $0.09, which is about 150% from current price levels. Technical Analysis: PENGU Breakout Setup Eyes 67% Rally to $0.065 On the technical side, the PENGU/USDT chart reveals an Elliott Wave pattern with a completed 5-wave impulse structure from the initial low, followed by what appears to be a corrective ABC pattern that bottomed around the $0.030 level in September. Source: TradingView The wave count indicates this could be the beginning of a third wave within a larger degree impulse, which typically represents the strongest and most extended moves in Elliott Wave theory. The projection lines show potential targets, with the most conservative target around $0.051 representing approximately 31% upside from current levels, while the more aggressive projection extends toward $0.058, offering roughly 49% potential gains. This bullish outlook gains additional support from the formation of a well-defined bullish pennant pattern that emerged following the July peak at $0.046. Source: TradingView The pennant structure typically signals continuation of the prior uptrend, and the measured move from this formation projects a target toward the $0.065 level, representing approximately 67% upside potential from current levels. The wave relationship and Fibonacci extensions support these higher targets, particularly given that third waves often extend 1.618 times the length of the first wave, while the pennant breakout would provide additional confirmation of the bullish trajectory.

Firstly, there’s Aptos’ infrastructure, designed for affordability, scalability, and speed. Secondly, PayPal boasts international credibility as a reliable payment company. The alliance could spark a shift in how individuals move money online amid increasing attention in instant, borderless payment options. Understanding PYUSD0 and PYUSD PayPal launched the US dollar-pegged PYUSD stablecoin in 2023. Meanwhile, PYUSD0 is a visionary version of PYUSD designed to move seamlessly across different networks. PYUSD0 aims to make PayPal’s stablecoin interoperable, allowing individuals to send PYUSD across different chains, starting with Tron, and today’s expansion to Aptos. Notably, PYUSD0 leverages LayerZero’s OTF (Omnichain Fungible Token) standard. It is a suitable option for people looking to hold PayPal’s official stablecoin (PYUSD) on any platform. LayerZero and Stargate’s roles LayerZero, which supports secure, seamless communication between blockchains, is crucial in PayPal and Aptos’ deal. Through its recently acquired Stargate bridge , LayerZero will support frictionless PYUSD0 transfers between Tron, Ethereum, Aptos, and possibly more chains in the future. That could be a game-changer for developers on Aptos. They can integrate PYUSD0 into payment apps, DeFi protocols, wallets, and gaming ecosystems. Besides near-instant transactions, users will enjoy heightened flexibility as they can use PYUSD stablecoin whenever they want, regardless of the chain holding it. Fueling crypto adoption These developments are crucial as crypto becomes mainstream. PayPal contributes regulatory credibility and brand recognition, whereas Aptos ensures inexpensive and faster transfers. Successful Aptos integration could expand PYUSD0’s utility beyond cryptocurrency trading into global remittances, P2P transfers, and online shopping. Notably, the Aptos integration comes less than a day after PayPal announced its collaboration with Google. Commenting on the deal, PayPal CEO and President Alex Chriss said : Together with Google, we are leading the way for digital commerce, ensuring greater opportunities for merchants and users worldwide. We are bringing PayPal’s products and services to billions of Google users and redefining what’s possible at a global scale. APT price outlook Aptos’ native token traded in the green amidst the collaboration news. APT has gained more than 7% on its daily chart to $2.73.

Pure-play miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) surged 10% and 17% on Thursday, leading gains among the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF members. There are two key factors that may be driving the sharp gains. The first is the idea that investors could be front-running expectations of a strong year-end for bitcoin, a period that has historically delivered some of its most bullish returns. BTC is climbing towards $118,000 following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, up 2.2% on Thursday and trading only 5% below its all-time high. With sentiment improving, miners with significant BTC stash on the balance sheet could be leveraged plays on bitcoin's potential rally to new records.

Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of BTC, is up 7% as well today. The second driver could be investors rotating profits from stocks in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which have enjoyed outsized gains over the past months.

The company wants to deploy the Atlas 950 supernode in 2026, and each unit will support 8,192 chips. It will then release the next-generation Atlas 960 supernode in 2027, holding 15,488 chips. When Huawei connects all the supernodes into SuperPods and then into a full SuperCluster, the Atlas 950 SuperCluster will use more than 500,000 chips, and the Atlas 960 SuperCluster could use over one million chips. The company wants to make up for the fact that each Ascend chip is not as strong as the top chips made by Nvidia or other competitors. Huawei says its Atlas 950 SuperCluster will have 6.7 times more computing power than Nvidia’s NVL144 system and be 1.3 times more powerful than Elon Musk’s xAI Colossus supercomputer. The company has already delivered over 300 Atlas 900 supernodes to 20+ customers in industries that need large-scale AI computing, such as telecom and factories. Huawei also uses its strong networking technology and China’s stable power supply to ensure all the connected chips run smoothly without slowing down or overheating. Some experts say Huawei exaggerated the system’s performance, but most agree that it is serious about challenging its top competitors in global AI computing. Huawei releases new Ascend chips through 2028 Huawei will release a new version of Ascend AI chips every year, and each model will steadily increase the company’s computing power and double the performance of the previous one. The company will roll out the Ascend 950PR early next year, then the Ascend 950DT in late 2026, the Ascend 960 in late 2027, and finally the Ascend 970 in late 2028. Instead of depending on very powerful single chips that are harder and more expensive to produce, the company will gradually expand its computing power over time. Huawei also wants to introduce its high-bandwidth AI memory to help the chips process data faster and manage bigger workloads. The company’s SuperClusters can deliver faster computing, handle more data simultaneously, and run complex AI tasks by combining the new Ascend chips with high-bandwidth memory. This approach will also allow China to reduce its dependence on foreign AI chips and memory since U.S. export restrictions and sanctions have already cut off access to high-end technology. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang cautioned that America’s self-imposed distance from China’s booming artificial intelligence sector could hand the market to Huawei. During a wide-ranging interview at Paris’s Viva Technology event, Huang said that U.S. restrictions on exporting high-end AI chips to China may backfire, boosting Huawei’s domestic dominance and potentially positioning it to serve global markets. According to Huang, Nvidia’s current processors lead the industry by roughly one product cycle. Still, he warned that if US firms refuse to engage with Chinese customers, “Huawei has got China covered, and Huawei has got everybody else covered.” Huawei is committed to long-term growth as it plans a multi-year rollout to expand its SuperClusters and meet growing AI demands over time. This strategy will also allow the company to upgrade existing SuperClusters as they release new versions into the market and prepare Huawei to meet global AI demand. Get seen where it counts.

Elizabeth, along with two other Democratic senators, sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi asking if Binance is meeting the “ongoing requirements” tied to that agreement. The letter, reviewed by Cryptopolitan , also asked about any private talks between Binance and officials in the Trump administration. In the letter, which was first sent in May, the senators questioned whether federal authorities are still keeping Binance in check after the company admitted to breaking U.S. laws by laundering money, running an unlicensed money-transfer service, violating sanctions, and failing to report suspicious transactions involving terrorist groups. The senators told Pam they were worried about reported meetings between Binance executives and Treasury Department officials, and demanded a full rundown of what actions had been taken to ensure Binance doesn’t ignore its settlement. Senators demand proof Binance is being monitored The letter spelled out four things they wanted the DOJ to answer. First, they asked what actual steps have been taken to keep Binance in full compliance with the terms it agreed to. Second, they asked for an update on Binance’s planned withdrawal from the U.S. They wanted the timeline, what actions had already been taken, and when the company was expected to fully leave the country. Third, they wanted to know if Binance had tried to bring up a possible pardon for former CEO Changpeng Zhao in conversations with the DOJ. And finally, they asked whether Binance ever brought up World Liberty Financial or its plans to list a new stablecoin with any DOJ officials. That last part isn’t just a random curiosity. It ties back to the Trump family. Since May, Donald Trump and his family have reportedly deepened their financial links to Binance through their company, World Liberty Financial. That connection is part of why the senators are pushing so hard for transparency. They’re not just asking about past violations; they’re looking at the current administration’s possible role in what Binance is doing now. The DOJ replied on September 12, but Elizabeth said after repeating basic public facts about the 2023 plea agreement, the letter said that “Binance has paid all the penalties due to the Department.” It then added that Binance “also has ongoing requirements under the terms of its plea agreement, including cooperating with the Department and remediation and enhancement of its compliance program.” But that’s where it stopped. It didn’t say whether Binance is meeting any of those obligations. It didn’t confirm if the DOJ is actively monitoring compliance. And it didn’t answer a single one of the four questions in any clear way. New Binance deal raises questions about oversight The timing of this DOJ silence is what makes it even more alarming. This same week, reports revealed that Binance is now in talks with the Justice Department to drop its outside compliance monitor. That monitor was a core part of the $4.3 billion settlement deal from 2023, and was supposed to ensure that Binance didn’t slip back into its old ways. If that monitor gets removed, Binance would basically be back to policing itself. For Elizabeth, that raises serious concerns. “Since May, President Trump and his family have increased their financial ties to Binance,” the senators wrote, pointing directly to the relationship between World Liberty Financial and the crypto exchange. They added that “just this week, news broke that Binance may be ‘moving toward a potential deal with the US Justice Department that would allow it to drop’ its outside compliance monitor, a ‘key oversight requirement in its $4.3 billion settlement.’” The letter ended with one final request: that Pam Bondi give them real answers to all four questions by October 1, 2025.

According to the company's analysis, short-term investors (STH) have begun accumulating Dogecoin again, while long-term investors (LTH) have begun releasing their coins. Alphractal noted that historically, periods of DOGE accumulation by short-term investors have signaled strong bull markets, adding, “We may be on the verge of a major Dogecoin price jump.” Alphractal founder Joao Wedson argued that altcoin markets have performed poorly compared to Bitcoin over the past two months: “Over the last 60 days, leading altcoins have lost value against BTC. The current altcoin rally is largely driven by new projects or Binance Smart Chain-connected coins. September isn't over yet, so I expect some recovery in BTC dominance. More established altcoins will only regain traction after that.” Related News: BNB Surpasses $1,000 for the First Time in Its History, CZ Makes First Statement Wedson pointed out that it is wrong for investors to attribute market movements to the news flow: If you position on the Fed, the FOMC, interest rate cuts, Trump, or Elon Musk, you're doomed to lose. As Wyckoff taught a century ago, news is an effect, never a cause. Smart money and market makers anticipate information and quietly build their positions.

The chart shows a bullish flag pattern; a breakout could push PENGU toward $0.074, more than doubling its current value. MACD and Stochastic RSI point to strong momentum, though near-term pullbacks remain a possibility. Price Pushes Higher After Retest Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) was trading at $0.037 at press time, showing a 10% gain in the past 24 hours with a trading volume of $528 million. Over the last week, the token has risen by 9%, signaling stronger interest from traders. On the 12-hour chart, PENGU had broken out above a descending channel that had kept prices moving lower since late July. The breakout was confirmed as $0.032 held as support during the retest. Fibonacci levels suggest next targets around $0.047, $0.064, and $0.076, with extended projections pointing toward $0.096 if momentum continues . Analyst Ali Martinez said, Successful bullish retest!

The breakout from accumulation created a steep flagpole, followed by a pullback inside a downward channel. This structure is often read as a continuation setup, where consolidation is followed by another push higher. Bitcoinsensus noted, $PENGU Bullish Flag in Play!

In addition, Momentum readings align with the bullish setup. The MACD line has moved above the signal line, and the histogram has flipped positive, pointing to building strength on the upside. The Stochastic RSI is trending higher at 78 and 66, close to the overbought range. This suggests intense buying pressure but also leaves room for short-term pullbacks before further moves higher.

The head of a leading crypto exchange says the launch of an XRP ETF could bring a wave of fresh capital into the market. He believes the impact will strengthen XRP’s place among digital assets, attract institutional investors, and increase trust in the token. Crypto.com CEO Predicts $8 Billion Inflows Into XRP ETF In a recent video posted on X by John Squire, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek shared his bold outlook for XRP’s future. He predicts that a new XRP ETF could draw as much as $8 billion in inflows in its first year. According to Marszalek, that level of new money would provide XRP with the extra liquidity it needs to gain more ground in the global cryptocurrency market. Marszalek explains that these inflows would show a new level of confidence, moving XRP beyond being viewed as just a speculative asset in the digital space. According to the Crypto.com CEO, this moment marks the beginning of XRP’s next phase of growth. Marszalek’s prediction suggests that the ETF would indicate institutions are prepared to view XRP as more than just a trading coin. For the XRP community, Marszalek’s words are adding to the excitement already building. ETF To Drive Institutional Demand And Liquidity Growth As institutions add XRP to their portfolios, retail interest may also rise, broadening the base of buyers. The Crypto.com CEO believes the new inflows will not only raise XRP’s position but also give it a larger role in decentralized finance (DeFi). With billions in fresh capital, XRP could appeal more to investors who want blockchain assets for trading or financial tools. The timing of the first XRP spot ETF also adds to the bullish momentum. The REX Shares and Osprey Funds will launch the XRP ETF on September 18. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart confirms that the XRP ETF is set to launch this week, despite potential delays for other products. ETF expert Eric Balchunas also notes that, although timelines are shifting, the Osprey XRP ETF is ready to begin trading soon, and experts predict it will attract increased institutional demand. If that forecast holds , XRP could face a sudden inflow that market watchers call a “liquidity tsunami.” With inflows of up to $8 billion predicted by the Crypto.com CEO, the XRP ETF could mark the beginning of a liquidity surge unlike anything the asset has experienced before. Expectations are running high among community members and market watchers, who will closely monitor the speed at which funds arrive and how exchanges handle the resulting flows. Traders and long-term holders say they will closely monitor liquidity, adoption, and whether XRP gains steady institutional support moving forward.",XRP|ETF|ETF news|XRP ETF|XRP ETF news|XRP ETFs|XRP ETFs news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-18 20:00:03

As the digital asset shows resilience against broader market volatility, Adam Back, the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blockstream, a blockchain technology company, has made a bold prediction that Bitcoin at $100,000 is still cheap. The crypto founder believes the flagship cryptocurrency holds far greater potential, predicting its real peak value for this cycle. Why Bitcoin Price At $100,000 Is Still Cheap Back, a long-time advocate of Bitcoin, recently emphasized that the market continues to underestimate BTC’s long-term potential. According to him, debates around diminishing returns from each halving cycle may not fully reflect the current economic climate. The crypto founder pointed out that the most recent halving cycle was impacted by macroeconomic disruptions, such as pandemic-related money printing and global supply chain issues, which may have suppressed Bitcoin’s potential upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Turns Bullish Above $114,000 With Hidden Divergence Forming The Blockstream CEO explained that Bitcoin’s previous peak above $73,000 occurred prematurely and should not be treated as the natural top of the last cycle. Instead, he views it as a temporary cap influenced by external economic headwinds. With those obstacles easing and market conditions aligning more favorably, Back argues that a $100,000 valuation for Bitcoin is “too cheap” relative to its true cycle top. Looking forward, the Blockstream co-founder believes Bitcoin could climb significantly higher during this current cycle, projecting a peak in the range of $500,000 to $1 million. This bullish forecast underscores his conviction that institutional adoption, increasing scarcity, and a shifting global economic environment are setting the stage for BTC’s most explosive rally yet. Chart Analysis Suggests BTC Could Hit $124,000 This Week Crypto analysts are also observing strong technical patterns that suggest Bitcoin may be preparing for another significant breakout. IncomeSharks, a prominent market analyst, has projected that BTC could reach $120,000 by the end of the week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes ‘Rarest Signal’ Ever, Is A 100% Rally Possible? His analysis, shared on X social media, is supported by a chart indicating a recovery from recent dips and a potential continuation of the upward trend. Currently, Bitcoin has rebounded from its correction below $108,000 and is now trading above $117,000. IncomeSharks’ chart highlights a “small support break” that has already been recovered, strengthening the bullish case for further price movement. If momentum continues as anticipated, a decisive test of resistance levels near $124,000 appears imminent. Adding to the optimism, market expert Ash Crypto has noted that Bitcoin is experiencing its strongest September in over a decade. Historically, September has often been a bearish month for the cryptocurrency, but this year has shown exceptional resilience. The analyst noted that when BTC closed September in the green, October and November have been “giga bullish.” If this pattern holds, he suggests that the final quarter of 2025 could mark the beginning of a major bull run.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-on-the-radar-of-uk-policymakers-heres-the-latest/,"A recent X post by SMQKE spotlighted a written submission to the UK Foreign Affairs Committee by the Emerging Payments Association (EPA). In this document, the EPA identifies “a Ripple-based messaging system backed with XRP, the Ripple token,” as a tool for real-time transmission of both the payment message and the funds. The association explains that such a system could eliminate the need for banks at both ends of a cross-border transaction to hold pre-funded liquidity. It also notes that smart contracts could enable 100% guaranteed Letters of Credit, underscoring the transformative power of this technology. Understanding the EPA’s Role The EPA, founded in 2008, represents more than 130 members who collectively employ over 300,000 staff and process more than £7 trillion annually. Its membership spans the full payments value chain—banks, issuers, merchant acquirers, payment processors, retailers, and technology providers. The EPA collaborates with regulators such as the Bank of England , FCA, HM Treasury, and international partners across Europe and Asia, giving its recommendations significant industry weight. THE EMERGING PAYMENTS ASSOCIATION URGES UK PARLIAMENT TO CONSIDER XRP FOR CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT INNOVATION AS A TECHNOLOGY THAT IS SHIFTING GLOBAL FINANCIAL POWER XRP is on the radar of UK policymakers. “The benefit of a Ripple-based messaging system backed with XRP,… pic.twitter.com/gRpphrHqkk — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 18, 2025 Historical Engagement with Ripple While the EPA’s submission dates to mid-2021, it builds on earlier UK exploration of Ripple technology. In 2017, the Bank of England ran a proof-of-concept with Ripple to test synchronized movement of currencies across real-time gross settlement systems, aiming to reduce settlement risk and improve speed. Ripple has also provided evidence to other UK parliamentary inquiries, reinforcing the government’s familiarity with its cross-border payment solutions. Current Policy and Regulatory Landscape The UK government is actively enhancing its crypto asset regulatory framework, with HM Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority issuing consultations and draft rules to bring clarity to the legal landscape for crypto activities while promoting innovation, safeguarding consumers, and maintaining financial stability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Against this backdrop, the EPA urges policymakers to create an environment that can “enable these technologies” so the UK can remain a global hub for payments innovation. Opportunities and Hurdles The EPA argues that XRP-backed systems could cut liquidity costs, shorten settlement times , and enable conditional payment instruments for international trade. Yet it also cautions that successful adoption depends on robust regulation, interoperability standards, and accountability mechanisms. Banks and financial institutions will require clarity on token classification, anti-money-laundering safeguards, and legal settlement finality before committing to large-scale use. Outlook SMQKE’s post highlights that UK policymakers recognize XRP’s potential to transform cross-border payments. While no official adoption has been announced, the combination of EPA advocacy, past Bank of England pilots, and ongoing regulatory work positions the UK to evaluate XRP as part of its future payments strategy. Industry watchers should follow forthcoming government consultations and central-bank pilots for the next concrete steps in this evolving story.

The Binance-based perpetual futures DEX has already surged more than 500%, climbing to a $400 million market cap as speculators label the altcoin a Hyperliquid competitor. hyperliquid — terry (@terrytjw) September 18, 2025 To their credit, Aster already ranks as the fourth largest perps DEX by volume, according to DefiLlama data . It outperforms the likes of MYX, which sits at $2 billion market cap. Perp DEXs ranked by volume. Source: DefiLlama. Still, it remains distant from challenging Hyperliquid, receiving 10x less daily volume and 21x less weekly volume. As a newly launched token, ASTER stands to see volatility, particularly tied to the influence of CZ, with short-term speculative trading likely amplifying swings. ASTER Coin Price Analysis: Is this the next 100x DeFi play? The Aster rally looks primed for continuation following the breakout of a falling wedge pattern that has been forming since its launch high. ASTER / USDT 15-min chart, falling wedge breakout. Source: TradingView. While early post-breakout momentum faltered, the token has now found firm support, bouncing from $0.70 as indicators stabilize. The RSI has reset into more neutral territory after narrowly avoiding the oversold threshold, a level that typically marks local tops. At 55, there is more upside potential. More so, the MACD line continues to hold above the signal line, pointing to resilience in the wider bullish trend. If fully realized, the wedge breakout targets a return to Aster’s launch high near $1.30, marking a potential 130% gain from current levels. Breaking free of this range, and with continued shilling from industry figures, ASTER could push into new price discovery. This would target the next milestone at $5 , a 745% jump from here. Such a climb would better align spot value with network activity. But a true 100x rally will hinge on sticky user growth and sustained adoption beyond the early hype of its debut.
