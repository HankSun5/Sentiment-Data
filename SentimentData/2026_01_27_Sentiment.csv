On-chain data shows the attacker began moving funds in January 2026. In the fresh moves, it deposited $5.4 million worth of Ethereum into Tornado Cash so far. Before the deposits, the theft-linked address moved roughly $5.8 million in DAI to a fresh wallet. That DAI was swapped for Ether. The ETH was then broken into multiple deposits, and Tornado Cash activity followed a clear batching pattern. The attacker sent twenty deposits of 100 ETH, and then smaller amounts followed. These included 10 ETH, 1 ETH, and fractional transfers. However, a separate wallet linked to the attacker is still holding about $4.6 million in DAI. This comes in when the global crypto market is dealing with heavy selling pressure. Ethereum has dropped by almost 10% in the last 7 days. ETH was trading in the range of $3,100-$3,700 in April 2024, when the exploit happened. As of now, Ether is trading at an average price of $2,890. Coinbase Commerce exploit The incident traces back to the date flagged in April 2024. On-chain investigator ZachXBT reported suspicious outflows from a Coinbase Commerce contract at the time. On April 21, 2024, the contract recorded more than 1,700 USDC outflows over a 16-hour window on Polygon. The total value reached $15.97 million. The pattern suggested a merchant using Coinbase Commerce had been exploited. The funds were drained in repeated transfers. The stolen USDC was later bridged from Polygon to Ethereum. It was swapped for Ether and was split across three wallets. The attacker has resumed activity after nearly two years of dormancy and is now depositing stolen funds into Tornado Cash. A total of $5.4M has been deposited so far. Prior to this, the theft address transferred $5.8M DAI to a fresh wallet, which was subsequently swapped for… https://t.co/6hZWByeuRQ pic.twitter.com/67vx2CLk6U — Specter (@SpecterAnalyst) January 26, 2026 Shortly after the theft, a threat actor using the alias “Excite” began discussing the funds in private chats. ZachXBT linked those claims to addresses tied to the outflows. He mentioned that back in May 2024, a Telegram user using the handle “tezedasads12” sent a 1 DAI transaction. The transfer was used to prove control over a wallet holding about $6 million from the theft. The same actor claimed ownership of the Instagram username “Excite.” He also attempted to purchase a matching Telegram username but failed. The Instagram account was initially private, but it later went public. The account showed luxury watches and other high-value items. ZachXBT stated that open source intelligence suggested the individual may have been based in Denmark. That detail was not independently confirmed. After the initial laundering phase, most of the funds stopped moving. Wallets linked to the exploit went dormant. Meanwhile, a smaller portion of funds was later routed through decentralized exchanges and staking platforms. Those transactions were used to move assets into new wallets. One deposit address showed high exposure to known drainer infrastructure. Investigators flagged that as a risk signal. The January 2026 Tornado Cash deposits mark the first major activity tied to the exploit in nearly two years. Coinbase hack 2025 The case adds to a series of security incidents tied to Coinbase. In May 2025, Coinbase disclosed a separate cyber attack. The company said the incident could cost up to $400 million. In that case, attackers obtained limited customer data by paying contractors and employees. The data was used to impersonate Coinbase and trick users. Coinbase said fewer than 1 percent of customers were affected. The attackers demanded $20 million and Coinbase refused to pay. Private keys were not compromised. However, the company said it would reimburse affected users. Get seen where it counts.

The lawsuit, filed October 13, 2025 in California’s Central District Court, represents the latest front in an expanding battle between content creators and technology companies over the ethical boundaries of AI training data acquisition. Snap AI Lawsuit Details and Core Allegations The plaintiffs, creators behind three YouTube channels with approximately 6.2 million collective subscribers, specifically allege that Snap trained its AI systems on their video content without permission or compensation. According to court documents, the YouTubers claim Snap utilized their creative work to develop features like the “Imagine Lens,” which enables users to edit images through text prompts. The lawsuit centers on Snap’s alleged use of the HD-VILA-100M dataset, a massive video-language collection containing millions of YouTube videos originally intended for academic research purposes only. Court filings reveal particularly detailed allegations about how Snap allegedly circumvented YouTube’s protections. The plaintiffs claim the company routed around YouTube’s technological restrictions, terms of service, and licensing limitations to repurpose content for commercial AI development. This alleged circumvention forms a crucial element of the legal argument, suggesting intentional avoidance of established content usage frameworks. The Expanding Legal Battlefield for AI Training Data This lawsuit represents just one engagement in a much broader conflict spanning multiple industries and creative domains. According to the Copyright Alliance, over 70 copyright infringement cases have been filed against AI companies as of October 2025. The legal landscape reveals a complex pattern of outcomes and ongoing disputes: Case Parties Status/Outcome Key Issue Current Case YouTubers vs. Snap Newly Filed Video content for AI training Previous Case Authors vs. Meta Ruled for Meta Text content for AI training Previous Case Authors vs. Anthropic Settlement Paid Copyright infringement claims Related Case YouTubers vs. Nvidia Active Litigation Similar video scraping claims The plaintiffs in the Snap case previously filed similar lawsuits against Nvidia, Meta, and ByteDance, indicating a coordinated legal strategy across multiple technology platforms. This multi-defendant approach suggests creators are systematically challenging what they perceive as industry-wide practices rather than isolated incidents. Legal Precedents and Industry Implications Legal experts note the varying outcomes in similar cases create uncertainty about how courts will ultimately rule on these novel copyright questions. The case between Meta and a group of authors resulted in a ruling favoring the technology giant, while Anthropic chose to settle with plaintiffs rather than pursue extended litigation. These divergent approaches reflect the legal complexity surrounding: Fair Use Doctrine Application: How courts interpret transformative use in AI training Dataset Licensing Boundaries: What constitutes proper versus improper use of research datasets Technological Circumvention: Whether bypassing platform restrictions constitutes violation Commercial Versus Research Use: How courts distinguish between different application contexts The Plaintiffs and Their Legal Strategy The case is spearheaded by creators from three distinct YouTube channels, each representing different content niches and audience sizes. The primary plaintiff operates the h3h3 YouTube channel with 5.52 million subscribers, while additional plaintiffs represent the golf-focused channels MrShortGame Golf and Golfoholics. This diversity in content types strengthens the class action argument by demonstrating how AI training potentially affects creators across multiple genres and audience scales. The lawsuit seeks both statutory damages and a permanent injunction against the alleged copyright infringement. The injunction request represents a particularly significant aspect of the case, as it could establish ongoing restrictions on how Snap and potentially other companies utilize creator content for AI development. Legal analysts suggest this combination of monetary and injunctive relief indicates a strategic effort to create both immediate consequences and long-term behavioral changes within the technology industry. Technical Dimensions of the HD-VILA-100M Dataset The lawsuit provides specific technical details about the datasets allegedly used improperly by Snap. The HD-VILA-100M dataset contains approximately 100 million video clips with corresponding text descriptions, originally compiled for academic computer vision and natural language processing research. Key characteristics of this dataset include: Source Composition: Primarily YouTube videos with Creative Commons licenses Original Purpose: Academic research in multimodal learning systems Access Restrictions: Intended for non-commercial research applications Content Scope: Diverse video categories with text annotations The plaintiffs allege Snap accessed and utilized this dataset despite clear restrictions against commercial application. Furthermore, they claim the company employed technical methods to bypass YouTube’s protective measures designed to prevent automated scraping of content. These technical allegations add a layer of complexity beyond simple copyright claims, potentially invoking additional legal frameworks related to computer fraud and terms of service violations. Industry Response and Regulatory Context The technology industry has developed varied responses to these growing legal challenges. Some companies have begun establishing formal licensing agreements with content providers, while others continue to assert that their data collection practices fall within fair use protections. Simultaneously, regulatory bodies in multiple jurisdictions are developing new frameworks specifically addressing AI training data acquisition, creating a rapidly evolving compliance landscape. Industry observers note several emerging trends in how companies approach these issues: Proactive Licensing: Some firms now negotiate content usage agreements before AI development Dataset Auditing: Increased scrutiny of training data sources and licensing terms Technical Alternatives: Development of synthetic data generation methods Industry Standards: Emerging best practices for ethical AI training data acquisition Historical Context and Legal Evolution The current lawsuit exists within a historical continuum of copyright disputes adapting to technological innovation. Previous generations witnessed similar legal battles surrounding: Music Sampling: Copyright disputes in hip-hop and electronic music production Image Search Engines: Legal challenges to thumbnail generation and display Text Aggregation: News aggregation services and copyright infringement claims Software Reverse Engineering: Copyright boundaries in interoperability development Each of these historical precedents established legal principles that now inform contemporary AI copyright disputes. However, legal experts caution that AI training presents unique challenges because it involves massive-scale data ingestion rather than discrete copying of individual works. This distinction may prove crucial in how courts apply existing copyright frameworks to these new technological contexts. Broader Implications for Content Creation Ecosystems The outcome of this lawsuit could significantly impact multiple stakeholders within digital content ecosystems. Content creators across platforms may gain clearer rights regarding how their work is utilized in AI development. Simultaneously, AI companies might face increased compliance requirements and potentially higher operational costs for training data acquisition. Platform operators like YouTube may need to implement more robust technical protections and clearer usage policies. Potential ripple effects include: Content Valuation Changes: New economic models for creator compensation Platform Policy Revisions: Updated terms of service addressing AI training Industry Collaboration: Potential partnerships between creators and AI developers Regulatory Development: New laws specifically governing AI training practices Conclusion The YouTubers’ lawsuit against Snap represents a critical juncture in defining how copyright law applies to artificial intelligence development. As AI systems increasingly rely on vast quantities of human-created content for training, legal frameworks must evolve to balance innovation incentives with creator rights protection. This Snap AI lawsuit, alongside numerous similar cases, will help establish precedents that shape AI development practices for years to come. The ultimate resolution will influence not only technology companies and content creators but also how society navigates the complex intersection of artificial intelligence, intellectual property, and creative expression in the digital age. FAQs Q1: What specific AI feature is at the center of the YouTubers’ lawsuit against Snap? The lawsuit specifically mentions Snap’s “Imagine Lens” feature, which allows users to edit images using text prompts. The plaintiffs allege this feature was trained using their copyrighted YouTube content without permission. Q2: How many copyright infringement cases have been filed against AI companies according to the Copyright Alliance? The Copyright Alliance reports that over 70 copyright infringement cases have been filed against AI companies as of October 2025, indicating a widespread legal challenge to current AI training practices. Q3: What dataset do the YouTubers claim Snap used improperly? The plaintiffs specifically reference the HD-VILA-100M dataset, a large-scale video-language collection containing millions of YouTube videos that was designed for academic research purposes only, not commercial AI development. Q4: Which other companies have been sued by these same YouTubers? The plaintiffs previously filed similar lawsuits against Nvidia, Meta, and ByteDance, suggesting a coordinated legal strategy targeting multiple technology companies engaged in AI development. Q5: What are the plaintiffs seeking in their lawsuit against Snap? The YouTubers are seeking both statutory damages for alleged copyright infringement and a permanent injunction that would prevent Snap from continuing to use their content for AI training purposes going forward.

Risk appetite has grown increasingly selective, pushing DOGE to the sidelines as speculative capital rotates toward meme coins more detached from macro narratives. Still, derivatives market activity could point to e a liquidity flush rather than a structural breakdown. Open interest has reset to its October baseline near $1.4 billion, signalling that excess leverage has largely been cleared from the market. DOGE Open Interest ($). Source: Coinglass . Following such a sharp drawdown, the stabilization of speculative demand points to underlying confidence rather than a cascade of de-risking. If price can begin forming higher lows from here, DOGE may yet re-enter the bull cycle — but failure to attract fresh momentum could see it lag as capital concentrates elsewhere. That said, fundamentals could put it back in the conversation as DOGE permeates deeper into mainstream TradFi markets with inclusion in the first S&P-linked crypto index ETF. Dogecoin Price Prediction: 550% Could Be Next Technicals emphasize current levels as key to the bull run, as the lower boundary of a year-long falling wedge pattern comes under pressure. DOGE USD 1-day chart – double bottom fuels falling wedge. Source: TradingView . Momentum indicators paint the setup as a potential launchpad. The RSI nears oversold levels around 30, suggesting that any further downside may be limited as sellers near exhaustion. The MACD has also levelled off and started rising towards a golden cross above the signal line, suggesting a deep and brief correction over a complete trend flip. This all lines up with what appears to be an early double bottom reversal. With a second bottom forming along the $0.115 support, a sharp rebound above the reversal structure’s neckline at $0.15 could put the key $0.28 wedge breakout threshold under test. If $0.28 flips to support, a confirmed wedge breakout eyes a 550% push past the previous $0.50 all-time high, into new price discovery targeting $0.80 . Still, a breakdown scenario could see a return to lows around $0.09. Maxi Doge: Market Behavior Favours This High-Beta Play As capital rotation becomes selective, speculative demand is concentrating on high-beta plays. While coins like $PENGUIN and $WHITEWHALE lead, momentum almost always circles back to one thing: Doge. History makes the pattern clear: Dogecoin started the trend, Shiba Inu ran with it in 2021, followed by Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, and Neiro. Every bull cycle eventually crowns a new Doge-inspired frontrunner. This time around, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is tapping into those early Dogecoin vibes with a community built around sharing early alpha, trading ideas, and competitive engagement. Participation is at its core. Weekly Maxi Ripped and Maxi Pump competitions reward top performers with leaderboard recognition, incentives, and bragging rights. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.5 million, while early backers are earning up to 69% APY through staking rewards. For those who missed the Doge wave before, Maxi Doge could be the next chance to catch a meme coin before it enters the mainstream.

According to a recent commentary on X, X Finance Bull noted that XRP, HBAR, and Litecoin are a few cryptocurrencies that can outpace Bitcoin. The crypto commentator pushed back against claims that XRP and Hedera have lost relevance, arguing instead that both are increasingly positioned as foundational blockchain infrastructure. These are based on recent events that have seen both the XRP Ledger and Hedera leading crypto enterprise infrastructure. XRP, HBAR, And Litecoin Are Coins To Watch In 2026 According to the commentary shared by X Finance Bull, XRP, Hedera, and Litecoin are a few of the top cryptocurrency ecosystems to watch in 2026. Notably, the crypto commentator grouped XRP and Hedera (HBAR) in the same group to watch due to their growing presence in financial infrastructure. This means these two cryptocurrencies are increasingly leaving the realm of pure speculative assets and are now being considered as important players in financial rails. Based on this, investors can expect upside divergence from Bitcoin in 2026 as these coins start to go on bullish momentum on their own. This view is based on the investor outlook shown in the image below, which identifies financial infrastructure as an important area of focus for 2026. XRP and HBAR anchor the infrastructure structure, while Litecoin is in the privacy-assets category. Litecoin’s optional privacy features place it alongside established privacy-focused networks like Monero and Canton. As it stands, you can easily argue that privacy assets are currently underappreciated, especially now that regulatory clarity and digital payments growth are bringing attention to data protection. Based on this context, Litecoin is another top coin to look forward to upside divergence from Bitcoin in 2026. Interestingly, tokenization platforms and stablecoins are other important themes for 2026. Ethereum and Solana are the primary networks for tokenized assets, while newer platforms such as Sui, Sei, and Injective are beginning to see higher adoption. At the same time, stablecoin supply has grown to over $300 billion, with USDT, USDC, USDE, and RLUSD expanding due to maturing payments infrastructure around stablecoins. XRP Ledger’s Institutional Appeal X Finance Bull supported his XRP outlook in a separate post by pointing to the XRP Ledger’s cost structure. The Ledger charges just 0.00001 XRP per transaction, and this places total daily fees across the entire network at around 650 XRP. Furthermore, the Ledger has maintained low and predictable fees since 2012, even during periods of heavy activity, which is in contrast to Ethereum’s variable gas fees and Bitcoin’s congestion pricing. All transaction fees generated by the Ledger are permanently burned, and this adds a deflationary element to the network. According to the crypto commentator, this combination of speed, low cost, and reliability is what makes its infrastructure the best for long-term institutional use.",XRP|Ethereum|HBAR|Hedera|Injective|litecoin|monero|ripple|RLUSD|SEI|solana|Stablecoins|SUI|USDC|USDe|USDT|X Finance Bull|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,LTC|WALLET|XRP|HBAR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-26 22:00:27

SHIB’s current price also makes for 9% fall in the past fortnight, and while the meme token is actually up by 7% in the last 30 days, it has suffered a 61% depreciation in the past year. These are disappointing percentages, yet data from CryptoQuant indicates that exchanges have witnessed outflows of SHIB in the past couple of days, after a period of selling pressure. In other words, whales may be stocking up on the meme token, something which points to a bullish medium- and long-term Shiba Inu price prediction . Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Price Crashes, But 26 Billion Tokens Just Turned Bullish – Do Whales Know Something Big? If we look at SHIB’s exchange flow data, there was actually an outflow of 58.6 billion SHIB (c. $450,000) yesterday, as well as an outflow of 16.8 billion SHIB the day before. Last week also saw four consecutive days of outflows, as whales seemingly took advantage of low prices to stock up on the meme coin. Source: CryptoQuant This is arguably very bullish for the Shiba Inu price, although traders should bear in mind that the token’s 24-hour volume is still pretty low, at $105 million today. However, this potentially sets the stage for one big buy to send the Shiba Inu price flying upwards. Its chart today suggests that it may need to fall a little further before experiencing a pronounced rally, with its RSI (yellow) on its way towards 30. Its MACD (orange, blue) has just turned negative after several weeks of positivity, so we may see a rebound once this decline bottoms out. Source: TradingView After bottoming, we could see the Shiba Inu price reach $0.000010 by Q2, before hitting $0.0000250 by H2. From there, the ongoing growth of the Shiba Inu ecosystem could see it burst out of medium-term ranges and push back towards its ATH of $0.00008616.

The Asian session opened with sharp losses, though a swift rebound at this critical threshold shows buyers are still defending key levels. Trading volumes have gone up by an eye-popping 278%, currently sitting at $6.3 billion and accounting for 9% of the token’s market cap. This confirms the technical relevance of this specific price zone. From Monday to Thursday last week, SOL ETFs brought in $10 million in assets, pushing the total to $1.1 billion. As Wall Street’s interest in Solana continues to be strong, this bounce off the $120 level could catalyze the token’s next leg up. However, it could also result in a sharp correction if this support area is lost. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Temporarily Finds Support at $120 But Bears are Still in Control The daily chart shows that SOL experienced significant selling pressure once again upon hitting the $145 resistance. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that negative momentum has accelerated as it fell below the 14-day moving average. If SOL’s $120 support falters, the lower bound of the descending price channel would be the next demand zone to watch. Meanwhile, the token’s downside risk would increase if that line fails to hold, increasing the odds of a move to $97 for the first time since April last year. Even though top altcoins are struggling to recover, top crypto presales in the Solana ecosystem, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), have managed to keep investors excited. This project brings Solana’s high speeds, low costs, and smart contracts support to the Bitcoin blockchain. Since the presale kicked off, it has raised $30 million to launch the scaling solution, setting the stage for a successful launch. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Is Bringing Solana Speeds to the Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a red-hot crypto presale bringing Solana’s powerful tech to Bitcoin. This unlocks a new era of speed, scalability, and passive income potential for BTC holders. For the first time, Bitcoin users will be able to do more than just HODL.

By combining Solana’s low-cost infrastructure with Bitcoin’s massive network, Bitcoin Hyper makes it possible to launch Bitcoin-native DeFi apps, NFT platforms, and advanced payment solutions. At the center of it all is the $HYPER token. More than $30 million has already been raised, and investor interest continues to grow. Demand for the token is expected to rise as the Hyper L2 gains traction, giving early backers a major advantage.

The prominent on-chain investigator said John, also known as “Lick,” was caught showing off approximately $23 million in crypto during a heated argument with another threat actor in a chat group. “Band for Band” Gone Wrong The dispute reportedly turned into what cybercrime circles call a “band for band,” where people try to prove who has more money by showing wallet balances and moving funds in real time. ZachXBT said the recording shows John controlling multiple wallets and moving large amounts of crypto while the interaction was being captured. After reviewing the footage, the investigator said he traced the funds and linked the wallets shown in the recording to more than $90 million in suspected thefts. ZachXBT said he then traced the funds backward and reported that one of the wallets in the chain received 1,066 WETH on November 20, 2025. He further claimed the funds could be traced back to a wallet that received $24.9 million from a US government address in March 2024, which he said was connected to the Bitfinex hack seizure, a theft from the US government that he had previously reported in October 2024. He also said the wallet shown in the recording was tied to over $63 million in inflows from suspected victims and government seizure addresses in Q4 2025, listing several large incoming transfers in November and December 2025. The on-chain sleuth added that another 4.17K ETH worth about $12.4 million was received from MEXC and flowed into the same wallet. USMS Crypto Asset Contract and a Family Tie ZachXBT said that John had an extensive history of boasting about his net worth on Telegram and shared the account identifier tied to those messages. He also pointed to rumors circulating in cybercrime Telegram channels, which revealed John could be John Daghitia, who was previously arrested in September 2025, but acknowledged that more research would be needed to fully confirm the identity. Additionally, the investigator raised questions about how John may have gained access in the first place, while stating that John’s father owns CMDSS, a company with an active government IT contract in Virginia. ZachXBT said the firm was awarded a contract to assist the US Marshals Service in managing and disposing of seized and forfeited crypto assets, but added that it remains unclear how John may have obtained access through his father. After ZachXBT published the thread, he said John quickly changed details on his Telegram profile, including removing NFT-related usernames and updating his screen name. ZachXBT also reported that his own public ENS address was later “dusted” from one of the wallets linked to the suspected thefts.

The model suggests that an extended bull run, supported by clearer and more favorable regulation in the United States, could drive leading altcoins to fresh record highs over the coming years. Below are ChatGPT’s predictions for three of the most popular cryptocurrencies heading into the next year. XRP ($XRP): ChatGPT Projects XRP at $12 by 2027 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) entered 2026 on a strong footing, rising 19% during the first week of the year alone. From its current level near $1.90, ChatGPT estimates that a bull market could push XRP as high as $12 by the end of 2026, representing upside of roughly 532%, or more than sixfold returns. Source: ChatGPT XRP was among the top-performing large-cap cryptocurrencies last year. In July, it recorded its first new all-time high in seven years, reaching $3.65 after Ripple secured a landmark legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That decision significantly eased regulatory pressure surrounding XRP and reduced fears that the SEC would escalate enforcement across the broader altcoin space. Market sentiment also improved following Donald Trump’s return to the White House, which reignited optimism for a more crypto-friendly policy environment. From a technical perspective, XRP’s Relative Strength Index is hovering around 44, indicating heavier selling than buying at the time of writing. Since early January, price action has formed a bullish flag pattern. Supportive macro conditions and clearer regulation could catalyze the sustained post-flag surge needed to reach ChatGPT’s upper $12 target. Adding to the bullish case, newly approved spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. are beginning to attract capital from traditional investors, mirroring the institutional inflows that followed the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Solana (SOL): ChatGPT Targets $650 for SOL The Solana ($SOL) network currently supports over $8 billion in total value locked and holds a market capitalization above $70 billion, alongside constant developer and user growth. Interest in SOL has increased following the launch of Solana-focused ETFs by major asset managers, including Bitwise and Grayscale. After a steep pullback toward the end of 2025, SOL has been consolidating around a critical support zone and is now trading near $125. A sustained move higher may hinge on Bitcoin reclaiming the $100,000 level, a milestone that could arrive sooner rather than later. In ChatGPT’s most optimistic scenario, Solana could rally to $650 by 2027. That would represent approximately 420% upside from current prices and more than double SOL’s previous all-time high of $293, set last January. Rising institutional involvement further strengthens Solana’s long-term outlook. Growing adoption of the network for real-world asset tokenization by firms such as Franklin Templeton and BlackRock highlights Solana’s increasing relevance within traditional finance. Dogecoin (DOGE): ChatGPT Expects a 7.5x Run for DOGE but No New ATH What began in 2013 as a parody has evolved into one of crypto’s largest digital assets. Dogecoin ($DOGE) now carries a market capitalization of nearly $21 billion, representing close to half of the $44 billion meme coin sector. DOGE formed several constructive technical patterns in late summer and early autumn of 2026, though momentum weakened following a sharp, market-wide sell-off in October. Dogecoin reached an all-time high of $0.7316 during the retail-driven bull market of 2021. While the long-discussed $1 target remains a symbolic goal for the Doge Army, ChatGPT forecasts that DOGE may top out near $0.90 this year. From its current price of around $0.12, that would still equate to an almost 7.5x increase. Dogecoin has also gained traction as a medium of exchange. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise, while payment platforms such as PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transactions, reinforcing its utility beyond meme culture. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Meme Coin Built for Extreme Price Swings Outside of ChatGPT’s blue-chip forecasts, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of January’s most talked-about meme coin presales, raising more than $4.5 million ahead of its planned exchange debuts. The project presents an over-the-top, gym-bro parody of Dogecoin. Loud, irreverent, and intentionally excessive, Maxi Doge leans fully into the high-octane meme culture that originally propelled meme coins into the spotlight. After years of Dogecoin dominance, Maxi Doge is building its own Maxi Doge Army, united by meme coin degeneracy, high-risk trading behavior, and an appetite for sharp price swings. MAXI is issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, giving it a lower environmental footprint compared with Dogecoin’s proof-of-work structure. Presale participants can stake MAXI tokens for yields of up to 69% APY, though rewards decrease as additional users join the pool. The token is currently priced at $0.00028 in the latest presale phase, with automatic price increases scheduled at each new funding milestone. Purchases are supported via MetaMask and Best Wallet .

This volatility squeeze reflects a market in temporary balance, where neither buyers nor sellers have full control, but pressure continues to build under the surface. With macro catalysts and derivatives positioning near the key technical levels, the current compression suggests that BTC may be approaching a decisive expansion. Bitcoin is being held in place, but is about to break. In an X post, an analyst known as NoLimit revealed data showing why BTC feels stuck between $85,000 and $95,000. While everything else is moving up, the magnetic pull that is holding BTC back will expire in 4 days. BTC is currently trapped inside a massive options web, and the chart shows the concentration around January 30 is nearly double that of any other date. Why Low Volatility Often Precedes Big Moves Currently, the market makers are sitting in a Long Gamma position in this range, which will completely change how the price behaves. When BTC price rises, dealers are forced to sell to stay hedged, and when it dips, they’re forced to buy to stay hedged. This setup reveals why every pump is immediately rejected and why every dump is bought up instantly, not weak buyers, but forced dealer activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Mirroring Key Patterns From 2021 – Is History About To Repeat? The data has also shown a massive gamma unwind on January 30. As BTC approaches that expiration, the magnetic force holding the price in this range will start to fade. Once those options expire, the hedges and the mechanical selling pressure that have been suppressing BTC rallies would disappear. Thus, the market would move from a pinned to a released market. When that much gamma leaves the system at once, the move is usually fast and aggressive. NoLimit noted that he will share an update in 4 days of the expiration of the magnetic pull holding BTC back. The analyst emphasized that he has been an analyst for over 10 years, and called every major market top and bottom publicly, including the $126,000 BTC all-time high. When the next move is set up, he ensures to post it publicly for everyone to see. How Bitcoin Price Holds Structure Despite Sell Pressure Bitcoin is bullish on Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) divergences, and the price is starting to build up, which could be an early sign of absorption by a larger entity. A full-time trader known as CEDOZXBT has pointed out that the market structure in CVD and price action is the key setup. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Supercycle Truly On The Horizon? Analyst Predicts $31K Bottom In 2026 At the same time, open interest (OI) has continued to rise, showing that shorts are entering the market at the point of order. This is an early stage for full validation, but if this structure continues to build up, it could be interesting and great for a long setup.

Coinbase recently withdrew its support for the CLARITY Act, a legislative proposal intended to define regulatory oversight of digital assets in the United States. Following this reversal, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee has postponed deliberations on the bill by several weeks. That said, comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. still could happen this quarter. If lawmakers deliver, the three biggest cryptos will all be nothing new all-time highs (ATHs). XRP (XRP): Payments Blockchain Eyes $5 as Momentum Builds XRP ($XRP) , currently valued at approximately $116 billion by market capitalization, continues to stand out as one of the most widely used cryptocurrencies for global payments, prized for its fast transaction finality and minimal fees. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) was purpose-built for banks and financial institutions, positioning it as a next-generation alternative to slower, more expensive legacy systems such as SWIFT. Ripple’s expanding footprint has earned recognition from prominent organizations, including the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, strengthening XRP’s standing as a potentially game-changing payments network. After finally resolving its prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, XRP surged to a new all-time high of $3.65 in mid-2025. Since then, broader market weakness has driven a pullback of roughly 48%, with the token now trading around $1.90. Despite the retracement, XRP’s time below $2 is likely limited. One of the most notable recent catalysts has been the approval of spot XRP ETFs in the U.S., giving both institutional and retail investors regulated access to the asset. Additional ETF launches and clearer regulatory guidance could help propel XRP toward the $5 mark by the second quarter. Bitcoin ($BTC): Could the King of Crypto Reach $200,000 by 2026? Bitcoin ($BTC) , the world’s largest cryptocurrency, remains front and center after setting a new record high of $126,080 on October 6. Should U.S. regulators move forward with Project Crypto, an initiative aimed at updating securities rules for digital assets, or if the Trump administration delivers on its pledge to establish a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Bitcoin could feasibly approach $250,000 this year. Even without major policy-driven catalysts, Bitcoin has already notched several new milestones this year and may post a new high watermark at the $150,000 level before the quarter ends. Frequently described as “digital gold,” Bitcoin continues to draw interest from both retail and institutional investors who see it as a long-term store of value and an inflation hedge. At present, Bitcoin accounts for more than $1.7 trillion of the global crypto market’s roughly $3 trillion total valuation, underscoring its role as the cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum ($ETH): Smart Contract Leader Prepares for the Next Leg Higher Ethereum ($ETH) remains the backbone of decentralized finance and much of the broader Web3 landscape, supported by a market capitalization of around $349 billion. With over $69 billion locked across its applications, Ethereum continues to dominate the DeFi sector, cementing its status as the most economically active blockchain network. In a strong bullish environment, ETH could test the $5,000 resistance level by March, surpassing its previous all-time high of $4,946 set last August. A decisive breakout could then open the door to a move toward $7,500 by the end of the quarter, representing a potential 2.5x increase from its current price near $3,000. Longer term, Ethereum’s path toward five-figure valuations will depend heavily on clearer U.S. regulation and supportive macroeconomic conditions, both of which are key to unlocking deeper institutional participation. From a technical perspective, ETH confirmed a bullish flag breakout last year, rallying from around $1,800 to new highs. Another bullish flag formed toward the end of the year, suggesting the potential for a sharp upside move if broader market conditions align. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme Branding Meets Advanced Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an emerging Bitcoin Layer-2 project designed to accelerate transactions, lower fees, and introduce advanced smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin network. Leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper incorporates decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that allows seamless cross-chain Bitcoin transfers. The project’s presale has already raised more than $31 million, with some influencers speculating about potential returns ranging from 10x to 100x once the token becomes available on exchanges. A recent audit by Coinsult reported no critical vulnerabilities in the smart contract. The HYPER token serves as the backbone of the ecosystem, acting as the medium for transaction fees, governance participation, and staking incentives. Early backers can stake tokens during the presale to earn yields of up to 38% APY, although returns gradually decrease as more participants enter the pool. With exchange listings anticipated later this year, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale offers early access to what could be the next evolutionary step for Bitcoin.

57488763,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265523,1769467212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Trump tariffs South Korea: Shocking 25% levy threatens global trade stability,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-tariffs-south-korea-25-percent/,"BitcoinWorld Trump tariffs South Korea: Shocking 25% levy threatens global trade stability WASHINGTON, D.C., March 2025 – In a dramatic trade policy announcement, former President Donald Trump declared his intention to impose 25% tariffs on South Korean goods, citing significant delays in bilateral trade negotiations. This potential escalation immediately sent shockwaves through global markets and diplomatic circles, threatening to unravel years of carefully constructed economic cooperation between the two allies. The proposed tariffs represent a substantial increase from current levels and could fundamentally reshape the $170 billion trade relationship between the United States and South Korea. Trump tariffs South Korea: The announcement and immediate context Former President Trump made his declaration during a campaign rally in Ohio, specifically pointing to what he characterized as “unacceptable delays” in trade negotiations between Washington and Seoul. Consequently, this announcement comes amid ongoing discussions about revising the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA), which has governed bilateral trade since 2012. Moreover, the timing coincides with increased geopolitical tensions in the Asia-Pacific region and shifting global supply chain dynamics. The proposed 25% tariff would apply broadly to South Korean imports, potentially affecting key sectors including: Automobiles: Hyundai and Kia vehicles, which represent South Korea’s largest export category to the US Electronics: Samsung smartphones, LG appliances, and semiconductor components Steel products: Various steel alloys and manufactured metal goods Industrial machinery: Precision equipment and manufacturing tools Consumer goods: Various finished products across multiple categories Historical background of US-South Korea trade relations The United States and South Korea have maintained extensive economic ties for decades, fundamentally transforming from a donor-recipient relationship after the Korean War to a partnership of equals. Significantly, the KORUS FTA implemented in 2012 eliminated tariffs on approximately 95% of consumer and industrial goods within five years. However, the agreement faced criticism from the Trump administration during his first term, leading to renegotiations in 2018 that resulted in modest revisions. Trade data reveals the relationship’s importance. According to the United States International Trade Commission, two-way goods and services trade totaled $170.1 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, South Korea represents the United States’ sixth-largest goods trading partner. The following table illustrates recent trade patterns: Year US Exports to South Korea US Imports from South Korea Trade Balance 2021 $69.2 billion $95.9 billion -$26.7 billion 2022 $80.8 billion $103.8 billion -$23.0 billion 2023 $82.4 billion $101.2 billion -$18.8 billion Expert analysis of the tariff announcement Trade economists immediately expressed concern about the potential consequences. Dr. Eleanor Vance, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted, “A 25% tariff on South Korean goods would represent one of the most significant unilateral trade actions against a major ally in recent history. Such measures typically trigger retaliation, disrupt supply chains, and increase costs for American consumers and businesses.” Furthermore, the announcement raises questions about its consistency with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The United States and South Korea both remain WTO members, bound by most-favored-nation principles that generally prohibit such discriminatory tariffs without specific justification. However, the Trump administration previously utilized national security provisions under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to justify tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Potential economic impacts and market reactions Financial markets reacted swiftly to the announcement. The Korean won depreciated approximately 1.5% against the US dollar in immediate trading. Simultaneously, shares of major South Korean exporters declined, with Hyundai Motor falling 3.2% and Samsung Electronics dropping 2.7%. American companies with significant supply chain exposure to South Korea also experienced stock price pressure. The potential economic consequences extend across multiple dimensions: Consumer prices: American consumers would likely face higher prices for electronics, automobiles, and various household goods Supply chain disruption: Many US manufacturers rely on South Korean components, particularly in automotive and technology sectors Retaliation risk: South Korea could impose counter-tariffs on American agricultural exports, aircraft, machinery, and energy products Investment uncertainty: Both countries might reconsider planned investments in each other’s economies Third-country effects: Other trading partners might adjust their strategies in response to the changed US trade policy posture Geopolitical implications beyond economics The tariff announcement carries significant geopolitical weight beyond mere economic calculations. South Korea remains a crucial United States ally in Northeast Asia, hosting approximately 28,500 American troops. Additionally, the two countries coordinate closely on North Korea policy, regional security, and technology standards. Some analysts worry that trade tensions could spill over into security cooperation, potentially weakening the United States’ strategic position in the region. Simultaneously, China closely monitors US trade actions against regional partners. Beijing might seek to exploit any rift between Washington and Seoul, potentially offering alternative trade arrangements or security assurances. Nevertheless, South Korea has worked to balance relations with both major powers, pursuing what some analysts term “strategic ambiguity” in its foreign policy approach. Legal and procedural considerations Implementing the proposed tariffs would require specific administrative actions. The President possesses authority to adjust tariffs under several statutes, including Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (addressing unfair trade practices) and Section 232 (national security). However, these authorities typically involve investigation periods and procedural requirements. Legal challenges would almost certainly follow any tariff implementation, potentially delaying or modifying the final policy. Congress also maintains constitutional authority over international trade. While legislators have delegated significant tariff-setting power to the executive branch, they retain oversight mechanisms and could potentially pass legislation limiting tariff actions. The political dynamics of such congressional intervention remain uncertain, particularly in an election year. Comparative analysis with previous tariff actions The proposed South Korea tariffs follow a pattern established during Trump’s first administration. Between 2018 and 2020, the United States imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods, along with levies on steel, aluminum, and some European products. Research from the Federal Reserve and academic institutions suggests those earlier tariffs: Increased costs for American consumers and businesses > Reduced employment in trade-exposed sectors Triggered retaliatory measures affecting US exports Created uncertainty that dampened business investment However, proponents argue that tariffs strengthened domestic manufacturing in some sectors and improved US negotiating leverage. The South Korea case differs significantly because it involves a treaty ally rather than a strategic competitor. This distinction might influence both the economic impact and political reception of the proposed measures. Industry-specific consequences and adaptation strategies Different economic sectors would experience varied effects from the tariffs. The automotive industry faces particular exposure, given South Korea’s role as a major vehicle exporter to the United States. Hyundai and Kia together sold over 1.4 million vehicles in the American market in 2023. A 25% tariff could increase prices substantially, potentially reducing sales and market share. Technology companies also confront significant challenges. South Korea supplies critical components for electronics manufacturing, including memory chips, displays, and batteries. Disruptions or cost increases in these supply chains could affect American technology firms’ production and profitability. Some companies might accelerate plans to diversify sourcing away from South Korea, though establishing alternative suppliers requires time and investment. Conclusion The announcement of potential 25% Trump tariffs on South Korea represents a major development in international trade policy with far-reaching implications. This proposal threatens to disrupt a $170 billion economic relationship between two longstanding allies, potentially increasing costs for American consumers and businesses while straining diplomatic ties. The coming weeks will reveal whether this announcement represents a negotiating tactic or a firm policy direction. Regardless, businesses, policymakers, and consumers must prepare for possible significant changes in US-South Korea economic relations. The Trump tariffs South Korea proposal underscores the continuing volatility in global trade arrangements and the importance of resilient international partnerships. FAQs Q1: What specific goods would the 25% tariffs affect? The tariffs would apply broadly to imports from South Korea, including automobiles, electronics, steel products, industrial machinery, and various consumer goods. The exact product list would be determined through administrative procedures if implemented. Q2: How would these tariffs differ from previous US tariffs on South Korean goods? Previous tariffs under the Trump administration focused primarily on steel and aluminum, with rates typically around 25% on those specific products. The new proposal appears broader, potentially affecting most or all South Korean imports at the 25% rate. Q3: Can South Korea retaliate against these tariffs? Yes, South Korea could impose retaliatory tariffs on US exports. Under the KORUS FTA and WTO rules, countries typically have the right to take equivalent countermeasures against unjustified trade restrictions. Q4: How quickly could these tariffs be implemented? The implementation timeline depends on the legal authority invoked. Using Section 232 (national security) or Section 301 (unfair trade practices) typically involves investigation periods of several months, though expedited procedures are possible. Q5: What would be the impact on American consumers? American consumers would likely face higher prices for products containing South Korean components or finished goods, particularly in electronics and automotive sectors. The exact impact would depend on how much of the tariff cost businesses pass through to consumers. Q6: How might this affect the broader US trade strategy in Asia? The tariffs could complicate US trade relationships throughout Asia, potentially causing other partners to question American reliability. Some countries might accelerate efforts to diversify their trade relationships or strengthen regional agreements that exclude the United States.

Analysts Weigh In,https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoins-surpass-284b-banks-risk/,"The global stablecoin market has crossed $284 billion in circulation, reviving a long debate about whether the growth of stablecoin poses a real threat to traditional banks or simply reflects a new layer of financial infrastructure evolving alongside them. That question took center stage this week after historians and economists Niall Ferguson and Manny Rincon-Cruz argued that fears of bank destabilization are overstated, even as banking groups intensify their opposition to stablecoin rewards. ""No one is surprised when banks and other financial incumbents argue against measures that might promote innovation. But the argument that stablecoins are a source of instability — and interest-bearing ones especially so — is a bad one. The opposite is quite likely to be true."" — Niall Ferguson (@nfergus) January 26, 2026 In an opinion piece published by Bloomberg, Ferguson and Rincon-Cruz framed stablecoins as fundamentally different from volatile crypto assets such as Bitcoin. While speculative tokens behave more like financial derivatives, they argued, fiat-backed stablecoins function as payment instruments whose growth has accelerated following the passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act last summer .

Since the law took effect, the stablecoin sector has expanded quickly. Banks Sound Alarm as Stablecoins Expand Beyond Payments Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee data cited in the opinion piece showed that fiat-backed stablecoins have surpassed $284 billion, dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, which together account for more than 90% of the supply. The payments, trading liquidity, and demand for cross-border settlements are projected to reach between $2 trillion and $3 trillion in the market by 2028, as cited by Treasury officials. Banks, however, have pushed back, as industry groups have warned that stablecoins, particularly when paired with rewards offered by exchanges or platforms, could draw deposits away from the banking system. The American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute have argued that large-scale migration of deposits would raise banks’ funding costs and reduce credit availability/ US community bankers are urging Congress to close what they see as a loophole allowing stablecoin rewards. #Crypto #banks https://t.co/2uuk96PfXH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 7, 2026 JPMorgan executives have referred to interest-bearing digital dollars as the establishment of a parallel banking system that lacks the same levels of protection. The push by banking lobbyists to change the proposed CLARITY Act, an expanded crypto market structure bill, provoked resistance by crypto companies and led to delays in Senate hearings. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal publicly rejected claims that stablecoin rewards threaten financial stability, saying there is no evidence of systemic risk and that competition should not be conflated with instability. No question @nfergus is right. There is zero evidence–zero–that stablecoin interest, yield or rewards destabilizes the banking system. There is tons of evidence that they provide real competition to banks. Those are two very different things. https://t.co/XPrwVu5TCX — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) January 26, 2026 History Tells a Different Story on Stablecoins and Banks Ferguson and Rincon-Cruz countered the banks’ narrative by turning to history. They said that stablecoins were more like bank notes than deposits, and that historically, notes and deposits increased together, as opposed to crowding out. They referred to some statistics indicating that since the introduction of the USDC in 2018, American bank deposits have grown by over $6 trillion, while stablecoins increased by roughly $280 billion, and both have been increasing in the same direction. They observed that stablecoin rewards are not new and have not caused deposit flight even in times when banks were paying close to no interest. The same sentiments were recently reiterated by the Circle CEO, Jeremy Allaire, in Davos at the World Economic Forum.

According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, this dramatic reduction in transaction costs, commonly called gas fees, marks a pivotal moment for Ethereum’s usability and economic accessibility. The data, recorded globally in early 2025, reflects the culmination of years of technical upgrades and shifting market dynamics. Consequently, users and developers now experience a fundamentally more affordable blockchain environment. This trend represents a significant departure from the exorbitant fee regimes that previously challenged the network’s scalability. Ethereum Network Fees Reach Historic Low Glassnode’s latest weekly report confirms the sustained decline in Ethereum’s average transaction fee. The metric recently dropped below 10 Gwei, a unit measuring the computational effort required for transactions. For context, this fee level was last commonplace over seven years ago, during Ethereum’s early developmental phase. At that time, the network facilitated a fraction of today’s decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) activity. Therefore, achieving similar costs now, amidst vastly higher demand, underscores profound technical progress. Network congestion, the primary driver of high fees, has visibly eased. This change allows for cheaper interactions with smart contracts, token swaps, and simple ETH transfers. Several interconnected factors explain this downward pressure on Ethereum network fees . First, the successful implementation of the Dencun upgrade in March 2024 introduced proto-danksharding via EIP-4844. This innovation drastically reduced data storage costs for Layer 2 rollups. As a result, these secondary scaling solutions, like Arbitrum and Optimism, became exponentially cheaper to use. Subsequently, a massive volume of transaction activity migrated off the main Ethereum chain, or Layer 1. This migration alleviated the core network’s congestion. Furthermore, a broader market trend toward consolidation and reduced speculative trading has decreased overall blockchain activity. The combined effect is a more stable and cost-effective base layer. Analyzing the Impact on Users and Developers The immediate impact of lower ETH gas fees is overwhelmingly positive for the ecosystem. Everyday users can now interact with decentralized applications (dApps) without fearing hundred-dollar transaction failures. Small-value transactions, once economically unviable, are now feasible. This accessibility is crucial for fostering mainstream adoption and innovative micro-transaction models. For developers, predictable and low costs reduce the operational overhead of deploying and maintaining smart contracts. Consequently, teams can prototype and iterate more freely, potentially unleashing a new wave of blockchain-based products. The improved user experience directly addresses a long-standing criticism of the Ethereum network. Expert Perspectives on the Fee Decline Industry analysts point to the data as validation of Ethereum’s layered scaling roadmap. “The Glassnode data isn’t an anomaly; it’s the expected outcome of a multi-year architectural shift,” notes a blockchain data researcher from a major analytics firm. “We are witnessing the ‘rollup-centric’ roadmap in action. The base chain is becoming a secure settlement layer, while execution moves to Layer 2.” This perspective aligns with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s long-term vision. Meanwhile, economic observers highlight the deflationary pressure on ETH. With fees lower, less ETH is burned via the EIP-1559 mechanism. However, this is partially offset by reduced selling pressure from validators who no longer earn high fee rewards. The net economic effect remains a complex, evolving equation. The following table contrasts key network metrics between May 2017 and early 2025: Metric May 2017 Early 2025 Average Gas Price ~10-20 Gwei Daily Transactions (L1) ~200k ~1.1 million Total Value Locked (DeFi) Negligible ~$50 Billion Dominant Use Case ICOs, Transfers DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 Settlements The Road Ahead for Blockchain Scalability While current cryptocurrency transaction costs on Ethereum are favorable, the community continues to push forward. The next major milestone, the Verkle trees upgrade (Prague/Electra), aims to further optimize data storage and enable stateless clients. This upgrade will support even greater scalability and node decentralization. Additionally, ongoing improvements to Layer 2 technologies, such as zero-knowledge proof rollups, promise faster finality and lower costs. The ecosystem’s health now depends on sustaining this low-fee environment through both bull and bear market cycles. Network analysts will closely monitor fee spikes during periods of high demand to stress-test the new scaling infrastructure. The long-term goal remains a robust, scalable, and decentralized global computer. Conclusion The plunge in Ethereum network fees to May 2017 levels is a landmark achievement for blockchain scalability . Driven by successful Layer 2 migration and core protocol upgrades, this trend demonstrates the tangible results of Ethereum’s iterative development process. Lower fees enhance usability for millions and empower developers to build more sophisticated applications. As the network evolves through further upgrades, maintaining this accessible cost structure will be paramount for realizing its full potential. The data from Glassnode not only records a historical moment but also signals a new, more efficient chapter for the entire Web3 ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that Ethereum fees are at a May 2017 low? It means the average cost to send a transaction or interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet is as low as it was over seven years ago. This is significant because the network now handles orders of magnitude more activity and value. Q2: What caused Ethereum gas fees to drop so dramatically? The primary cause is the Dencun upgrade (EIP-4844), which made Layer 2 rollups much cheaper to operate. This shifted transaction volume away from the congested mainnet. Reduced overall market activity also contributed to lower demand for block space. Q3: Are low Ethereum fees good for the price of ETH? The relationship is complex. Low fees improve network utility and adoption, a long-term positive. However, they also reduce the amount of ETH burned (destroyed) via EIP-1559, which can affect its deflationary supply mechanics. Q4: Will Ethereum fees stay low forever? Not necessarily. Fees are a function of supply (block space) and demand (network usage). While scalability improvements increase supply, a massive surge in demand—like a new popular NFT mint or DeFi boom—could cause temporary spikes. The baseline, however, is now much lower. Q5: Should I always use the Ethereum mainnet now that fees are low? For many users, especially those making frequent or small transactions, Layer 2 rollups (like Arbitrum, Base, or Optimism) are still recommended. They offer even lower fees and faster speeds while deriving security from Ethereum.

The question is how much longer this pain will last before we finally see XRP, Shiba Inu, and PEPE rise again. It all depends on Bitcoin. With some geopolitical stability, we could see more moves toward risk-on assets. XRP, Shiba Inu, and PEPE, technically, are still in a weak phase. Below is how things could play out for the three as we head into 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time XRP Price Prediction: Holding Long-Term Support as Bulls Fight to Regain Control Ripple (XRP) is currently not in the best position price-wise, yes. However, it is holding its 18-month support and could reverse at any time. The relative strength index (RSI) is leaning bearish right now, which is worrying for bulls if they do not regain momentum. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.91 and just bounced off the $1.81 dip. If it continues this bounce, $2.00 and $2.25 are the first psychological resistance levels. Breaking above those levels would confirm a bullish shift. This scenario and the target of $3.00 remain valid for XRP as long as it holds above the $1.80 support. A break below it would invalidate the setup and ruin the structure. PEPE Price Prediction: Fool Me Once, Shame On You At the beginning of the year, PEPE price fooled everyone into believing memecoins were back after 5 days of constant pumping and a rally of over 60%. This ended shortly after topping near $0.000007, and the price has been trending down since. It is still up around 20% on the monthly chart, but expectations were much higher. If we talk purely technically, PEPE respected the upper boundary of the descending channel. A bullish outlook would be anticipated if a breakout above the $0.000006 resistance occurs. If the dump continues, the horizontal support at $0.000004 is important to hold. There have been repeated reactions at this same price level. If a candle closes near its low, things could turn ugly, as there is very little historical support below. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Does It Even Try To Pump Anymore, Worst Performer? Shiba Inu is the worst performer among the top memecoins. The burn mechanism is in constant decline, and the narrative being “dog-themed-memecoin” is considered old now. The Shiba Inu chart is basically a clean descending channel that has been respected for a long time, with lower highs and lower lows grinding price down in a very orderly way. Right now, the price is sitting right on the lower boundary of the channel, which is an important area. Historically, this is where short-term relief bounces can start if buyers step in. RSI is sitting around the mid-40s, which backs that up. It is not oversold, but it does show bearish momentum cooling rather than speeding up. Until SHIB breaks and holds above the channel resistance, this remains a bearish structure with bounce potential, not a confirmed reversal. In short, the trend is still weak, the price is sitting at support, and this is an interesting spot, but confirmation is everything. Bitcoin Hyper Price Prediction: Anticipation Building Quietly While the Market Hurts While XRP, SHIB, and PEPE are all stuck grinding lower and waiting on Bitcoin to finally flip sentiment back to risk-on, some traders are already looking past the pain and positioning early. That is where Bitcoin Hyper starts to stand out. Bitcoin Hyper is being built for exactly this kind of market environment. When majors are weak, momentum is dead, and confidence is low, capital tends to rotate into new narratives that are not tied to broken charts or long downtrends. That rotation almost always starts quietly, before Bitcoin and altcoins wake up. The project has already raised 31M , showing conviction even while the broader market struggles. On top of that, Bitcoin Hyper offers 38% staking rewards, giving holders a reason to stay positioned instead of chasing short-term pumps elsewhere. Historically, the biggest upside opportunities show up when the market feels the worst. If Bitcoin stabilizes and risk appetite returns heading into 2026, projects that were accumulated during these painful phases tend to move first. For traders tired of watching XRP, SHIB, and PEPE bleed while waiting on Bitcoin to save the market, Bitcoin Hyper is shaping up as a high-risk, high-reward alternative worth keeping on the radar.

Experts Favor This $0.04 Altcoin Over XRP,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-with-400-in-q2-2026-experts-favor-this-0-04-altcoin-over-xrp/,"Small retail traders as they join the market with small budgets tend to pose the same question every cycle. What assets can continue to be forced and provide meaningful upside with the use of small capital. With the shift of the focus to Q2 2026 positioning, a single comparison has become popular. Would a small investor put $400 in a big-cap such as Ripple or on a new cheap crypto that is below $1. The analysts that watch this match-up are inclined towards the latter. Ripple (XRP) Ripple is at present trading at close to $1.90 having a market capital of approximately one hundred and seventeen billion dollars. One of the most widespread altcoins in the market and one that has already passed through multiple adoption waves is XRP. It has rallied in the previous cycles, at the time of a relaxation of regulatory pressure and the development of cross-border payment narratives. The moves had the effect of rewarding the early movers but also propelled the asset into an even deeper liquidity profile requiring large inflows of any new breakout. According to the technical analysts, XRP has found it hard to break the two dollar band resistance. During recent pushes volume has been less than expected which indicates how challenging it is to restore high momentum with mature assets. Projections are not promising in 2026 and 2027. Other analysts forecast XRP crawling to the $2.30 mark that would be a modest increment compared to the present value of XRP. Investors who look to greater returns with lesser investments are not attracted to this profile. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The altcoin that is being discussed in these circles is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It is a new crypto project that constructs a decentralized lending platform in which users are able to borrow without the necessity of selling on collateral. The design will involve yield tracking using the form of mtTokens and the use of collateral rules with liquidation protection to lenders. The protocol has affirmed its V1 protocol release will start testing on Sepolia in Q1 2026 per the official account of Mutuum Finance X. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised about $19.9M and over 18,800 investors. The token started at $0.01 early in 2025 and currently costs $0.04 in presale Phase 7. This is a 3x rise to the first phase when a proposed launch price has been six cents. The Reason Why MUTM is Viewed as The Early XRP There is an essential similarity that analysts with experience of previous cycles in XRP note. XRP was a draw not due to hype but rather it presented an infrastructure narrative that was yet to be priced. The investors shifted in prior to the utility being established. The allocation of $400 in XRP at $1.90 will be unlikely to put a Ripple in the needle according to the current projections. That allocation, in a regard, is going to yield a mere single percentage gain after a long period, which would be as indicated by the mild outlook of two dollars and thirty cents. Comparatively, a $400 crypto investment into MUTM at $0.04 is aimed at a younger profile where liquidity is still being established and where price discovery is more price elastic. Analysts who modeled the 2026 demand assume that the utility-based demand would also be able to reprice MUTM to the $20-$28range that would mean that the upside is multiplied by several times over the same time. Presale Acceleration Phase Seven of MUTM presale has been selling faster than the previous rounds. It also has a twenty-four hour leaderboard to reward the top daily contributor with five hundred dollars worth of MUTM. This process has maintained allocation competition and has promoted time-based participation. The onboarding funnel has been broadened through card payment access by users who are not holding crypto. These indicators are important in that initial distribution will influence long-term liquidity performance. Another point of comparison has been security. Mutuum Finance passed an independent audit conducted by Halborn Security alongside with a score of 90/100 on CertiK token scan. V1 is also being preceded by a fifty thousand dollar bug bounty. The lending systems are based on trusted code in the provision of collateral regulations, liquidation conditions and the accounting of debts. Investors would still wait to be assured of their security before committing more money. As Q2 2026 positioning is going on, the difference between Ripple and Mutuum Finance is evident. XRP is a developed resource that can hardly be expanded with little capital, and MUTM is in a low pricing stage with potential that still has not been realized. Such a mix is what makes the case of the $400 allocation scenario to which experts consider the cheaper asset to increase the upside, instead of the already known one.

57490299,659042,1769468442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57490299.jpeg,"The Myth Of USD Weakness Boosting Bitcoin: Inflation, Liquidity, Or Fear Changes The Outcome",https://bitcoinist.com/the-myth-of-usd-weakness-boosting-bitcoin-inflation/,"Bitcoin has slipped below the $87,000 level, extending its pullback as selling pressure and macro uncertainty keep traders on the defensive. After multiple failed attempts to regain key resistance zones, BTC is now trading in a fragile range where momentum remains weak, and liquidity conditions can amplify short-term moves. With risk appetite fading, the market is once again questioning whether this decline is a temporary shakeout or the start of a deeper corrective phase. At the same time, the US dollar has been weakening, reigniting a familiar debate across financial markets: Does a softer dollar automatically lift Bitcoin? The answer is not that simple. A falling dollar can support BTC, but only under the right macro conditions. The driver is not the dollar itself, but why it is falling, and how investors interpret that shift in terms of risk. In inflation-driven environments, dollar weakness can push capital toward hard assets, allowing Bitcoin to behave more like a “digital gold” narrative. In liquidity-driven cycles, rate cuts and easier financial conditions can also push investors into higher-beta assets like crypto. But when the dollar declines due to stress, intervention fears, or escalating uncertainty, capital often rotates into traditional safe havens instead—leaving Bitcoin to trade like a risk asset alongside equities. A Weak Dollar Isn’t Automatically Bullish For Bitcoin A CryptoQuant report argues that the relationship between a falling US dollar and Bitcoin is indirect and conditional, not mechanical. In other words, a weaker dollar can support BTC, but only under specific macro regimes. The key variable is not the dollar move itself, but the underlying driver behind that devaluation and the broader risk environment investors are reacting to. CryptoQuant outlines three scenarios. First, if dollar weakness reflects persistent inflation and a growing search for protection, Bitcoin can benefit as investors treat it like a form of “digital gold.” Second, if the decline is driven by rate cuts and excess liquidity, risk assets typically outperform, and cheaper capital can rotate into crypto as investors seek upside in higher-beta markets. In both cases, the dollar weakness aligns with conditions that can lift Bitcoin. The third scenario, however, is the most important for the current market. If the dollar is weakening due to a confidence shock and extreme risk aversion—such as the present episode tied to rumors of yen intervention—crypto tends to fall alongside equities. In that environment, the weak dollar is only a backdrop, not a bullish engine. The conclusion is clear: the market is rotating from the dollar into gold, while Bitcoin ETFs see heavy outflows, showing that in panic, investors still choose the traditional refuge. For Bitcoin to thrive, dollar weakness must come from risk appetite, not fear. Bitcoin Rebounds Keep Failing Below Key Moving Averages Bitcoin is trading around $87,900 after a volatile decline that dragged price below the $90,000 psychological level and kept bulls under pressure. The chart shows BTC is still trapped in a corrective structure that began after the late-2025 peak, with the downtrend accelerating into November before transitioning into a choppy consolidation phase. Even though price has stabilized above the mid-$80K area, rebound attempts continue to lose strength, suggesting demand remains cautious. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin is now trading below its major moving averages, reinforcing bearish momentum across multiple timeframes. The 50-period moving average (blue) has turned sharply downward and sits well above the price, acting as dynamic resistance and capping short-term rallies. The 100-period moving average (green) is also sloping lower, confirming that the broader recovery structure has weakened since BTC failed to sustain moves above $95K. Meanwhile, the 200-period moving average (red) remains the highest overhead level near the low-$100K range, highlighting how much upside would be required to shift the market back into a stronger macro trend. The recent bounce toward the low-$90K region was rejected quickly, and the price has slipped back into its compression zone. For bulls, reclaiming $90K and then breaking above $92K–$95K is necessary to rebuild momentum. If BTC fails to hold the $87K–$88K region, downside risk remains open toward $84K and potentially the low-$80K zone.

With regulation pushing crypto deeper into the mainstream, getting ahead of the quantum threat could give Ethereum credibility as key infrastructure to bridge Web2 and Web3. Real-world adoption at institutional scale will demand security frameworks that meet established protection standards, and Ethereum’s proactive approach could prove critical in securing that role.

A fully realised right shoulder stands to see a return to previous all-time highs around $5,000 , representing a 70% gain from current locations.

SOL gambling sites excel in this situation. Solana casinos process withdrawals quickly, within minutes or even seconds, and at minimal costs, in contrast to traditional casinos and other online casinos that use slower blockchains. Why Solana enables near-instant payouts Bitcoin transactions routinely take between 10 to 60 minutes to reach confirmation, while traditional payment methods can take days. Solana, on the other hand, is one of the fastest and most cost-efficient blockchains. The network processes and confirms transactions in less than a second, and for only a few cents as fees. Because of these, it’s a perfect platform for cryptocurrency casinos for players who want to receive their money fast. What “instant” really means (processing vs confirmation) Solana casinos’ instant withdrawals do not always mean how fast Solana can confirm a transaction. When online casinos talk about instant withdrawals, it usually involves two separate factors: Casino processing time: This is how long the casino takes to verify your withdrawal request and prepare the transaction. It could take anything from a few seconds to minutes, depending on the casino’s policies. On-chain confirmation: Once the casino processes your transaction and sends it to the Solana network, confirmation typically occurs within a second. Some Solana casinos’ instant withdrawals are faster than others. A truly instant withdrawal means both processes happen quickly. Common causes of withdrawal delays Some Solana casino payouts might get delayed due to various reasons: Manual reviews: Payouts can be delayed in situations where a withdrawal requires manual review. KYC verification requirements: Some casinos require users to completely verify their identities before withdrawals can be processed. Withdrawal limits and cooldowns: Some casinos set minimum withdrawal amounts or waiting periods between transactions. This is done for security reasons and also to prevent congestion. Liquidity issues: Casinos can run out of SOL to pay users immediately. In cases like this, withdrawals are delayed until the casino replenishes its SOL reserves. Security holds: Large withdrawals or suspicious account activity can lead to automatic security reviews. Network Congestion: While Solana operates quickly, heavy usage can sometimes slow down confirmations. Comparison of top Solana casinos Casino Avg SOL Withdrawal Time Fees Limits Shown Provably Fair Best For CryptoGames 1-5 minutes Network fees absorbed Yes Yes Speed & transparency BC.Game 2-10 minutes Minimal Yes Yes Altcoin diversity Stake 5-15 minutes Low Yes Partial High-volume players Cloudbet 10-20 minutes Standard network Yes No BTC/SOL mix Bitcasino.io 15-30 minutes Transparent Yes No Trust & reliability Top Solana casinos with instant withdrawals (Ranked) While Solana casinos have the advantage of running on a fast network, different platforms also have internal systems that make them comparatively faster in processing and confirming users’ instant SOL withdrawals. This list ranks Solana casino payouts according to metrics on actual SOL withdrawals, not bonuses or marketing claims. CryptoGames (Best overall for instant SOL withdrawals) CryptoGames is ranked the #1 among low-fee Solana casinos because it consistently delivers the fastest and most reliable instant SOL withdrawals in the industry. It also holds up well even under high-traffic events. CryptoGames took top spot on this list because: Near-instant SOL withdrawals with predictable processing: CryptoGames delivers high-speed withdrawals, with most withdrawal requests processed within 1-3 minutes. CryptoGames maintains this high level of speed even during busy periods, unlike competitors who may see some slippage in processing speed. Clear limits and real-time status updates: CryptoGames provides users with real-time updates on their withdrawal status. It also clearly displays minimum and maximum withdrawal limits, which improves user experience. Strong SOL liquidity: CryptoGames has a substantial SOL reserve, which prevents bottlenecks when processing instant SOL withdrawals, even during peak hours. Optimized Solana routing: CryptoGames connects directly to the Solana blockchain to ensure fast confirmation of transactions on the blockchain. Minimal fee friction: The crypto casino carries the burden of paying for network fees, which means you get all your withdrawal requests paid in full. No regular “manual review” bottlenecks: CryptoGames automates security checks to meet compliance requirements and still guarantee quick withdrawals. Best for: CryptoGames is ideal for players who prioritize speed, without compromising transparency and reliability. BC.Game ( Fast withdrawals with support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies) BC.Game is well-known among SOL gambling sites for supporting more than 50 cryptocurrencies, making it perfect for players who want to diversify their holdings. For SOL-specific withdrawals, BC.Game is slower than CryptoGames. However, it offers remarkable versatility along with outstanding speed. Fast SOL processing for most accounts: Verified users’ withdrawals are typically completed in two to ten minutes. However, security procedures may cause slightly longer processing times for new accounts or larger withdrawal amounts. Clear limits and fair queuing: Withdrawal requests are processed by the game in the order that they are received. Since there is no special treatment, everyone has equal access to fast withdrawals from Solana Casino. Provably fair originals: Several proprietary games with verifiable fairness algorithms are available on the platform. Best for: Altcoin users who frequently withdraw SOL. Stake ( High-volume platform with reliable SOL payouts) Stake is a high-volume casino that routinely handles massive daily transaction volume from its long line of casino services, such as frequent tournaments, live dealers, and sports betting. Despite having a huge volume of transactions, it is well known for dependable and speedy Solana casino withdrawals. Strong SOL liquidity: Due to their substantial reserves, Stake rarely faces the liquidity shortages that can delay withdrawals. Even during major sporting events or viral casino sessions, instant SOL withdrawals are always available. Fast withdrawals for verified users: Winnings from verified accounts usually arrive in five to fifteen minutes. Remember that processing speed may be impacted by regional and compliance requirements. Best for: High-volume players and sportsbook users who are looking for fast Solana casino withdrawals. Cloudbet (Consistent withdrawals, select SOL support) Cloudbet has been around since 2013, and it is primarily built for Bitcoin. While it is not the fastest for instant SOL withdrawals, Cloudbet offers dependable performance and consistent fast Solana casino withdrawals for users. Reliable payout reputation: Cloudbet’s decade-plus track record includes very few withdrawal disputes. When they commit to a payout timeline, they deliver consistently. Straightforward fee handling: Cloudbet clearly discloses when it absorbs network fees versus when users pay them, preventing surprise deductions from your Solana casino payouts. Best for: Mixed BTC/SOL players valuing consistency and reliability. Bitcasino.io ( Trusted platform with transparent processing) Bitcasino.io is a trusted platform with transparent processing. It holds a license from the Curaçao Gaming Control Board (GCB) and has served users since 2014, and has gained the trust of gamblers through transparency. While not the fastest among low-fee Solana casinos, you can expect withdrawals to be processed within 15-30 minutes. Clear withdrawal rules: Bitcasino publishes detailed policies explaining processing timeframes, limits, and fee structures. You won’t encounter surprise delays or hidden terms affecting your fast Solana casino withdrawals. Longstanding operational history: Over a decade of continuous operation demonstrates stability. The platform has weathered various crypto market conditions while maintaining service quality. Best for: Players who value trust and operational transparency over absolute speed. If you prefer an established, licensed casino that clearly communicates policies, Bitcasino provides solid performance for instant SOL withdrawals within a trusted framework. What makes a Solana withdrawal “instant”? An instant Solana withdrawal usually means that the blockchain confirms your withdrawal instantly. However, when it comes to Solana casino payouts, there are a couple of things to consider: On-chain confirmation vs casino processing time: When you request a withdrawal, the casino carries out various checks before sending your transaction to the Solana network. This constitutes the casino processing time, and it varies by casino. After the casino has processed your withdrawal and sent your winnings through the Sol network, you wait for on-chain confirmation, which usually takes less than a second. Liquidity queues and withdrawal minimums: Casinos maintain “hot wallets” with readily available SOL for withdrawals. When hot wallet balances run low, withdrawals wait until the casino transfers more SOL to the hot wallets, resulting in liquidity queues. Also, some platforms prioritize larger withdrawals or VIP accounts. Low-fee Solana casinos can set lower minimums than other blockchain-based casinos; however, minimums still exist to prevent users from spamming transactions, which congest their systems. How to verify SOL transactions on explorers: Once your withdrawal is broadcast to the Solana network, you can track it independently. Copy your wallet address or the transaction signature provided by the platform, and check by yourself on the Solana explorer. Fees & limits on SOL withdrawals Even when instant SOL withdrawals are advertised, certain conditions still apply based on Solana network benchmarks and internal standards specific to your preferred SOL gambling sites. Typical Solana network fees (very low) Solana’s network fees average around 0.000005 SOL per transaction, which is usually worth less than one cent. This low cost is one of Solana’s key benefits for frequent withdrawals. You can cash out small wins profitably, unlike on networks with high fees. These low fees come from Solana’s effective proof-of-history setup. It handles thousands of transactions per second without congestion-based fee auctions like Ethereum’s gas system. When casinos absorb fees Top SOL gambling sites usually absorb the Solana network fees for their users. This helps improve overall user experience. However, some casinos reserve this treatment for VIP or higher loyalty tier members. How limits can affect perceived speed Users trying to make instant SOL withdrawals may face delays when their withdrawal amount is less than the platform’s minimum. Typically, you’d have to wait until your balance reaches the minimum before the platform can successfully process the request. Low-fee Solana casinos typically set minimums around 0.1-1 SOL. Large withdrawals sometimes trigger manual security reviews, even on automated platforms. Some platforms also set daily withdrawal limits; hitting this limit means you have to wait for the next withdrawal window. Red flags to avoid Even though users look at Solana casinos’ instant withdrawals as a preferred feature, it does not always work out as advertised. Sometimes, it’s a random glitch from the Solana network; other times, it’s an issue with the casino itself. That’s why it is important to know the red flags to look out for when using these SOL gambling sites. “Instant” claims with hidden queues: Some casinos promise instant SOL withdrawals; however, terms and conditions reveal up to 24 hours processing time. Manual review on every withdrawal: Manually reviewing every withdrawal causes delays in transaction processing. If a casino manually examines each transaction, it could be an indicator that it is not a reliable platform. No public limits or processing times: Solana casinos’ instant withdrawal times and limits are always clearly shown. If a crypto casino does not have clear information about the withdrawal process, it may be a sign of potential issues. Blaming delays solely on the Solana network: If a Solana casino always blames the network for withdrawal delays, it probably has problems with its own internal processing. You should check the Solana network status on your own to verify your claims.",Cryptocurrency Guides|BC.GAME|Bitcasino.io|Cloudbet|CryptoGames|Solana|Stake.com,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-26 23:52:46

This substantial transaction, verified by on-chain analytics from ai_9684xtpa, represents one of the most significant single-entity exchange outflows of 2025 and offers a profound signal about veteran investor sentiment towards long-term digital asset custody. Analyzing the Bitcoin OG’s $427 Million Ethereum Withdrawal The series of transactions, culminating in a final 30,000 ETH transfer just hours before publication, provides a clear case study in on-chain behavior. Withdrawals of this magnitude from centralized exchanges like Binance are universally interpreted by market analysts as a bullish, long-term holding strategy. Essentially, the investor is moving assets from a trading venue to a private wallet, reducing immediate sell-side pressure and signaling strong conviction in Ethereum’s future value. This action starkly contrasts with depositing funds onto an exchange, which typically precedes a sale. Data transparency allows for detailed tracking. The entity ‘1011short’ is not an anonymous newcomer but a recognized address with a history in the crypto space, earning the ‘OG’ (Original Gangster) moniker through early involvement with Bitcoin. Their decision to allocate such a colossal sum into Ethereum, the leading smart contract platform, is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a sophisticated diversification strategy beyond Bitcoin, acknowledging Ethereum’s fundamental role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 infrastructure. Context and Impact of Major Cryptocurrency Whale Movements To understand the scale, consider the following comparison of recent notable whale withdrawals: Entity/Date Asset Amount Withdrawn Approx. Value (USD) From Exchange 1011short (March 2025) Ethereum (ETH) 148,000 ETH $427 million Binance Known Whale (Jan 2025) Bitcoin (BTC) 4,200 BTC $300 million Coinbase Institution (Dec 2024) Ethereum (ETH) 85,000 ETH $245 million Kraken This movement occurs within a specific market context. Firstly, Ethereum has recently undergone significant network upgrades, enhancing its scalability and reducing environmental impact. Secondly, regulatory clarity for custodial services has improved in several jurisdictions, making self-custody a more secure and legitimate option for large holders. Consequently, analysts view this not as an isolated event but as part of a broader trend of ‘exchange net outflows,’ where the total value of assets leaving exchanges exceeds deposits. Expert Interpretation and Market Sentiment Indicators Leading blockchain analysts emphasize the data-driven nature of this story. Platforms like ai_9684xtpa and others provide real-time monitoring of wallet addresses tagged by the community. When a known entity acts, the market takes note. The timing is also crucial; such withdrawals often precede periods of reduced liquid supply, which can contribute to price stability or upward momentum if demand remains constant or increases. Furthermore, this action underscores a key principle in cryptocurrency investing: sovereignty. By withdrawing to a private wallet, the OG asserts full control over the private keys, eliminating counterparty risk associated with leaving assets on an exchange. This practice, often called ‘HODLing’ in cold storage, is a hallmark of veteran investors who prioritize security and long-term vision over short-term trading. The move indirectly advocates for personal custody, a foundational ethos of the decentralized blockchain movement. Conclusion The Bitcoin OG’s withdrawal of 148,000 ETH from Binance is a powerful, data-rich event with multiple layers of significance. It demonstrates a strategic shift towards long-term Ethereum holding, highlights the maturity of on-chain analytics, and reflects a growing preference for self-custody among sophisticated market participants. While not a direct price predictor, this $427 million movement is a strong sentiment indicator, suggesting that seasoned investors are positioning for the next phase of blockchain adoption rather than engaging in speculative trading. The market will continue to watch the ‘1011short’ address for future clues, but the immediate message is one of calculated, long-term confidence in digital assets. FAQs Q1: What does ‘Bitcoin OG’ mean? ‘OG’ stands for ‘Original Gangster’ and is a term of respect in the cryptocurrency community for early adopters and investors who have been involved with Bitcoin since its formative years, often demonstrating deep understanding and conviction. Q2: Why is withdrawing crypto from an exchange considered bullish? Withdrawing to a private wallet reduces the immediately available supply on exchanges for trading. This can decrease potential sell pressure and indicates the holder’s intent to keep the asset for a long period, which is generally interpreted as a sign of confidence in its future value. Q3: How do analysts track these large transactions? Analysts use blockchain explorers and specialized analytics platforms (like Nansen, Arkham, or the cited ai_9684xtpa) that monitor public ledger data. They track wallet addresses, often identifying and tagging those belonging to known entities, whales, or exchanges to interpret market flows. Q4: What is the difference between keeping crypto on an exchange vs. in a private wallet? On an exchange, the platform holds your private keys, meaning you trust them to secure your assets (custodial). In a private wallet (non-custodial), you control the private keys, giving you full ownership and responsibility for security, aligning with the ‘be your own bank’ philosophy of crypto. Q5: Could this large withdrawal impact Ethereum’s price? While a single event rarely dictates price, large withdrawals can affect market microstructure. By locking up a significant supply, it reduces liquid assets available for quick sale, which can contribute to price stability or support upward trends if demand persists, as per basic economic principles of supply and demand.

This view is based on long-term chart structures that appear to resemble patterns seen in earlier market cycles. According to proponents of this outlook, XRP’s current lack of momentum does not necessarily invalidate its bullish potential. Instead, they argue that the extended period of price compression could be laying the groundwork for a significant impulse move once broader market conditions align. One of the analysts advancing this thesis is CryptoBull , a widely followed commentator who focuses on long-term technical structures rather than short-term volatility. His analysis emphasizes historical symmetry across XRP’s multi-year price cycles, with particular attention paid to how long the asset has remained in consolidation relative to prior bull markets. From this perspective, time rather than price is the most critical variable in assessing XRP’s next potential expansion. The next impulse will take #XRP to $11 and the last wave to $70. The price pattern is copying the previous bullrun, only difference is time, which makes sense, as we need longer accumulation for higher prices. pic.twitter.com/WJxzYDVRKT — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) January 23, 2026 Long-Term Structure and Historical Comparisons CryptoBull’s assessment relies on weekly chart data spanning nearly a decade. His work compares XRP’s current market structure with earlier periods that preceded strong upward movements, particularly the phases leading into the 2017–2018 rally. In those earlier cycles, XRP spent several years trading within defined ranges below key resistance levels before entering rapid expansion phases. What differentiates the present cycle, according to this analysis, is the duration of consolidation. XRP has remained range-bound for considerably longer than it did in previous market phases. From a technical standpoint, this extended base formation suggests a higher degree of price compression. Analysts who follow this framework argue that longer consolidation periods often result in more pronounced directional moves once resistance is decisively cleared, although the timing of such a move remains uncertain. The current structure shows XRP holding within a broad range after a prior breakout, without establishing a sustained trend on higher timeframes. While this has frustrated short-term traders, long-term observers view it as a continuation of accumulation rather than a sign of structural weakness. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The $11 Projection and Its Implications Based on this multi-year structure, CryptoBull identifies approximately $11 as the next significant upside objective. This level represents the first major impulse target derived from historical expansion ranges, adjusted to account for the size and duration of the current accumulation phase. Reaching this level would require XRP to increase nearly sixfold from its current price, placing its market capitalization above $600 billion. The analyst frames this target not as an extreme projection but as a measured outcome if historical patterns were to repeat proportionally. He also suggests that a move toward $11 could represent an intermediate phase rather than the final peak of the cycle. Higher-End Scenarios and Long-Term Expectations Beyond the $11 level, CryptoBull has outlined a more aggressive scenario in which XRP could eventually approach the $70 range if the full historical structure plays out. Such an outcome would imply a market capitalization exceeding $4 trillion, placing XRP among the largest financial assets globally. While this scenario is acknowledged as highly speculative, supporters argue that it is mathematically consistent with prior percentage expansions observed in earlier cycles. Importantly, this view does not assume rapid progression. Even proponents of the bullish thesis emphasize that XRP remains in a prolonged accumulation phase. In response to questions about timing, CryptoBull has indicated that it could take more than a year for XRP to reach double-digit prices, assuming favorable conditions develop. Extending the projection further, external estimates suggest that higher targets, such as $70, may not be achievable until well into the next decade. At present, XRP continues to trade within a narrow range on higher timeframes, reflecting limited directional conviction across the broader market. While near-term price action remains subdued, analysts following long-cycle frameworks maintain that the structural foundation for a larger move is still forming. The case for an XRP move toward $11 rests on historical pattern analysis, extended consolidation, and proportional expansion rather than short-term momentum. Although these projections remain uncertain and dependent on broader market dynamics, they illustrate why some analysts believe XRP’s next major impulse may occur after a prolonged period of apparent inactivity.

The funds were moved through a public wallet tied to WLFI. This was confirmed by on-chain evidence that was circulated by data platforms. Strategic Reasons Behind The Shift Several reasons could explain the swap. Holding ETH gives direct access to smart contracts, staking, and DeFi tools that WBTC cannot offer on its own. Some market watchers think WLFI may be positioning to use ETH for on-chain services, staking, or profit from future network activity. Others suggest it could be a way to rebalance risk between stores of value and utility tokens. Reports say no single motive can be proved from the chain itself, only the movement of funds. Reaction And Broader Signals Traders reacted with curiosity rather than panic. Prices barely moved on the news, showing the market may have already priced in similar flows. Smaller investors watched closely because such a swap by a high-profile, politically linked project draws attention. The wallet activity was tracked publicly, and analysts noted the timing matched a period of calmer ETH price action.

In a Saturday post on X, Entropy founder and CEO Tux Pacific said the crypto automation platform has reached the end of the road after years of trying to find a workable future. I am winding-up Entropy. After four years, several pivots, and two rounds of layoffs, I’ve decided to wind-up Entropy and return capital to our investors. For the latter half of 2025, the Entropy team was hard at work on a crypto automations platform (basically n8n/zapier/etc… — tux pacific (@__tux) January 24, 2026 Decision To Return Capital Two clear facts pushed the move. First, buyers and customers did not grow fast enough for the kind of return venture backers expect. Second, the team struggled to find a steady, repeatable business model that could support rapid growth and hire plans. Leaders tried product tweaks and new directions, but the pace of change stayed slow and revenue did not climb as hoped. In some cases the product was kept alive by small wins; in others it felt stalled. Investors will get back most of the money they put in. That makes this shutdown cleaner than some collapses where user funds were at risk. Reports say refunds will be handled through formal steps and planners are working out the details. The company’s founder has suggested they may shift their career focus away from crypto, possibly into fields like medical research, though that path is not certain.

Fresh data shows that wallets holding between 100,000 and 100 million ADA added about 454.7 million ADA over the past two months. At current prices, that accumulation stands around $161 million. As big whales look to take over, smaller wallets continue to exit positions. Wallets holding 100 ADA or less dumped 22,000 tokens over the last week. The investors’ behavior has grown a spot on separation between large and small holders. Such actions often appear during phases of market stress. It is suggested that when whales add and retails dump, it could turn out to be an ideal setup for a rebound when markets stabilize. Cardano holders sitting on losses? Santiment in a post shared data around Cardano’s current market value to realized value ratio. It mentioned that a lower 30-day MVRV suggests reduced downside risk relative to recent market participants. However, ADA’s 30-day MVRV stood at minus 7.9 percent. A negative MVRV number indicates that the average holder is sitting on unrealized losses. This can lower the selling pressure since fewer holders are in profit. It added that if a coin holds a positive percentage, then the traders you’re competing with are making money. This eventually pushes a high risk of entering while profits are above the normal. Data shows that other major altcoins are also holding similar readings. Chainlink sits at minus 9.5 percent, while Ether is at minus 7.6 percent. XRP is at minus 5.7 percent. The biggest crypto, Bitcoin, shows a milder negative reading of minus 3.7 percent. Cardano price has dropped by almost 19% in the last 60 days but it has managed to gain by 6% on YTD. ADA price jumped by 4% in the last 24 hours. It is trading at an average price of $0.35 at the press time. It is down by over 88% from its all time high of $3.10, recorded in September 2021. Is ADA facing US regulatory pressure? The accumulation trend comes as Cardano faces political and regulatory uncertainty in the United States. Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson said the current administration has left the US crypto industry in a weaker position than under former President Joe Biden. Hoskinson criticized how the Trump admin handled the launch of the Trump Coin and Melania Trump’s token. He said the rollout blasted the trust and damaged prospects for bipartisan crypto legislation in early 2025. Earlier, after Donald Trump’s election in November 2024, he reportedly stated that he would work with the new administration. He later said relations worsened as policy decisions unfolded. Despite political headwinds, institutional infrastructure around Cardano is expanding. CME Group said it plans to list futures contracts tied to Cardano on Feb. 9. It is still awaiting regulatory approval. It also plans to introduce futures for Chainlink and Stellar. The products would fall under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The exchange plans to offer both standard and micro contracts. Position sizes for Cardano would range from 10,000 to 100,000 ADA. Chainlink contracts would range from 250 to 5,000 LINK. Stellar contracts would range from 12,500 to 250,000 XLM. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

This strategic maneuver, reported on April 10, 2025, solidifies the firm’s position as a dominant force in the proof-of-stake ecosystem, with a total staked ETH valuation now surpassing a staggering $6.22 billion. The move sends a clear signal about long-term confidence in Ethereum’s network security and economic model. Bitmine’s Strategic Ethereum Accumulation and Staking Data from the analytics platform Onchain Lens confirms that Bitmine sourced its latest 20,000 ETH acquisition through the institutional trading desk FalconX. Subsequently, the firm directed 184,960 ETH into Ethereum’s staking contract. Consequently, Bitmine’s total staked ETH balance now stands at 2,128,160 tokens. This activity represents a continuous, calculated accumulation strategy rather than a one-off event. Furthermore, the decision to stake such a substantial portion of holdings underscores a commitment to network participation and yield generation. The scale of this operation is monumental. To provide context, 2.1 million ETH represents a significant percentage of the total ETH currently staked on the Beacon Chain. This scale grants Bitmine considerable influence within the validator set and generates substantial staking rewards, paid in ETH. The firm’s actions are closely watched as a barometer for institutional sentiment. Acquisition Channel: The purchase via FalconX highlights the preference for over-the-counter (OTC) desks for large, discreet transactions that avoid market slippage. Staking Mechanism: Staking involves locking ETH to help secure the Ethereum network and validate transactions, earning rewards in return. Portfolio Strategy: This move aligns with a yield-generating, long-term hold strategy common among large-scale digital asset managers. Analyzing the Impact on Ethereum’s Staking Landscape Bitmine’s latest deployment has immediate and long-term implications for the Ethereum ecosystem. Primarily, it further decentralizes the validator set among large, professional entities, potentially enhancing network resilience. However, it also concentrates a sizable stake with a single institution, a dynamic that regulators and community stakeholders monitor closely. The influx of nearly 185,000 new staked ETH increases the total network stake, which can subtly influence overall issuance rates and validator rewards. From a market perspective, large-scale staking acts as a reduction of liquid supply. When entities like Bitmine lock ETH for the long term, those tokens are effectively removed from immediate trading circulation. This can create a supply-side constraint, especially when coupled with growing demand. The table below contextualizes Bitmine’s position relative to the broader market. Metric Bitmine’s Holding Market Context Total Staked ETH 2,128,160 ETH Represents a major portion of the ~30 million total staked ETH. USD Value (Approx.) $6.22 Billion Comparable to the market cap of large public companies. Recent Staking Batch 184,960 ETH A single transaction larger than the reserves of many small nations. Expert Perspective: Institutional Validation of Proof-of-Stake Financial analysts view this activity as a robust endorsement of Ethereum’s post-merge economic model. “When a firm commits over $6 billion to a staking position, it’s not a speculative trade; it’s a strategic allocation,” notes Dr. Alina Chen, a blockchain economist at the Digital Asset Research Institute. “This signals a mature view of ETH as a productive, yield-bearing asset akin to a digital bond. The use of regulated counterparties like FalconX also underscores the professionalization of this space.” Chen points to the growing trend of institutional treasuries allocating to crypto-staking for portfolio diversification and inflation-hedging yield. The timing is also noteworthy. This accumulation occurs amidst broader discussions about Ethereum’s protocol upgrades, including potential changes to staking mechanics and fee structures. Bitmine’s commitment suggests a vote of confidence in the core development roadmap. Moreover, the firm’s ability to manage the technical and operational complexities of running thousands of validators demonstrates advanced infrastructure. The Broader Trend of Crypto Asset Management Bitmine’s move fits within a larger narrative of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Traditional finance giants and dedicated digital asset firms are increasingly building substantial positions in core blockchain assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their strategies often blend direct acquisition, staking for yield, and participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This activity provides market stability and liquidity while legitimizing the asset class for a wider investor base. Regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions has also enabled this growth. Frameworks for digital asset custody and staking-as-a-service are becoming more defined, reducing operational risk for large institutions. Bitmine’s use of established channels like FalconX, which complies with financial regulations, reflects this evolving, compliant landscape. The firm’s actions are therefore both a cause and a consequence of the market’s maturation. Conclusion Bitmine’s acquisition of 20,000 ETH and the subsequent staking of 184,960 ETH constitutes a major development in the cryptocurrency institutional investment landscape. By elevating its total staked Ethereum position to a $6.22 billion valuation, the firm has made a profound, long-term bet on the Ethereum network’s utility and security. This move reinforces the viability of staking as a core institutional strategy, reduces liquid ETH supply, and provides a strong signal of confidence to the broader market. As the digital asset ecosystem continues to mature, the strategic maneuvers of large, sophisticated players like Bitmine will remain critical indicators of trend direction and market health. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that Bitmine “staked” its ETH? Staking involves depositing Ethereum into the network’s consensus mechanism to help validate transactions and secure the blockchain. In return, stakers earn rewards, similar to interest, paid in additional ETH. Q2: Why is this acquisition significant for the average Ethereum investor? Large-scale staking by institutions reduces the amount of ETH available for immediate sale on exchanges, which can impact supply and demand dynamics. It also demonstrates strong professional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Q3: How does staking affect the Ethereum network’s security? Staking directly contributes to network security. The more ETH that is staked, the more expensive it becomes for a malicious actor to attack the network, as they would need to acquire and stake a prohibitively large amount of ETH. Q4: Can staked ETH be sold immediately? No. Staked ETH is locked in a contract. While mechanisms for withdrawal exist post-Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, there is a queue and unbonding period, making it a less liquid commitment than holding ETH on an exchange. Q5: What is an institutional OTC desk like FalconX? Over-the-Counter (OTC) desks facilitate large trades directly between two parties, away from public order books. This allows institutions to buy or sell large amounts of cryptocurrency without causing significant price movement in the open market.

The AI’s recent breakdown is brutally honest: Ethereum price prediction models show $7,500 by late 2026, a solid 2.6x gain from today’s $2,887 mark. River might touch $150 if whale momentum continues, delivering roughly 77% upside from its current $84.53 position. Grok’s data essentially confirms what contrarian wealth builders already know: blue-chip coins preserve capital, but presales create millionaires. That’s where APEMARS ($APRZ) enters the conversation as the legitimate next 100x crypto that is still in Stage 5 of a 23-stage presale mission. Let’s look at Ethereum price prediction, River price forecast, and APEMARS explosive gains. APEMARS ($APRZ): The Next 100x Crypto APEMARS is a 23-stage meme coin presale, currently in Stage 5 with over $115k raised and 570+ committed holders. The current depletion rate is 72% of the allocation, and the stage closes in 4 days. Stage 6 launches at $0.00004634, increasing the token price and reducing returns. Beyond stage-based urgency, APEMARS weaponizes scarcity through its Thermal Disposal Protocol: structured burns at Stages 6, 12, 18, and 23 that permanently erase every unsold token from existence. Every token left unsold from earlier phases gets incinerated, shrinking available supply while 18 remaining stages push demand higher through narrative momentum and expanding holder base. As one of the next 100x cryptos, APEMARS is primed to benefit from this supply reduction strategy. This means you’re not just paying higher prices; you’re entering after the first checkpoint burn, missing the pre-scarcity window that separates generational positioning from decent trades. $2,500 Turns Into $378,892 If You Secure Stage 5 Before Closure Mathematics strips emotion from decisions. Deploy $2,500 at Stage 5’s $0.00003629 pricing, and you lock in 68,889,501 $APRZ tokens. Projected Q2 2026 listing price? $0.0055 per token. Your $2,500 position becomes $378,892.26, a straightforward 15,000% return. As one of the next 100x cryptos, APEMARS offers a rare chance for those looking for exponential growth. Don’t miss this opportunity to invest in one of the next 100x cryptos that could change your portfolio.

Ethereum continues powering decentralized finance infrastructure, trading around $2,887.87 after reclaiming support between $2,750 and $3,100. Standard Chartered recently called 2026 “Ethereum’s year,” pointing to accelerating adoption in real-world asset tokenization, stablecoin frameworks, and Layer-2 scaling reducing network congestion. Near-term Ethereum price prediction targets range $4,000-$4,950, extending toward $7,500 by year-end if institutional inflows maintain pace. Long-term models estimate $22,000 by 2028 and $40,000 by 2030 as Ethereum cements its position as a foundational DeFi infrastructure layer. Reality check: $2,887 to $7,500 equals 2.6x return, respectable for preservation, nowhere near explosive for multiplication. River Prediction: $150 Possible But Volatility Is the Price River demonstrated explosive momentum recently, surging late 2025 to peaks around $75-$80 amid whale accumulation and community hype cycles. Currently at $84.53, analyst predictions for end-2026 span wide ranges due to the speculative nature and supply transparency controversies. Bullish forecasts suggest potential $149+ if momentum sustains. Conservative models point toward $60-$80 averages. Bearish outlooks project $20-$50 if sentiment shifts or manipulation concerns trigger selloffs. Realistic targets sit around $100-$150 by year-end 2026, roughly 18%-77% growth, assuming broader market strength and controversies fade. Key drivers include institutional altcoin interest and Bitcoin cycle influence. Red flags around supply control and volatility warrant caution. $RIVER remains high-risk, prone to sharp swings either direction, requiring careful position sizing and constant monitoring. Next 100x Crypto Window Is Closing Fast Grok’s Ethereum price prediction delivers 2.6x certainty. River forecasts offer 77% speculation with manipulation shadows. But the next 100x crypto ? That’s APEMARS Stage 5 right now, where $2,500 becomes $378,892 at Q2 2026 listing. Stage 4 vanished within hours. Stage 5 closes in just 4 days and Stage 6 jumps to $0.00004634. This entry point?

This movement, recorded on March 26, 2025, by data provider Alternative.me, represents a significant change in investor temperament that often precedes broader market movements. Consequently, analysts and traders are now scrutinizing the underlying data for clues about the sustainability of this newfound, albeit cautious, sentiment. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s Recent Ascent The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple yet effective scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear,’ typically associated with panic selling and market bottoms, while a score of 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed,’ often correlating with market tops and irrational exuberance. The jump from 20 to 29 is therefore more than a numerical change; it is a categorical shift from one emotional extreme to a less severe state of ‘Fear.’ This metric aggregates multiple data points to avoid reliance on any single indicator. Volatility (25%): Measures price swings, with high volatility often feeding fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes trading activity; rising volume on positive price action can indicate growing conviction. Social Media (15%): Scans platforms like X and Reddit for sentiment trends. Surveys (15%): Incorporates direct polling of market participants. Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Trends (10%): Uses Google search volume for crypto-related terms. The recent rise suggests a measurable decrease in negative signals across several of these components. For instance, reduced volatility and increased buy-side volume likely contributed substantially to the nine-point gain. Furthermore, this shift did not occur in a vacuum but followed a period of consolidation for major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which often stabilizes trader nerves. Historical Context and Market Psychology Historically, the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone has frequently presented contrarian buying opportunities for long-term investors. Periods where the index languished below 25 have often coincided with local price bottoms, though not without exceptions. The transition out of this zone is a critical watchpoint for market technicians. It signals that the pervasive panic may be subsiding, allowing for a more rational assessment of asset fundamentals. However, veteran analysts caution that a move into ‘Fear’ is not a bullish signal in itself but rather a reduction of extreme bearishness. Market psychology cycles between fear and greed are well-documented in traditional finance, and cryptocurrency markets exhibit these traits with amplified intensity. The index’s design specifically captures this behavioral finance aspect. When the crowd is exceedingly fearful, the potential for a sentiment-driven rally increases as selling pressure exhausts itself. Conversely, the current reading of 29 remains firmly in ‘Fear’ territory, indicating that widespread optimism or ‘Greed’ is still absent. This middle ground can sometimes provide a healthier environment for gradual, sustainable price appreciation than a rapid surge into ‘Greed.’ Expert Analysis on Sentiment Drivers Financial psychologists and market strategists often reference the Fear & Greed Index as a tool for identifying emotional extremes. According to principles of behavioral finance, investors are prone to herd mentality. The index’s rise from 20 may reflect a diminishing herd instinct towards panic. Several tangible factors could be driving this change: clearer regulatory guidance in key jurisdictions, strong quarterly reports from major blockchain networks, or a macro-economic shift favoring risk assets. Importantly, the index measures sentiment, not value, so it does not indicate whether assets are fundamentally cheap or expensive, only how the market feels about them. Data from derivatives markets also provides context. A decline in funding rates for perpetual swaps and reduced put/call ratios often align with a rising Fear & Greed Index. These metrics suggest professional traders are becoming less inclined to bet on further immediate downside. Additionally, on-chain data, such as the movement of coins from long-term holder wallets to exchanges, can show whether the sentiment shift is accompanied by actual changes in holder behavior. A calming sentiment with low exchange inflows can be a more robust signal than sentiment alone. The Path Ahead and Potential Implications The immediate question for the market is whether this sentiment improvement can catalyze a broader recovery or if it will prove fleeting. A sustained move above 50 into ‘Neutral’ territory would signal a true balance between fear and greed. Key levels to watch include the index’s 30-day moving average and its trajectory over the coming weeks. It is also instructive to compare the current reading to historical periods. For example, in early 2023, a sustained climb out of ‘Extreme Fear’ preceded a significant multi-month rally, though macroeconomic conditions today are distinctly different. The index’s rise may have practical implications for different market participants. For retail investors, it can serve as a reminder to avoid emotional decision-making. For institutional players, it forms one data point in a complex risk model. The table below contrasts typical market characteristics at different index levels: Index Range Sentiment Label Typical Market Behavior 0-24 Extreme Fear Panic selling, high volatility, negative news dominance. 25-49 Fear Cautious trading, selective buying, sentiment recovery. 50-74 Greed FOMO buying, increasing leverage, strong bullish trends. 75-100 Extreme Greed Market tops, irrational exuberance, bubble warnings. Ultimately, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a lagging indicator, reflecting emotions that have already been expressed in price and volume. Therefore, while its exit from ‘Extreme Fear’ is a positive development, it should be synthesized with fundamental on-chain analysis, macroeconomic trends, and technical price action to form a complete market view. The coming days will be crucial to see if this sentiment shift attracts fresh capital or meets renewed resistance. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s climb to 29 marks a meaningful inflection point for market psychology, moving the needle from ‘Extreme Fear’ to a more moderate state of ‘Fear.’ This shift, driven by a composite of volatility, volume, and social metrics, suggests a decrease in panic and a potential foundation for more stable market conditions. However, investors should treat this as one valuable gauge among many, recognizing that true market health depends on a confluence of sentiment, fundamentals, and external economic factors. The index now offers a glimmer of hope, but the path forward will be determined by sustained positive developments and capital flows. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 29 mean? A reading of 29 falls into the ‘Fear’ category. It indicates that market sentiment has improved from the prior state of ‘Extreme Fear’ but remains predominantly negative, with investors still exhibiting caution rather than optimism. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily, typically based on a 24-hour rolling window of data, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment. Q3: Can the Fear & Greed Index predict Bitcoin’s price? The index is not a direct price predictor. Instead, it measures current sentiment, which can be a contrarian indicator at extremes. Historically, prolonged ‘Extreme Fear’ has sometimes preceded price rebounds, while ‘Extreme Greed’ has signaled potential tops. Q4: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is created and published by Alternative.me, a company that provides data and tools for cryptocurrency market analysis. Q5: Why is the index important for cryptocurrency investors? It helps investors quantify the often-irrational emotional component of the market. By recognizing periods of extreme fear or greed, investors can better manage their own psychology and avoid making decisions based purely on the prevailing crowd emotion.

This substantial outflow from the digital asset ecosystem coincided precisely with gold and silver prices soaring to unprecedented record highs, highlighting a classic flight to safety during periods of market uncertainty. Analysts from Santiment, a leading blockchain analytics firm, provided the data that reveals this capital rotation, suggesting a broader narrative of risk aversion taking hold among investors. Stablecoin Market Cap Reveals Investor Sentiment Shift The market capitalization of the top twelve stablecoins serves as a critical liquidity indicator for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Essentially, these dollar-pegged tokens represent dry powder—capital parked on the sidelines, ready to re-enter more volatile markets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Consequently, a contraction in this metric signals that capital is exiting the crypto ecosystem entirely rather than simply moving between digital assets. The recent $2.2 billion drop marks one of the most pronounced withdrawals in recent months. This movement provides a clear, quantifiable signal of changing investor psychology, moving from a risk-on to a risk-off stance. Historically, periods of stablecoin supply growth have often preceded strong crypto market rallies. Conversely, periods of decline, like the current one, typically correlate with market corrections or sideways consolidation. The speed of this drawdown is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a coordinated shift rather than gradual profit-taking. Market participants are demonstrably reducing their exposure to crypto-associated volatility. They are seeking shelter in assets with centuries-long reputations for preserving value during economic turbulence. The Data Behind the Decline Santiment’s analysis pinpointed the ten-day window where the outflow accelerated. Major stablecoins like Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI) all saw reductions in their circulating supplies. This data is publicly verifiable on-chain, providing a transparent view of capital movements that is unavailable in traditional finance. The timing is inextricably linked to macroeconomic anxieties, including geopolitical tensions and recalibrated interest rate expectations from central banks. When such uncertainties arise, digital asset investors often execute a two-step process: first, they sell volatile cryptocurrencies for stablecoins; second, they redeem those stablecoins for fiat currency to deploy elsewhere. Gold and Silver Surge as Primary Beneficiaries Simultaneously, precious metals markets experienced a powerful rally. Gold prices broke through the $2,800 per ounce barrier for the first time, while silver also achieved a new all-time high. This inverse correlation is not coincidental but rather a textbook example of capital rotation. Gold has served as the ultimate safe-haven asset for millennia, prized for its scarcity, tangible nature, and independence from any government or financial system. In contrast, cryptocurrencies, despite being dubbed “digital gold” by some proponents, remain a relatively new and proven asset class prone to high volatility. The concurrent timing strongly suggests that a portion of the capital leaving stablecoins is directly fueling the rally in precious metals. Institutional investors, in particular, have sophisticated treasury management strategies that mandate allocations to proven stores of value during downturns. For many, physical gold and gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) fulfill this role more convincingly than digital assets during times of acute stress. The scale of the metals rally indicates this is not merely retail investor behavior but includes significant institutional capital flows. Tangible vs. Digital: Gold is a physical commodity, while stablecoins are digital tokens reliant on blockchain infrastructure and issuer solvency. Historical Track Record: Gold has a millennia-long history as a store of value; stablecoins have existed for less than a decade. Regulatory Environment: Precious metals markets are heavily regulated and established; the regulatory framework for stablecoins is still evolving globally. Broader Market Impact and Crypto Correlation This capital rotation occurred alongside a corrective phase in the broader cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC), often considered a digital risk-off asset within the crypto space, also faced downward pressure, though analysis suggests it may demonstrate relative strength compared to altcoins. The logic is straightforward: if stablecoin liquidity is draining away, there is less available capital to purchase any crypto asset. However, during sell-offs, investors tend to flee higher-risk altcoins first, consolidating into Bitcoin before potentially exiting into fiat or other asset classes entirely. This dynamic explains why altcoins often face disproportionate selling pressure during such liquidity contractions. Analyzing the Drivers of Uncertainty To understand this capital shift, one must examine the global economic landscape. Several interlocking factors are driving the search for safety. Persistent inflation concerns, despite central bank efforts, erode the real value of fiat currencies. Geopolitical instability in multiple regions increases demand for neutral, apolitical assets. Furthermore, volatility in traditional equity and bond markets has pushed investors to re-evaluate their entire portfolio allocation strategies. In this environment, the perceived stability of gold becomes exceptionally attractive. For the crypto market, this presents a moment of truth. Proponents argue that Bitcoin is a superior store of value due to its verifiable scarcity and digital portability. However, during genuine market stress tests, a significant cohort of investors still defaults to the ancient precedent of gold. This does not invalidate crypto’s long-term thesis but highlights the ongoing battle for mindshare and capital in the “store of value” category. The market is effectively testing the resilience of both narratives simultaneously. Comparative Asset Performance During Stress Period (10-Day Window) Asset Class Key Metric Performance Implied Sentiment Stablecoins Aggregate Market Cap -$2.24B Capital Outflow / Risk-Off Gold (XAU) Price per Ounce All-Time High Safe-Haven Inflow Bitcoin (BTC) Price & Dominance Corrected, Dominance Stable/Rising Relative Strength Within Crypto Major Altcoins Market Cap vs. BTC Underperformed BTC Heightened Risk Aversion Historical Precedents and Future Trajectories Past market cycles provide context for the current stablecoin market cap contraction. Similar drawdowns have occurred during previous crypto winters and broader financial crises. The critical indicator for a crypto market recovery has historically been the resumption of growth in stablecoin supplies. This signals that fresh capital is entering the ecosystem, ready to be deployed. Until that metric reverses course, the crypto market may struggle to find sustained upward momentum, with altcoins remaining particularly vulnerable. Experts monitor on-chain metrics like exchange inflows and outflows of stablecoins to gauge returning confidence. A key level to watch is the aggregate stablecoin market cap returning to and surpassing its previous high. That event would suggest the completion of the rotation cycle and a renewed appetite for crypto risk. In the meantime, the strength of the gold rally will be a competing indicator of how long the risk-off sentiment persists in the broader financial landscape. The Path Forward for Digital Assets This episode underscores a crucial development phase for cryptocurrencies. To become a universally accepted safe haven, the asset class must demonstrate reduced correlation to traditional risk assets and prove its resilience during systemic stress. Developments such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs were steps toward institutionalization, but events like the current capital rotation show the journey is ongoing. Building trust as a store of value is a multi-decade process, and gold’s recent outperformance during crypto outflows is a reminder of that reality. Conclusion The $2.2 billion decline in the stablecoin market cap is a powerful market signal, reflecting a decisive pivot by investors toward traditional safe-haven assets like gold and silver. This capital rotation, occurring amid macroeconomic uncertainty, highlights the current limits of crypto’s perceived stability during broad risk-off events. While the long-term implications for digital assets remain open, the immediate effect is clear: capital has exited the crypto liquidity pool, increasing selling pressure, particularly on altcoins. Market participants will now watch closely for a reversal in stablecoin market cap growth as the primary harbinger of a renewed crypto bull run. Until then, the allure of gold’s timeless security continues to exert a powerful force on global capital flows. FAQs Q1: What does a falling stablecoin market cap mean for Bitcoin? A1: A declining stablecoin market cap generally indicates net capital outflow from the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This reduces overall buying pressure, often leading to price corrections or stagnation. Bitcoin may show relative strength compared to altcoins during this period, but a sustained recovery typically requires stablecoin supplies to begin growing again, signaling new capital inflows. Q2: Why would investors choose gold over cryptocurrency as a safe haven? A2: Investors often choose gold due to its millennia-long history as a store of value, its tangible physical nature, and its established, deeply liquid global markets. During periods of extreme uncertainty, some investors perceive gold as having a more proven track record of wealth preservation compared to the newer, more volatile cryptocurrency asset class. Q3: How is the stablecoin market cap calculated? A3: The aggregate stablecoin market cap is calculated by summing the total circulating supply of each major stablecoin (like USDT, USDC, DAI) multiplied by its intended peg value, usually $1.00. Blockchain analytics firms like Santiment track these supplies on-chain in real-time, providing a transparent view of the total dollar value of capital parked in these assets. Q4: Could this capital rotation be a positive sign for crypto in the long term? A4: Potentially, yes. Healthy markets experience cycles of capital rotation. This outflow could represent a cleansing of speculative excess. If the capital eventually returns from traditional assets, it may do so with greater conviction. Furthermore, it forces the crypto industry to build more robust, less correlated fundamentals to truly compete with gold as a safe haven. Q5: What should crypto investors watch to signal the end of this capital outflow? A5: The key metric to watch is a sustained increase in the aggregate stablecoin market cap. This indicates new dollars are entering the crypto system. Other positive signals would include decreasing exchange inflows of Bitcoin (suggesting holders are not looking to sell) and a stabilization or increase in Bitcoin’s dominance ratio relative to altcoins.

This incremental yet significant movement provides a crucial data point for investors analyzing the perennial tug-of-war between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies. Consequently, market analysts are now scrutinizing historical patterns to gauge whether this marks the beginning of a broader altcoin rally or merely a temporary fluctuation. The index serves as a foundational barometer for understanding capital flows within the digital asset ecosystem. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Mechanics CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index functions as a sophisticated, objective metric designed to quantify market sentiment and performance. The platform calculates this figure by analyzing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, deliberately excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. A definitive altcoin season is officially declared only when 75% of these major altcoins outperform Bitcoin during that timeframe, which corresponds to an index score of 75 or higher. Therefore, the current score of 29, while rising, remains firmly in “Bitcoin season” territory, indicating Bitcoin’s continued outperformance. However, the recent upward movement suggests a potential weakening of Bitcoin’s dominance, prompting closer examination of underlying trends. The Historical Context of Market Cycles Understanding the current index position requires analysis of previous crypto market cycles. Historically, bull markets often begin with Bitcoin leading the charge, as institutional and large-scale capital typically flows into the most established asset first. Subsequently, as investor confidence grows and Bitcoin’s price stabilizes at higher levels, capital begins to “rotate” into altcoins, which are perceived to have higher growth potential. For instance, the last major altcoin season, which peaked in early 2021, saw the index sustain scores above 75 for several months, coinciding with explosive growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects built primarily on networks like Ethereum. This historical precedent provides a framework for interpreting today’s data. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Index Rise The two-point increase in the Altcoin Season Index, while modest, is not an isolated event. It correlates with several observable market developments in early 2025. Firstly, Ethereum continues to demonstrate strength following its successful transition to a full proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which has significantly reduced its energy consumption. Secondly, layer-1 blockchain competitors like Solana and Avalanche have reported sustained growth in developer activity and network usage. Furthermore, renewed interest in specific sectors, such as real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), is driving capital toward the native tokens of protocols operating in these spaces. These sector-specific rallies can contribute to improved relative performance against Bitcoin, even during a broader Bitcoin-dominant phase. The table below illustrates a simplified comparison of key metrics during different market phases: Market Phase Altcoin Season Index Range Typical Bitcoin Dominance Investor Sentiment Bitcoin Season 0 – 74 High & Rising Risk-Off, Cautious Transition Phase 30 – 70 (Fluctuating) Stable or Slightly Declining Speculative, Watchful Altcoin Season 75 – 100 Low & Falling Risk-On, Euphoric Currently, the market appears to be in a volatile transition phase . Key factors influencing this phase include: Macroeconomic conditions: Interest rate decisions by major central banks directly impact liquidity available for speculative assets. Regulatory clarity: Evolving regulatory frameworks in jurisdictions like the EU (MiCA) and the US provide a more defined operating environment. On-chain activity: Metrics like active addresses and transaction volumes on smart contract platforms offer real-time demand signals. Derivatives market data: Funding rates and open interest on altcoin perpetual contracts reflect trader leverage and sentiment. Expert Perspectives on Market Rotation Signals Seasoned market analysts emphasize that the Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator, confirming trends that have already developed over a quarter. However, its rise is often preceded by early signals. For example, analysts at blockchain analytics firm Glassnode have previously noted that a sustained increase in altcoin trading volume as a percentage of total crypto volume often foreshadows a rising index. Similarly, a narrowing of the performance gap between Bitcoin and the top 10 altcoins can be an early technical signal. Experts from firms like Arcane Research consistently advise investors to use the index as one tool within a broader toolkit, combining it with on-chain analysis, macroeconomic review, and fundamental project research. This holistic approach prevents overreliance on any single metric. The Impact of Institutional Adoption The structure of capital entering the market has fundamentally shifted since the last major altcoin season. The approval and subsequent inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 created a powerful, sustained demand driver for Bitcoin, arguably prolonging its dominance. For a true, broad-based altcoin season to emerge, many analysts believe a similar catalyst is required for altcoins. This could take the form of a spot Ethereum ETF approval, clearer regulatory pathways for other digital assets, or significant institutional adoption of specific blockchain utilities beyond pure speculation. The gradual increase in the Altcoin Season Index may reflect early institutional experimentation with diversified crypto portfolios, moving cautiously beyond Bitcoin-only strategies. Conclusion The rise of the Altcoin Season Index to 29 represents a meaningful, though preliminary, signal in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. It underscores a gradual increase in the relative strength of major altcoins compared to Bitcoin, based on a rigorous 90-day performance analysis. While the index remains far from the 75 threshold that defines a full altcoin season, its upward trajectory warrants attention from investors monitoring for phase shifts in market cycles. Ultimately, this metric, grounded in verifiable price data from CoinMarketCap, provides a neutral framework for assessing market structure. Continued observation of the Altcoin Season Index , alongside broader economic and technological developments, will be essential for navigating the evolving digital asset landscape in 2025 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index score of 29 mean? An index score of 29 indicates that, over the past 90 days, less than half of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin. The market is still in a “Bitcoin season,” but the rising score suggests altcoins are beginning to close the performance gap. Q2: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, providing a near real-time view of the changing performance dynamics between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market. Q3: Does a rising index guarantee that an altcoin season is coming? No, it does not guarantee it. The index is a lagging indicator that confirms past performance. A rising trend can reverse, and the index must reach and sustain a score above 75 to officially declare an altcoin season. Q4: Which altcoins are considered in the index calculation? The index uses the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC), to focus purely on volatile assets competing for investor capital. Q5: How should a long-term investor use this index? Long-term investors should treat the index as a context-setting tool, not a timing signal. It helps understand which phase of the market cycle is occurring, which can inform portfolio rebalancing strategies and risk management, but should not replace fundamental research on individual assets.

Crypto CEO Weighs In",https://timestabloid.com/is-20000-xrp-enough-crypto-ceo-weighs-in/,"A recurring question within the XRP community has resurfaced following comments from Jake Claver, chief executive officer of Digital Ascension Group. Rather than focusing on price hype or short-term speculation, Claver approached the topic from a practical financial perspective, examining what long-term outcomes could look like for an investor holding 20,000 XRP under different valuation scenarios. His analysis has reignited debate around portfolio size , sustainability, and what financial independence realistically means in the context of digital assets. A Scenario-Based Approach to XRP Holdings Claver’s discussion centers on hypothetical price milestones and the income potential they could generate, rather than encouraging active selling or market timing. In one scenario, he outlines the implications of XRP reaching a valuation of $100 per token . At that level, a holding of 20,000 XRP would equate to a portfolio valued at $2 million. Assuming a conservative annual return of 5%, such a portfolio could theoretically generate around $100,000 per year without reducing the underlying capital. Is 20,000 XRP enough? If XRP hits $100, that’s $2 million. A 5% return is $100k a year If XRP hits $1,000, that’s $20 million. A 5% return is $1 million a year The right bag can go far with patience — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) January 25, 2026 He extends the same framework to a more aggressive valuation of $1,000 per XRP . Under those conditions, the portfolio value would rise to $20 million, with an estimated annual income of approximately $1 million at the same return rate. The emphasis in both examples is on income generation rather than liquidation, aligning the argument with traditional wealth preservation and yield-based strategies. At present, XRP trades well below these projections, hovering under $2, which underscores the long-term and speculative nature of the assumptions. Caution From Longstanding XRP Community Voices While Claver’s calculations present an optimistic outlook, they have been met with skepticism from more conservative figures within the XRP ecosystem. Some early community participants have cautioned that a seven-figure portfolio does not automatically translate into financial security, particularly over several decades. Their concern is rooted in real-world considerations such as taxation, inflation, healthcare costs, and lifestyle inflation, all of which can significantly reduce the effective value of wealth over time. From this viewpoint, a $2 million portfolio may appear substantial but could prove insufficient when spread across 30 to 50 years of living expenses, especially in regions with high costs of living. These commentators argue that the psychological impact of seeing a large number on paper often obscures the practical realities of long-term financial planning. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Defining Financial Independence More Rigorously A more conservative interpretation of financial freedom suggests that a higher capital base is required to sustain long-term independence without undue risk. Estimates frequently cited by this group place the threshold between $5 million and $7 million, though the exact figure varies depending on age, location, and spending habits. This perspective emphasizes capital preservation, diversification, and realistic expectations over reliance on exceptionally high asset valuations. Importantly, this school of thought does not necessarily reject Claver’s framework. Instead, it highlights that his example assumes disciplined financial management and consistent returns, rather than impulsive spending or reliance on appreciation alone. The distinction lies in how much margin for error an investor has when market conditions or personal circumstances change. No Universal Answer to “Enough XRP” The broader discussion reveals that there is no consensus on how much XRP constitutes a sufficient holding. Some commentators advocate for significantly larger positions, arguing that higher exposure provides flexibility if price appreciation underperforms expectations. Others contend that even smaller holdings could be impactful if paired with prudent management and favorable market conditions. A growing number of voices within the community reject fixed numerical targets altogether. They argue that financial literacy, risk management, and long-term planning are ultimately more important than the size of any single position. From this angle, outcomes are shaped less by how much XRP is held and more by how capital is deployed, protected, and grown over time. Claver’s analysis provides a useful framework for thinking about possibilities, but it also highlights the importance of strategy, patience, and realistic expectations in determining long-term financial outcomes.

The sudden dip exposed how thin demand has become at key support zones, and while buyers are trying to stabilize the price, momentum remains weak. With volatility rising and sentiment turning defensive, Ethereum is entering a pivotal stretch where the next few weeks could define the broader trend for 2026. Bulls need to reclaim lost ground quickly, but repeated failures to hold higher levels suggest the market is still vulnerable to deeper downside if support breaks again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Falls Back To Post-Bear Market Levels: Investors Approach A Key Decision Point Adding to the pressure, a key US institutional demand proxy is flashing a warning sign. The 30-day simple moving average (SMA30) of the Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index has dropped to −0.08, reaching its lowest level since early 2023. This index tracks the pricing gap between Ethereum’s USD pair on Coinbase and the USDT pair on Binance, and deep negative readings typically indicate ETH is trading at a discount on Coinbase—often interpreted as weaker demand from US-based institutional buyers. This divergence matters because positive Coinbase premiums historically support sustained upside trends in Ethereum. With that premium now at a multi-year low, ETH’s attempt to recover above $2,900 is happening without strong confirmation from US “smart money,” increasing uncertainty around the next move. Coinbase Premium Hits Multi-Year Low A CryptoQuant report highlights a key warning signal for Ethereum: the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the price gap between ETH/USD on Coinbase and ETH/USDT on Binance. Because Coinbase is widely viewed as a proxy for US institutional activity, a deeply negative premium typically indicates ETH is trading at a discount where “smart money” is most active, while Binance—often driven by global retail and whale flow—holds relatively stronger pricing. In practical terms, this spread helps reveal where demand is coming from and whether capital flows are supportive of a sustained trend. The current downside in the premium suggests a clear lack of buying pressure from US institutions. Even if global markets on Binance are stabilizing Ethereum’s price in the short term, the absence of American demand creates a bearish divergence. This matters because positive premiums underpin major ETH rallies; they signal the US-based accumulation and deep spot demand that drive price extensions. Without that backing, rallies are more likely to fade, and rebounds can become vulnerable to renewed selling pressure. The report flags this historic premium low as a warning: despite global resilience, the market lacks the US momentum that typically fuels a strong, immediate reversal. For bulls, the priority is not only reclaiming key price levels, but also seeing confirmation through premium recovery.

While the bounce suggests buyers are still defending the lower end of the current range, the overall structure remains weak. ETH has been trending lower from its late-2025 highs, and recent recovery attempts continue to fade before triggering a sustained reversal. Technically, Ethereum is still trading below its key trend averages, which keeps pressure on bulls. The 50-period moving average (blue) is positioned above the price and is beginning to roll over, signaling weakening short-term momentum. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended The 100-period moving average (green) is also above current levels and sloping downward. This reinforces that traders are selling into rallies rather than following them with fresh demand. Together, these moving average bands have become a clear resistance zone that ETH must reclaim to shift the trend back in favor of buyers. At the same time, the 200-period moving average (red) remains below the price and continues to rise gradually, acting as a long-term structural support reference. As long as ETH holds above this curve, the move looks more like a corrective phase than a full macro breakdown. For bulls, the immediate objective is reclaiming $3,000, then pushing toward $3,150–$3,250 to challenge the 50/100 MA zone. If ETH fails to stabilize, downside risk remains open toward $2,750–$2,800.

The company has added 40,302 Ether in the last week, increasing its total holdings to 4.24 million ETH. It also increased its balance of ETH held in staking by 171,264 over the last week, bringing the total to more than 2 million ETH. Bitmine stakes more Ether to earn a steady income Bitmine is increasing the amount of Ether it stakes as it seeks to make its vast crypto reserves a regular source of on-chain income . It does this by using the Ethereum staking mechanism to earn rewards on the cryptocurrency. Currently, the amount of Ether that Bitmine has staked could bring in around $164 million annually, given the company’s 2.81% Composite Ethereum Staking Rate (CESR) and the price of Ether at the time of the report. CESR measures the average yearly earnings that validators on Ethereum accumulated. It is a widely used standard for measuring stakeholder performance. Bitmine has invested more than half of its total Ether holdings, doing so faster than most public crypto treasuries. This demonstrates a clear shift towards actively earning yields. Chairman Tom Lee said the company can see significant earnings growth if it continues to expand its staking business. He said that staking all of Bitmine’s Ether would yield annual staking revenue of $374 million, or more than $1 million per day, assuming the same staking rate. Bitmine will work with multi-party staking firms to spread the risk involved with its bold plan and increase the amount of Ether present on the blockchain. The company will also launch its own validator setup in the U.S. this year as part of the next phase in its staking plan. Companies use Ether staking to earn money Ether staking is one of the most common strategies for companies with large crypto treasuries. More firms are looking for regular income from their ETH while maintaining exposure to the network. What Bitmine’s plan illustrates is a shift in the digital asset space. Rather than holding their Ether as a value that goes up and down with the market, companies with treasuries are increasingly opting to stake their ETH to receive rewards directly from the network. Bitmine also claims it has $682 million in cash, 193 Bitcoins, and some minority equity holdings, for a total of $12.8 billion in crypto and cash. Yet Ether is still the dominant holding. Bitmine now holds 3.52% of the 120.7 million ETH in circulation, underscoring the company’s determination to increase its influence in the industry. The company plans to hold 5% of all the ETH. Other companies are using similar concepts and reaping success. SharpLink Gaming , the second-largest Ether treasury company, reported earning 10,657 ETH, or $33 million, in staking rewards. SharpLink has accumulated 864,840 ETH, according to CoinGecko, and has been earning rewards for 7 months. However, this trend is expanding to other companies beyond these two. In June, Bit Digital announced its plan to cease or sell its Bitcoin mining business and invest in a larger Ether position. Currently, the company has 153,546 ETH in reserve and only six Bitcoins, indicating a change in strategy. About a month after the announcement, Ether Machine disclosed plans to roll out a publicly traded yield-focused Ether fund targeting institutional investors. The company has now become the third-largest Ether treasury, holding 496,712 Ether. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This monumental transaction, first identified by blockchain analytics firm EmberCN, concludes a nine-year holding period that has yielded one of the most legendary profits in crypto history. The event immediately sends ripples through market analysis, prompting deep examination of holder behavior and potential market signals. Decoding the $248 Million Ethereum Whale Transaction The transaction originated from an Ethereum address beginning with 0xb5Ab. Significantly, this address had lain completely inactive since its creation. According to verifiable on-chain data, the entity initially acquired 135,000 ETH from the Bitfinex exchange in 2016. The average acquisition price stood at a mere $90 per token, representing a total initial investment of about $12.17 million. Consequently, the recent deposit of 85,000 ETH at an average price of $2,908 signifies a partial realization of gains. This specific move crystallizes an estimated profit of $381 million on the deposited portion, marking a staggering 32-fold return on the original capital. Blockchain analysts universally classify such addresses as “dormant whales.” These entities hold vast quantities of assets without any movement for multiple years. Their eventual activity often carries substantial weight for several reasons. First, it demonstrates extreme conviction and patience. Second, it can indicate a major shift in sentiment from accumulation to distribution. Finally, the sheer size of the movement can impact exchange liquidity and trader psychology. Historical Context and the 2016 Ethereum Landscape To fully appreciate this event, one must understand the Ethereum ecosystem of 2016. The network itself was in its infancy, having launched just the year before. Smart contracts and decentralized applications were novel concepts. The infamous DAO hack occurred in June 2016, leading to a contentious hard fork and the creation of Ethereum Classic. Amid this volatility and uncertainty, the whale made its initial purchase. The table below contrasts the market environment then and now: Factor 2016 Context 2025 Context ETH Price ~$90 ~$2,900 Network Status Post-DAO hack, emerging tech Mature Layer 1, Proof-of-Stake Regulatory Climate Largely undefined Evolving global frameworks Primary Use Case ICO platform, experimentation DeFi, NFTs, Institutional Finance Therefore, the whale’s initial investment was a high-risk bet on unproven technology. Holding through multiple market cycles—including the 2017/2018 boom and bust, the 2020-2021 DeFi summer, and the 2022 bear market—required extraordinary discipline. This context transforms the transaction from a simple trade into a case study in long-term crypto investment strategy. Expert Analysis on Whale Behavior and Market Impact Market analysts emphasize that large deposits to exchanges like Gemini do not automatically equate to an immediate sell-off. However, they typically increase the supply of assets available for sale on the platform. This action can exert localized selling pressure. Conversely, analysts from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode often note that such moves can also be precursors to over-the-counter (OTC) deals, collateralization for loans, or portfolio rebalancing. The choice of Gemini, a regulated U.S. exchange, may signal a preference for compliance and fiat currency conversion channels. Furthermore, the timing invites scrutiny. Was it triggered by a specific price level, a macroeconomic indicator, or personal financial planning? While the whale’s exact motives remain private, the move coincides with a period of relative consolidation for Ethereum following its transition to Proof-of-Stake. This has led some commentators to speculate about profit-taking after a multi-year cycle. Regardless of intent, the transaction provides a powerful data point for understanding the behavior of ultra-long-term holders, a cohort that often possesses the most significant supply. Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The awakening of a dormant whale after nearly a decade carries symbolic and practical weight for the entire market. Symbolically, it reinforces the “HODL” narrative that has permeated crypto culture, showcasing a real-world example of life-changing returns from early conviction. Practically, it highlights several key trends: Market Maturation: Early investors are now realizing profits, a normal phase in any asset class’s lifecycle. On-Chain Transparency: The entire history is publicly verifiable, demonstrating blockchain’s immutable ledger. Exchange Role: Regulated exchanges like Gemini serve as critical gateways between crypto wealth and the traditional financial system. Wealth Distribution: It underscores the vast wealth accumulation possible for early adopters, a topic of ongoing discussion in the community. Moreover, this event will likely be integrated into future analyses of Ethereum’s supply dynamics. Researchers track metrics like “ETH last active 5+ years” to gauge the potential selling pressure from ancient wallets. A single movement can shift these metrics, albeit slightly, offering a fresh snapshot of holder stamina. Conclusion The $248 million Ethereum deposit to Gemini by a dormant whale after nine years stands as a landmark event in cryptocurrency history. It encapsulates the journey of Ethereum from an experimental platform to a cornerstone of digital finance. This transaction provides a tangible, data-rich story of extreme patience and monumental reward. While its immediate effect on the ETH price may be nuanced, its impact on market narrative and investor psychology is profound. It serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative potential and inherent volatility within the blockchain asset class, as early believers begin to interact with a vastly matured ecosystem. The movement of such a significant, long-held stash will undoubtedly remain a key reference point for analysts and investors studying whale behavior and market cycles for years to come. FAQs Q1: What is a “dormant cryptocurrency whale”? A dormant cryptocurrency whale is a wallet address that holds a very large amount of a specific digital asset (enough to influence the market) and has shown no spending activity for a significantly long period, often several years. Q2: Does depositing ETH to an exchange like Gemini mean the whale is selling? Not necessarily. While depositing to an exchange is often a precursor to selling, it can also be for other purposes like using the funds as collateral for a loan, engaging in an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or moving assets between accounts. The deposit simply makes the assets available on the exchange’s platform. Q3: How was this transaction discovered and verified? Blockchain analytics firms like EmberCN, Chainalysis, and others use software to monitor the public ledgers of cryptocurrencies. They can track large transactions, identify wallet addresses linked to exchanges, and analyze the historical activity of those addresses to uncover stories like this one. Q4: What was the whale’s total profit? The reported $381 million profit applies specifically to the 85,000 ETH that was moved. The whale’s original purchase was for 135,000 ETH. The remaining 50,000 ETH, still held in the original wallet, represents an unrealized gain of approximately $140+ million based on the same cost basis. Q5: Why is the choice of Gemini exchange significant? Gemini is a regulated, New York-based cryptocurrency exchange known for its compliance-focused approach. A whale choosing Gemini could indicate a desire to operate within a clear regulatory framework, possibly to convert crypto to fiat currency (like USD) through approved channels or to access institutional-grade services.
