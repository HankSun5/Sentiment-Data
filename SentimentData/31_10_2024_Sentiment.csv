35358645,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650730,1730329211,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Celestia (TIA) Set For Major Breakout? Top OTC Exec Warns Of Supply Shock,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celestia-tia-major-breakout-otc-exec-supply-shock/,"In an analysis shared on X, Taran Sabharwal, CEO of Stix—a leading OTC trading platform specializing in liquidity solutions for private crypto transactions—provided insights into the upcoming unlock dynamics of the Celestia (TIA) token scheduled for October 31, 2024. His assessment suggests that the market may be underestimating the potential impact on TIA’s price action heading into November. Why Celestia (TIA) Could Be A Buy “TIA – an OTC story,” Sabharwal began. “We used on-chain data (via @celenium_io API) to judge exactly how the unlock dynamics may shape TIA’s PA going into Nov. The results are in the table above. We’ve summarized that a total of 92.3M TIA will be liquid post unlock, which would act as the upper bound of overall spot selling pressure.” Interestingly, this figure accounts for less than 50% of the total cliff unlocks, suggesting that the actual sell pressure may be only half of what the market has been anticipating. Sabharwal highlighted that the real increase in circulating supply compared to the current supply indicates a 41.8% dilution. Related Reading: Celestia (TIA) Leads Crypto Market With 16% Surge, Will It Hit $7 This Month? A significant factor in this dynamic is the activity of OTC buyers who acquired large amounts of the initial unlock and hedged on perpetual futures, causing open interest to surge in recent months. “We expect many of these shorts to continue winding down, partially negating the spot-selling pressure,” he explained. This unwinding could serve as a bullish signal for spot buyers due to the potential reset in funding rates. Sabharwal’s analysis included several key assumptions. OTC round buyers possess an 11 million TIA cliff unlock, included in the non-staked token category since these tokens originated from treasury wallets not tagged on the blockchain explorer. His team mapped a total of 292 vesting wallets but acknowledged some gaps, which were also included in the non-staked category. Reflecting on TIA’s OTC history on Stix, Sabharwal observed that Celestia has been one of the most actively traded assets in the OTC market this cycle. Early in the cycle, it offered an attractive opportunity for directional buyers, while sellers were eager to realize large unrealized profits without expecting an imminent bull market in Q3 2023. He continued: “In Q1 2024, the bull had matured and TIA rallied to $20+. OTC activity was minimal here as sellers didn’t want to take larger discounts (40+%) and buyers didn’t want to bid higher than the $8.5 ceiling. We saw almost no activity as sellers were ‘feeling’ rich and wanted to stay risk-on, despite having the opportunity to realize 100-800x on their investments.” Related Reading: Celestia Plans For 1 GB Blocks For Scaling: Why Are TIA Holders Worried? The dynamics shifted when TIA fell below $5. This was around the time when the Celestia Foundation started raising its OTC round of $100M at $3. “The vesting for buyers was the same as those of private investors—33% unlock on Oct 31 2024 (<2 months from the round) and a 12-month linear unlock,” Sabharwal noted. During the third and fourth quarters of 2024, aggressive OTC trading activity resumed, with sellers offloading various positions. Stix alone facilitated approximately $60 million in TIA volume since July, suggesting that total trading volume could exceed $80 million across all liquidity channels, assuming Stix holds a 75% market share in the OTC space. Summing up his analysis, Sabharwal concluded: “TLDR: Shorts will keep unwinding into the unlock and funding rates may reset to 0 or positive. People who missed the 9th October unstaking deadline may also have unstaked during October, causing further spot supply (ready to be sold) going into November. Either way, the supply shock is massive and it’s been the most broadcasted unlock of this cycle. That, coupled with suppressing OTC discounts, may create a lot of action for the coin.” Renowned crypto analyst Will Clemente also weighed in on the developments via X: “Great piece on $TIA OTC activity by Taran from Stix. TLDR: OTC discount to spot in the private market has compressed over the last year, showing growing demand into the unlock. Stix alone has done $60mm in TIA OTC volume since July.” Clemente added his perspective on the potential market impact: “I think this BTC price action has further slid the probability of Thursday’s TIA unlock being bearish towards ‘no’. 6 months of reaccumulation after 80% drawdown, ton of OTC volume, most widely telegraphed unlock in crypto history, 9 figs short, BTC nearing ATHs. Am long rn.” At press time, TIA traded at $5.00.

Although prices are moving within a tight range at spot rates, the uptrend remains. While there are pockets of weakness, at least seen earlier today, candlestick formation in the daily and weekly charts point to strength. Is Bitcoin Preparing For A 6X Surge To $462,000? In a post on X, one analyst thinks Bitcoin will not only break above its all-time high at $74,000 but can easily 6X to over $462,000 in the coming sessions. To support this outlook, the analyst said the coin is breaking out above key resistance levels, and Fibonacci extension levels mirror this shift in trend after the Q3 2024 plunge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Daily Close Above $76,000 To Confirm True Breakout: Analyst Based on the analyst’s assessment, historical price action shows that BTC peaks between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci extension levels. Technical analysts use this tool to project how fast prices will rally or drop based on a given range. If history guides and the Fibonacci extension levels remain valid, applying the same pattern to the current cycle could easily see Bitcoin soar to between $174,000 and $462,000. These two levels mark the extension levels’ lower and upper limits that define past cycles’ peak zone. As bullish as this forecast is, it should be known that the range anchoring any Fibonacci extension is subjective. For this reason, it will change depending on the analyst, meaning potential peaks will shift accordingly. Despite everything, the consensus is that Bitcoin could break and reach new all-time highs in Q4 2024. Taking to X, another analyst said Bitcoin is already within a bullish breakout formation, easing above a descending channel or bull flag. At the same time, prices are breaking above the resistance of a “cup and handle” pattern. Institutions Buying As BTC Recovers If bulls take over, pushing prices higher, the evolution would confirm gains of Q1 2024. Subsequently, it would mark the resumption of bulls, an encouraging development following the 30% drop from March highs.

Amid this wave of optimism, institutions are also pouring in, getting exposure via spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to SosoValue, there are massive inflows as institutions buy more shares on behalf of their clients. On October 29, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the United States bought $870 million worth of shares backed by BTC for their clients.

Leveraged Bets Suggest Big Moves Are Coming,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-bull-market-just-beginning-leveraged-bets-suggest-big-moves-are-coming/,"The recent surge in Bitcoin price appears to align with a shift in investor behavior, according to a CryptoQuant analyst known as ‘crypto sunmoon.’ In a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst observed that the current bull market is driven by leveraged bets, particularly in derivatives markets. This trend is noteworthy as it contrasts with past market cycles where increased deposits often accompanied BTC bull runs to spot exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility To Peak By November 8 As ‘Trump Trade’ Intensifies – Report Leveraged Bets’ Role in Bitcoin Price Growth Elaborating further on leverage bets involves using borrowed funds to multiply the size of an investment. For example, with 2x leverage, a trader can open a position twice as large as their capital. In Bitcoin futures trading, this approach can be profitable during upward price movements but also comes with risks. If the market shifts against their position, traders can face significant losses called liquidation. The analyst notes that the inflow of Bitcoin into derivatives exchanges signals increased confidence among investors, suggesting a belief in further price gains. This confidence can create a feedback loop, where rising prices encourage additional leveraged bets, further fueling the bull market. Bitcoin bull market begins with leveraged bets “The bull market will continue as #bitcoin continues to be deposited into futures exchanges for leveraged bets using derivatives, rather than into spot exchanges for selling.” – By @t0_god Link 👇https://t.co/1egL7L2YoO pic.twitter.com/uuQPEiSWtb — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 30, 2024 BTC Price Performance And Outlook With Bitcoin’s price showing an 8.2% increase over the past week, currently trading at $71,804, the role of leverage becomes increasingly relevant. Notably, BTC saw a slight retracement from its recent 24-hour high of $73,562 yet continues to maintain upward momentum. This steady price growth and leveraged inflows signal broader investor optimism toward Bitcoin’s future price potential. According to the analyst, as long as Bitcoin continues to flow into futures rather than spot exchanges, the bullish sentiment will likely remain strong. Notably, leveraged bets happen to be just one of the several metrics of Bitcoin, suggesting a potential continuity of the ongoing increase in price. So far, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio Oscillator (SSRO) has seen low levels not seen since 2022. The decrease of this metric into lower levels means more stablecoins are being converted to BTC, therefore suggesting increasing demand for the asset.

Meanwhile, the technical outlook isn’t left in one of the several metrics indicating more rally for BTC’s price. Earlier today, the renowned crypto analyst Ali highlighted that historically, BTC has increased to 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels. Should the asset follow the same pattern this time, Ali predicts BTC will surge to a price between $174,000 and $462,000. In past bull cycles, #Bitcoin has peaked between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels. Following a similar pattern, the next $BTC top could land between $174,000 and $462,000! pic.twitter.com/KUq51Tt57z — Ali (@ali_charts) October 30, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin analysis|bitcoin market|bitcoin price|bitcoin price prediction|btc|BTCUSDT|CyrptoQuant,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-10-31 01:30:58

Bitcoin Makes Fresh ATH Against Euro Bitcoin surpassed €68,000 ($73,561) on October 29, establishing a new ATH against the euro. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap reached this milestone on multiple crypto exchanges, including Binance. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Reach A New All-Time High? This Golden Cross Suggests So This marks the first time since March 2024 that BTC has set a new ATH against the euro. Although Bitcoin came very close to a new ATH in USD, it fell short by approximately $200, dropping from $73,620 to $71,805 at the time of writing. Notably, the discrepancy between BTC’s performance against the euro and the USD is due to changes in the dollar’s strength. On March 14, when BTC last reached its USD ATH of $73,737, the USD/EUR exchange rate was 0.9113. Currently, the rate is 0.9238, indicating a weakening euro against the dollar. One key factor behind the dollar’s renewed strength is the US Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates to bring inflation down to its target of 2%. Bitcoin has also achieved a new ATH against the Canadian Dollar (CAD), recording a price of just over CAD 102,000, or approximately USD 73,225. As expected, BTC has reached new ATHs against weaker and hyperinflated fiat currencies, including the Turkish Lira, Argentine Pesos, and Russian Ruble. BTC ATH Against USD Most Awaited Bitcoin’s impressive performance comes at a crucial time, with the approaching US presidential elections, the effects of BTC halving, and a surge in stablecoin demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $100,000 By February 2025? Analyst Explains Why While Bitcoin’s new ATH against the EUR is promising, the wider crypto market eagerly awaits a USD-denominated ATH, as most crypto trading on exchanges takes place in USD or USD-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Data shows that the BTC/EUR trading pair generates the most volume on exchanges such as Bitstamp ($39.8 million), Binance ($36.7 million), and WhiteBit ($26.7 million). However, these volumes are dwarfed by higher-volume trading pairs like BTC/Korean Won (KRW). BTC/KRW trading volumes reach as high as $400 million daily – almost ten times more than the most-traded BTC/EUR pair. Recent data indicates that, despite flirting with ATH levels, BTC traders are holding off on profit-taking around the $71,000 level, suggesting expectations of further price increases based on current momentum. Commenting on BTC’s trajectory, seasoned analyst Peter Brandt said that the leading digital asset requires a daily close above $76,000 to confirm a true breakout. At press time, BTC trades at $71,805, up 0.6% in the past 24 hours.
