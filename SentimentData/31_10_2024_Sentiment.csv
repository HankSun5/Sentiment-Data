35358645,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650730,1730329211,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Celestia (TIA) Set For Major Breakout? Top OTC Exec Warns Of Supply Shock,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celestia-tia-major-breakout-otc-exec-supply-shock/,"In an analysis shared on X, Taran Sabharwal, CEO of Stix—a leading OTC trading platform specializing in liquidity solutions for private crypto transactions—provided insights into the upcoming unlock dynamics of the Celestia (TIA) token scheduled for October 31, 2024. His assessment suggests that the market may be underestimating the potential impact on TIA’s price action heading into November. Why Celestia (TIA) Could Be A Buy “TIA – an OTC story,” Sabharwal began. “We used on-chain data (via @celenium_io API) to judge exactly how the unlock dynamics may shape TIA’s PA going into Nov. The results are in the table above. We’ve summarized that a total of 92.3M TIA will be liquid post unlock, which would act as the upper bound of overall spot selling pressure.” Interestingly, this figure accounts for less than 50% of the total cliff unlocks, suggesting that the actual sell pressure may be only half of what the market has been anticipating. Sabharwal highlighted that the real increase in circulating supply compared to the current supply indicates a 41.8% dilution. Related Reading: Celestia (TIA) Leads Crypto Market With 16% Surge, Will It Hit $7 This Month? A significant factor in this dynamic is the activity of OTC buyers who acquired large amounts of the initial unlock and hedged on perpetual futures, causing open interest to surge in recent months. “We expect many of these shorts to continue winding down, partially negating the spot-selling pressure,” he explained. This unwinding could serve as a bullish signal for spot buyers due to the potential reset in funding rates. Sabharwal’s analysis included several key assumptions. OTC round buyers possess an 11 million TIA cliff unlock, included in the non-staked token category since these tokens originated from treasury wallets not tagged on the blockchain explorer. His team mapped a total of 292 vesting wallets but acknowledged some gaps, which were also included in the non-staked category. Reflecting on TIA’s OTC history on Stix, Sabharwal observed that Celestia has been one of the most actively traded assets in the OTC market this cycle. Early in the cycle, it offered an attractive opportunity for directional buyers, while sellers were eager to realize large unrealized profits without expecting an imminent bull market in Q3 2023. He continued: “In Q1 2024, the bull had matured and TIA rallied to $20+. OTC activity was minimal here as sellers didn’t want to take larger discounts (40+%) and buyers didn’t want to bid higher than the $8.5 ceiling. We saw almost no activity as sellers were ‘feeling’ rich and wanted to stay risk-on, despite having the opportunity to realize 100-800x on their investments.” Related Reading: Celestia Plans For 1 GB Blocks For Scaling: Why Are TIA Holders Worried? The dynamics shifted when TIA fell below $5. This was around the time when the Celestia Foundation started raising its OTC round of $100M at $3. “The vesting for buyers was the same as those of private investors—33% unlock on Oct 31 2024 (<2 months from the round) and a 12-month linear unlock,” Sabharwal noted. During the third and fourth quarters of 2024, aggressive OTC trading activity resumed, with sellers offloading various positions. Stix alone facilitated approximately $60 million in TIA volume since July, suggesting that total trading volume could exceed $80 million across all liquidity channels, assuming Stix holds a 75% market share in the OTC space. Summing up his analysis, Sabharwal concluded: “TLDR: Shorts will keep unwinding into the unlock and funding rates may reset to 0 or positive. People who missed the 9th October unstaking deadline may also have unstaked during October, causing further spot supply (ready to be sold) going into November. Either way, the supply shock is massive and it’s been the most broadcasted unlock of this cycle. That, coupled with suppressing OTC discounts, may create a lot of action for the coin.” Renowned crypto analyst Will Clemente also weighed in on the developments via X: “Great piece on $TIA OTC activity by Taran from Stix. TLDR: OTC discount to spot in the private market has compressed over the last year, showing growing demand into the unlock. Stix alone has done $60mm in TIA OTC volume since July.” Clemente added his perspective on the potential market impact: “I think this BTC price action has further slid the probability of Thursday’s TIA unlock being bearish towards ‘no’. 6 months of reaccumulation after 80% drawdown, ton of OTC volume, most widely telegraphed unlock in crypto history, 9 figs short, BTC nearing ATHs. Am long rn.” At press time, TIA traded at $5.00.

Although prices are moving within a tight range at spot rates, the uptrend remains. While there are pockets of weakness, at least seen earlier today, candlestick formation in the daily and weekly charts point to strength. Is Bitcoin Preparing For A 6X Surge To $462,000? In a post on X, one analyst thinks Bitcoin will not only break above its all-time high at $74,000 but can easily 6X to over $462,000 in the coming sessions. To support this outlook, the analyst said the coin is breaking out above key resistance levels, and Fibonacci extension levels mirror this shift in trend after the Q3 2024 plunge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Daily Close Above $76,000 To Confirm True Breakout: Analyst Based on the analyst’s assessment, historical price action shows that BTC peaks between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci extension levels. Technical analysts use this tool to project how fast prices will rally or drop based on a given range. If history guides and the Fibonacci extension levels remain valid, applying the same pattern to the current cycle could easily see Bitcoin soar to between $174,000 and $462,000. These two levels mark the extension levels’ lower and upper limits that define past cycles’ peak zone. As bullish as this forecast is, it should be known that the range anchoring any Fibonacci extension is subjective. For this reason, it will change depending on the analyst, meaning potential peaks will shift accordingly. Despite everything, the consensus is that Bitcoin could break and reach new all-time highs in Q4 2024. Taking to X, another analyst said Bitcoin is already within a bullish breakout formation, easing above a descending channel or bull flag. At the same time, prices are breaking above the resistance of a “cup and handle” pattern. Institutions Buying As BTC Recovers If bulls take over, pushing prices higher, the evolution would confirm gains of Q1 2024. Subsequently, it would mark the resumption of bulls, an encouraging development following the 30% drop from March highs.

Amid this wave of optimism, institutions are also pouring in, getting exposure via spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to SosoValue, there are massive inflows as institutions buy more shares on behalf of their clients. On October 29, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the United States bought $870 million worth of shares backed by BTC for their clients.

Leveraged Bets Suggest Big Moves Are Coming,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-bull-market-just-beginning-leveraged-bets-suggest-big-moves-are-coming/,"The recent surge in Bitcoin price appears to align with a shift in investor behavior, according to a CryptoQuant analyst known as ‘crypto sunmoon.’ In a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst observed that the current bull market is driven by leveraged bets, particularly in derivatives markets. This trend is noteworthy as it contrasts with past market cycles where increased deposits often accompanied BTC bull runs to spot exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility To Peak By November 8 As ‘Trump Trade’ Intensifies – Report Leveraged Bets’ Role in Bitcoin Price Growth Elaborating further on leverage bets involves using borrowed funds to multiply the size of an investment. For example, with 2x leverage, a trader can open a position twice as large as their capital. In Bitcoin futures trading, this approach can be profitable during upward price movements but also comes with risks. If the market shifts against their position, traders can face significant losses called liquidation. The analyst notes that the inflow of Bitcoin into derivatives exchanges signals increased confidence among investors, suggesting a belief in further price gains. This confidence can create a feedback loop, where rising prices encourage additional leveraged bets, further fueling the bull market. Bitcoin bull market begins with leveraged bets “The bull market will continue as #bitcoin continues to be deposited into futures exchanges for leveraged bets using derivatives, rather than into spot exchanges for selling.” – By @t0_god Link 👇https://t.co/1egL7L2YoO pic.twitter.com/uuQPEiSWtb — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 30, 2024 BTC Price Performance And Outlook With Bitcoin’s price showing an 8.2% increase over the past week, currently trading at $71,804, the role of leverage becomes increasingly relevant. Notably, BTC saw a slight retracement from its recent 24-hour high of $73,562 yet continues to maintain upward momentum. This steady price growth and leveraged inflows signal broader investor optimism toward Bitcoin’s future price potential. According to the analyst, as long as Bitcoin continues to flow into futures rather than spot exchanges, the bullish sentiment will likely remain strong. Notably, leveraged bets happen to be just one of the several metrics of Bitcoin, suggesting a potential continuity of the ongoing increase in price. So far, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio Oscillator (SSRO) has seen low levels not seen since 2022. The decrease of this metric into lower levels means more stablecoins are being converted to BTC, therefore suggesting increasing demand for the asset.

Meanwhile, the technical outlook isn’t left in one of the several metrics indicating more rally for BTC’s price. Earlier today, the renowned crypto analyst Ali highlighted that historically, BTC has increased to 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels. Should the asset follow the same pattern this time, Ali predicts BTC will surge to a price between $174,000 and $462,000. In past bull cycles, #Bitcoin has peaked between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels. Following a similar pattern, the next $BTC top could land between $174,000 and $462,000! pic.twitter.com/KUq51Tt57z — Ali (@ali_charts) October 30, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin analysis|bitcoin market|bitcoin price|bitcoin price prediction|btc|BTCUSDT|CyrptoQuant,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-10-31 01:30:58

Bitcoin Makes Fresh ATH Against Euro Bitcoin surpassed €68,000 ($73,561) on October 29, establishing a new ATH against the euro. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap reached this milestone on multiple crypto exchanges, including Binance. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Reach A New All-Time High? This Golden Cross Suggests So This marks the first time since March 2024 that BTC has set a new ATH against the euro. Although Bitcoin came very close to a new ATH in USD, it fell short by approximately $200, dropping from $73,620 to $71,805 at the time of writing. Notably, the discrepancy between BTC’s performance against the euro and the USD is due to changes in the dollar’s strength. On March 14, when BTC last reached its USD ATH of $73,737, the USD/EUR exchange rate was 0.9113. Currently, the rate is 0.9238, indicating a weakening euro against the dollar. One key factor behind the dollar’s renewed strength is the US Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates to bring inflation down to its target of 2%. Bitcoin has also achieved a new ATH against the Canadian Dollar (CAD), recording a price of just over CAD 102,000, or approximately USD 73,225. As expected, BTC has reached new ATHs against weaker and hyperinflated fiat currencies, including the Turkish Lira, Argentine Pesos, and Russian Ruble. BTC ATH Against USD Most Awaited Bitcoin’s impressive performance comes at a crucial time, with the approaching US presidential elections, the effects of BTC halving, and a surge in stablecoin demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $100,000 By February 2025? Analyst Explains Why While Bitcoin’s new ATH against the EUR is promising, the wider crypto market eagerly awaits a USD-denominated ATH, as most crypto trading on exchanges takes place in USD or USD-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Data shows that the BTC/EUR trading pair generates the most volume on exchanges such as Bitstamp ($39.8 million), Binance ($36.7 million), and WhiteBit ($26.7 million). However, these volumes are dwarfed by higher-volume trading pairs like BTC/Korean Won (KRW). BTC/KRW trading volumes reach as high as $400 million daily – almost ten times more than the most-traded BTC/EUR pair. Recent data indicates that, despite flirting with ATH levels, BTC traders are holding off on profit-taking around the $71,000 level, suggesting expectations of further price increases based on current momentum. Commenting on BTC’s trajectory, seasoned analyst Peter Brandt said that the leading digital asset requires a daily close above $76,000 to confirm a true breakout. At press time, BTC trades at $71,805, up 0.6% in the past 24 hours.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $78,000 resistance level. Any more gains might call for a test of $80,000. Are Dips Supported In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $73,000 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $71,650 level. The first major support is near the $69,500 level, the trend line, and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $65,530 swing low to the $73,574 high.

ETH is consolidating gains and might aim for a move above the $2,720 resistance. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,650 zone. The price is trading above $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $2,650 and $2,720 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price formed a base above the $2,550 level and started a fresh increase like Bitcoin. ETH climbed above the $2,600 and $2,620 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The price even broke the $2,650 resistance. A high is formed at $2,719 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $2,680 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,489 swing low to the $2,719 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,700 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,720. A clear move above the $2,720 resistance might send the price toward the $2,880 resistance. An upside break above the $2,880 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,600 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,489 swing low to the $2,719 high. The first major support sits near the $2,540 zone. A clear move below the $2,540 support might push the price toward $2,500. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,450 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

This surge in investment comes as the largest cryptocurrency inches closer to its all-time high of $73,700, originally reached in March. This comes as investor sentiment appears to be buoyed by speculation surrounding a potential victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump over VP Kamala Harris, which many believe could foster a more positive environment for the digital asset ecosystem, ultimately favoring crypto prices. Bitcoin ETFs Inflows And Price Rally According to Bloomberg data, Tuesday’s subscriptions pushed the year-to-date inflows for the group of 12 Bitcoin ETFs to over $23 billion. Analysts attribute the growing demand for Bitcoin exposure to Trump’s elevated odds in election betting markets. However, while Trump leads in prediction markets, polls show a tight race against Vice President Harris, who has pledged to support a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Still, Trump’s approach seems to have resonated more with the community. Related Reading: Solana Memecoin Market Thrives: POPCAT Reaches New Record Price Of $1.75 Adding to the speculation, Bitcoin options markets reflect a one-third chance of a price swing exceeding 10% on election day, November 5, as indicated by Nick Forster, founder of the crypto trading platform Derive.xyz. This surge would take the Bitcoin price to a new all-time high of $72,900 in the potential scenario where BTC consolidates above $72,000 for the next few days ahead of the election. Forster believes such volatility often encourages traders to position themselves for potential market movements, increasing demand for Bitcoin ETFs and contributing to the current price rally since the beginning of the week. Expert Warns Of Potential Selloff ETF expert Eric Balchunas has also commented on the bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that these funds are on track to reach 1 million BTC in holdings as early as today. In a recent social media post, Balchunas reported that US spot ETFs could surpass 1 million BTC by next Wednesday, potentially surpassing the holdings of Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, by mid-December, with the funds adding approximately 17,000 BTC each week. However, following Tuesday’s performance, Balchunas remarked, “We’re going to need to move up our predictions,” highlighting that Bitcoin ETFs had gobbled up over 12,000 coins in a single day, now holding 996,000 BTC. The expert expressed optimism about the likelihood of breaching the 1 million mark today, stating that the “extraordinary” trading volume from the previous day is likely to translate into significant inflows.

Balchunas also cautioned that market conditions can be unpredictable. “Anything can happen,” he warned, referencing the risk of a sudden selloff that could delay reaching the 1 million BTC milestone. Conversely, if Bitcoin prices continue to rise and a Trump victory boosts market enthusiasm, a fear of missing out (FOMO) could drive even more rapid accumulation, according to the expert’s analysis. When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $72,360, up over 8% in the 7-day time frame.

This indicator tracks the number of unique addresses engaging with the Bitcoin network, providing insights into the network’s overall activity, investor involvement, and possible market directions. Related Reading: Stablecoins Signal Strong Bitcoin Demand: Could BTC Renew Its ATH Soon? Golden Cross On Bitcoin Active Addresses According to Dent’s analysis, applying a monthly and annual moving average to this number of active addresses metric could indicate a shift toward bullish momentum. A high number of active addresses generally suggests strong participation, while fewer addresses may indicate reduced interest. Dent noted that when the 30-day moving average of active addresses crosses above the 365-day moving average—a phenomenon known as a “golden cross”—it often correlates with upward price momentum in the Bitcoin market. This alignment between short-term and long-term trends can suggest renewed interest among both retail and institutional investors, which could potentially sustain or even increase Bitcoin’s value. Furthermore, the concept of the golden cross in active addresses is significant in light of previous market cycles, Dent pointed out. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the last notable shift in Bitcoin’s active addresses occurred post all-time high (ATH) levels, leading to what is called a “dead cross,” where the short-term average fell below the long-term average. This pattern typically signals bearish sentiment or market stagnation. However, the current reversion to a golden cross shows a different scenario. Transaction volumes are almost double what they were during Bitcoin’s 2021 price cycle, a favourable sign of increased market engagement and potential upward momentum. The analyst concluded that a weaker or inconclusive golden cross could lead to a repeat of mid-2021 trends, where price gains faced strong resistance without maintaining upward movement. BTC On Track For $100k Rally? In the past weeks, Bitcoin has seen quite a noticeable rebound in price, reclaiming price levels it once faced resistance in. So far, the asset has recorded double digit gains in the slightly higher time frames suggesting that a positive momentum has begun. Particualry, in the past 30 days, BTC has increased by 13% and nearly 10% in the past 7 days. This increase has brought the asset price to currently trade above $72,000 as of today. This price zone not only equals 2.3% decrease from its ATH registered in March 2024 but also marks a vital level that makes the increase above $100,000 more likely.

Some suggested that the second-largest cryptocurrency will soon break from the next resistance level and reclaim the $3,000 mark. Related Reading: Neiro Breaks Above Key Level Following 10% Weekly Drop, Is $0.0020 Next? Ethereum Retests $2,700 Ethereum surged above a key resistance level on Wednesday morning as most of the crypto market soared. The cryptocurrency rallied 3.1% toward the $2,700 horizontal level, hitting the $2,722 mark before retracing to $2,710. Over the past week, ETH hovered between the $2,430-$2,650 range after failing to hold its support. This performance worried many investors and market watchers, who have heavily criticized the crypto’s price action throughout the year. However, today’s jump represents a 5.6% increase in the weekly timeframe, which sparked a bullish sentiment among the community. Crypto trader CRG noted that Ethereum is testing a support level in its trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC) in a higher timeframe (HTF). Per the chart, ETH/BTC is retesting an HTF support at the 0.0377 level. The 0.023-0.040 zone was a crucial area between 2020 and 2021, with ETH’s all-time high rally starting after breaking above the upper line of this range. The trader suggested that Ethereum’s surge would be short-lived as the “King of Altcoins” has had a “disappointing” performance despite the spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval. “ETH is like the toxic ex-gf that keeps you going back,” he jokingly stated. Similarly, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe remarked that it’s time to be bullish on ETH, suggesting that there’s a “massive bullish divergence” in the one-day timeframe of the ETH/BTC chart, while it was “popping up” in the three-day timeframe. Van de Poppe pointed out that the 0.051 area is the crucial zone for a trend reversal. ETH To Hit $3,000 In Two Weeks? Various crypto analysts have set the $2,800 resistance level as the next crucial zone if Ethereum successfully reclaims the $2,700 mark. Analyst Crypto Yapper pointed out that ETH has registered five consecutive green daily candles since bouncing from last week’s lows. To the analyst, if ETH breaks above the $2,800 horizontal level, the cryptocurrency will rally toward the $3,000 resistance level and potentially kickstart the altcoin season. Similarly, van de Poppe suggested that Ethereum will break above the crucial horizontal level in the next two weeks, as it took the liquidity at the $2,450 level and “ran back up to resistance.” According to the analyst, this could propel ETH’s price to $3,000 in November.

As of this writing, the cryptocurrency trades at $2,693, a 1.4% and 3.3% increase in the daily and monthly timeframes. Nonetheless, it’s worth noting that the crypto market might continue facing high volatility over the next few days as speculation increases ahead of the US presidential elections.

The company lost 54 cents per share in the quarter. From both net income and earnings per share standpoints, this was Riot's worst quarter since 'crypto winter.' Riot's energy curtailment strategy lacks consistency and SG&A is enormous relative to industry peers. When I last covered Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) for Seeking Alpha, I was actively holding the company's stock as a trade idea. The thesis behind that trade wasn't technical in nature, but there was a shelf-life on the viability of the thesis. My argument back in June was that Riot could benefit from a hot Texas summer: Between now and likely the end of September, Riot should be able to benefit from power credit optionality. If it's hot and Bitcoin's price returns are lackluster, Riot can instead go the energy route for monetizing power. This is not something that every public miner is able to do, so it gives Riot Platforms an advantage in the event Bitcoin's summer month price languishes. At that time of that publication of that article, the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was topping out before a multi-week selloff that took the coin from $72k down to $53.5k by early-July. Data by YCharts As fate would have, the price of BTC is right back where it was in early June. The BTC pricing angle to my power credit thesis generally held up. The other half of my thesis did not. In this article, we'll look at Riot's Q3 earnings and assess whether RIOT is still a good trade with BTC now breaking out of multi-month resistance. Riot's Q3 Results For quarter ended September 2024, Riot Platforms reported top line revenue of $84.8 million. This was a year over year increase of 63% and a sequential increase of 21%. 80% of that headline number came from Bitcoin mining with the rest coming from 'engineering' and 'other.' Importantly, Riot didn't sell any BTC during the quarter. Q3 Investor Deck, Slide 8 (Riot Platforms) Despite the block reward halving back in April, the company managed to mine 1,104 BTC. This was almost an identical number of Bitcoin compared with the 1,106 mined during the same period from the prior year. However, that post-halving BTC production has come at a considerably higher 'all-in cost' when adjusting for the company's growth in installed exahash capacity. Riot has simply made up for declines in gross margin by scaling mining capacity up over 28 EH/s. Notably, quarter ending hash rate capacity is more than double the 10.9 EH/s figure from the end of Q3-23. I think this really highlights the problem with long term reliance on the block reward subsidy as the primary incentive for transaction validation. The company's self-reported cost to mine one Bitcoin including both power costs and hardware depreciation was $75.5k per coin during the quarter - nearly three times the figure from a year ago. And this doesn't even factor in other opex costs. Q3-24 Earnings Deck, Slide 9 (Riot Platforms) SG&A came in at $66.9 million. For the full quarter, the company reported a net loss of $154.4 million and a loss of 54 cents per share. From both net income and earnings per share standpoints, this was Riot's worst quarter since 'crypto winter' even though Bitcoin spent most of the quarter between $58-65k per coin. Power Credits What has saved Riot's bottom line in the past is the curtailment strategy that the company was able to execute during much of 2023. Riot's curtailment strategy paid off so well last year, that the company actually reported a negative net power cost for the three months ended September: Q3-24 Earnings Deck, Slide 18 (Riot Platforms) The company never sniffed curtailment credits to that degree this time around. Compared with 2023, the relative lack of energy and demand response credits during the Texas summer months has resulted in much less of an impact on the company's net power cost. In the chart below, we can get a good visual sense for how the company's power credit segment performed relative to last year and compared with BTC sales: Monthly Revenue Breakout (Bitfarms, Author's Chart) What complicates things for Riot now financially is the company's pivot from selling part of its BTC production to a 100% HODL approach. When combining BTC sales, power credits, and DR: 70% of Riot's monthly monetary production came from BTC sales in 2023. That is no longer the case. So long as Riot is HODLing mined BTC and generating very little in the way of DR/Energy credits, I don't see how the company can sustain a positive net income under this current strategy without significantly higher BTC prices. But even that doesn't address the long term asset volatility problem. Consider that mined BTC that isn't sold is an unrealized gain rather than an actual sale of goods. If we're simply leaving the company's quarterly results to FASB accounting adjustments, I don't see much of a reason to long RIOT over simply buying a spot ETF. The latter is certainly a lot less expensive to shareholders. Bitfarms Fiasco Something that I believe has weighed on RIOT's stock price is the failed hostile takeover of mining peer Bitfarms ( BITF ). The result of Riot's attempted takeover is a temporary truce between the two companies. As part of this agreement, Riot and Bitfarms will table merger talks through Bitfarms' 2026 annual meeting. Thus, Riot is now the largest holder of BITF stock without a clear path toward full ownership of the company at this point in time. Bitfarms: Top 5 Holders Shares Held or Principal Amt Market Value RIOT PLATFORMS, INC. 90,110,912 $184,727,370 Invesco Ltd. 19,712,032 $50,659,922 TIDAL INVESTMENTS LLC 6,617,428 $17,006,789 VAN ECK ASSOCIATES CORP 6,075,744 $11,969,000 STATE STREET CORP 4,853,813 $12,474,299 Source: Whale Wisdom Riot's Bitfarms position represents 19.9% of outstanding BITF common shares and is about four times the daily trading volume for the month of October. This means that even if Riot wanted to unwind its BITF position, it is unlikely to be able to do so without having a fairly significant impact on the share price. One could argue this makes Riot sort of a captive holder of BITF shares. For full disclosure, I actually happen to like BITF as a trade at the moment so I don't think immediate share price declines in BITF will be an immediate risk to RIOT for the time being. But I do think longer term the BITF shares take away balance sheet optionality from Riot management. Closing Summary I've maintained for quite some time through my previous Seeking Alpha work that I don't think Bitcoin miners are great long term investments without a meaningful rise in transaction fees on the primary blockchain layer. That being said, I think there are some miners that are better suited for speculative wagers than others. Yet, I'm struggling to see the bull case for RIOT relative to other opportunities. Perhaps the best thing RIOT has going for it is balance sheet strength with a large cash position and no debt. But the company now seems pot-committed to holding Bitfarms stock, which is eating up a considerable portion of Riot's capital. From an operational standpoint, Riot Platforms isn't historically the most efficient miner measured by BTC per EH/s. The energy/DR credit strategy doesn't seem to be a reliable way to mitigate energy costs. Riot Platforms has the highest SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue of any mining company with a top ten market cap - and by a wide margin. And for that expense, investors are getting a Bitcoin HODL play and 20% of Bitfarms. At this point, I think there are better opportunities elsewhere in both the industry and in the broad market overall.",BTC-USD|RIOT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MINING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-31 12:00:00

Interestingly, the analyst is confident that Bitcoin will eventually reach this ambitious quarter-million-dollar target. However, they caution that once profits are taken at this top, Bitcoin could decline significantly to new lows. Bitcoin Price Projected To Crash 98% On October 30, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen told his 106,700 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that the Bitcoin price could drop to the $24,000 range once it hits $250,000. Lagen revealed that many investors have felt overly confident that Bitcoin could never experience a 98% crash again, especially with the introduction of Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline Countering this overconfidence, the crypto analyst asserted that ETF assets tend to lose significant value during periods of economic recession. Consequently the analyst predicts that the Bitcoin price could first experience a “blowoff” of up to $250,000, marking a historical milestone. At this point, many investors would start taking profits, triggering massive selling pressure as they liquidate ahead of potential price declines. Following Lagen’s analysis, once the market sentiment for the Bitcoin price shifts, institutional investors, who may have been the prime drivers for the $250,000 rally, are likely to sell off their holdings. Lagen has described this massive sell-off as the “shake out of the century,” when the Bitcoin price could plummet dramatically to 98% of its high. This suggests that after hitting $250,000, the BTC price could crash to $2,000, trading below Ethereum’s current price, which is trading at $2,635, according to CoinMarketCap. Highlighting the reasoning behind this unexpected bearish price crash, Lagen revealed that by plotting the Bitcoin price on the “Syslog scale,” it clearly shows a High-Time Frame (HTF) rising wedge, which points at a price target between $1,000 and $10,000. He also disclosed in a much earlier post that if Bitcoin does experience his projected shakeout and price decline to $1,000, it will take four halving events before the cryptocurrency can return to its $200,000 price high. BTC To Break Above $73,000 And Rally Higher As of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at $72,433 after experiencing more than a 7.8% increase this week. Lagen has stated that the Bitcoin price action points to a possible “triangle bearish continuation pattern,” which typically signals a potential downward trend in a cryptocurrency. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Solana? Analyst Predicts 77% Price Crash To $40 The crypto analyst has set a new target of $71,200 for Bitcoin, suggesting that if the cryptocurrency follows through with the triangle bearish continuation pattern, its price could decline significantly. On the flip side, Lagen has predicted that if Bitcoin can break the $73,000 threshold, it would invalidate the triangle bearish continuation pattern. This could indicate the end of the downtrend and potentially lead to a stronger upward momentum.

MicroStrategy's leveraged BTC strategy and ongoing debt refinancing pose significant risks, with the firm generating a massive operating loss relative to revenue. Despite outperforming BTC, MSTR's valuation is driven by speculative euphoria, potentially reaching its pre-DOTCOM bubble high amidst a declining Federal Funds Rate. MicroStrategy reported earnings after market close on October 30, 2024, with 2x downward analyst revisions and no upward revisions in the last 90 days. MicroStrategy has been active in the debt market throughout q3’24, redeeming its senior secured 2028 notes through the issuance of $1.01b in 2028 convertible notes with part of the proceeds being allocated to acquiring additional BTC. Given the major run-up in share price and challenging business operational performance, I am reiterating my STRONG SELL rating with a price target of $102.63/share at 1.107x price/BTC. Be sure to review my previous coverage of MSTR here: MicroStrategy Holds Less Bitcoins Than You Think (Q2 Earnings Preview) During q3’24, MicroStrategy issued $800mm in 2.25% 2032 convertible notes and added 25,889 BTC to the company’s holdings. Total BTC holdings at the end of q3’24 sat at 252,220 BTC. The firm also had $650mm of 2025 convertible notes settle all conversion requests in shares. MicroStrategy also raised $1.1b through equity sales in q3’24. Since reporting q2’24 earnings, MicroStrategy has made a few updates to its debt levels. On September 16, 2024, MicroStrategy paid down $500mm of 6.125% 2028 senior secured notes and issued $1.01b in 0.625% 2028 senior convertible notes on September 20, 2024. The convertible notes were issued to pay down the 2028 secured notes as well as to purchase additional BTC. Paying down the secured notes resulted in 69,080 BTC being held as collateral to be released, potentially allowing for MicroStrategy to migrate these BTC to MacroStrategy. The conversion rate on the 2028 notes is set at 5.4589 shares, pricing these shares at $183.19. One of the factors Michael Saylor is bringing to the table is MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Yield factor, which is essentially the difference in share distribution and BTC value. The example used was a 250bps expense ratio for BTC ETFs, which appears to be quite a high comparison considering that iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) costs holders 12bps. Regardless, management believes that the rate of share dilution will be outweighed by the growth in value of the company’s BTC holdings. YTD, the firm’s BTC yield sits at 12.2%, above the previous two years. Looking out to eFY27, management is targeting a BTC yield in the range of 4-8%. Corporate Reports Aside from the additional reporting strategy, MicroStrategy will continue its capital raises in the debt and equity markets. Management laid out their capital raising target for the coming years in their q3’24 earnings report. This will include $21b in equity issuances and $21b in debt over the next few years. Management is targeting $10b in eFY25, $14b in eFY26, and $18b in efY27. Given that MicroStrategy generated an adjusted operating loss of -$802mm as of q3’24 on a trailing twelve-month basis, the firm will likely remain in a cycle of debt refinancing debt. Given that digital assets are not held as a cash & equivalent position and rather a long-term investment, MicroStrategy has $4,264mm in total debt on the balance sheet. Essentially, MicroStrategy is acting as a leveraged BTC strategy on the back of an operating company that generates a massive loss relative to revenue. Corporate Reports Accordingly, the BTC yield targeted will be dependent on the price and accumulation of BTC. As of October 29, 2024, BTC holds a value of ~$73,315, leading MicroStrategy’s total BTC holdings to be valued at $18.5b. TradingView Comparing the performance of MSTR shares to BTC, MSTR has significantly outperformed the underlying asset. This is primarily due to MicroStrategy’s leveraged BTC strategy that enables the firm to issue debt to accumulate BTC. TradingView Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports As of q3’24, the breakeven price is $36,800/BTC, well below the present level of $73,315/BTC. Using the current price of BTC, MSTR’s valuation sits at 2.71x price to value of its BTC holdings. Using the firm’s capital structure as a guide, I value MSTR shares at 1.107x BTC at $102.63/share. I am reiterating my STRONG SELL rating for MSTR shares. Corporate Reports Though share price independently isn’t a material metric outside of observation, shares are driving towards their pre-DOTCOM bubble high of $333/share, adjusted for stock splits. The driving factor is that BTC may continue its upward trajectory as buy-and-hold strategies continue paired with the possibility of a declining Federal Funds Rate. Perhaps this may also indicate that MSTR is reaching peak euphoria amongst its shareholders.

This bullish sentiment is evident in recent trading activities on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where Bitcoin options have experienced some of their highest trading volumes ahead of the US presidential election. Bitcoin To Rise Above $79,300? Joshua Lim, co-founder of Arbelos Markets—a trading firm providing liquidity across cryptocurrency derivatives markets—shared insights on X about these notable trades. “CME Bitcoin options just experienced some of its largest volume days ever, ahead of the US election,” Lim stated. He highlighted two substantial transactions that occurred in the past week. On Friday the 25th, traders purchased 1,875 Bitcoin units of the 29-November $70,000 strike calls. In options trading, a call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an asset at a specified strike price before the option expires. In this case, the strike price is $70,000, meaning the buyers are betting that Bitcoin will exceed this price by the end of November. Lim detailed that at the time of the trade, “$8.3 million of premium was paid, $147,000 of vega, $65 million of delta.” Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hit $200,000 Only If The Dollar Falls? Bitwise CIO Answers Then, on Tuesday the 29th, another significant trade occurred with the purchase of 3,050 Bitcoin units of the 29-November $85,000 strike calls, where the strike price is $85,000. Lim noted that “$4.6 million of premium was paid, $173,000 of vega, $42 million of delta” at the time of the trade. The amounts of $8.3 million and $4.6 million indicate substantial investment, reflecting strong confidence in Bitcoin’s potential rise. The high vega suggests that the traders expect significant volatility, which could be massive around the US election. Delta represents how much the option’s price is expected to change with a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset. High delta values of $65 million and $42 million imply substantial exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. The total notional value of these positions—the total value of the underlying assets represented by the options—is approximately $350 million. Lim pointed out that this is “large even in the context of Deribit,” referring to the world’s largest crypto options exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility To Peak By November 8 As ‘Trump Trade’ Intensifies – Report The breakeven point for these positions is just below $79,300. This means that for the traders to start making a profit, Bitcoin’s price needs to exceed this level by the option’s expiry date. This price represents about a 16% increase from Bitcoin’s price when these trades were executed. “Very bullish positioning into the election, and great to see institutions sizing up like this on CME,” Lim commented. He added, “Perhaps a good sign that there is and will be growing liquidity in the crypto derivatives markets as the asset class matures.” The timing of these trades is particularly noteworthy. With the US presidential election imminent, market volatility is expected to increase, potentially impacting the entire Bitcoin and crypto market. Overall, the majority of experts believe that a Trump victory is bullish for the BTC price. At press time, BTC traded at $72,382.

In its third-quarter filing ending September 30th, 2024, the company disclosed its revenues were up by 165%, and its overall year-to-date (YTD) net deposits increased to $34 million. Related Reading: Tether’s $1 Billion USDT Mint On Tron: What’s Fueling The Demand Surge? It’s a promising development for Robinhood Markets this quarter after facing plenty of challenges in the past. The company took a hit in early 2021 after it decided to restrict trading in GameStop and other meme stocks during a market frenzy. In a separate statement, Robinhood shared that it’s inching closer to a settlement with investors and traders. Q3 Filing Is Company’s Second-Best Revenue Despite its challenging backstory and the SEC’s regulatory pressures, Robinhood Markets found its rhythm to post a solid third-quarter performance. The company shared that its net deposits grew to $34 billion, and revenue increased 36% yearly to $367 million, with its cryptocurrency unit leading the surge. In its filing, Robinhood stated that its cryptocurrency revenue increased to $61 million over the quarter or 165%. Market observers expected this growth after the company completed its takeover of Bitstamp, thus pushing its trading volume. Robinhood Surprises With Impressive Growth Robinhood’s growth story impressed many market observers and analysts, given its recent experience with FTX, the ‘meme frenzy,’ and run-ins with the SEC. Last year, the company bought back its shares from Alameda Research for $605 million. At the time of the transaction, many observers expected that Robinhood would avoid cryptocurrency investments. However, the company surprised analysts by making crypto a critical investment through its Robinhood Crypto unit. For its Q3 filing, Robinhood’s Asset Under Custody (AUC) surged by 76% year-over-year to more than $152 billion. The firm reported that its holdings increased due to higher equity, better crypto valuation, and sustained deposits. The company has a portfolio heavy on Bitcoin, and the recent rise in the top crypto bodes well for the firm, which will continue to earn as long as the trend remains bullish for BTC.

As mentioned, the company was embroiled in a trading scandal in early 2021 over the hype on GameStop and meme stocks. Last May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells Notice to the company. The agency argued that some of Robinhood’s cryptocurrency services violate securities laws. Interestingly, the SEC has not filed a case against the company. In the meantime, Robinhood Markets is business as usual. Based on reports, Robinhood has listed several tokens and allowed transfers for assets like SOL. However, access to the service is limited to EU customers.

Besides boasting of high throughput and low fees while protecting traders from maximal extractive value (MEV) bots, the platform has been striking key partnerships. Injective Integrates With Fetch.ai And ASI This week, the proposal by Fetch.ai and the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) community to integrate Injective was passed synonymously. The proposal passed with 100% of the votes agreeing with the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: Analyst Says Expect 98% Crash After Blow Off To $250,000, Here’s Why Looking at voting data, over 324 million FET voted to endorse the idea, with only 656 FET rejecting it. No one voted to abstain or veto. Voting started on October 23 and ended five days later on October 28. According to the proposal, the goal is to revive the expired IBC client for Injective under “Revive expired IBC client for Injective.” In this way, Fetch.ai, now part of the ASI Alliance, can harness the power of AI within the sprawling Injective DeFi ecosystem. This arrangement will allow Fech.ai, an AI-centric platform, to directly plug its machine learning and AI capabilities into the Injective platform. Out of this, users will benefit from streamlined and leveraged AI-enabled tools when trading. The team also said they would benefit from improved liquidity management and asset allocation. Even with this deal, Injective and ASI will continue operating independently. The integration isn’t a merger but an Injective tapping into ASI’s AI capabilities. Why Is INJ Down? Bullish as this may be, INJ prices ticked lower, looking at the events in the daily chart. Injective bulls have yet to reverse losses posted on October 25 comprehensively. Accordingly, despite the series of higher highs over the weekend and in the first half of the week, sellers are in control. So far, INJ is down 20% from October highs and continues consolidating inside a $10 zone. Clear resistance is around $25, while support is at $15. If the bulls of Q1 2024 flow back, momentum will likely pick up once buyers break above the $25 level, preferably with increasing engagement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Near ATH – Volume Suggests A Big Move Ahead Besides improving crypto sentiment and rising total value locked (TVL) across DeFi, INJ could benefit from Injective’s core feature. The protocol has the highest revenue-to-fully diluted valuation (FDV) ratio, even better than Ethereum. The high metric translates to Injective boasting of an efficient revenue generation mechanism that could further boost prices.

Today, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market stands at $2.44 trillion, an increase of 1.61% from the previous day. Most of the digital assets are in the green zone meaning that their prices are rising and the outlook of the market is generally positive. Related Reading: Cardano To Soar 22X? Analyst Sees Opportunity Despite On-Chain Decline In this latest market frenzy, one storyline is attracting attention and some analysis: while Bitcoin is outperforming the rest and retesting $73,000, Ethereum is struggling to hit its target of $4,000. The diverging performances between the two top digital assets now serve as an interesting sub-plot to an exciting week ahead for the general cryptocurrency industry. Ethereum And Bitcoin- A Contrasting Story Of Market Run As the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, it’s natural for analysts and observers to take a second look at Ethereum and Bitcoin. While both digital assets have notched some gains, with Bitcoin rising by 1.90% and ETH by 2.59%, they still paint contradicting storylines. $ETH is moving according to plan but is underperforming BTC from the past few weeks. With the momentum gained, it is looking ready to head past the $2800 resistance zone and start a parabolic move towards my target of $4000. It’s time for ETH to outperform BTC. pic.twitter.com/4mK8DVMd2c — Crypto General 🦄 (@DaCryptoGeneral) October 29, 2024 As the top crypto, Bitcoin has led the recent market rally, surpassing the psychological $70,000 level and hitting $72,459.92. Last Tuesday, BTC tested the $73k level again, and analysts expect it will record another all-time high soon. In contrast, Ethereum’s run has been sluggish, falling short of expectations. While ETH joined other coins in a mini-rally this week, its current price of $2,687 is still far from the analysts’ target of $4,000. ETH’s Recent Run- What Analysts Are Saying The contrasting price runs and milestones for both top cryptos have attracted some attention. For most analysts, Bitcoin’s recent price performance validates its standing as the current top digital asset. Ethereum’s struggles to hit the elusive $4k have been criticized by some traders and analysts, with many stating that Solana is now “the next Ethereum.” ETH is not dying.#ETH / #BTC is doing what it always does. I think ETH/BTC bottoms this quarter and goes up in 2025. Once ETH/BTC passes the 50D SMA, the bottom is in IMO. Still a risk ETH/USD drops one more time in Nov/Dec but hedging makes sense pic.twitter.com/xAbg8Szi3N — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) October 30, 2024 However, a few analysts still defend Ethereum and expect the blockchain to rebound soon. Benjamin Cowen, the founder and CEO of ITC, took to Twitter/X to say that the Ethereum blockchain “is not dying.” In the same post, he shared that he expects ETH/BTC to bottom this quarter and will make a run next year.

While many are excited about Bitcoin’s next price move, some are paying attention to ETH.
