35358645,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650730,1730329211,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Celestia (TIA) Set For Major Breakout? Top OTC Exec Warns Of Supply Shock,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celestia-tia-major-breakout-otc-exec-supply-shock/,"In an analysis shared on X, Taran Sabharwal, CEO of Stix—a leading OTC trading platform specializing in liquidity solutions for private crypto transactions—provided insights into the upcoming unlock dynamics of the Celestia (TIA) token scheduled for October 31, 2024. His assessment suggests that the market may be underestimating the potential impact on TIA’s price action heading into November. Why Celestia (TIA) Could Be A Buy “TIA – an OTC story,” Sabharwal began. “We used on-chain data (via @celenium_io API) to judge exactly how the unlock dynamics may shape TIA’s PA going into Nov. The results are in the table above. We’ve summarized that a total of 92.3M TIA will be liquid post unlock, which would act as the upper bound of overall spot selling pressure.” Interestingly, this figure accounts for less than 50% of the total cliff unlocks, suggesting that the actual sell pressure may be only half of what the market has been anticipating. Sabharwal highlighted that the real increase in circulating supply compared to the current supply indicates a 41.8% dilution. Related Reading: Celestia (TIA) Leads Crypto Market With 16% Surge, Will It Hit $7 This Month? A significant factor in this dynamic is the activity of OTC buyers who acquired large amounts of the initial unlock and hedged on perpetual futures, causing open interest to surge in recent months. “We expect many of these shorts to continue winding down, partially negating the spot-selling pressure,” he explained. This unwinding could serve as a bullish signal for spot buyers due to the potential reset in funding rates. Sabharwal’s analysis included several key assumptions. OTC round buyers possess an 11 million TIA cliff unlock, included in the non-staked token category since these tokens originated from treasury wallets not tagged on the blockchain explorer. His team mapped a total of 292 vesting wallets but acknowledged some gaps, which were also included in the non-staked category. Reflecting on TIA’s OTC history on Stix, Sabharwal observed that Celestia has been one of the most actively traded assets in the OTC market this cycle. Early in the cycle, it offered an attractive opportunity for directional buyers, while sellers were eager to realize large unrealized profits without expecting an imminent bull market in Q3 2023. He continued: “In Q1 2024, the bull had matured and TIA rallied to $20+. OTC activity was minimal here as sellers didn’t want to take larger discounts (40+%) and buyers didn’t want to bid higher than the $8.5 ceiling. We saw almost no activity as sellers were ‘feeling’ rich and wanted to stay risk-on, despite having the opportunity to realize 100-800x on their investments.” Related Reading: Celestia Plans For 1 GB Blocks For Scaling: Why Are TIA Holders Worried? The dynamics shifted when TIA fell below $5. This was around the time when the Celestia Foundation started raising its OTC round of $100M at $3. “The vesting for buyers was the same as those of private investors—33% unlock on Oct 31 2024 (<2 months from the round) and a 12-month linear unlock,” Sabharwal noted. During the third and fourth quarters of 2024, aggressive OTC trading activity resumed, with sellers offloading various positions. Stix alone facilitated approximately $60 million in TIA volume since July, suggesting that total trading volume could exceed $80 million across all liquidity channels, assuming Stix holds a 75% market share in the OTC space. Summing up his analysis, Sabharwal concluded: “TLDR: Shorts will keep unwinding into the unlock and funding rates may reset to 0 or positive. People who missed the 9th October unstaking deadline may also have unstaked during October, causing further spot supply (ready to be sold) going into November. Either way, the supply shock is massive and it’s been the most broadcasted unlock of this cycle. That, coupled with suppressing OTC discounts, may create a lot of action for the coin.” Renowned crypto analyst Will Clemente also weighed in on the developments via X: “Great piece on $TIA OTC activity by Taran from Stix. TLDR: OTC discount to spot in the private market has compressed over the last year, showing growing demand into the unlock. Stix alone has done $60mm in TIA OTC volume since July.” Clemente added his perspective on the potential market impact: “I think this BTC price action has further slid the probability of Thursday’s TIA unlock being bearish towards ‘no’. 6 months of reaccumulation after 80% drawdown, ton of OTC volume, most widely telegraphed unlock in crypto history, 9 figs short, BTC nearing ATHs. Am long rn.” At press time, TIA traded at $5.00.

Although prices are moving within a tight range at spot rates, the uptrend remains. While there are pockets of weakness, at least seen earlier today, candlestick formation in the daily and weekly charts point to strength. Is Bitcoin Preparing For A 6X Surge To $462,000? In a post on X, one analyst thinks Bitcoin will not only break above its all-time high at $74,000 but can easily 6X to over $462,000 in the coming sessions. To support this outlook, the analyst said the coin is breaking out above key resistance levels, and Fibonacci extension levels mirror this shift in trend after the Q3 2024 plunge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Daily Close Above $76,000 To Confirm True Breakout: Analyst Based on the analyst’s assessment, historical price action shows that BTC peaks between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci extension levels. Technical analysts use this tool to project how fast prices will rally or drop based on a given range. If history guides and the Fibonacci extension levels remain valid, applying the same pattern to the current cycle could easily see Bitcoin soar to between $174,000 and $462,000. These two levels mark the extension levels’ lower and upper limits that define past cycles’ peak zone. As bullish as this forecast is, it should be known that the range anchoring any Fibonacci extension is subjective. For this reason, it will change depending on the analyst, meaning potential peaks will shift accordingly. Despite everything, the consensus is that Bitcoin could break and reach new all-time highs in Q4 2024. Taking to X, another analyst said Bitcoin is already within a bullish breakout formation, easing above a descending channel or bull flag. At the same time, prices are breaking above the resistance of a “cup and handle” pattern. Institutions Buying As BTC Recovers If bulls take over, pushing prices higher, the evolution would confirm gains of Q1 2024. Subsequently, it would mark the resumption of bulls, an encouraging development following the 30% drop from March highs.

Amid this wave of optimism, institutions are also pouring in, getting exposure via spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to SosoValue, there are massive inflows as institutions buy more shares on behalf of their clients.
