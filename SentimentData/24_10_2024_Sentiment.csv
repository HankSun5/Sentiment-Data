Known for his technical forecasts, Brandt feels the altcoin is on the verge of a bullish turnaround. He’s identified an inverted Head and Shoulders formation on the daily chart of Ethereum. This is one of the most classic buy signals in technical analysis. If ETH can hold above that neckline at $2,745, we could be looking at a breakout.

Data from IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum’s network is stronger than ever, boasting over 5 million active addresses across its mainnet and Layer 2 networks. Though market mood is still mixed, this statistic confirms Ethereum’s importance in the crypto ecosystem. Although some investors see Ethereum’s long-term future improving, others are worried by the short-term hazards. There are now over 5 million active $ETH addresses across the Ethereum mainnet and leading L2 networks, outpacing any other Layer 1 asset by a significant margin. pic.twitter.com/W6JaauNvhV — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) October 21, 2024 A Long-Term Play Ethereum definitely had its ups and downs. From a price tag as low as $10 to nearly $4,900 in the past, it’s very obvious that ETH has made quite a few early believers. And while taking such wild rides can be full of gut-wrenching moments, Ethereum never failed to ensure that its core strength lies in the facilitation of smart contracts and decentralized applications in the blockchain space. However, Ethereum’s cost basis for many investors has risen as the market has matured. This has made short-term gains more elusive, leading some traders to approach the market cautiously. But for those with a long-term view, Ethereum’s ambitious roadmap and history of overcoming challenges continue to make it an attractive option. Ethereum: The Next Path Ethereum’s present pricing behavior has one of more fascinating technical aspects: its interaction with the Point of Control (POC). Often considered as a significant support or resistance, this level could be crucial in deciding Ethereum’s next direction. As ETH’s price hovers near this point, it suggests a possible buying opportunity for those looking at the long term. If the POC holds, Ethereum could build a solid foundation for future growth. But a break below this level might signal trouble ahead, so investors should stay cautious.

If Ethereum maintains over $2,745 and the inverted Head and Shoulders pattern persists, it might climb significantly. Yet, as always, it’s essential to consider other market factors—broader trends, technical indicators, and market sentiment all play a role in shaping the future of Ethereum. While Ethereum has its challenges, the potential for a bullish breakout is hard to ignore. Whether you’re in it for the long game or watching closely for short-term gains, Ethereum’s next move could be a significant one.

However, after testing the $69,500 supply level, the cryptocurrency faces selling pressure. Despite this, Bitcoin remains strong, holding above the previous high of around $66,000, a crucial level determining its next move. Related Reading: Solana Could ‘Go Parabolic’ Starting Today – Analyst Sets $370 Target Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that, despite recent bearish attempts, bears are losing control in the futures market. A key indicator has flipped bullish for the first time since July, suggesting that the current selling pressure may not be enough to push Bitcoin lower. With Bitcoin in a critical phase, holding above the $66,000 level would signal continued strength and maintain the uptrend for the coming weeks. Investors are watching closely, as Bitcoin’s ability to stay above this support could pave the way for new highs and further momentum in the bullish cycle. Bitcoin Taker Buyers Starting To Breathe Crypto analyst Maartunn shared recent data from CryptoQuant, revealing that Bitcoin taker buyers in the futures market have struggled to gain an advantage over taker sellers throughout the past year. Maartunn highlighted a chart showing that the BTC net taker volume has turned positive for the first time since July, signaling a potential shift in momentum. The present trend change suggests that bears are beginning to lose control over Bitcoin’s price action, with buyers starting to gain strength. This data points to an accumulation phase, where Bitcoin’s price has been suppressed by large investors, keeping it from making significant gains or marking new monthly lows. The fact that BTC hasn’t posted new lows despite previous bearish pressure reinforces the view that an accumulation period may end, and a new bullish phase could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Breakout Confirmed – Top Analyst Predicts $3,400 Target The coming weeks are critical for Bitcoin, particularly with the approaching U.S. presidential election on November 5. Historically, elections introduce volatility and uncertainty into financial markets; this year is no exception. Broader market trends likely influence Bitcoin’s price action, and traders are watching closely to see how BTC responds to these developments. If Bitcoin maintains its upward momentum, a rally to new highs could follow in the weeks after the election. BTC Testing Crucial Support Bitcoin is currently trading at $66,400 after a healthy retrace from its recent high of $69,500. The price now finds support at $66,000, which acted as a key resistance in late September and has since flipped into a crucial demand zone for BTC. This support is essential for the bulls to maintain control, as holding above $66,000 signals strength and keeps the momentum alive for another attempt at breaking the $70,000 mark. If Bitcoin can hold steady above this support level, the next logical target would be to challenge the $70,000 resistance, which has proven difficult to breach. A successful push past this level would likely trigger further upside, potentially driving BTC into new price discovery.

In this case, the daily 200 moving average at $63,300 is the next key area where Bitcoin could find support before resuming its upward trend. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether BTC can maintain its bullish trajectory or if a deeper pullback is on the horizon.

According to an analysis shared on TradingView by the analyst RLinda, Bitcoin could be on the way to reversing last week’s gains and correcting heavily due to the formation of a bearish engulfing pattern. Failed Push Above $69,000 Marks Bearish Reversal For Bitcoin RLinda’s analysis of the Bitcoin price trajectory is based on a new bearish engulfment candlestick pattern that is developing on the daily candlestick timeframe. Last week, Bitcoin experienced a notable rally that brought the cryptocurrency into a strong buying zone around $68,900. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Next Stop $3,400? Despite the bullish momentum, Bitcoin bulls were unable to push the price through the $69,000 resistance zone, encountering repeated rejections as the cryptocurrency pushed toward this level. RLinda’s analysis noted that this inability to break higher has led to the formation of a bearish engulfment pattern over the past three daily candlestick bars, which could be a sign that the sellers are regaining control. The bearish engulfment pattern, where the latest candle completely engulfs the previous day’s candle, is a strong reversal signal that suggests the upward momentum has exhausted itself. This pattern, combined with the failure to clear the $69,000 zone, indicates that Bitcoin could be facing a deeper correction. RLinda’s goes further to highlight that the recent rally appears to have been a false breakout from the descending resistance trendline that has been in place since Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $73,737. The descending trendline has acted as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s price rallies since March. Although last week’s rally initially seemed to break through it, the subsequent rejection suggests the breakout was not sustainable. Given this, the analyst notes that Bitcoin has now returned to a consolidation phase just below this trendline. As Bitcoin continues to consolidate, it increases the risk of deeper correction. How Far Can A Bitcoin Price Correction Go? Looking ahead, RLinda foresees a potential correction in Bitcoin’s price, with the first target for a decline set around $65,000. Should this level fail to hold, further corrections could see Bitcoin falling to $61,000, $58,000, and possibly as low as $57,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Things Are ‘About To Get Interesting’ However, this bearish outlook is not set in stone. RLinda adds that the bearish structure could be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to break above $69,400. A break above would secure the bullish momentum and a sustained breakout above the descending triangle. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66,670, marking a 0.6% decline in the last 24 hours. The current price action aligns with RLinda’s prediction of consolidation below the descending resistance trendline. In the meantime, the next few days could determine how much Bitcoin closes October (Uptober) in the green zone. Resistance levels to watch are $66,500 and $65,000, while support levels to watch are $68,400, $69,400, and $71,500.
