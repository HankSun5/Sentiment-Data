Known for his technical forecasts, Brandt feels the altcoin is on the verge of a bullish turnaround. He’s identified an inverted Head and Shoulders formation on the daily chart of Ethereum. This is one of the most classic buy signals in technical analysis. If ETH can hold above that neckline at $2,745, we could be looking at a breakout.

Data from IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum’s network is stronger than ever, boasting over 5 million active addresses across its mainnet and Layer 2 networks. Though market mood is still mixed, this statistic confirms Ethereum’s importance in the crypto ecosystem. Although some investors see Ethereum’s long-term future improving, others are worried by the short-term hazards. There are now over 5 million active $ETH addresses across the Ethereum mainnet and leading L2 networks, outpacing any other Layer 1 asset by a significant margin. pic.twitter.com/W6JaauNvhV — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) October 21, 2024 A Long-Term Play Ethereum definitely had its ups and downs. From a price tag as low as $10 to nearly $4,900 in the past, it’s very obvious that ETH has made quite a few early believers. And while taking such wild rides can be full of gut-wrenching moments, Ethereum never failed to ensure that its core strength lies in the facilitation of smart contracts and decentralized applications in the blockchain space. However, Ethereum’s cost basis for many investors has risen as the market has matured. This has made short-term gains more elusive, leading some traders to approach the market cautiously. But for those with a long-term view, Ethereum’s ambitious roadmap and history of overcoming challenges continue to make it an attractive option. Ethereum: The Next Path Ethereum’s present pricing behavior has one of more fascinating technical aspects: its interaction with the Point of Control (POC). Often considered as a significant support or resistance, this level could be crucial in deciding Ethereum’s next direction. As ETH’s price hovers near this point, it suggests a possible buying opportunity for those looking at the long term. If the POC holds, Ethereum could build a solid foundation for future growth. But a break below this level might signal trouble ahead, so investors should stay cautious.

If Ethereum maintains over $2,745 and the inverted Head and Shoulders pattern persists, it might climb significantly. Yet, as always, it’s essential to consider other market factors—broader trends, technical indicators, and market sentiment all play a role in shaping the future of Ethereum. While Ethereum has its challenges, the potential for a bullish breakout is hard to ignore. Whether you’re in it for the long game or watching closely for short-term gains, Ethereum’s next move could be a significant one.

With Bitcoin in a critical phase, holding above the $66,000 level would signal continued strength and maintain the uptrend for the coming weeks. Investors are watching closely, as Bitcoin’s ability to stay above this support could pave the way for new highs and further momentum in the bullish cycle. Bitcoin Taker Buyers Starting To Breathe Crypto analyst Maartunn shared recent data from CryptoQuant, revealing that Bitcoin taker buyers in the futures market have struggled to gain an advantage over taker sellers throughout the past year. Maartunn highlighted a chart showing that the BTC net taker volume has turned positive for the first time since July, signaling a potential shift in momentum. The present trend change suggests that bears are beginning to lose control over Bitcoin’s price action, with buyers starting to gain strength. This data points to an accumulation phase, where Bitcoin’s price has been suppressed by large investors, keeping it from making significant gains or marking new monthly lows. The fact that BTC hasn’t posted new lows despite previous bearish pressure reinforces the view that an accumulation period may end, and a new bullish phase could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Breakout Confirmed – Top Analyst Predicts $3,400 Target The coming weeks are critical for Bitcoin, particularly with the approaching U.S. presidential election on November 5. Historically, elections introduce volatility and uncertainty into financial markets; this year is no exception. Broader market trends likely influence Bitcoin’s price action, and traders are watching closely to see how BTC responds to these developments. If Bitcoin maintains its upward momentum, a rally to new highs could follow in the weeks after the election. BTC Testing Crucial Support Bitcoin is currently trading at $66,400 after a healthy retrace from its recent high of $69,500. The price now finds support at $66,000, which acted as a key resistance in late September and has since flipped into a crucial demand zone for BTC. This support is essential for the bulls to maintain control, as holding above $66,000 signals strength and keeps the momentum alive for another attempt at breaking the $70,000 mark. If Bitcoin can hold steady above this support level, the next logical target would be to challenge the $70,000 resistance, which has proven difficult to breach. A successful push past this level would likely trigger further upside, potentially driving BTC into new price discovery.

In this case, the daily 200 moving average at $63,300 is the next key area where Bitcoin could find support before resuming its upward trend. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether BTC can maintain its bullish trajectory or if a deeper pullback is on the horizon.

According to an analysis shared on TradingView by the analyst RLinda, Bitcoin could be on the way to reversing last week’s gains and correcting heavily due to the formation of a bearish engulfing pattern. Failed Push Above $69,000 Marks Bearish Reversal For Bitcoin RLinda’s analysis of the Bitcoin price trajectory is based on a new bearish engulfment candlestick pattern that is developing on the daily candlestick timeframe. Last week, Bitcoin experienced a notable rally that brought the cryptocurrency into a strong buying zone around $68,900. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Next Stop $3,400? Despite the bullish momentum, Bitcoin bulls were unable to push the price through the $69,000 resistance zone, encountering repeated rejections as the cryptocurrency pushed toward this level. RLinda’s analysis noted that this inability to break higher has led to the formation of a bearish engulfment pattern over the past three daily candlestick bars, which could be a sign that the sellers are regaining control. The bearish engulfment pattern, where the latest candle completely engulfs the previous day’s candle, is a strong reversal signal that suggests the upward momentum has exhausted itself. This pattern, combined with the failure to clear the $69,000 zone, indicates that Bitcoin could be facing a deeper correction. RLinda’s goes further to highlight that the recent rally appears to have been a false breakout from the descending resistance trendline that has been in place since Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $73,737. The descending trendline has acted as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s price rallies since March. Although last week’s rally initially seemed to break through it, the subsequent rejection suggests the breakout was not sustainable. Given this, the analyst notes that Bitcoin has now returned to a consolidation phase just below this trendline. As Bitcoin continues to consolidate, it increases the risk of deeper correction. How Far Can A Bitcoin Price Correction Go? Looking ahead, RLinda foresees a potential correction in Bitcoin’s price, with the first target for a decline set around $65,000. Should this level fail to hold, further corrections could see Bitcoin falling to $61,000, $58,000, and possibly as low as $57,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Things Are ‘About To Get Interesting’ However, this bearish outlook is not set in stone. RLinda adds that the bearish structure could be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to break above $69,400. A break above would secure the bullish momentum and a sustained breakout above the descending triangle. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66,670, marking a 0.6% decline in the last 24 hours. The current price action aligns with RLinda’s prediction of consolidation below the descending resistance trendline. In the meantime, the next few days could determine how much Bitcoin closes October (Uptober) in the green zone. Resistance levels to watch are $66,500 and $65,000, while support levels to watch are $68,400, $69,400, and $71,500.

Analyst Predicts Major Price Movements Ahead For Altcoins In a recent post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), OxNobler shared insights on the Altcoin Indicator, which has just gone parabolic for the first time in three years. The analyst emphasized the cyclical nature of market phases, driven by capital inflows that shift from Bitcoin into larger-cap tokens before eventually reaching lower-cap altcoins, suggesting a growing liquidity movement that could fuel significant price surges across the altcoin landscape. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Face Last Major Crash, Warns Crypto Analyst Identifying key catalysts for the upcoming liquidity inflows, OxNobler pointed to several factors: the upcoming US election, where both candidates express support for Bitcoin, anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, the potential lifting of the cryptocurrency ban in China, and the expected payout of $16 billion from FTX in Q4 2024 to Q1 2025. By analyzing historical price movements and market cycles, OxNobler believes traders can position themselves for substantial gains in the months ahead. OxNobler has highlighted several altcoins that he believes are primed for growth in this new market phase. Key Players In Upcoming Market Shift Realio Network (RIO): This blockchain-based platform focuses on the issuance, investment, and lifecycle management of digital securities and crypto assets. With a current trading price of $0.83 and a market cap of just $4 million, OxNobler believes that RIO is poised for significant upside, especially given the increasing interest in Real World Assets (RWA). Major asset managers like BlackRock are already investing in this sector, potentially driving demand for altcoins such as RIO. Zero Labs (DEAI): This token supports a decentralized artificial intelligence ecosystem focused on data governance. Currently priced at $0.55, DEAI has a market cap of $50 million, making it an attractive option as AI continues to gain traction, specially over the past year behind the buzz surrounding companies like Nvidia. Related Reading: ApeCoin Faces Strong Resistance As Bears Seize Control At $1.755 SUI: Notable for its recent performance, SUI has surged 28% over the past month and an impressive 372% year-to-date, currently trading at $1.98 with a market cap exceeding $5 billion, positioning it well for the expected altseason. Render Network (RENDER): This decentralized GPU rendering network connects users needing GPU computing power with those willing to rent out their resources. Priced at $5 with a market cap of $2.6 billion, the analyst suggests that RENDER is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for GPU computing in various technological applications. TokenFi (TOKEN): Aiming to simplify the crypto and asset tokenization process, TokenFi aspires to become the leading platform in this space, according to the analyst. Currently, TOKEN trades at $0.047 with a market cap of $47 million.

While the platform is critical in many crypto sectors, especially DeFi, LINK has recently struggled for momentum. LINK Holders Moving Tokens From Exchanges: Are They Accumulating? However, on-chain streams from IntoTheBlock reveal that more holders are moving tokens from top exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. In a post on X, the analytics platform observes that exchange flow over the past month has been negative, signaling sustained withdrawals. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Quarterly Performance Hints At Possible Correction—Here’s What You Should Know Usually, whenever tokens are moved from exchanges, it could indicate that owners are confident of what lies ahead. Since LINK, the ERC-20 token, is supported by many DeFi protocols, it could suggest that holders are interested in engaging with these dapps, possibly earning passive income. The more transfers from centralized ramps, the higher the likelihood of prices expanding in tandem, which is a net positive for LINK bulls. According to Etherscan, Chainlink has a top supply of 1 billion LINK distributed to 721,996 unique addresses when writing on October 23. These holders have, in turn, moved LINK over 15.8 million times. A level deeper, onchain data reveals that Binance controls more than 4.2% of the total supply. LINK under their control exceeds $479 million at spot rates. Chainlink Building: Will Price Break Above $20? With IntoTheBlock data pointing to net outflows from exchanges, there is a chance that LINK will find support and resume the uptrend of the past few trading days. LINK has resistance at $12.3, and a double bar bear formation is printing out following the dip of early today. However, even if prices break higher, rejecting bears, bulls must decisively expand above the double top at around $13. The eventual spike will open the door for LINK bulls to create a solid base for a rally to $20. The pace of this growth depends on how top altcoins, including Ethereum, perform. If Ethereum prices recover, soaring above $3,000, it could reinvigorate DeFi and NFT demand, lifting LINK. Beyond this, price drivers will include the team’s progress. Yesterday, October 22, Chainlink Labs launched the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) Private Transactions. This feature enables data privacy without violating existing laws guarding cross-chain transactions.

US Elections Results Not Consequential As the US presidential elections inch closer, a slight change in tone can be observed among crypto options traders regarding its implications on the digital asset market. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Reach A New All-Time High? This Golden Cross Suggests So Notably, options traders are increasingly betting big on $80,000 BTC by the end of November, regardless of whether Republican candidate Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris wins the election. Commenting, David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, a crypto brokerage firm, said: I believe the market consensus is that Bitcoin is likely to perform well regardless of the election outcome. Our analysis shows that options activity surrounding the upcoming elections exhibits a notable topside-heavy bias. Within crypto circles, the general belief is that a Trump win would likely benefit the digital asset ecosystem. At the same time, a Harris victory would likely continue the Biden administration’s perceived hostile stance toward cryptocurrencies. However, Harris has attempted to shift this perception among crypto voters, as she recently promised to foster emerging technologies like AI and digital assets through a supportive regulatory framework. Besides the US elections, other factors, such as interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and cooling inflation, can be attributed to increased optimism toward a new ATH for Bitcoin by the end of the year. To recollect, Bitcoin hit its current ATH value of $73,797 in March 2024, largely buoyed by the anticipated demand for the digital asset following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, BTC dropped to $53,956 in September due to rising interest rates, before the Fed announced a rate cut. Since then, Bitcoin has rebounded strongly, trading just above $66,000. Bitcoin Put To Call Ratio Trending Lower According to data compiled by Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange by reported trading volume, the put-to-call ratio is trending lower toward the end of the year. Essentially, a lower put-to-call ratio means that more traders are buying call options than put options, indicating a strong belief that BTC will likely surge in the coming days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? Yev Feldman, co-founder at SwapGlobal, an institutional-grade crypto options trading platform, notes: We see traders buy calls near 68k and puts near 66k, in other words, many continuously position and reposition for a breakout for either end. There is limited reason to collapse downwards after the election, so up makes more sense. Additionally, for BTC call options expiring on November 29, open interest is largely concentrated around $80,000, with $70,000 being the second most favored strike price. For call options expiring on December 27, strike prices are between $80,000 and $100,000. Recent reports suggest that retail interest in BTC has been on a gradual upward trajectory, indicating that the market is in risk-on mode after being range-bound for the majority of the year. Lawant concluded: This indicates that investors are leveraging the options market more as a tool for capturing potential upside rather than as a hedge against downside risks. Concerns about a potential downside persist due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle East and lingering doubts about Bitcoin’s halving earlier this year. BTC trades at $66,696 at press time, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,560 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $2,600 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,758 swing high to the $2,445 low. A clear move above the $2,600 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,700 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,720 level or $2,750. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,550 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,520 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward $2,450. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,450 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,420.

This key shift in Bitcoin’s network fundamentals includes the rise in Bitcoin’s hashrate, which has surged to an all-time high, marking a significant milestone for the network. According to Mac.D in a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the rise in BTC hashrate, which measures the computational power miners use, suggests “intensified competition” among miners, driving up the mining difficulty to unprecedented levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Quarterly Performance Hints At Possible Correction—Here’s What You Should Know The Signals: Active Addresses And Mining Difficulty This increase in mining difficulty indicates Bitcoin’s growing intrinsic value. According to Mac.D, for long-term investors, commonly called “SmartMoney,” this makes Bitcoin an increasingly attractive investment. Historically, a higher hashrate and mining difficulty are positive indicators for the Bitcoin network, reflecting strong miner activity and a more secure network. The analyst’s observations come as Bitcoin has recently experienced a recovery in price after months of consolidation. Another important factor contributing to Bitcoin’s positive network fundamentals is the surge in active Bitcoin addresses. Mac.D pointed out that the number of active addresses, measured over 30 days, has risen steadily since mid-September. This increase in active addresses indicates greater user engagement with the network as more people send and receive Bitcoin. #Bitcoin Network Fundamentals Turn Positive “Bitcoin’s network fundamentals are exhibiting patterns similar to those observed during previous bullish periods. Even if a correction or consolidation phase occurs in the near future, there is a strong likelihood of a positive trend… pic.twitter.com/XBWCmNymKT — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 23, 2024 Increase In Bitcoin Network Fees In addition to the rise in active addresses, Bitcoin’s total network fees have also increased, driven by a spike in on-chain transactions. Mac.D noted that this pattern is typical during bullish periods, where a price rally leads to more transactions increasing network fees. The rising fees and the surge in active addresses point to heightened network activity—a positive sign for Bitcoin’s overall health and adoption. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? The analyst also compared the current network activity to previous bullish periods, noting similarities in on-chain behaviour. The analyst noted: Even if a correction or consolidation phase occurs in the near future, there is a strong likelihood of a positive trend emerging. Notably, the increasing hashrate, rising transaction volume, and surging network fees all contribute to a more solid Bitcoin ecosystem, signaling that the network is becoming more resilient and attractive to miners and investors.

Current Bitcoin Trends Echo 2021 Rally, New ATH Possible Crypto analyst CryptoBullet has pointed out that the last time the MACD signaled a bullish trend, BTC was trading between $20,000 and $25,000 in 2023, which preceded a significant price spike to a new all-time high of $73,700 in back in March of this year. This context raises the possibility of significant gains ahead for the leading crypto as the market begins to show signs of recovery from previous consolidation periods over the past few months. Related Reading: Solana Stays Strong Despite BTC Drop – $176 Next? In a recent analysis shared on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), CryptoBullet also noted the similarities between the current market conditions and those of the 2021 bull cycle. The analyst emphasized the vertical rally in 2021, followed by a mid-term correction, suggesting that while the current correction may not be as severe, it has taken longer to unfold. CryptoBullet explained that BTC is breaking out of that multi-month consolidation as MACD crosses bullish again, hinting at the potential for a new all-time high in the last months of the year, alongside a lower high on the MACD indicator. Cycle Top Of $95,000-$100,000 By Early 2025 CryptoBullet’s bullish outlook extends over the next two years, forecasting a cycle top for Bitcoin between $95,000 and $100,000, with a subsequent bear market bottom anticipated at between $23,000 and $25,000. This forecast is based on Fibonacci wave analysis, where he predicts that the confluence of the 1.618 Fibonacci level and the top of the current channel will align with his target for Wave 5. CryptoBullet anticipates that once the target range of $95,000 to $100,000 is reached—expected between December 2024 and March 2025—Bitcoin may face rejection, initiating the first wave (A) of the next bear market. The analyst predicts a temporary low during the summer of 2025, followed by fluctuations often referred to as a “Dead Cat Bounce” in the market, expected between September and December 2025. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Face Last Major Crash, Warns Crypto Analyst CryptoBullet warns that the most challenging phase, Wave C, could stretch throughout 2026, with a potential target of $23,000 to $25,000. CryptoBullet acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in these projections, stating, “These are just my expectations. I try to be conservative here and not give you crazy $250,000 to $500,000 or $1 million targets.” In his analysis, CryptoBullet also notes that these scenarios could be invalidated if there is a dramatic shift in the macroeconomic landscape, which could lead Bitcoin to break out of its multi-year channel to the upside. In such a case, discussions around $170,000 to $200,000 targets for Bitcoin could become relevant. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $65,970, down 2% over the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin & Apecoin Are Among Memecoins That Fell Prey To FOMO Recently As explained by Santiment in a new post on X, the Positive Sentiment vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio has seen a spike for Dogecoin and other memecoins recently. The “Positive Sentiment vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio” here refers to an indicator that tells us whether major social media platforms are leaning towards positive or negative comments right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? This indicator makes use of a machine-learning model designed by the analytics firm to separate between comments pertaining to negative and positive sentiments. When the value of the metric is greater than zero, it means the total number of positive posts/threads/messages is outweighing that of the negative ones. On the other hand, the indicator being under this threshold suggests the dominance of bearish sentiment on social media. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in this indicator for four assets over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, Dogecoin and Apecoin both witnessed spikes in the Positive Sentiment vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio recently, implying a large amount of positive comments related to these coins were made on social media. Interestingly, as the analytics firm has pointed out, these spikes coincided with tops in the DOGE and APE prices. The other two memecoins listed in the chart, GIGA and GOAT, also witnessed a similar pattern, although their tops came before that of the former two. While positive sentiment can suggest belief in the market, a large amount of it can be an indication of excessive hype, which is something that has historically led to tops for not just memecoins but cryptocurrencies in general. “Prices typically always go the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations, and when the crowd gets extreme on either the bullish or bearish end, it becomes highly predictable to buy or sell,” explains Santiment. Given the timing of the recent positive spikes in the indicator, it would appear possible that the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) that developed among the investors was the reason behind the corrections that Dogecoin and others have faced. Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Ratio Reaches Extreme Levels, What It Means The Positive Sentiment vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio could now be to watch in the coming days, as any cooldowns in its value could pave way for bullish momentum to restart for these coins. DOGE Price Dogecoin had neared the $0.150 level a few days ago, but with the correction that has followed since then, its price has retraced back to the $0.136 mark.
