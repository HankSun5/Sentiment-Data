Solana Reclaims $100 Billion Market Cap, Is SOL ATH Imminent? Solana, currently the cryptocurrency with the fourth-largest market cap, recently joined the ranks of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) by surpassing the $100 billion mark in market valuation. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance – Top Analyst Sets $300 Target At the time of writing, Solana’s native token SOL is trading at $216.43, marking impressive weekly gains of 32.6%. In comparison, Bitcoin has gained 19.6% and Ethereum 29.7% over the same period. To recall, SOL’s current ATH of $259.96 was recorded in November 2021, at the peak of the crypto bull market, buoyed by monetary easing as a measure to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. However, this upward momentum changed sharply for SOL at the height of the FTX crisis, with its price plummeting to a low of $8.68 in November 2022. SOL’s current market price thus reflects an almost 40x increase from these lows. Despite this substantial recovery, analysts believe there is still more room for SOL to rally, potentially setting a new ATH in its current price surge. Providing commentary on SOL’s recent price action, Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor, shared his analysis, saying that the SOL/BTC trading pair has broken out of an 8-month sideways consolidation channel, potentially moving toward the “banana zone” in Q4 2024. For the uninitiated, the “banana zone” in trading terms refers to a phase where the underlying asset may witness an explosive, parabolic price appreciation, leading to extraordinary gains in a short period. This breakout has positioned SOL for either an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart or a cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart, both incredibly bullish patterns for the altcoin. Another crypto trader, Bob Loukas, shared his outlook on X, stating that he wouldn’t be surprised to see SOL reaching a new ATH “within 14 days.” Loukas hinted that SOL could “get silly” in 2025, suggesting the potential for abnormal gains shortly. Overall Sentiment Bullish On SOL As BTC continues establishing new ATHs beyond $80,000, the wider crypto market appears to follow the leading asset’s price momentum. Related Reading: Solana ‘Must Break Descending Resistance’ To Regain Bullish Momentum – Analyst Among major altcoins, SOL has piqued the interest of several crypto analysts due to its potential to “flip” Ethereum’s market cap and become the leading smart contract platform. In related news, Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem’s total-value-locked (TVL) rose to $5.7 billion during Q3 2024, signifying a 26% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth. Some analysts are wary of SOL’s current price action, suggesting that the token might be headed for a sharp correction before further upside movement. BTC trades at $82,251 at press time, up 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

Public company holdings of BTC are up 34% year to date, with MicroStrategy making up the overwhelming majority of that increase. Popular cycle top indicators like MVRV Ratio, Puell Multiple, and the Stock-to-Flow Model show considerable room to run still if history is any guide. As of article submission, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has printed a fresh all time high of $87,000 per coin. Having rallied nearly 30% in a matter of just a few days, a $100,000 per coin Bitcoin price seems as though it's only a 'matter of when' rather than a 'matter of if' at this point in time: BTC Weekly Chart, 11/11/24 (TrendSpider) The chart setup for BTC looks terrific for bulls. In recent pieces for Seeking Alpha, I've covered Bitcoin from a variety of different angles; including on-chain metrics, seasonality, technical conditions, and election impact: BITO: Buying The 'Breakout Shakeout' BITW: The 'Trump Trade' At A Discount From low to high, BTC has added $20k per coin in just 7 days . Given the absolute surge in the price of the coin since my last two Bitcoin-related articles, I wanted to add some additional coverage for readers to consider. In this piece, we'll explore recent capital flows, possible cycle top indicators to be mindful of, and a reiteration of why I personally like the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) as my preferred ETF for long term allocations. Capital Flows and Corporate Holdings During the monstrous BTC rally earlier this year that took Bitcoin on a 90% ride between late-January and mid-March, the aggregated on-chain holdings of the US-based spot products increased from 635k BTC to roughly 830k BTC before holdings growth stalled out for several months. US Spot ETF Holdings (TheBlock) We again see on-chain holdings in these funds starting to quickly rise once again. As of November 10th, these funds hold 1.05 million BTC on behalf of investors; indicating a sharp 10% increase in supply held through spot ETFs since the end of September. Per data from CoinShares, the week ended November 8th was the 5th consecutive week of positive inflow for crypto-related investment products globally. From a raw figure standpoint, the crypto market has seen nearly $2 billion of net inflow since the election of President Trump on November 5th. There has been a staggering $1.8 billion of investment demand for BTC alone in a single week: Asset Flows (CoinShares) Year to date, net flows for Bitcoin through traditional investment products have now surpassed $29 billion. ETFs and other investment funds aren't the only buyers. We've seen public and private companies execute corporate treasury management strategies that include Bitcoin in recent years. Interestingly, the year to date holdings data is a bit more mixed: BTC Holdings 12/31/23 11/10/24 YTD Private Companies 479,361 410,401 -14.4% Public Companies 272,103 363,629 33.6% Public & Private Combined 751,464 774,030 3.0% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries While public companies have grown BTC holdings by 33.6% year to date, private companies have actually been net sellers of BTC since the end of 2023. In fact, when we strip out the BTC holdings of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) from the rest of the public company holdings, we see a far less enthusiastic story for even the public companies: BTC Holdings 12/31/23 11/10/24 YTD Public Companies 272,103 363,629 33.6% MicroStrategy 189,150 279,420 47.7% Public minus MSTR 82,953 84,209 1.5% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries Taking out MicroStrategy's BTC holdings from total public holdings results in just a 1.5% year to date increase in BTC held via public companies. This is certainly a trend that I suspect long term Bitcoiners will want to keep an eye on going forward, as it likely conflicts with the notion that we're seeing more adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury strategy. Cycle Indicators In my October article covering the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), I shared several cycle indicators that, I felt, were worth considering such as HODLer balance and realized HODLer price. In this update, I'd like to share a few additional metrics that, I think, can be helpful for assessing when a cycle peak may be in. First, the MVRV Ratio: MVRV Ratio (IntoTheBlock) This is the market value to realized value, or the average purchase cost of each coin. During past cycle peaks, we've seen the MVRV ratio approach or even eclipse the 400% level. The ratio hit 435% in December 2017 and 373% in 2021. As of November 10th, the MVRV checks in at 239%. Even if we assume a law of diminishing returns and project just a 300% MVRV ratio top for this cycle, the ratio would be projecting a $135k per coin BTC price at current realized price levels. How does this compare with other models? Puell Multiple (Bitcoin Magazine PRO) The chart above is showing Bitcoin's Puell Multiple in orange. This figure takes the dollar-denominated revenue that is being earned by Bitcoin miners and compares it with statistical averages. The higher the multiple, the more extreme the price dislocation from norms. At Bitcoin's 2017 peak, the Puell Multiple eclipsed 6. Prior to peaking in 2021, the multiple nearly took out 4. As of November 10th, the Puell Multiple was slightly above 1. Again assuming diminishing returns over time, even if the multiple gets to just 2 again, it would be implying a BTC value closer to $174k per coin. Stock-To-Flow (Bitcoin Magazine PRO) I am not personally a fan of the stock-to-flow model for Bitcoin, but I'd rather show it and comment than ignore it when talking about cycle top price possibilities because I know there are many who do follow it. The biggest reason I don't generally care for this model is because the coin has been well behind the model for most of the last 3 years. If BTC were to ""catch up"" with the stock-to-flow model, it would imply a price today of $135k BTC and a price of $420k by May. I flat out don't believe that we'll see Bitcoin at $420k anytime soon, and certainly not in the next 6 to 7 months. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund Data by YCharts Buying Bitcoin through the ETF products is going to lead to long term under-performance due to the expense ratio. Compared with other funds like IBIT, FBTC is competitive, judging by the very similar total return since fund inception. But there is one critical difference between these funds that I think tilts the scale in favor of FBTC. I've written previously about the specific reasons why I like FBTC versus other spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past. To reiterate, the biggest reason; the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF does not use Coinbase ( COIN ) as the fund's custodian. I have no issue with Coinbase. I've used it in the past as a customer. As a retail trader, COIN's fees are quite a bit more than I'd want them to be when compared with the spot ETFs. Even in a standard brokerage account, the 25 bps charged by the fund is far cheaper than what a retail trader would generally pay to buy Bitcoin from Coinbase and self-custody the asset. I've done that math in a prior article , and it still checks out. Monthly Exchange Volume (TheBlock) In my view, the relative value offered by the spot ETFs is a big reason why active addresses have been in decline and monthly exchange volume remains well off highs. My longer-term suspicion is that Coinbase will raise custody fees on ETF managers. Since Fidelity self-custodies the Bitcoin held via FBTC, this long-term Coinbase fee risk is diminished. Thus, my spot ETF preference for long-term Bitcoin allocation is FBTC. Thesis Risks The major risk to the FBTC long thesis would be if the price of Bitcoin doesn't continue to rise with global liquidity. There are theoretical scenarios where the price of BTC falls even as global liquidity rises - such was the case for most of the summer during 2024. Prior to the approval of spot ETFs, Bitcoin has historically benefited from a parabolic phase when there has been clear signs of FOMO from retail traders and investors. I don't know that we can conclusively say we have that: Bitcoin purchase interest (Google Trends) Google Trends Search interest for ""how to buy bitcoin"" hasn't sniffed extremes that we've seen in the past. Though, we can observe a noticeable move higher at the beginning of November. There is perhaps credence to the notion that retail traders already know how to buy Bitcoin, since there were Super Bowl advertisements for cryptocurrency exchanges during the last cycle and spot ETFs exist. But a more fundamental risk is the lack of on-chain active addresses recently would be indicative of a network that is not really functioning as originally intended. Furthermore, a manufactured supply crunch through HODLing an asset isn't necessarily a great reason to be bullish, in my view. Investor Takeaways Despite my skepticism about $420k BTC, or even $200k BTC for that matter, I do think the market is going to take the Bitcoin price to six figures and possibly as high as $135-140k. Where the coin goes from there is anybody's guess. I still think there are a lot of reasons to be cautious about blindly HODLing any coin or token, and BTC is no different. Actual users of Bitcoin have been in decline and scalability continues to be a concern, judging by things like Lightning Network channels. Bitcoin is supposed to be a network for 'the people' not a speculative asset for Wall Street. But we have to trade the reality we have, not the reality we might want. Narratives can be very powerful and few narratives have had the same stickiness as Bitcoin's 'digital gold' narrative over the last decade. There will be a time to be bearish BTC, but we're not there yet.",FBTC|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-12 00:19:05

Data Hints At Massive 60,000% Rally",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/could-xrp-explode-after-us-elections-data-hints-at-massive-60000-rally/,"Many analysts are anticipating a bull run for Ripple’s XRP which could lead to an exponential growth, giving Ethereum and Bitcoin a run for their money. Several experts suggest that XRP’s potential price rally could be attributed to Donald Trump winning the US election, a political event that brought so much excitement to the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Strategic US Hub Plan Sends SHIB Price On A 23% Moonshot XRP: 700% Price Hike Analysts said that XRP could be on the brink of a possible price rally based on historical price movement after an election. They predicted that the price could skyrocket by 700% to about $4.89 per coin if history repeats itself. Currently, the crypto is being traded at $0.6113 with a total market capitalization of $34.76 billion and a 24-hour volume of $2.82 billion. Market commentators said that they believed that XRP would greatly benefit from positive sentiment brought by the upcoming administration of pro-crypto Donald Trump. According to analysts, they see a potentially massive price surge for the digital currency because of the long-term pattern in its price movement and a possible repetition of the coin’s post-election trends. However, some market observers decided not to disclose any price target for the anticipated XRP upsurge. Meanwhile, other analysts suggested that the most optimistic forecast for a post-election surge would be a growth between 100% and 500%, saying that the XRP price would be somewhere between $1.22 to $3.67 per coin. Historical Price Rally Analysts studied the price movement of XRP in past US elections, saying that after the 2016 US election, the digital asset’s price went down in the next four months after the election poll. They however noted that after the initial price dip, the altcoin had a massive price rally which propelled the coin to a whopping 60,000% and hit the all-time high of $3.31, an event which is not far-fetched at the moment. If XRP would again surge by 60,000% after the election, it would reach the $367 level. $XRP huge acceleration is coming Look at the past elections and see what follows. pic.twitter.com/ufcqC8v5Y5 — Mikybull 🐂Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 8, 2024 Likewise, in the 2020 election, XRP also experienced a huge price uptick of 177%, coincidentally in the same month as in the 2016 breakout before a correction was done in December.

Mikybull Crypto said that XRP is poised for another price upsurge, expressing his confidence in the prospects of the cryptocurrency following the notable price rallies during the previous elections.

BTC is showing no signs of stopping and might aim for a move toward $100,000 in the near term. Bitcoin started a fresh surge above the $82,500 zone. The price is trading above $85,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $82,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise above the $88,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Sets Another ATH Bitcoin price started a fresh increase above the $80,500 level. BTC cleared the $85,000 resistance and traded to a new all-time high. It posted a high at $89,600 and is currently consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $89,000 level. However, the price is still well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $78,555 swing low to the $89,600 high. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $82,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading above $86,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $88,800 level. The first key resistance is near the $89,500 level. A clear move above the $89,500 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $92,500. A close above the $92,500 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $95,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $100,000 resistance level. Are Dips Limited In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $88,800 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $88,000 level. The first major support is near the $84,000 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $78,555 swing low to the $89,600 high. The next support is now near the $82,500 zone and the trend line. Any more losses might send the price toward the $80,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 80 level. Major Support Levels – $88,000, followed by $84,000.

Key Metrics Reveal Crucial Insights For Investors,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-now-overheating-key-metrics-reveal-crucial-insights-for-investors/,"Amid Bitcoin’s pursuit to hit the six figures all-time high (ATH), a CryptoQuant analyst known as aytekin, has shared a comprehensive analysis on tools to assess Bitcoin’s market temperature, focusing on distinguishing useful from potentially misleading metrics. According to aytekin, investors’ concerns often center around Bitcoin’s ability to reach new peaks and when it might experience a market top. To navigate these questions, he highlighted two charts he pays less attention to for gauging market sentiment: “open interest” and the “supply in profit” metric. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Bitcoin Key Support Levels For Reaccumulation – Details Challenges With BTC Key Metrics The analyst elaborated that establishing a causal link between price and open interest remains challenging, as historical data indicates that price fluctuations tend to drive changes in open interest levels rather than the reverse. Furthermore, the analyst reveals that with the growth of futures markets and Bitcoin’s adoption, higher levels of open interest are anticipated in the coming years. Another metric aytekin views as potentially misleading is the “supply in profit,” which measures overall network profitability. This metric correlates with Bitcoin’s nominal price, often leading to extreme spikes above 95% in profitability during ATH periods. However, aytekin suggests that reaching new highs would be problematic if extreme profitability consistently triggered major sell-offs. Instead, he recommends considering how long these high-profitability levels persist, noting that historically, such conditions have lasted up to a year within broader market cycles. Credible Metric Suggests Overheating Bitcoin? In contrast, the analyst emphasized two metrics he finds valuable for tracking Bitcoin’s market sentiment: the funding rate and the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The funding rate, which tracks the cost paid between long and short positions in futures markets, serves as a tool to identify “overzealous” market optimism. Aytekin believes monitoring this metric offers better insights than open interest for assessing market conditions. As of now, he notes that funding rates are not signaling extreme market behavior. The analyst reveals that the SOPR metric clarifies profitability trends, particularly when smoothed using a 30-day moving average. Aytekin highlights that profitability alone is not inherently risky unless it coincides with supply movements within the market. The CryptoQuant analyst reveals that current SOPR levels indicate a market that, while showing signs of profitability, does not exhibit symptoms of overheating.

ETH is showing positive signs but struggling to catch up Bitcoin’s momentum. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,000 resistance zone. The price is trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,230 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,350 resistance. Ethereum Price Eyes Steady Increase Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,880 resistance like Bitcoin. ETH was able to climb above the $3,000 and $3,120 resistance levels to move further into a positive zone. It even surged above the $3,250 level in the past few sessions. It is up over 5% and there was a move above $3,350. A high is formed at $3,390 before there was a minor pullback. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,080 swing low to the $3,390 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,230 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,080 swing low to the $3,390 high. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,350 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,390 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,420. A clear move above the $3,420 resistance might send the price toward the $3,550 resistance. An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,680 resistance zone. Are Dips Limited In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,350 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,280 level. The first major support sits near the $3,250 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $3,250 support might push the price toward $3,150. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,080 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5940 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $0.5700 support zone. XRP Price Holds Support XRP price remained supported above the $0.5550 level. It formed a base and started a fresh increase above $0.5800, but gains were limited compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.6150 and $0.62200 resistance levels.

The first major resistance is near the $0.6220 level. The next key resistance could be $0.6350. A clear move above the $0.6350 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6465 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6550 resistance or even $0.6720 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6880. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.6150 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5980 level. The next major support is near the $0.5940 level and the trend line.
