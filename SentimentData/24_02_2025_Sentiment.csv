Despite XRP prices trading sideways for the past two or so months now, these holders have been ramping up their accumulation, fueling a new buying frenzy. On Wednesday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this trend, revealing in a tweet “ Whales bought 150 million XRP in the last 48 hours” . Notably, this surge in accumulation coincides with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledging three additional spot XRP ETF filings, bringing the total number of pending applications to six in just under two weeks. On Wednesday, the SEC officially acknowledged three separate filings for spot XRP ETFs from asset managers WisdomTree, Canary Capital, and CoinShares, marking a crucial step in the ongoing push to introduce institutional-grade XRP investment products. According to the SEC’s official statement, the agency has opened a public comment period to assess whether the applications comply with Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934. Investors and stakeholders have 21 days to submit feedback once the filings appear in the Federal Register. The commission then has up to 240 days to approve or reject the applications. These latest filings come just days after the SEC acknowledged three similar XRP ETF applications from Bitwise, Grayscale, and 21Shares, signaling a potential shift in regulatory sentiment and an accelerating path toward spot XRP ETF approvals. Meanwhile, the push for XRP ETFs extends beyond the U.S. According to sources, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) has approved the world’s first spot XRP ETF, with only a trading launch date pending. Furthermore, building on Marinez’s findings, the surge in ETF filings has reignited buying activity among large investors. In a Thursday tweet, crypto analytics platform Santiment emphasized this trend, highlighting a significant rise in XRP accumulation among major holders. “There are 261 more 100,000 XRP wallets than 10 weeks ago, a strong sign of confidence from key stakeholders,” the firm reported . Santiment further noted that despite a stagnant broader crypto market, XRP has sustained strong momentum, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in recent months. The XRP Ledger’s market cap is up 6% on the day and has posted a 9% gain over the past week, making it one of the few assets in positive territory. Since November 11, 2024, XRP’s price relative to BTC has surged by 297%. That said, whales’ and sharks’ sustained accumulation suggests confidence in XRP’s long-term trajectory, especially with the potential approval of a spot ETF on the horizon. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.57, reflecting a 0.50% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-23 22:06:47

The attack targeted liquid-staked Ether (stETH), Mantle Staked ETH (mETH), and various ERC-20 tokens, causing an industry-wide shock. According to CryptoQuant data, Bybit’s Ether reserves rebounded significantly within two days of the breach. The exchange now holds over 201,600 Ether, about 45% of the 439,000 ETH it possessed before the attack. Following the exploit, reserves had plunged to just 61,000 ETH. Support and Spot Buying Fuel Recovery A significant factor in Bybit’s resurgence has been aggressive spot buying. The exchange reportedly purchased 106,498 ETH worth $295 million through over-the-counter (OTC) trades, as per Lookonchain data. In addition, major crypto platforms and industry leaders rallied to support Bybit. Binance transferred 50,000 ETH, Bitget contributed 40,000 ETH, and HTX Group co-founder Du Jun provided 10,000 ETH, among other donations. Industry Confidence Remains Strong Despite the turmoil, Bybit maintained operational stability, processing over 350,000 withdrawal requests within 10 hours post-exploit, according to CEO Ben Zhou. This responsiveness helped retain user confidence, reinforcing the exchange’s credibility. Emergency Funding and Asset Impact Bybit secured approximately $390 million in emergency liquidity, with major contributions including $127 million from Binance-affiliated investors and $53 million from a single whale wallet. However, DefiLlama data indicates that Bybit’s total assets dropped by more than $5.3 billion in the wake of the attack. An independent proof-of-reserve audit by Hacken, however, confirmed that Bybit’s reserves still exceed its liabilities. “Despite the significant loss, Bybit’s reserves remain strong and fully back user funds,” Hacken stated. The Hack’s Origins and Investigation Investigators, including Arkham Intelligence and ZachXBT, have traced the attack to the North Korean Lazarus Group. Similarities between this hack and previous incidents, such as the $230 million WazirX breach and the $58 million Radiant Capital exploit, suggest a recurring method of deception. Security expert Meir Dolev explained that Bybit’s Ethereum multisig cold wallet was compromised through a misleading transaction, tricking signers into approving a malicious smart contract logic change. “This allowed the attacker to gain control of the wallet and move all ETH to an unknown address,” Dolev told Cointelegraph.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETH|TRADING|ARKM|BNB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-23 22:08:00

A Bybit statement confirms that the coordinated effort led to the freezing of nearly $43 million barely two days after the jarring security breach. Exchanges Team Up To Recover Funds According to Bybit’s X post , a total of $42.85 million have been frozen across a handful of exchanges in the wake of the attack. Decentralized exchange THORChain blacklisted several addresses linked to the North-Korean hacking syndicate while Coinex provided Bybit’s team with key insights. ChangeNow froze 34 ETH ($97,000) in addresses linked to the hack while the Avalanche restricted access to 0.38755 BTC ($37,124). Lightning Network-based exchange FixedFloat froze 120,000 in USDC and USDT stablecoins, mirroring the efforts of Bitget and other centralized exchanges. “Respect to their teams for their timely responses,” said Bybit on X. “They helped us monitor and block the blacklisted addresses.” Per the statement, stablecoin issuers Tether and Circle are flagging addresses linked to the Bybit hack with Tether freezing 181,000 USDT. Taking Proactive Steps Following The Bybit Hack While law enforcement agencies and exchanges are keen on recovering stolen funds from the Bybit hack, the top crypto exchange is taking proactive steps to protect its users. In collaboration with Pump.fun and Solana Foundation President Lily Lui, the team confirmed the removal of a Solana-based token with ties to marauding hacker groups. Onchain data indicates that the Lazarus Group is bridging its assets to Solana and using fake KYC data to deposit funds on exchanges. In an advisory to users, Bybit warned that scammers are pretending to be officials of the exchange to obtain sensitive personal information. “Bybit will never ask for your personal info, deposits, or passwords,” read the warning. “Always double-check official sources and report anything suspicious.” On the other hand, Ethereum community members are mulling over the prospects of a blockchain rollback to stifle the efforts of Bybit’s attackers The post Bybit Hack: Exchanges Freeze $42 Million From Exploit – Here’s All appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|Ethereum News|Exchange News|Bybit|Bybit hack|Circle USDC|Solana blockchain|Tether USDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|USDT|ETH|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-02-23 22:11:00

Ethereum (ETH) rebounds 8% as community anticipates bullish resolution to Bybit hack Ethereum (ETH) suffered a significant setback on Friday as hackers, allegedly linked to the Lazarus Group, drained 401,346 ETH (~$1.4 billion) from the Bybit exchange. Despite the severity of the breach, Bybit swiftly reassured users, restoring withdrawals and ensuring no customer suffered direct losses. With operations returning to normal within hours, speculation surrounding how the exchange will resolve the stolen funds has become a major driver of Ethereum’s price action. Notably, top analysts—including early Bitcoiner Arthur Hayes— suggested a blockchain rollback to reverse the illicit transactions. However, key Ethereum stakeholders strongly opposed this solution. On February 22, Tim Beiko, Core Protocol Developer at the Ethereum Foundation, published a detailed post outlining why a rollback is not a viable option to remediate the Bybit hack. “From the perspective of the Ethereum protocol, there is nothing to distinguish that transaction from other legitimate transactions on the network. There is no protocol rule that was broken where patching the issue would isolate the hacked funds, like in the case of the Bitcoin exploit.” —Tim Beiko, Ethereum Foundation, Feb 22, 2025 Ethereum Price Action, Feb 23, 2025 | (ETHUSDT) Within 24 hours of Beiko’s statements, ETH price rebounded sharply erasing all the losses it suffered on Friday. As seen above, ETH price surged 8% from a low of $2,616 to reclaim the $2,800 territory by press time on Sunday, February 23. Why Tim Beiko’s Statements Propelled Ethereum Price Ethereum traders have reacted positively to Beiko’s rejection of a rollback, signaling confidence in Ethereum’s long-term stability. However, with prominent mixers like TornadoCash under intense scrutiny from regulators after recent legal battles with the U.S. SEC, the Bybit hacker now faces significant hurdles in laundering the stolen ETH. This leaves two plausible paths forward for ByBit: retrieval or confiscation of the funds through law enforcement as evidenced by the $140 million bounty declared by the team. Alternatively, the Exchange may have purchase the lost ETH worth $1.4 billion from the open market to balance its books. Both scenarios present fresh bullish narratives for Ethereum’s near-term price action: ETH Supply Reduction via Litigation: If law enforcement intervenes, the stolen 401,346 ETH could be locked up in lengthy legal proceedings, effectively removing it from active circulation. Historical precedent suggests that such cases can take years to resolve. For context, customer refunds from the FTX liquidation in 2022 only began distribution on February 18, 2025—over two years later—totaling $800 million across 162,000 accounts. Bybit Buyback Driving ETH Market Demand : Should Bybit opt to buyback the lost 401,346 ETH from the open market to balance its books, it would effectively squeeze market supply further, inevitably skewing demand and supply dynamics and driving up Ethereum prices. With Ethereum stabilizing above $2,800 amid rising volumes, the bullish momentum could accelerate as the resolution discourse picks up steam in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Price Forecast: $3,000 rebound viable as community weighs Bybit hack solutions Having reclaimed all losses from the momentary crash on Friday, Ethereum price forecast remains cautiously bullish as ETH approaches key resistance levels amid renewed buying pressure. The daily chart shows ETH/USDT trading at $2,808, with a 1.63% gain. The ETH price has pushed above the short-term moving averages, suggesting bullish momentum could extend toward the next resistance at $2,826.02. The orange line, representing a lower timeframe moving average, has acted as dynamic support, preventing a breakdown over the past week. However, overhead resistance from the purple and blue moving averages near $2,994 to $3,039 could limit the upside. Ethereum Price Forecast | ETHUSDT The Volume Delta indicator reflects a net positive buying trend, with 27.97K in net volume favoring the bulls. This indicates growing accumulation, but the lack of a significant breakout suggests buyers remain cautious. The recent two-day bullish move of 8.04% shows that buyers are in control, but the 8.03% drop from a previous move highlights lingering volatility. A confirmed close above $2,811.87 could clear the path for a run toward $3,000, while failure to hold support at $2,771 could reignite selling pressure.

Elon posted on X (formerly Twitter) that this sudden demand came directly from President Donald Trump. Right after Elon’s tweet, a memo went out from the Office of Personnel Management in Washington, according to a report from the Financial Times. The memo specifically asked federal employees to write down five things they did in the past week. They have until midnight on Monday. It also told employees not to include classified info. The demand from Elon matches exactly how he handled things at Twitter after taking it over. He had previously asked Twitter workers to quickly justify their roles or risk getting fired. President Donald Trump seemed happy with Elon’s new government approach, posting on Truth Social Sunday that Elon was “DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.” Elon’s team at the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, known informally as “D.O.G.E,” has already made massive cuts throughout federal agencies. D.O.G.E has canceled hundreds of government contracts and put tens of thousands of government staff on suspension. Trump’s administration has faced criticism over some firings—especially veterans and cyber security experts—and even had to rehire some people at the agency that manages America’s nuclear weapons because they mistakenly fired key staff. D.O.G.E recently offered federal workers a choice: either return to the office full-time or resign. The White House estimated around 200,000 workers might take this deal. But by the time the scheme ended earlier this month, about 77,000 employees actually resigned. On Friday, Trump fired General CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, plus five other senior Pentagon officials. Next week, the Defense Department will also fire 5,400 probationary workers, under the guidance of Elon’s D.O.G.E following the confirmation of Pete Hagseth as Defense chief. Should all federal employees be required to send a short email with some basic bullet points about what they accomplished last week? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 23, 2025 Even though Saturday’s email request came officially from the government’s Office of Personnel Management, it didn’t repeat Elon’s threat of automatic firing. But Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, quickly responded. Everett promised that his union would legally challenge any firings he called “unlawful.” Everett added that Elon and Trump have again shown disrespect to government workers and the services they perform. “It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,” Everett said. How will the US economy be affected by all this? Economists say these cuts might become the largest firing of government employees in US history. The White House, guided by Elon’s D.O.G.E group, has already fired tens of thousands of workers or convinced them to quit. The US federal government employs more people than any other organization nationwide. Economists aren’t exactly sure how many jobs Trump’s administration plans to cut, but it’s definitely in the tens of thousands, based on current evidence. There were about 220,000 federal employees with less than a year of tenure as of May 2024, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. On top of that, more than 75,000 federal workers agreed to quit after being offered buyouts. Those employees will keep receiving paychecks through September even though they don’t work anymore. Bloomberg economists think total job losses won’t exceed 300,000 but could easily surpass 100,000. Losing a job can seriously hurt families. People who suddenly lose income often have trouble quickly finding a new position. According to data from the Labor Department, unemployment benefits only cover around one-third of what someone earned before losing their job. Data showing exactly how many federal workers lost jobs might not appear in official unemployment reports for at least a month. According to a Piper Sandler report from February 16, those who took the severance deals won’t even be counted officially until September. But weekly unemployment claims in Washington, D.C., already rose 36% by the week ending February 8, indicating early signs of significant job losses. Economists like Tedeschi, former chief economist for the Biden administration’s White House Council of Economic Advisers, said these layoffs alone won’t severely damage the broader US economy. Tedeschi explained that even if around 200,000 probationary workers lose jobs immediately, it would only reduce America’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) by about 0.1%. “This, on its own, is not recessionary,” Tedeschi said.

Amidst these fluctuations, an interesting technical indicator suggests that Dogecoin’s long-term rally is still intact. This technical indicator’s outlook was pointed out by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, who used the Gaussian Channel, a popular momentum tool, as evidence that Dogecoin’s bullish momentum is still in play despite the current selling pressures. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Go On A 110-Million Memecoin Buying Spree—What’s Next For DOGE? Gaussian Channel Shows Continued Bullish Strength For Dogecoin Dogecoin’s price trajectory has been highlighted by a decline since mid-January. This decline has seen Dogecoin fall by as high as 47% from a lower high of $0.4159 on January 18. The price correction is even more pronounced when considering its multi-year high of $0.475, which it achieved on December 9, 2024, from which Dogecoin has now corrected by approximately 54%. This notable correction has also seen the development of a few bearish signals on the Dogecoin price chart. One such bearish development is the rejection at a macro resistance and the failure to reclaim the macro golden pocket in the recent week. However, despite the notable correction in the Dogecoin price, the meme coin seems to be still trading in an uptrend in the longer term. This long-term outlook is revealed through the analysis of Dogecoin on the weekly candlestick timeframe using the Gaussian Channel. The Gaussian Channel is a lesser-known technical analysis tool that helps identify trends and cycles in price movements by highlighting green and red zones in different market cycles. The green zones represent periods of upward momentum, where the price is expected to keep growing. On the other hand, red zones indicate periods of correction or consolidation, during which the market pauses before resuming its upward trajectory. According to a Dogecoin price chart shared by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade on social media platform X, Dogecoin entered into its most recent green zone on the Gaussian Channel in 2024. However, despite the recent correction, it has remained in this green zone, indicating that Dogecoin’s uptrend is still active in the long term. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Long-Term Price Target For DOGE With the Gaussian Channel still indicating the green zone for Dogecoin, the rally could resume anytime soon. According to Trader Tardigrade’s projection, this rally will be enough to push DOGE above multiple resistance levels at $0.3, $0.4, and the recent multi-year high of $0.475. If momentum builds and buying pressure increases, Dogecoin may even retest its all-time high of $0.7316, which has remained unchallenged since the peak of the 2021 bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Tightens — CZ Says There’s ‘No Escape’ From Crypto Beyond these immediate targets, Tardigrade’s analysis suggests that the meme coin’s long-term trajectory could extend well beyond the $1 mark. The forecast envisions an even more aggressive rally that could see Dogecoin climbing as high as $4.1. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.247, up by 1.5% in the past 24 hours but down by 25% since the beginning of February.

40748170,https://coingape.com/?p=240504,1740350765,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"XRP Price Nears Breakout Zone, Is a Rally To $5 on the Horizon?",https://coingape.com/xrp-price-nears-breakout-zone-is-a-rally-to-5-on-the-horizon/,"XRP price is trading in an important area as analysts watch the $2.6 mark to decide the future of the altcoin. While analysts have indicated that crossing this level and further breaching the $2.77 mark would support the continuation of the upward movement. Currently, the resistance is found at $2.60, $2.85, and $5.85 in the long term while the support level is $2.33. XRP Price Approaches Key Resistance Levels Dark Defender has noted that XRP price is currently at the $2.60 level which is a key level that will determine the direction in the short term. A breakout above $2.77 will help signal a continuation of an up move, to higher prices. The analyst also notes that Ripple price is establishing higher lows and that implies that there is more buying pressure in the market. Technical indicators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI), also reflect bullish momentum. The RSI trendline has been creating higher lows, indicating an increasing demand for the asset. If XRP price manages to stay above the $2.60 resistance, the next target stands at $2.85, followed by a long-term projection of $5.85. However, if it fails to break through, support remains at $2.33. Also, according to analyst Egrag Crypto , predicted that XRP price may reach $67 if higher levels will be broken. He stated that if the price closes above 3$ on the monthly chart, then pump signals of an upward trend would have been established fully. However, the analyst also informed his followers that he expected XRP to pull back in the short-term, potentially testing $0.90 before shooting up once again. Ripple Forms a Cup and Handle Pattern More so, another analyst Thom Sieloff, identified a cup and handle formation in the daily timeframe. This pattern is widely considered a bullish continuation signal, often resulting in an upward price move. XRP price has been consolidating between $2.40 and $2.70, forming the handle portion of the pattern. According to technical projections, the breakout point for this structure is expected around $2.68 to $2.70. Historically, this pattern leads to a 20-30% surge upon breakout. If XRP price follows this pattern, the potential price target could reach $3.36 before facing further resistance. Traditionally, a stock or crypto (like $XRP ) forming a cup and handle pattern may increase by 20-30% from the breakout point, based on the depth of the cup projected upward from the resistance level, potentially targeting around $3.36 (a ~25.37% increase from $2.68) in this case.… — Thom Sieloff (@RealThomSieloff) February 21, 2025 Potential For an Altcoin Rally Market sentiment indicates that a confirmed breakout in XRP price could trigger an altcoin rally. Several analysts suggest that if XRP manages to hold above resistance levels, it could set the stage for an uptrend. The formation of bullish structures, coupled with increasing demand, supports this outlook. The possibility of an altcoin rally is further supported by growing institutional interest. Recent movements in the cryptocurrency market, including discussions around the MicroStrategy ETF, highlight increasing capital inflows into digital assets. XRP price action remains a key factor in determining whether this rally materializes. Despite positive technical signals, regulatory concerns remain a factor in the broader market. The SEC continues to maintain regulatory oversight on digital assets, influencing investor sentiment. However, XRP price has demonstrated resilience, recovering from past regulatory challenges. Nevertheless, the altcoin season is at risk if Ethereum fails to maintain the critical $2,600 support level, as highlighted by analysts. A drop below $2,425 could trigger further declines, delaying the anticipated altcoin rally.

The project will debut a stablecoin called USP on Ethereum and Solana blockchains in the second half of 2025, according to Bloomberg. Pi will use smart contracts to mint its USP stablecoin and minters will earn yields in the form of another token called USI. Competing With Tether The stablecoin will be backed by yield-bearing real-world assets such as bonds and over-collateralized with assets like Treasuries and money-market funds. “We view Pi Protocol as the evolution of stablecoins,” Collins told Bloomberg before comparing it to Tether. “Tether has been extremely successful in showcasing demand for stablecoins. But they keep all the yield. We believe 10 years later the market is really ready to evolve.” Collins, who was CEO from 2013 to 2015, and his partners sold Tether to the operators of the Bitfinex exchange in 2015. Back then, USDT stablecoin’s market value was less than $1 billion, today it is close to record highs of more than $140 billion. Pi Chief Executive Officer Bundeep Singh Rangar said, “You want assets that are non-correlated to crypto that are mid- to high yield, low risk.” “We have a mechanism that assesses the quality of the asset. They are ones that are vetted on their loss ratio and origination of where they are coming from,” he added. Regulations are shifting. Yield-bearing stablecoins will be the next trillion-dollar asset class — Pi Protocol (@piprotocol) February 18, 2025 Stablecoins got a green light this year with the election of US President Donald Trump. In his first days in office, he signed an executive order promoting US dollar-pegged stablecoin adoption while Congress is working on a regulatory framework for them. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also wants to chip away at Tether’s market dominance. At the company earnings call last week, he said that the firm aims to make USDC “number one” but admitted that this ambition was a “stretch goal.” A Crowded Space USP is entering an extremely competitive stablecoin market that is dominated by Tether which has a share of 60% from a current supply of $141 billion. Circle’s USDC has seen its supply and market share grow in recent months, and it is currently $56 billion, giving it a market share of 24%. The third largest stablecoin is USDS, formerly DAI, which has just under $9 billion in circulation and a market share of almost 4%.

Brazil’s approval of the first spot XRP ETF and the US SEC’s acknowledgment of Grayscale’s application mark major milestones – we’ll cover this topic in detail below. While XRP gains momentum, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is gaining attention among whales by potentially tackling Bitcoin’s biggest issues—slow transactions and high fees. Let’s check out the deets below. XRP Price Prediction: Could XRP’s Price Get Higher With Recent ETF Developments? On February 20, 2025, Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) approved the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Index Fund, making it the first spot XRP ETF in the world. Managed by Hashdex, a well-known crypto asset manager, the fund will be available on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange. The official trading date is still unknown, but Hashdex has confirmed the approval and plans to share more details soon. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s XRP ETF application has cleared a key step as the US SEC formally acknowledged it . While this doesn’t mean approval is guaranteed, it’s a significant step forward, especially given Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Many expected a rejection, so this acknowledgment boosts confidence in XRP’s future. Some analysts even believe that XRP could surpass Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency. Crypto analyst, Maxi shared their prediction for XRP where they expect it to hit $74.30 by December which would be a 2800% boost. How PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Might Improve Bitcoin With Faster Transactions, Lower Fees, and Ethereum Compatibility Bitcoin has long struggled with slow transactions, high fees, and network congestion. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana have introduced solutions to improve scalability, Bitcoin’s core technology remains largely unchanged. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , a hybrid Layer-2 solution, could offer a way to enhance Bitcoin’s efficiency without modifying its core network. By handling block times off-chain before finalizing them on Bitcoin’s base layer, PlutoChain might help reduce congestion and speed up processing. One of its biggest advantages could be speed. Instead of waiting nearly 10 minutes for confirmation, PlutoChain’s blockchain may complete block times in about two seconds. This improvement could make Bitcoin more practical for everyday payments, global transfers, and microtransactions. Lower costs are another potential benefit. By significantly reducing transaction fees, PlutoChain might make Bitcoin more accessible for regular use. Its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility could also allow Ethereum-based applications—such as DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and AI-powered tools—to connect with Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Early tests suggest PlutoChain has potential, with reports showing it processed 43,200 transactions in one day without issues. Security remains a major focus, with audits from firms like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . The project also emphasizes decentralized governance, allowing the community to influence upgrades and decisions. With its fast transactions, lower fees, and cross-chain capabilities, PlutoChain could help Bitcoin become more scalable and versatile, making it better suited for mainstream adoption. The Bottom Line With ETFs bringing new momentum to XRP, its price could see massive gains if adoption continues. Analysts predict a potential 2,800% surge, which could push XRP closer to the top of the crypto market. Meanwhile, PlutoChain might offer even greater utility by potentially improving Bitcoin’s speed, cost, and functionality. If it delivers on its features, it could change how Bitcoin is used, making it more efficient and practical. ———— Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

Solana Expert Say This Hidden Altcoin is Set to Skyrocket 8000x,https://thecoinrise.com/the-next-big-thing-in-2025-solana-expert-say-this-hidden-altcoin-is-set-to-skyrocket-8000x/,"Solana’s recent performance has caused panic among many altcoin investors after it succumbed to a double-digit loss over the past few weeks. Investors are now looking for new alternative tokens that can help them return to profits. This has brought them to Propichain, a new crypto token that stands out for its approach to tokenizing housing investments and bringing liquidity to the real estate sector. Read on to see why experts are confident that Propichain will outshine Solana in 2025. Solana Could Drop Below $150 in February Solana has become one of the worst-performing tokens over the past few weeks. Like many altcoins, Solana suffered double-digit losses at the start of February due to the widespread market crash. Some investors expected a swift Solana recovery. However, this momentum worsened in mid-February. Market charts now show that Solana had dropped by 14% over the past week to its current price of $166.52. With Solana struggling to regain momentum, many altcoin holders are now looking for more stable or high-growth alternatives to offset losses. In search of safer or more profitable opportunities, many investors are turning to Propichain—a real estate-backed crypto project that combines AI-powered tools with metaverse technology. Propichain: How Artificial Intelligence is Spearheading the Future of Real Estate Investing What if real estate investing didn’t have to be complex or require high capital and years of experience to be profitable? This is the solution that Propichain (PCHAIN) sets out to provide via its AI-backed investing ecosystem. Propichain is a novel real estate trading platform that offers new opportunities to multiply returns. Whether you’re a risk-taker or a cautious planner, PCHAIN opens doors to a new way of thinking about property investments. As a Propichain user, the first major benefit you enjoy is access to lower-cost investing powered by asset tokenization. Propichain allows you to buy shares in desired assets at a fraction of the cost. Imagine a $6 million property becoming 6,000 tokens at $100 each, allowing you to own a slice of prime real estate without committing a fortune. This increases participation opportunities by creating avenues for lower-budget traders to maximize returns. With Propichain’s (PCHAIN) fractional tokens, you can start earning rental income. You can also receive loans from DeFi ecosystems, using Propichain’s fractional tokens as collateral. Once investors take advantage of asset tokenization to reduce costs, Propichain further enhances their experience with AI-driven automation and precision trading tools. By combining affordability with precision trading, Propichain ensures that even first-time investors can navigate the market with confidence. For instance, It might flag a high-risk, high-reward opportunity in an emerging neighborhood or suggest a safer bet in a stable suburban area. This allows you to stay ahead of the competition while maximizing gains from participation in the housing sector. Propichain’s AI tools also provide real-time property valuations, ensuring that you can capitalize on low-price opportunities while avoiding overpayments. Traders can also enjoy greater investing efficiency through Propichain’s automated trading beefits. This enables traders to complete investment deals with AI-driven commands. For instance, you can instruct the system to “ allocate 10% of my portfolio to office apartments if employment rises by 10% .” This hands-free approach ensures you never miss an opportunity, even while asleep or dining with family.’ Beyond AI-driven insights, Propichain further enhances investor confidence with immersive metaverse tours, allowing users to visually assess properties before making decisions. These tours allow you to take virtual leaps into uncharted markets, inspect properties in a bustling urban center, or a tranquil rural retreat—all from your couch. With Propichain’s metaverse-backed tours, you can collaborate with developers and fellow investors, brainstorming ways to maximize returns from the housing sector. Even better, these virtual tours allow traders to find more investing opportunities, which translates to potentially higher returns. In addition to metaverse-backed property tours, Propichain also provides high levels of security for traders. It leverages BlockAudit-certified smart contracts to ensure every move is transparent and secure. These smart contracts also automate payments for leasing, rental, and even revenue splits. Additionally, Propichain’s recent CoinMarketCap listing has also increased its market hype, drawing more investors to its ecosystem. Best Crypto Tokens for 2025: Propichain VS Solana Many investors have been impressed with Propichain’s approach to tokenizing housing investments. These investors claim that its RWA tokenization benefits make it a more attractive project than established coins like Solana. Already, many investors have joined Propichain’s ecosystem, buying over $2 million worth of tokens from its ongoing presale, which is now in its second round. PCHAIN currently trades at $0.011. By round three of this presale, its value will grow to $0.023. By the time of its listing, PCHAIN’s value will grow to $0.032, taking its entire presale ROI to 800%. Many analysts agree that now is the best time to join Propichain’s ecosystem as this is the lowest its value will ever be again. Even better, buying PCHAIN now will help capitalize on its expected 10,000x growth. This could see a $1,000 investment grow to $120,000 by early December. Don’t delay any longer.

Whether it’s Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) rebounding from market corrections, Bittensor TAO expanding its AI-powered blockchain ecosystem, or Qubetics redefining real-world asset tokenization, this week is full of exciting moves in the market. Out of these, Qubetics ($TICS) is making the biggest headlines. With its Web3 aggregation and asset tokenization marketplace, it’s solving one of the biggest pain points in crypto—real-world adoption. With over $13.9M raised and its presale stage nearing the next price jump, Qubetics is easily one of the top cryptos to join now before the bull run truly kicks in. Qubetics: Bringing Real-World Assets On-Chain Like Never Before Blockchain has been around for over a decade, but there’s still a massive gap between the crypto space and real-world assets. Traditional finance still relies on outdated systems, while businesses and investors struggle with inefficient processes and expensive intermediaries. This is exactly what Qubetics is solving with its Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace. Imagine being able to fractionally invest in real estate, commodities, and fine art through blockchain—all while enjoying instant settlements, lower fees, and full transparency. That’s what Qubetics is building: a one-stop shop where businesses can tokenize assets and investors can trade them seamlessly. For businesses, this means easier access to liquidity. No more waiting weeks or months for financing approvals—tokenized assets can be instantly traded, collateralized, or used in DeFi ecosystems. Whether it’s a real estate firm issuing tokenized property shares or a gold mining company offering blockchain-based reserves, Qubetics is set to revolutionize how real-world assets are owned, traded, and managed. And it’s not just businesses that benefit—retail investors now have access to previously untouchable markets. Ever wanted to own a fraction of a rare painting, a slice of a luxury hotel, or a stake in a global supply chain? Qubetics makes it happen, lowering entry barriers and democratizing access to wealth-building opportunities. Qubetics Presale: The Ultimate Early Investment Opportunity Qubetics’ record-breaking presale is proving to be one of the hottest opportunities in the market right now. The presale follows a structured format, where each stage lasts seven days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. Currently, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.08073, with the project in its 22nd stage. Investor demand has driven over $13.9 million in funding, with more than 21,000 token holders and 487 million tokens sold. Market analysts predict that by the end of the presale, $TICS will hit $0.25, bringing a 209.67% ROI. The excitement doesn’t stop there—after the presale, projections show potential price milestones of $1 (1138.69% ROI) and $5 (6093.48% ROI). Once the Qubetics mainnet launches in Q2 2025, early investors could see prices reach as high as $10 to $15, delivering an ROI of up to 18,480.45%. The race is on to secure TICS at its current price before the next stage’s increase. Bitcoin Cash: Can It Break Past $40K? Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) has had a rollercoaster ride, moving in and out of major resistance levels. As one of the most recognized Bitcoin forks, it maintains its low-fee, fast transaction model, making it a preferred choice for everyday payments. Despite market volatility, Bitcoin Cash has seen renewed interest from institutional investors, thanks to its scalability and increasing adoption among merchants. But the big question is: can it sustain momentum and break past the $40K resistance level? With the broader market heating up, a major breakout could be imminent. The next few weeks will determine whether Bitcoin Cash solidifies its position as a top altcoin or struggles to keep up with stronger players. Bittensor TAO: AI and Blockchain Converging for Innovation Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the fastest-growing sectors in tech, and Bittensor TAO is bridging the gap between AI and blockchain in a way no other project has. By creating a decentralized neural network, Bittensor allows machine learning models to collaborate, improve, and monetize their contributions. Why is this important? Traditional AI models are centralized and controlled by tech giants. Bittensor flips the script by making AI an open-source, decentralized ecosystem, where anyone can contribute to and benefit from AI-driven computations.

With its history of explosive rallies, many are wondering – could SHIB repeat its past performance and turn early holders into multi-millionaires by 2026? Meanwhile, PlutoChain could advance Bitcoin’s scalability with its Layer-2 solution by delivering 2-second block times and processing 43,200 transactions during its testnet phase. Unlike traditional Layer-2s, PlutoChain brings Ethereum-based applications into Bitcoin’s ecosystem and unlocks DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain functionality. Let’s break it down below! Shiba Inu Price Prediction – Can SHIB Create Multi-Millionaires by 2026? Shiba Inu’s history of explosive rallies has already turned some early holders into millionaires, and the question now is – can it happen again? SHIB’s growing presence in DeFi, gaming, and real-world payments is adding utility beyond its meme origins, which strengthens its long-term value proposition. Whale accumulation remains a key driver, with large users strategically buying dips, often signaling potential price breakouts. Technical indicators suggest that SHIB must break through key resistance levels to sustain upward momentum, which could make its trajectory in the coming years one to watch closely. PlutoChain Is a Hybrid Layer-2 Solution That Could Expand Bitcoin’s Capabilities Bitcoin has long been the dominant force in digital assets, but its slow transaction speeds and high fees limit its ability to function as a seamless payment network. PlutoChain might step in to solve this challenge with its Layer-2 technology and potentially bring speed, scalability, and interoperability to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. With 2-second block times, PlutoChain might significantly improve transaction efficiency, which could make Bitcoin more practical for everyday use. During its testnet phase, it successfully processed 43,200 transactions in a single day, which could demonstrate its ability to handle high demand. Additionally, PlutoChain introduces EVM compatibility, which allows Ethereum-based applications to integrate within Bitcoin’s network – something previously unattainable. Governance is another area where PlutoChain could set itself apart. Unlike Bitcoin’s rigid upgrade process, PlutoChain empowers its community to propose and vote on network improvements, which might ensure ongoing evolution. Security remains a priority as well, with PlutoChain undergoing audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi to reinforce trust in its reliability. Beyond payments, PlutoChain could expand Bitcoin’s functionality by unlocking new use cases, including DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain applications. PlutoChain could pave the way for a more scalable and adaptable blockchain ecosystem by addressing Bitcoin’s limitations. Final Words Shiba Inu has already made history with its explosive gains, and 2026 could bring another wave of opportunity for early holders. If adoption in DeFi, gaming, and payments continues growing, SHIB’s long-term value could rise significantly. Meanwhile, PlutoChain could tackle one of Bitcoin’s biggest challenges – scalability. It might start to gain attention because it could push Bitcoin toward a brighter future simply by offering faster transactions and cross-chain functionality. ——— Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

Per the South Korean news agency Yonhap , the incident allegedly took place on February 21 in the city of Incheon. USDT OTC ‘Theft’ – Police Searching for Suspect Speaking on February 23, officers at Incheon Seobu (West) Police Station said that the “thief” arranged to meet the “victim” on the first floor of a commercial building in West Incheon’s Seoknam District. Incheon Seobu Police Station, in Incheon, South Korea. (Source: hyolee2 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The unnamed “victim” was described as a man in his “thirties.” Police said the “victim” responded to a “post in a KakaoTalk open chatroom” from a vendor offering to “sell USDT coins” at a low price. Officers said the “victim” and the suspect exchanged chat messages via the app and eventually arranged to meet. The USDT market cap over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) Police Unsure of Suspect’s Nationality The suspect allegedly told the “victim” that they would transfer the coins to the former’s wallet and then take the cash as payment. However, the “victim” explained: “I put the cash on the floor in a paper bag to complete transaction. But while I was looking away for a moment, [the suspect] ran away with it.” The police said that they believed that the suspect came from a “Central Asian country,” but admitted they did not know exactly what the suspect’s “nationality” was. A police official told the media that investigators were hunting for the suspect for alleged “theft”-related offenses. However, they added that they would not decide on “specific charges” until they had “arrested” the suspect. On February 23, Cryptonews.com found several posts in crypto-related KakaoTalk open chatrooms from individuals saying they wanted to swap coins for cash as part of in-person deals.

USDT-related OTC thefts appear to be on the rise in South Korea, particularly in Incheon and nearby regions. In May last year, four men pleaded guilty to stealing some $735,000 from a USDT OTC buyer in a similar case .

Could this Ripple Prediction Mint You A Millionaire?,https://nulltx.com/ripple-price-prediction-xrp-to-hit-5-trillion-market-cap-could-this-ripple-prediction-mint-you-a-millionaire/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has put forward a bold prediction for XRP, saying its market capitalization reached an astonishing $3.7 trillion – we’ll check out the details below. Meanwhile, PlutoChain , a hybrid Layer-2 solution, might gain momentum by fixing Bitcoin’s key limitations. With smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Bitcoin network, PlutoChain could boost the network’s scalability and functionality while maintaining robust security. We’ll cover the deets below. Ripple Price Prediction: Why Does This Analyst Believe that XRP’s Market Cap Could Explode? Egrag Crypto’s analysis is built around the logarithmic measured move, a tool for evaluating long-term exponential growth. According to his model, XRP’s market cap could soar to $3.7 trillion, translating to a price of roughly $58 per token. For a more immediate outlook, the non-logarithmic measured move presents a more conservative target. This approach suggests XRP’s market capitalization will first reach $200 billion, setting a new all-time high of $3.5 per token. Interestingly, the analyst also believes XRP could hit a $1 trillion market cap within the current cycle. He attributes this possibility to the Fibonacci 1.618 level—often called the “golden ratio”—which aligns closely with $978 billion. Given that XRP surged 15,000% in the last market cycle, Egrag Crypto sees this target as entirely feasible. Several factors would need to happen for XRP to reach these ambitious valuations. Institutional adoption and regulatory clarity stand out as primary drivers, with the ongoing discussions around XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) serving as a key example of how institutional interest could increase demand. PlutoChain’s Hybrid Layer-2 Solution Could Finally Make Bitcoin Scalable and Add New Functionalities to Its Network Bitcoin’s biggest pain points—slow transactions and high fees—have limited its practicality for everyday use. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might offer a long-awaited breakthrough. By introducing a hybrid Layer-2 solution, it could make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more adaptable without sacrificing security. PlutoChain’s Layer-2 network processes block times in just 2 seconds, a huge leap from Bitcoin’s usual 10-minute confirmation time. This could allow users to send transactions or interact with Bitcoin-based applications with near-instant finality. Next to speed, PlutoChain could change Bitcoin’s role in decentralized finance. Its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility might let developers bring DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and AI-driven applications into the Bitcoin ecosystem—something that was previously impossible. Early performance tests suggest PlutoChain’s network could handle up to 43,200 transactions per day without congestion. To back up its security claims, the project has undergone audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . Community governance could also play a major role. PlutoChain’s model may let users propose and vote on protocol changes, ensuring the network evolves in a way that aligns with user needs. PlutoChain might not only reduce Bitcoin’s network congestion and fees but also unlock new use cases that could change how the industry views Bitcoin’s utility. The Bottom Line While XRP’s long-term price predictions remain speculative, analysts like Egrag Crypto suggest that its market cap could reach new heights if key adoption and regulatory factors align. Whether or not these forecasts come true, they show the growing interest in blockchain scalability and real-world use cases. On the other hand, PlutoChain could offer a hybrid Layer-2 solution that might finally address Bitcoin’s speed and cost inefficiencies. With faster transactions, lower fees, and compatibility with Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, PlutoChain might redefine Bitcoin’s utility. ——- This article is not financial advice.

Which Crypto Has 15,800% Potential?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-xrp-or-official-magacoin-which-crypto-has-15800-potential/,"As we approach March 2025, the cryptocurrency market is buzzing with speculation about which tokens could deliver astronomical returns. Three contenders stand out: Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin; XRP, backed by Ripple’s institutional partnerships; and THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN, a newcomer with explosive presale momentum. Each represents a different facet of the crypto ecosystem – meme-driven, institutional-backed, and community-powered. With global crypto adoption surpassing 1 billion users, the stage is set for potential breakout performances. Dogecoin (DOGE) Analysis Dogecoin, the pioneer meme coin, has a history of defying expectations. Its community-driven price spikes, often fueled by celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk’s tweets, have led to impressive rallies. However, sustaining such growth becomes increasingly challenging as the market matures. Expert predictions for DOGE in 2025 vary widely: Some experts forecasts a maximum value of $0.392. While others suggest a more conservative range of $0.17 to $0.202. One expert presents an optimistic scenario of breaching $1, potentially reaching $1.072. While DOGE maintains a strong community, its ability to replicate past parabolic runs remains uncertain. The 2025 landscape may require more than meme power to achieve 15,800% gains. XRP (Ripple) Analysis XRP’s trajectory is closely tied to Ripple’s legal battles and institutional adoption. Recent favorable rulings in its SEC case have bolstered investor confidence. XRP’s integration into global payment networks positions it well for potential growth. Price predictions for XRP in 2025 are bullish but varied: Some experts project XRP reaching between $5 and $7 7 . More conservative estimates suggest a range of $0.426124 to $0.5841545. XRP’s potential for explosive growth hinges on regulatory clarity and increased adoption in cross-border payments. While significant gains are possible, reaching 15,800% from current levels appears ambitious. THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN: The Potential 15,800% Breakout Token THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN has emerged as a dark horse, combining political backing with crypto innovation. Its presale success, raising $3.5 million by February 20, 2025, signals strong investor appetite. With a current price of $0.0001978 and an anticipated listing price of $0.007, MAGACOIN presents an enticing opportunity for explosive growth. Key factors driving MAGACOIN’s potential include: Limited supply of 100 billion tokens, creating scarcity Strong community backing with over 60,000 supporters Unique blend of political branding and crypto innovation Analysts predict a potential 1000% surge post-listing, with some suggesting even higher possibilities given the token’s unique positioning. ACT FAST! ENTER MAGA50X NOW AND CLAIM YOUR 50% EXTRA BONUS! Comparative Growth Potential: Which Crypto Has the Edge? While Dogecoin and XRP offer established track records, their potential for 15,800% growth faces significant hurdles: Dogecoin: 122-196% potential growth from current prices to 2025 highs. XRP: Predictions range from 100% to 1,300% growth, falling short of the 15,800% target. THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN, however, stands out with its explosive presale momentum and unique market position. Its limited supply and growing demand create a perfect storm for potential hypergrowth. While achieving 15,800% gains remains speculative, MAGACOIN’s early-stage entry point and viral traction make it the most likely candidate among the three to approach such astronomical returns. Secure Your Stake in THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN Before the Next Surge! As we look towards 2025, Dogecoin and XRP remain strong contenders in the crypto space, but their ability to deliver 15,800% returns is constrained by market cap and existing adoption levels. THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN, with its presale dominance and projected hypergrowth, emerges as the most attractive high-reward investment opportunity. The combination of scarcity, political backing, and community-driven demand positions MAGACOIN uniquely in the market. While all cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, MAGACOIN’s potential for exponential growth makes it a compelling option for investors seeking outsized returns. Don’t miss out on this limited-time opportunity to be part of MAGACOIN’s journey. Early entry could be crucial for maximising potential returns with the next price increase imminent and exchange listings on the horizon.

For the most part of the year, the value of Solana has oscillated around the $200 zone, and with other altcoins poised to gain 10x or more, investors are taking a closer look at these opportunities. More and more investors are now targeting RCO Finance due to its high utility and ability to generate greater returns, which is a more desirable option in the current market. Why RCOF Could Outperform Solana in 2025 At the core of RCO Finance is its Robo Advisor, an advanced AI-driven tool created to address the complexities of the cryptocurrency market. This will enable investors to make more informed decisions in a market always evolving. Let’s take a look at Solana during the second half of 2024. The crypto asset reached a six-month high of $188 on expectations of a more cryptocurrency-friendly regulatory environment with President Trump at the helm. Bitcoin also surpassed $100,000 in November 2024, and investors who entered early amassed significant profits. A tool like the Robo Advisor could have caught emerging trends early, allowing investors to join at favorable prices. By continuously monitoring market conditions, the Robo Advisor provides timely suggestions, enabling users to adjust their portfolios so as to secure profits. The Alpha platform is in the final stages of development, and this will bring new improvements to the Robo Advisor. As the bull run approaches, this is one tool everyday savvy investors should have in their arsenal. On top of the Robo Advisor, RCO Finance offers exposure to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 categories. This range provides investors with the power to build diversified portfolios based on their financial goals. Whether investors are interested in old school stocks, cryptocurrencies, or emerging assets like tokenized real estate, RCO Finance has you covered. RCO Finance also offers a KYC-free experience, allowing you to invest and trade without having to go through time-consuming procedures. This will help you get into the market immediately to grab opportunities as they arise. Holders of the RCOF tokens also have the added benefit of earning passive income through staking. Now, investors can lock tokens and let their money work for them. Token holders also have unlimited access to all the features mentioned above. The Beta platform is now live, and investors can interact with some of the platform’s AI features. The platform will receive regular updates to ensure it functions at the best level possible. Join the Token Presale Today One token is currently priced at $0.1, and analysts claim that the token is still highly undervalued. Soon, the price will rise to $0.13, and by then, your potential profit margins will be lost forever. A modest investment of $2,000 could lock in $80,000 or more at the end of the presale. With 10,000 users already onboard, RCO Finance’s popularity will only increase from here. RCO Finance has been audited by SolidProof . The company thoroughly scanned its smart contracts and platform’s codes, and RCO Finance surpassed expectations. The audit confirms the platform’s commitment to making sure that investments are safe and secure. Investors who get in now could secure life-changing profits. Don’t miss the opportunity to secure your financial future in 2025.

While the altcoin has shown some stability over the past day, there is no indication of price recovery. Amid these developments, X digital asset analysis handle More Crypto Online has shared some market updates highlighting important price levels for the XRP market. Related Reading: Altseason On The Way? Key DeFi Developments Signal Major Crypto Surge XRP Bulls Await Breakout Confirmation As Market Remains Neutral In a new X post on February 22, More Crypto Online provides an intriguing XRP price analysis identifying the needed conditions for a bullish or bearish development. According to these analysts, XRP is currently in neutral consolidation range indicating neither bulls nor bears are welding market control. Based on the Elliot Wave Theory, it is understood the altcoin is holding well above the critical price of $2.47 which allows a bullish orange scenario to remain viable. XRP enthusiasts must avoid any decisive price fall below this support level which could activate a yellow bearish scenario. In this case, XRP could slide into a downtrend with potential support levels identified at $2.34, $2.22, $2.11, and $1.95. On the other hand, aside from staying above $2.47, More Crypto Online states that market bulls must force a price surge above the $2.75 resistance zone to confirm any bullish breakout. Thereafter, XRP could surge to above $3.30. Interestingly, fellow analyst Egrag Crypto presents a higher validation point for the XRP bullish case, stating a monthly close above $3.00 is needed to show sufficient buying pressure for a sustained uptrend. As reported by NewsBTC, this development would pave the way for a new all-time high of around $6.00.

At press time, XRP trades at $2.56 reflecting a 0.84% in the past day. Meanwhile, the altcoin’s monthly losses have now increased to 16.18%. XRP has failed to struggle to regain its bullish form from November 2024 due to multiple factors including widespread market uncertainty. However, data from CoinMarketCap reflects that the altcoin community remains largely bullish with expectations of long-term profitability. This optimism can be attributed to factors such as the growing potential of XRP Spot ETF amidst strong investor confidence in the new US administration’s pro-crypto approach. Interestingly, this policy change has shown significant rewards as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) abruptly withdrew its lawsuit against Coinbase Exchange. If a similar development occurs in the Commission’s case against Ripple, it could translate into a major bullish driver for the XRP market.

Mantle (MNT) – Elevating Ethereum with Layer-2 Innovation Mantle is reshaping the blockchain landscape with its Layer-2 solution designed to supercharge Ethereum’s scalability.

Since its inception, Notcoin has captivated a growing audience with its engaging, straightforward gameplay integrated seamlessly with Telegram, ensuring exceptional user retention. As it plans to expand its reach within Telegram’s ecosystem, Notcoin’s trajectory points towards significant growth, especially as gaming and crypto continue to merge, positioning it among the best crypto gems to buy right now for gaming enthusiasts and Web3 pioneers. 4. Stacks (STX) – Propelling Bitcoin into the Smart Contract Era Stacks introduces a transformative layer to Bitcoin by integrating smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) directly atop the Bitcoin blockchain. Unlike other Layer-2 options that focus on Ethereum, Stacks taps into Bitcoin’s robust security to enable a new realm of possibilities for Bitcoin-centric development. The rising interest in Bitcoin-native applications marks Stacks as a significant player in the blockchain arena. With Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and recent value surges, Stacks gains from the network’s unmatched security and established reputation. As Bitcoin evolves past its traditional role as a digital store of value, Stacks opens a gateway for investors eager to explore Bitcoin’s burgeoning smart contract and dApp ecosystem. This positions Stacks as the best crypto gem to buy right now for those intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin’s Layer-2 advancements.

With AI-powered trading, cross-chain compatibility, and privacy-focused tools, 1FUEL redefines digital asset management. Investor interest is soaring, with over $2.32 million raised in its ongoing ICO, solidifying its position as one of the most anticipated Web3 projects of 2025. Shiba Inu news: price dips as market struggles for a rebound Shiba Inu (SHIB) maintains a low price at $0.00001568 after experiencing a seven percent decline during the past week and a 2% decline in the previous 24 hours. Shiba Inu presents strong resistance to investors because its trading volume exceeds $170.04 million, while its market capitalization stands at $9.24 billion. A death cross on Shiba Inu’s daily chart, where the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, suggests further downside. Whale transactions for Shiba Inu declined by 79% during the preceding three-month period, indicating that major investors show less interest in the coin. In other Shiba Inu news, the upgraded ShibaSwap system provides better liquidity pool features and real-time reporting, which boosts investor interaction. The destruction rate for Shiba Inu tokens increased by 120%, removing 128 million tokens in seven days. The analysts at Telegaon believe Shiba Inu will reach $0.0000728 by 2025 because adoption will rise and market sentiment will transform. The ongoing development and burning processes create long-term potential for SHIB, although investors should exercise caution. Why is Bonk dropping? Factors behind Iis recent decline Bonk (BONK) has a current market value of $0.00001627 and a market capitalization of $1.25 billion, with daily transactions reaching $81.88 million. Bonk’s price has dropped significantly by 52.67% over the last month, mostly because traders have withdrawn their funds, and its system has been minimally innovated. Even though market sentiment declines, Bonk maintains its position in the market through its dedicated community members who show interest in meme tokens. According to the latest Bonk news, the weekly chart indicates a bullish engulfing pattern demonstrating emerging buyer interest. Experts predict that improved market sentiment could lead to such indicators becoming signals that the price might reverse. Integrating Bonk into Decentralized Finance applications will create new use cases that bring sustained value to the platform. The Telegaon analysts project that Bonk will achieve an average value of $0.000032 in 2025 when specific positive factors emerge. The success of the meme coin depends on ecosystem growth and adoption so that it may experience a powerful resurgence. 1Fuel’s roadmap: The future of decentralized trading and multi-chain transactions The crypto space highly praised 1Fuel (OFT) because of its revolutionary technology and practical real-world applications. The forthcoming secure multi-chain wallet combined with decentralized exchange functions will transform trader management of digital assets. Users can easily exchange tokens through the platform’s cross-chain system using a single-click operation while avoiding multiple wallet management issues. 1Fuel operates a peer-to-peer exchange that lets users privately complete secure, unmediated, and rapid trades. Through its staking program, investors obtain substantial returns, up to a maximum of 30% APR. 1Fuel utilizes AI-powered trading technologies and intelligent features to dominate DeFi operations. The anticipation grows stronger as the Beta Wallet launch approaches. All investors who purchase $2,000 worth of tokens in the presale period will receive front-line access to the product. Early backers receiving first access to Beta Wallet features will happen earlier because $3 million is reached during the presale period ending on February 23. About 218 million tokens have been sold in the presale phase of 1Fuel, while the project has collected more than $2.32 million, bringing it close to finishing its presale period. Analysts expect the value of $0.018 tokens to surpass 100x its initial price point when major exchanges integrate them, leading experts to consider this venture one of the most promising crypto opportunities.

Therefore, it is not surprising that these investors are considering 1Fuel (OFT) Exchange, a platform with its DeFi token in the presale stage that is expected to have a 100x gain in the first year of its launch, as the successor. Read on to understand why. Meme Coins struggle in the market and most could soon take a dive When meme coins entered the crypto world, the community blossomed. However, with meme coins, every investment automatically becomes risky as is evident in certain meme coins. Two noteworthy examples are the recent PEPE price predictions made by experts, who say that a crash from its current price of $0.000009 is imminent and analyses showing that PENGU might drastically drop from $0.0088 very soon. Pepe, a deflationary frog-themed meme coin created to honor Pepe the Frog has made a name for itself by being honest with its community about its lack of utility since launching. Still, it quickly rose as one of the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. Yet, Pepe’s price prediction implies a crash soon, and with a 65.6% drop from an ATH of 0.00002825, the downtrend might be even closer than expected. PENGU, the official coin of the NFT project “Pudgy Penguins” was launched on the 17th of December, 2024, and quickly rose to an ATH of $0.05738. This token was designed solely to boost engagement within its community by giving early access to NFT drops, helping them unlock special features, and providing special in-game experiences. Since its launch, PENGU has taken a nosedive, dropping by 84.6% from it’s all-time high to a current price of $0.0088. Despite the achievements and contributions of these meme coins to the crypto market, their future remains uncertain. Experts predict that several meme coins will either break beyond resistance points and reach a new ATH by 2025 or embark on another bearish run. Investors who have since been worried and anticipating a price crash are starting to find alternative projects to safeguard their liquidity. 1Fuel: Taking over the crypto-verse with innovation 1Fuel is a new project already causing a sensation in the community. It is set to take the reins from its predecessors and lead everybody willing to give it a chance to crypto paradise. Although it is still in its fourth presale stage, it has pulled off a sale of 219 million tokens raising $2.3 million in the process. With its wallet launch already upon us, investors can expect smooth sailing transactions with their one-click solution for cross-chain transactions. Analysts forecast 1Fuel to gain at least 100x in the first year of its launch and this already has investors buzzing. Still selling at $0.018, 1Fuel is the way to go for crypto enthusiasts and experts alike. We live in a world where one right decision can set you up for life and earn you financial freedom and this possibility is further amplified in the crypto-verse.

Solana Under Pressure as Bybit Hacker Launders Stolen Funds Through Pump.Fun Memecoins Solana (SOL) experienced another wave of steep losses on Sunday despite early recovery tailwinds within the crypto market. Notably, top altcoins like Ethereum, and Tron (TRX) erased considerable portions of losses booked in the aftermath of the Bybit crash on Friday, while Solana price has plunged even further. The chart below shows how Solana price declined by 4% within the daily timeframe, trading at $167 lower that the $170 bottom recorded during the initial crash on Friday. Solana (SOL) Price Action Feb 23, 2025 The latest SOL price slump has been linked to reports that hackers linked to the $1.4 billion Bybit hack are using the solana’ memecoin launchpad Pump.Fun platform to launder the funds stolen from ByBit. Citing official data from Solana blockchain explorer Solscan, Blockchain analytics platform WuBlockchain alerted market watchers to a series of transactions linked to the stolen funds. According to Solana blockchain explorer Solscan, blockchain analytics platform WuBlockchain identified suspicious transactions tied to the stolen assets: “Bybit exploiter is laundering money by issuing memecoins on Pump.Fun. The Bybit exploiter (5STkQy…95T7Cq) transferred 60 SOL to 9Gu8v6…aAdqWS, who then launched a token called QinShihuang (500,000), which has traded over $26 million.” WuBlockchain, Feb 23, 2025 This move could effectively nullify the possibility of a rollback , an outcome which has propelled Ethereum price by 8% as it reclaimed the $2,800 territory at the time of writing. However, it sparked negative sentiment for the Solana network, as key opinion leaders began to berate the blockchain for a second major link to an high-profile exploit, a week after controversy broke out around Argentina President Javier Milei’s involvement with the LIBRA memecoin rug-pull . “Solana is being used to launder stolen funds from Bybit. No need to beg for rollback, it has always been a wash chain.” – CardanoHumpback, Feb 22, 2025 $2 Billion FTX Unlock Could Compound Solana’s Short-Term Woes With SOL now trading below its previous local bottom, concerns are mounting over further downside risk. Adding to the bearish outlook is the ongoing repayment process for victims of the collapsed FTX exchange. According to Bitget, over $800 million in funds were distributed to 160,000 customer accounts starting February 18. Bitcoin researcher PeddyXBT has pointed out that an additional 11.2 million SOL (approximately $2.03 billion) is due for distribution on March 1, less than a week away. FTX Estate set to Unlock 11.2 million SOL ($2.03 billion) While he noted that over-the-counter (OTC) sales could mitigate immediate selling pressure, the 4% decline in SOL price on Sunday suggests majority of traders are exercising caution. In summary, Solana’s Pump.Fun being used to launder Bybit hack funds—mere days before the $2 billion FTX asset unlock—could prompt strategic investors to reduce their SOL exposure. If selling pressure intensifies, further declines may be on the horizon in the coming trading sessions. Solana Price Forecast: $150 Breakdown Likely if Bearish Risks Crystalize Solana price forecast charts suggests further downside as bearish signals mount, with SOL trading at $168.08 after a 4% weekly decline. The daily chart shows price action constrained below the midline of the Bollinger Bands at $185.89, reflecting ongoing selling pressure. SOL remains pinned beneath the 50-day moving average at $185, reinforcing the bearish outlook as long as it struggles to reclaim this level. Trading volume at 1.44K suggests weakening market participation, limiting upside potential. Solana Price Forecast (SOLUSDT) The Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator at -21.90 signals a firm grip by bears, extending a prolonged negative momentum streak. If this pressure continues, SOL could break below the lower Bollinger Band at $160.58, paving the way for a retest of psychological support at $150. A confirmed breakdown below this threshold could trigger an extended decline toward the next demand zone near $135. Conversely, a decisive bounce off current levels, backed by increased buying volume, could see SOL reclaim $170. A move past the $185 resistance would invalidate immediate bearish projections and open the door to a potential recovery toward $211. However, without a shift in trading volume dynamics, bearish risks remain dominant.

40751033,https://nulltx.com/?p=145694,1740356947,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Panshibi (SHIBI) TOP TRENDING Presale Is Nearly Over: Litecoin (LTC) Positive 30% Gains Show Strengths In Old Age,https://nulltx.com/panshibi-shibi-top-trending-presale-is-nearly-over-litecoin-ltc-positive-30-gains-show-strengths-in-old-age/,"Litecoin’s months-long consolidation between $90 and $130 has left traders questioning if Litecoin gains could manifest soon or if the coin remains stalled. Meanwhile, a new comedic contender called Panshibi (SHIBI) priced at $0.005 has raised over $1 million in presale, signaling a craving for higher-upside meme coins. As LTC struggles with whale-driven resistance, SHIBI might steal the spotlight in a market hungry for fresh comedic narratives. Litecoin Gains Under Pressure Litecoin (LTC) trades near $127 but struggles to surpass key resistance between $90 and $130, reflecting a wider trend of sideways movement. Market observers highlight that Litecoin gains are largely stifled by whale manipulation, as these major holders appear to sell on price spikes and buy during dips. Despite a 50% rise in LTC’s price during its recent consolidation phase, an enduring breakout remains elusive. The asset’s inability to crack $130 has limited upward potential, triggering cautious sentiment among traders expecting a more sustained push. Analytics firm IntoTheBlock reveals that whale behavior ties in closely with Netflow readings on exchanges, indicating how major LTC holders tend to shift tokens for quick trades. This pattern, often referred to as “ramping up withdrawals and deposits,” underscores the barrier to consistent Litecoin gains. Even so, a sudden uptick in trading volume like February’s 60% surge can spark fleeting rallies. Some analysts foresee a run toward $180 if LTC finally pushes past $130 , though any failure near resistance might send the price tumbling back to $150 or lower. Panshibi’s Final Surge While Litecoin’s gains fluctuate due to significant whale activity, Panshibi (SHIBI) has gained attention through its successful presale and humorous panda theme. Priced at $0.005, Panshibi offers a structured approach to meme coin security, locking liquidity for ten years and team tokens for two. These measures address concerns that plague many meme projects like sudden rug pulls thus fostering trust among speculators. The contract has also been audited, boosting confidence for those wary of quick collapses. Early adopters highlight Panshibi’s AI-based “social-fi,” which nudges the community to stake and complete quests, prolonging engagement well after launch. Some LTC holders, frustrated by whale suppression and modest Litecoin gains, have begun experimenting with $SHIBI in search of higher returns. Supporters say Panshibi’s lighter brand and quest-based rewards might stand out if the meme coin sector reignites this year. Although there’s no guarantee of explosive growth, the token’s structured tokenomics and comedic angle appeal to traders used to dog- or frog-themed assets. Should LTC’s sideways pattern continue, Panshibi could siphon off investor attention as the next meme star. In a hyper-volatile environment, novelty plus security often command premium interest. Conclusion As many track Litecoin gains for clues on altcoin sentiment, Panshibi’s presale emerges as a strong contender among meme coins. Whale manipulation keeps LTC pinned between $90 and $130, hindering a meaningful breakout. Meanwhile, Panshibi’s success so far demonstrates traders’ readiness to explore new comedic tokens that promise more than just hype. If LTC rallies past critical resistance, it might pave the way for broader altcoin optimism but if whales maintain their grip, capital could flow toward fresh comedic narratives like Panshibi ($SHIBI). In a market torn between caution and speculation, both LTC and Panshibi could shape the meme coin storyline in the months ahead.

Analysts Weigh In,https://nulltx.com/is-pepeto-the-best-presale-to-invest-in-will-shib-ever-recover-analysts-weigh-in/,"Investors often look for chances to make significant profit. While old tokens such as Shiba Inu ($SHIB) have issues, new projects like Pepeto ($PEPETO) attract interest because of strong basics and market promise. Pepeto costs only $0.000000112 each in presale and has raised over $4.7 million. Compared to standard memecoins that depend solely on buzz, # PEPETO builds an ecosystem with staking, a chain bridge, and its exchange for memecoins. With clear allocations and a plan for long-term growth, many analysts say Pepeto might be the top crypto purchase in 2025. Shiba Inu’s Struggles: Road to Recovery Shiba Inu ($SHIB) was once a top memecoin but now struggles in a hard market. In the past month, its price fell by 22.50% and its current price is $0.0000157 with a market cap of $9.26 billion. https://x.com/pepetocoin/status/1874260504891240897?s=46 {Embed} Despite the drop a notable event occurred – SHIB burned over 6 million tokens with an 800% increase in its burn rate. Token burns may cut supply and help value over time; however, experts doubt this will reverse selling and lift SHIB’s price. Why Investors Are Betting on PEPETO Over SHIB The difference between # PEPETO and SHIB shows why many investors now search for new projects with fresh ideas. While SHIB cannot get back its past strength, Pepeto’s presale attracts investors because of strong basics and a community plan. Pepeto uses staking and controls liquidity to provide lasting strength, unlike SHIB. SHIB burns tokens to reduce supply, yet it holds too many coins which can slow future growth. Investors who seek high gains see more promise in Pepeto. PEPETO vs. SHIB: Which Has the Better Future? Shiba Inu has a loyal community and a record of market gains, yet its recent losses create doubts about its chance to keep growing. Pepeto aims to be the new memecoin by linking meme culture with actual blockchain use. With its fixed presale, clear plan along with fresh method, #PEPETO comes up as a strong rival in the field. Investors who missed the first SHIB rally now view Pepeto as a possible means for big gains. At the same time, #WALLSTREETPEPE proved that new memecoins with solid bases may beat older tokens. If Pepeto holds its pace, it might outdo older memecoins like SHIB in the next market surge. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xDqgktMKkU {Embed} Conclusion: Is Pepeto the Best Memecoin Investment Right Now? As the crypto market gets ready for its next cycle, the search for the best meme coin to buy grows stronger. While SHIB still struggles, Pepeto’s presale success shows its potential. By raising over $4.7 million, smart money goes into # PEPETO . Its ecosystem-based plan with an early entry price makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. { Add Hyperlink to Banner: http://pepeto.io } To participate in the ongoing presale or to start staking PEPETO, visit Pepeto’s official website at pepeto.io .

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 857,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on the OTHERS chart, an altcoin index that tracks the market cap of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins. According to Pentoshi, OTHERS appears to be carving a local bottom at $250 billion and is now threatening to shatter its immediate resistance at $281 billion. “Alts potential low time frame double bottom forming from $250 billion. Still think we played this very well overall, and looking for it to go back toward $281 billion once again. Reclaim that and we get a nice move up for some actual relief.” Source: Pentoshi/X A double-bottom pattern is a bullish reversal structure indicating that an asset or index has formed a solid demand area and is setting the stage for an upside burst. Pentoshi predicts that OTHERS can surge by about 15% if it takes out resistance at $281 billion. “Looking better and better, the market has had numerous opportunities to sell off. Potential lower high at $320 billion range. Again, that area is likely the most important to watch as well as $250 billion for the next major trend in my opinion.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, OTHERS is trading for $271.63 billion. One altcoin on the trader’s radar is the native asset of the layer-1 protocol Injective ( INJ ). According to the analyst, INJ appears to be respecting its high time frame support at $14 and is looking for a bounce toward $17.58. “Still looking good, hit $16 already, now looking for a move further up.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, INJ is worth $15.26.

Both cryptocurrencies are experiencing crucial shifts, with Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra and Fusaka updates aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Meanwhile, XRP’s outlook is strengthening due to growing optimism surrounding a potential ETF approval and ongoing regulatory discussions. Analysts predict steady growth for both, with traders monitoring essential price levels. As these developments unfold, blockchain’s role in online shopping is becoming more evident. Web3Bay is introducing a decentralized shopping experience that removes intermediaries, enabling direct transactions between buyers and sellers. Offering a variety of products, from high-end goods to digital assets, Web3Bay is demonstrating that blockchain technology extends far beyond finance—it’s transforming e-commerce as well. Web3Bay: A Blockchain-Based Alternative to Traditional Online Marketplaces E-commerce giants like Amazon operate on a centralized structure that imposes third-party fees and limits direct interactions between buyers and sellers. Web3Bay takes a different approach, leveraging blockchain to create a marketplace where transactions are executed securely and without unnecessary intermediaries. This ensures that sellers retain more of their profits while buyers enjoy fair pricing and reduced costs. The platform supports a wide range of products, including luxury items, gaming assets, and digital collectibles, all facilitated through smart contracts and cryptocurrency payments. Unlike traditional platforms, where users have little control over policies, Web3Bay operates with a community-driven governance model. Those holding 3BAY tokens actively participate in decision-making, influencing platform updates and regulations. Payments are processed through cryptocurrency, minimizing fraud risks and ensuring quick transactions. Future plans include PayPal integration, making it easier for mainstream users to embrace blockchain-based shopping. Web3Bay’s early success is evident in its ongoing presale, which has already raised over $1.5 million, with more than 375 million 3BAY tokens sold. Priced at $0.004562625, the token’s value proposition lies in its governance utility and marketplace benefits. As traditional marketplaces face criticism over high fees and restrictive policies, Web3Bay is proving that blockchain-based shopping can offer a better alternative with clear advantages for both buyers and sellers. XRP Price Forecast: ETF Speculation and SEC Developments Drive Optimism XRP is gaining traction as speculation grows around a potential ETF approval. The SEC’s recent acknowledgment of Grayscale’s application for an XRP ETF has sparked discussions regarding institutional investment. While approval remains uncertain, this step suggests that XRP is increasingly being recognized as a regulated financial asset. Adding to the anticipation, the SEC has scheduled a closed-door meeting on February 20, with reports hinting that it may withdraw its appeal in the ongoing legal dispute with Ripple. Should this occur, it would mark a significant shift in XRP’s regulatory landscape, potentially boosting long-term investor confidence. At present, XRP is valued at $2.69, with technical analysts identifying a cup-and-handle pattern that could push the price toward $3.35. Meanwhile, financial institutions like Frankenmuth Credit Union are beginning to offer XRP trading through online banking services, reflecting the asset’s growing adoption in the banking sector. As regulatory clarity improves, investors are closely watching XRP’s price trajectory. Ethereum: Upcoming Enhancements and Staking Proposals Fuel Market Interest Ethereum is preparing for a series of upgrades with Pectra and Fusaka set to launch in April 2025. These enhancements focus on improving efficiency and lowering transaction fees, which have already decreased by 70% ahead of the official rollout. Market sentiment remains strong, with experts predicting Ethereum could climb to $4,000–$8,000 in the near future. Additionally, whale investors have been withdrawing ETH from exchanges, suggesting an accumulation phase that could indicate future price appreciation. Beyond technical improvements, Ethereum’s staking model is also under review. The New York Stock Exchange has submitted a proposal for a rule change that would allow Grayscale’s spot Ether ETFs to include staking rewards. If approved, this could attract more institutional interest in Ethereum’s ecosystem. While XRP’s price outlook remains a focal point, Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades and increasing adoption make it a strong contender for long-term growth. Final Thoughts The potential approval of an XRP ETF and the SEC’s upcoming closed meeting could bring clarity to its regulatory standing, influencing its market trajectory. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s Pectra and Fusaka updates are already driving down transaction fees, and discussions around ETF staking could further boost institutional participation. These key changes highlight the evolving nature of both assets, with investors keeping a close eye on upcoming movements. As cryptocurrency reshapes financial systems, Web3 e-commerce is redefining how people shop online. By eliminating intermediaries and enabling direct transactions, Web3Bay offers a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to traditional platforms. The presale’s success, with over $1.5 million raised, demonstrates a strong interest in this new approach. As more users explore blockchain-powered shopping, Web3Bay is proving that decentralized e-commerce is not just a concept—it’s already a reality.

With 94% of Phase 1 tokens snapped up, the window to buy at $0.01, the lowest price point, is closing rapidly. Investors who delay risk missing a guaranteed 600% return at launch, as prices will jump 50% in Phase 2. While established names like Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) show potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the standout opportunity, backed by real-world utility and a presale frenzy hinting at a 100x surge to $1 in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE): A Meme Coin Eyeing a Risky Rebound Dogecoin has stumbled into a bearish cycle this year, plunging from $0.48 in December to $0.26. Bitcoin’s stagnant price action, lingering between $90,000 and $109,000, has drained momentum from meme coins like DOGE. A sell-off following Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, where Elon Musk’s advisory role briefly boosted sentiment, further accelerated declines. The crypto fear and greed index dropping to 39 reflects eroding confidence, leaving DOGE struggling to regain footing. Technical charts suggest a possible rebound via an Elliott Wave pattern, where DOGE could rally 276% to $1 after completing its current corrective phase. However, this projection hinges on Bitcoin’s recovery and overcoming resistance levels, a process likely stretching deep into 2025. While DOGE’s loyal community and speculative appeal remain, its path to $1 is fraught with volatility, making it a high-risk bet compared to presale-stage projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Solana (SOL): Institutional Support Meets Technical Uncertainty Solana’s price has dipped to $174, down 40% from its January 2025 peak of $294.85. Despite this slump, Coinbase’s launch of CFTC-regulated SOL futures has injected optimism, potentially stabilizing prices through increased institutional liquidity. Technical indicators hint at a turnaround, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nearing oversold levels and an emerging Elliott Wave structure suggesting a rally to $180 if support at $160 holds. While Solana’s ecosystem growth and Coinbase’s backing are positive signals, its recovery depends heavily on broader market trends. Analysts note SOL remains vulnerable to Bitcoin’s volatility, and its 9.56% weekly drop underscores lingering bearish pressure. For investors seeking near-term gains, Solana’s uncertain trajectory pales next to Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale, which offers defined returns at launch and a clear path to triple-digit growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Presale Powerhouse Primed for a 100x Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is dominating attention as its presale rockets past $1 million, fueled by a decentralized lending platform poised to disrupt DeFi. The project’s structured ecosystem, featuring peer-to-contract lending, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a buy-and-distribute rewards model, combines innovation with tangible demand. Early investors locking in tokens at $0.01 today will secure a guaranteed 600% profit at launch, when MUTM hits exchanges at $0.06. Post-launch, experts forecast a climb to $1 in 2025, driven by platform adoption and a tokenomics model designed to sustain buying pressure. A beta version of Mutuum’s lending protocol will debut alongside its exchange listing, ensuring immediate utility and user engagement. Additionally, 30% of platform fees will fund continuous MUTM buybacks, redistributing tokens to stakers and creating scarcity. With a $100,000 giveaway accelerating community growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another altcoin, it’s a calculated entry into high-yield DeFi with mechanics engineered for exponential returns. Solana and Dogecoin offer speculative opportunities, but neither matches the asymmetric risk-reward profile of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project’s Phase 1 presale, priced at $0.01, is a limited-time gateway to a 600% gain at launch and a potential 100x return as its ecosystem matures. With 94% of Phase 1 tokens already sold, the clock is ticking. Investors eyeing life-changing gains in 2025 must act quickly, before the next price hike locks them out of the crypto opportunity of the year. Secure your MUTM tokens today and position for the 6645% surge ahead.

The presale phase presents a unique chance to acquire tokens at the lowest price before they become publicly available, making it an ideal moment to invest for long-term gains. Among the many upcoming projects, Web3Bay (3BAY) is leading as the best crypto presale due to its real-world use case, decentralized marketplace approach, and an anticipated 4200% return on investment upon launch. Unlike meme coins that rely on hype, Web3Bay is reshaping online shopping by eliminating intermediaries, cutting transaction costs, and giving users full control over their buying and selling experience. With over $1.50 million raised and 375 million tokens sold, Web3Bay’s presale is moving quickly, demonstrating strong investor demand. Here’s why this project is making waves in 2025 and why now is the right time to secure a position. Web3Bay (3BAY): The Leading Crypto Presale of 2025 Web3Bay is setting a new standard in e-commerce by introducing a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers engage directly without relying on third parties. Unlike established platforms such as Amazon or eBay, Web3Bay eliminates high service fees, removes payment restrictions, and ensures privacy through blockchain technology, creating a transparent and secure trading environment. The Web3Bay presale is gaining rapid traction, with the token currently priced at $0.00456, expected to climb to $0.1959 at launch—offering early buyers the potential for a 4200% gain. As blockchain adoption grows, decentralized platforms like Web3Bay are expected to redefine online commerce, making this one of the top crypto presales to consider. Why Web3Bay is a Must-Buy: Decentralized Trading – Direct transactions between buyers and sellers, cutting out unnecessary fees from centralized platforms. Flexible Payment Options – Supports both cryptocurrency and fiat payments (including PayPal) for broader accessibility. Secure Transactions – A smart contract-based escrow system protects users from fraud. Staking Rewards – Earn passive income by staking 3BAY tokens while contributing to the platform’s security. Community Governance – Token holders have decision-making power through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). High Demand – Over $1.50 million was raised in presale, reflecting strong investor interest. With blockchain technology revolutionizing industries, Web3Bay is positioned as a leader in decentralized e-commerce. Investors are taking advantage of the presale pricing before the next increase, making 3BAY one of the most attractive altcoins to buy now. Mind of Pepe ($MIND): AI-Powered Insights for Crypto Traders While Web3Bay focuses on e-commerce, Mind of Pepe ($MIND) is gaining attention for its AI-driven trading insights. Unlike most meme coins, $MIND utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze market trends, social sentiment, and blockchain data, helping traders make informed decisions. With over $6 million raised, Mind of Pepe is proving that AI-powered cryptocurrency projects are here to stay. The presale price is $0.0033188, with an annual staking reward of 380%, making it an appealing choice for passive income seekers. By using AI to track patterns and eliminate emotional trading, Mind of Pepe gives investors an edge in the highly unpredictable crypto market. Best Wallet ($BEST): A High-Tech Crypto Management Platform For those looking for a secure and efficient way to manage digital assets, Best Wallet ($BEST) stands out. This next-generation crypto wallet offers cross-chain compatibility, enabling users to handle assets across 60+ blockchain networks seamlessly. The project has already raised $9.8 million, attracting strong investor interest. Holding $BEST tokens grants exclusive benefits, including discounted trading fees, governance voting rights, and staking rewards of up to 169% APY. With a projected 40% market share in the crypto wallet sector by 2026, Best Wallet is a strong contender among presales for investors focused on long-term blockchain integration. Currently priced at $0.023975, this presale offers an excellent entry point before the token becomes available on major exchanges. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Presale Holds the Most Potential? The crypto presale market in 2025 is filled with high-potential projects, but only a few stand out. While Mind of Pepe introduces AI-driven insights and Best Wallet offers a seamless digital asset management solution, Web3Bay is leading the pack with its decentralized e-commerce model and an anticipated 4200% ROI. With blockchain technology expanding across industries, projects that provide real-world utility will drive the next major market surge. Web3Bay is at the forefront of this shift, making it the best crypto presale to buy right now. The presale is selling fast—will you secure your spot before the next price increase?

At the forefront of this transformation is a Matt Furie inspired FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a next-generation AI-powered meme coin that integrates artificial intelligence, DeFi, and blockchain technology. While PEPE has made its mark as another popular meme coin inspired by Matt Furie’s legendary Frog character, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is taking it a step further, using AI to redefine the meme market and positioning itself as the most promising investment in the meme market for 2025. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI Meme Evolution That Will Dominate 2025 FloppyPepe (FPPE) is built on the foundation of the Matt Furie legacy with cutting-edge AI-driven utilities. The meme coin’s community-driven approach is another major factor fueling its success. With its Telegram and X communities experiencing surging growth and a hand-drawn FloppyPepe art collection by a leading artist set for release, the project is capturing the imagination of investors and meme enthusiasts alike. The upcoming beta launch of its AI agents in two weeks further solidifies its place as the most advanced and promising Matt Furie coin in the meme market. Its Meme-o-Matic AI generator is an advanced tool that allows users to create viral meme content by submitting text, images, or videos. This feature alone sets FloppyPepe miles ahead of its competition, making it a true trailblazer in the meme market. The project’s AI ecosystem doesn’t stop there. The FloppyX video AI Agent is another game-changing feature that enables users to generate high-quality video content through an intelligent AI framework. This platform supports text-to-video generation, character consistency, and an automated video pipeline, empowering creators to develop unique and engaging content at an unprecedented scale. With the AI sector booming and AI-powered cryptocurrencies rapidly gaining traction, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to be one of the most lucrative investments of the upcoming bull run. The presale’s explosive success is proof of this momentum: It raised $500,000 in its first three days and is now on track to surpass $1 million in its first week. The tokenomics of FloppyPepe (FPPE) also boosts its long-term value. With a 1% burn mechanism embedded into every transaction, supply will continuously decrease, driving scarcity and price appreciation. Additionally, a 3% redistribution mechanism. Security and credibility are top priorities for FloppyPepe, addressing concerns about rug pulls and fraudulent meme projects. The platform boasts a diligently audited smart contract by SolidProof, reinforcing its commitment to transparency and investor protection. With the presale price at $0.0000002 and projected to surge by 1,780%, early investors stand to gain massive returns. As AI-driven crypto strategies continue to dominate, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the Matt Furie inspired coin that will conquer the meme market. PEPE: The Meme Market’s Classic Challenger Pepe (PEPE) has long been a dominant force in the meme market, with its branding tied directly to Matt Furie’s iconic character. PEPE capitalized on the widespread popularity of meme culture, attracting traders and community-driven hype. However, PEPE’s primary limitation is its lack of fundamental utility. While its price movements have delivered gains for some investors, its overreliance on hype and market trends makes it highly volatile. Despite its strong community presence, PEPE has yet to introduce any groundbreaking technology that would set it apart in the rapidly evolving crypto space. The Verdict: Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is The Clear Winner While PEPE remains an iconic name in the meme market, the future belongs to projects that combine meme culture with advanced technology. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is not just another Matt Furie meme coin; it is an AI-driven asset with real-world applications that extend far beyond speculation. Its integration of AI video and text-to-image generation, smart tokenomics, strong security infrastructure, and rapidly growing community make it the most promising meme coin for 2025. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) AI beta launches in two weeks. Its rapidly growing presale and projections of a 1,780% price increase present investors with a rare opportunity to participate in a project that is set to redefine the meme market.

The ETF provides a way for investors to profit from declines in Bitcoin pricing, offering a hedge or speculation against cryptocurrency market downturns. One of my favorite momentum-based trading formulas flashed a buy signal for BITI at the end of last week. This investment vehicle is designed for short-term trading and is not suitable for long-term holds due to the costs associated with creating its inverse positioning. I have a very useful and successful momentum formula that just flipped to a buy signal on ProShares Shrt Bitcoin ETF ( BITI ). This fund uses futures contracts to create a short position that will benefit owners if Bitcoin declines. So, if you have been searching for a way to play a correction or bear market in the bubble move for Bitcoin, BITI is the plain-vanilla choice for retail investors inside a normal brokerage portfolio (usually available in IRA and 401-k accounts). StockCharts.com - Bitcoin in U.S. Dollars, 2 Years of Daily Price & Volume Changes ProShares Short Bitcoin Background ProShares opened this ETF for business in June 2022, once futures were approved for trading. After the wicked ""inverse"" decline in the fund, going in the opposite direction of Bitcoin's monster gains of 2023-24, total assets under management have fallen to $98 million. The fund does charge 1.03% in fees annually to manage its holdings and list the fund. The ProShares website explains the investment objective as this, Pro Shares Short Bitcoin ETF seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to the inverse (-1x) of the daily performance of the Bloomberg Bitcoin Index. The website also does a good job of exploring the risk of investment loss, which has been a regular occurrence since Bitcoin only seems to rise in price the last couple of years. ProShares Website - BITI Risks Explained, February 22nd, 2025 ProShares Website - BITI Risks Explained, February 22nd, 2025 ETF holdings are quite simple to understand as of Friday's close (February 21st, 2025), with two futures contract expirations shorted, alongside cash held as collateral to create the inverse -1x position. The good news in today's financial market structure is cash investments do earn interest for ETF owners. ProShares Website - BITI Positions, February 21st, 2025 The bad news (and only realistic drawback to holding a BITI stake outside of Bitcoin prices continuing to zigzag higher) is Bitcoin futures participants put a nice premium value on contracts further out in time in anticipation of new cryptocurrency gains. This "" contango "" price condition costs extra money to generate BITI's -1x leverage, with monthly rollovers hurting the value of BITI. It has to do with crypto investment sentiment being uber-bullish today. If conventional wisdom flips to bearishness, with futures preparing for a bust, the opposite situation of futures selling for a discount to spot prices would appear ( backwardation ). CME Futures Exchange - Bitcoin Futures Pricing, February 21st, 2025 BITI Performance vs. Bitcoin The best way to describe how this short ETF works for investors in the real world is through a review of past trading. The ETF has paid out a dividend from cash interest coming in the door at a faster clip than management fees are being expensed (since December 2022). So, I will use total return comparisons vs. Bitcoin price changes. The main advantage of owning BITI vs. shorting futures directly is the design limits losses to -100% of your invested capital. If you are wrong on a short Bitcoin position in futures, you can lose many times your initial investment, where your broker requires you to add new money to keep your position. This concept is visible on the performance chart since inception below. Against the +368% Bitcoin gain since June 2022, BITI has declined just -87.6% in price. I know that's not the kind of loss anyone shoots for, but the idea of ""limited"" losses is fully on display. YCharts - BITI vs. Bitcoin, Total Returns, Since June 2022 That's not to say upside is limited in BITI. In fact, if Bitcoin were to collapse in value during 2025, the daily rebalance design of BITI could actually help compound gains in your favor, especially over shorter spans between futures contract rollovers. I am charting periods of sharp Bitcoin decline vs. BITI's oversized gains below. YCharts - BITI vs. Bitcoin, Total Returns, August 12th, 2022 to September 6th, 2022 YCharts - BITI vs. Bitcoin, Total Returns, April 11th, 2024 to August 5th, 2024 Latest Performance Stats In fact, BITI has performed quite admirably over the last four weeks, as the Trump-inspired euphoria in Bitcoin seems to be ebbing. YCharts - BITI vs. Bitcoin, Total Returns, 1 Month In general, the daily rebalance feature alongside cash interest have helped BITI to ""outperform"" its basic 1:1 design over the past year (albeit with major losses for the buy-and-hold crowd owning it greater than three months). YCharts - BITI vs. Bitcoin, Total Returns, 3 Months YCharts - BITI vs. Bitcoin, Total Returns, 6 Months YCharts - BITI vs. Bitcoin, Total Returns, 1 Year Final Thoughts In conclusion, if you are bullish on Bitcoin, please avoid this product. However, if you are looking for an angle to bet on a Bitcoin correction or even an all-out bust in 2025, BITI should absolutely be on your research list. Again, my plan is to buy a BITI position early next week, as one of my favorite momentum trading formulas is screaming now is a solid risk/reward moment to do so. An important trigger for my formula is a security's price getting back above its 50-day moving average, after suffering a major decline. While not expressly part of the formula, having rising trends in the Accumulation/Distribution Line , Negative Volume Index and On Balance Volume indicators over the past month are also a positive development. StockCharts.com - BITI, 12 Months of Daily Price & Volume Changes I cannot guarantee any type of positive return or trading profit, but the odds seem to favor at least a minor drop in Bitcoin over coming weeks, with a bump higher in BITI the likely reaction. It's entirely possible I will take a quick +10% to +20% gain in BITI, if such appears into March. Historically, holding this ETF longer than a few months has not outlined serious gains during Bitcoin's boom move in price. And, Bitcoin futures contract premiums do pose a stiff headwind currently in the marketplace. To achieve a +30% or better return in BITI, Bitcoin would have to drop by around the same amount, which may happen eventually, if and when Bitcoin busts. To me, this idea is more of a trade. I do not suggest holding BITI longer than several months. If you will, investors can just assume a defined sell date is appropriate, like a stop-loss idea, 6–8 weeks in the future. At that time, you sell your position, no matter the profit/loss level or your personal outlook for Bitcoin. Having an exit plan in leveraged ETFs is just as (if not more) critical as entering a buy decision. As a consequence, I have a 12-month outlook of Hold for the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. In addition, I would not be surprised by some sort of loss being the final destination for BITI trust holders by the end of 2025. Thanks for reading. Please consider this article a first step in your due diligence process.

As profits roll in, Ethereum (ETH) and XRP holders are turning to an emerging altcoin RCO Finance (RCOF) . The altcoin incorporates game-changing AI and blockchain technology that will revolutionize trading and investment strategies. As a result, analysts predict that RCOF could soar by a staggering 22,000%, delivering life-changing gains to early investors. Ethereum Recovery Amidst ETF Acknowledgement At press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,740, recording an uptick of 0.4% in the past 24 hours. Amid the broader market recovery, Ethereum (ETH) is gaining strength as it strives to sustain momentum above the $2,700 mark. With this short-term recovery, market sentiments are now positive as the SEC acknowledges the 19b-4 filing of the 21Shares Ethereum ETF for approval of Ethereum staking. If approved, this would become the first-ever Ethereum ETF to offer staking features in the US. Despite the potential gains, Ethereum holders are now looking beyond legacy blue-chip platforms and shifting focus to projects with high growth potential, like the RCOF altcoin. XRP: New Highs Expected After Brazilian ETF Approval In the past 24 hours, XRP has surged ahead of Bitcoin and Ethereum after approval of its first ETF in Brazil. XRP surged by 4.3% to reach $2.70, making it the best performer in the top 5 crypto by market cap. Hashdex, an asset management firm, acquired the regulatory approval to launch Brazil’s first spot XRP ETF. Ripple CEO Brand Garlinghouse acknowledged this by sharing a news report on his official X account . Institutional adoption for XRP is on the rise, and analysts predict that the altcoin price will rise even further. Amidst this prediction, XRP holders are shifting their profits to an emerging altcoin, RCOF, that promises high growth potential due to its game-changing approach to DeFi. RCO Finance: Emerging Altcoin Attracting Ethereum and XRP Holders Ethereum and XRP have dominated the crypto market for a long time. As the crypto market evolves, investors are seeking projects with high growth potential. Similarly, Ethereum and XRP holders are rotating their profits to RCOF, an emerging altcoin with a 22,000% ROI. At the core of RCOF is the AI Robo-advisor , designed to craft customized investment strategies based on a trader’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and market trends. This tailored approach makes RCOF users stand out in the competitive crypto market. Another outstanding feature of the RCOF altcoin that differentiates it from Ethereum and XRP is its AI-driven predictive analytics. The tool analyzes historical data, real-time trends, and social sentiments to predict price movements accurately. For instance, if an XRP trader is unsure whether to sell or hold, the RCOF AI scans market indicators like whale transactions, on-chain activity, and exchange inflow to provide data-driven forecasts. This technology will help investors make informed decisions to minimize risks and maximize returns in the volatile crypto market. Unlike Ethereum and XRP, the RCOF altcoin offers users a diverse asset selection of over 120,000 assets, including bonds, stocks, forex, and tokenized real-world assets. This enables investors to diversify their investment portfolios all under a single dashboard. Again, the altcoin offers a leverage option of up to 1000x on select assets. You will not find this feature anywhere else in the crypto market, thus making RCOF a game changer in the crypto market. With a small stake, investors can reap massive returns, which is ideal even for new investors starting out in trading. RCOF operates a no-KYC ecosystem ideal for Ethereum and XRP traders who prefer privacy and anonymity. Unlike legacy platforms that require lengthy ID verification, RCOF enables a seamless trading experience without onboarding friction. Security is paramount in the crypto space; hence RCOF has partnered with SolidProof to regularly audit its smart contracts. This guarantees that the platform is safe and secure, boosting investor confidence. The RCOF altcoin has set standards in the crypto market since it recently launched its AI Beta platform . This is a rare occurrence, as most crypto projects wait until the token’s official launch to test their technology. Over 10,000 active users are experiencing the Robo-advisor firsthand and getting a feel for how the platform operates. Since this is just the beta phase, investors should expect more enhancements in the Alpha phase under internal development. RCOF Presale Shines with a Potential 22,000% ROI Unlike Ethereum and XRP, which have experienced significant growth since their inception, RCOF is in its early stages, giving early entrants an opportunity to acquire the token at a low price before its price skyrockets. The RCOF presale is in stage 5, with tokens priced at $0.10. Already, the altcoin has raised $13.8 million in its presale, with over 38% of the allocated tokens in stage 5 sold out. Analysts predict that the listing price could be between $0.4 and $0.6, giving early investors a minimum of 500% ROI. However, the real excitement is in its post-launch projections, where analysts anticipate that the altcoin could soar by a staggering 22,000%. With real-world financial integrations, strong community backing, and a live beta platform, RCOF could be the biggest altcoin boom in 2025.

Web3Bay Becomes Hot Investment Pick,https://thecoinrise.com/xrp-price-forecast-could-an-etf-approval-propel-it-to-10-web3bay-becomes-hot-investment-pick/,"XRP’s price forecast is generating excitement as ETF approval odds jump to 81%, fueling bullish expectations. With the SEC reviewing applications from heavyweights like Grayscale and 21Shares, institutional investors are gearing up for a potential breakout. XRP recently shattered its $2.50 resistance, hitting $2.78 in response to the news. Experts suggest that surpassing $3.40 could pave the way for an explosive rally toward $10. While XRP’s institutional backing strengthens, another crypto is turning heads—Web3Bay, the fastest-growing presale of 2025. Unlike speculative tokens, Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace is disrupting online commerce, positioning itself as a major player in blockchain-driven transactions. With early investors eyeing a 4,200% ROI, let’s examine how XRP’s ETF speculation could push it past $10 and why Web3Bay is capturing market attention. XRP Price Forecast: Could an ETF Approval Spark a Massive Surge? Optimism surrounding XRP’s price is on the rise as Polymarket data shows ETF approval odds climbing to 81%. Recent filings from Grayscale and 21Shares indicate a shifting regulatory landscape, making the possibility of an XRP ETF stronger than ever. Past ETF approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum triggered institutional inflows, sending prices soaring. If XRP follows a similar pattern, analysts predict surpassing the $3.40 resistance could unlock a surge toward $10. Key resistance points are marked at $2.75, $2.94, and $3.22, with $3.40 being the critical threshold. Notable analyst EGRAG Crypto highlights $3.40 as the breakout zone, suggesting that a sustained close above this level could send XRP to record highs. Institutional interest continues to grow as traditional finance players seek exposure to blockchain assets. Currently, XRP trades at $2.73, marking a 6.76% rise in the last 24 hours. Investors are closely monitoring SEC actions, as an approved XRP ETF would validate Ripple’s courtroom success, opening the door for XRP to climb into double-digit territory by 2025. XRP ETF Approval: A Game Changer for Institutional Interest The SEC’s decision to review XRP ETF applications marks a major turning point. While experts like Bloomberg’s James Seyffart were initially skeptical about approval in 2025, the latest developments suggest otherwise. Under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, the SEC has 240 days to decide on ETF filings. This means institutional investors could gain direct access to XRP by the final quarter of 2025, mirroring previous moves with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market momentum is already shifting. XRP’s trading volume has spiked, and open interest in futures contracts is reaching new peaks. If the ETF gets the green light, analysts foresee a surge in institutional demand, potentially pushing XRP toward $10. However, some industry experts remain cautious. Weiss Crypto Ratings has raised concerns about XRP’s long-term dominance, arguing that stablecoins may take precedence in mainstream finance. Messari’s Ryan Selkis believes stablecoins have already won, while others, including Mike Novogratz, argue that XRP’s efficiency in global payments will sustain its relevance. Despite differing views, XRP’s upward momentum remains strong, and the potential ETF approval could be the catalyst for an unprecedented price surge. Web3Bay: The Crypto Presale Offering 4,200% ROI Potential As XRP’s ETF speculation fuels excitement, Web3Bay is gaining traction as one of the most promising blockchain projects of 2025. Unlike XRP, which depends on institutional backing, Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce through blockchain technology. With over $1.50 million raised and 375 million tokens sold, Web3Bay’s presale is accelerating as investors recognize its potential. The current presale price of $0.00456 is set to jump to $0.1959 at launch, positioning early adopters for a staggering 4,200% ROI. Web3Bay is redefining online commerce by eliminating intermediaries, enabling direct transactions between buyers and sellers. This approach not only lowers costs but also ensures security through smart contract escrow systems. Why Web3Bay Is a Standout Crypto Investment Web3Bay is not just another speculative token—it’s an ecosystem with tangible use cases. Here’s why investors are securing 3BAY tokens before the presale ends: Decentralized Marketplace – Eliminates third parties, reducing fees and giving users full transaction control. Smart Contract Escrow – Ensures secure and fraud-free transactions. Multi-Payment Integration – Supports both crypto and fiat transactions, including PayPal. Staking Rewards – Allows investors to earn passive income by staking 3BAY tokens. DAO Governance – Token holders drive platform decisions, ensuring community-led growth. High Growth Potential – The projected 4,200% ROI makes it one of 2025’s hottest presales. With blockchain adoption growing rapidly, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leader in decentralized e-commerce, presenting an opportunity for investors to get in before the market takes off. XRP vs. Web3Bay – Where Should You Invest? XRP’s bullish outlook continues to strengthen as ETF approval odds hit 81%. If XRP successfully surpasses the $3.40 resistance, a run toward $10 could be within reach, driven by institutional demand. However, while XRP’s future hinges on SEC decisions, Web3Bay is actively building an ecosystem with immediate real-world applications. As investors seek high-return opportunities, Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace stands out as one of the top investments for 2025. With limited time remaining before the presale closes, those looking for exponential gains need to act quickly. XRP’s ETF approval is still months away, but Web3Bay’s presale is happening right now—offering a rare chance to enter before prices skyrocket.

Speculation is growing, especially after the price climbed back above $1.50, sparking optimism among investors. The RSI remains elevated, indicating strong momentum, and the bullish breakout above $1.10 has been reinforced. If the current price continues to hold, Pi Coin could rise towards $2 in the short-term. A key driver behind this positive sentiment is the results of a Binance poll, where 85% of voters expressed their desire to see Pi Coin listed on the exchange. While no official announcement has been made yet, this high level of interest has raised hopes of a listing. According to analyst Kim Wong, several factors are contributing to Pi Coin’s price surge: Increased Trading Volumes : Compared to just two days ago, trading volumes have significantly increased, signaling the arrival of large capital inflows into Pi Coin. Attractive Price Movements : Traders are excited by Pi’s large price movement, which has jumped over 101% today, reaching $1.48. The trading volume has also surged to $1.53 billion, further fueling interest. Listings on Major Exchanges : Pi Coin has been listed on five major exchanges – OKX, MEXC, Bitget, GateIO, and Pionex. This increased exposure has attracted more buyers. Bullish Chart Patterns : The Pi Coin price chart is showing a bullish Cup and Handle pattern, which indicates strong breakout momentum.

There was a move below the $2,850 support. The price traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,616 swing low to the $3,021 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $2,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,616 swing low to the $3,021 high. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,820 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,850 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,880 or $2,920. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,050 resistance zone or even $3,120 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,850 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,780 level. The first major support sits near the $2,720 zone. A clear move below the $2,720 support might push the price toward the $2,650 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,500. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

The proposed House Bill No. 429 aimed to create a special revenue account for investing in Bitcoin, stablecoins, and precious metals that meet a market cap threshold of $750 billion—criteria that only Bitcoin currently fulfills. However, many Republican lawmakers expressed concerns about the risks of speculating taxpayer money and voted against the bill. State Representative Steven Kelly argued that these types of investments were too risky, stressing the need to protect public funds. However, as reported by Cointelegraph, Representative Lee Demming said, “If we’re going to keep the taxpayer’s money, I think we owe it to the taxpayers to get as high a return on that money that’s sitting in there, either that or you give it right back to them, so I’m going to vote on this bill for that reason.” Montana Representative Steve Fitzpatrick added, “We can make a return to the taxpayer and ultimately that will allow us to give more money back, to cut taxes, and provide that fiscal relief that people are looking for.” Despite support from some lawmakers who believed in the potential benefits of investing in digital assets, the bill was shelved. Montana’s decision reflects broader resistance to embracing cryptocurrencies, with 24 other states having considered similar legislation. However, Utah has made more progress on its own Bitcoin reserve bill. The vote highlights a clash between traditional governance and the growing influence of the crypto movement.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-24 03:32:50

Traders on X have been speculating whether Kanye West has partially sold administrator access to his X account. Several crypto influencers are warning users about the possibility of Dognials member and serial memecoin launcher ‘Barkmeta’ controlling Ye’s X account. Their speculation is based on the fact that Kanye’s recent tweets seem to be “out of place” or rather mismatched with his usual social media behavior and habits. Reportedly, one deleted post by Ye was hit with Community Notes claiming that accounts ‘ Tall ‘ and ‘ Barkmeta ‘ are the ones behind Ye’s recent tweets. The note read, “Kanye sold access to his account to @barkmeta, the account he follows (@tall _data) is barks alt account. The dark/light mode and time format changes between screenshots point to multiple people having access to his account. This will be a major liquidity extraction event.” Barkmeta, on the other hand, rejects these claims. In a recent tweet , he said, “Imagine the whole space telling us we’re scammers when it would’ve been so easy to rinse like $20M doing a fake Kanye coin today.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News|IN BRIEF,EN,0,0,OTHER,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-24 03:34:51

The development was first spotted by X news aggregator platform Aggr News, which took notice of amm.pump.fun, a new liquidity pool under internal testing. If implemented, Pump.fun’s in-house AMM would allow the platform to capture more fees , potentially impacting trading fees on Raydium ( RAY ) https://t.co/wohP4puuSl TESTING IN-HOUSE AMM, POTENTIALLY REPLACING RAYDIUM AS THIRD PARTY PROVIDER: WEBSITE pic.twitter.com/VLavRsRHFQ — Aggr News (@AggrNews) February 24, 2025 The shift comes as memecoins continue to command huge volumes in the DEX market. Pump.fun has already generated over $500 million in total swap fees, according to DeFiLlama . Currently, about 1.4% of tokens launched on the platform migrate to Raydium, meaning an in-house AMM could help keep more liquidity within the ecosystem. You might also like: Pump.fun launches mobile app for Solana meme coin trading The X community is speculating that this development could also pave the way for additional features like memecoin perpetuals and lending. Raydium could see a 30-50% drop in trading volume if Pump.fun moves forward with the transition. This would greatly impact Raydium’s market position. Raydium’s token, RAY , is already down 20% in the last 24 hours in reaction to the news, according to CoinGecko . Beyond its liquidity shift, Pump.fun has been in the news for stopping a hacker connected to the recent $1.4 billion Bybit hack from laundering funds on the platform. Pump.fun blocked the attacker’s ability to transfer assets via Pump.fun’s infrastructure and stopped them from laundering stolen money through a memecoin launch. Through a coin called “QinShihuang (500000),” the hacker had already pushed over $26 million in trade volume before being banned. According to blockchain data , the attacker moved 60 SOL to a different wallet before launching the token on Pump.fun, perhaps to mix and hide the stolen assets.

The broader market sentiment has turned red and Bitcoin is currently trading below $96,000. The price of XRP remains stuck in a tight range, struggling around key resistance levels. The current resistance area, sitting between $2.65 and $2.80, has shown strong rejection multiple times, preventing upward price movement above it. Despite these rejections, there has not been a major shift towards bearish momentum, indicating that the market lacks clear direction. Support Levels and Market Behavior Currently, XRP is bouncing between support and resistance. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, the first support level is around $2.50, with further support found between $2.25 and $2.30. This suggests that XRP is range-bound, showing a lack of decisive movement in either direction. Attempts at bullish moves are stalling at resistance, while bearish moves are not gaining enough strength to push the price lower. Potential Bullish Breakout and Future Resistance Should XRP manage to break above $2.80 and close a daily candle above this level, it could signal the beginning of a bullish relief rally, possibly driving the price up to $3. However, at around the $3 mark, XRP would likely face resistance once again. For now, a confirmed breakout above $2.80 is required to push the price higher. Outlook for XRP in the Short Term In the near term, XRP’s price action is expected to remain relatively uneventful, with a lack of momentum likely leading to continued sideways movement. As of now, short-term traders may experience somewhat boring price action until a breakout or breakdown occurs.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-24 04:03:03

The price is now at a risk of more downsides below the $2.50 support zone. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.620 level. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.5650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.60 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips To Support XRP price attempted to gain pace for a move above the $2.750 level. However, the bears remained active and the price started a fresh decline below the $2.650 support, like Bitcoin . The price even dipped below $2.60 and tested the $2.50 support. A low was formed at $2.508 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.7450 swing high to the $2.508 low. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.5650 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.5650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.60 level. The next resistance is $2.620 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.7450 swing high to the $2.508 low. A clear move above the $2.620 resistance might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance or even $2.750 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.850. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.60 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

Top Cryptos to Invest in February 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/vechain-built-a-strong-foundation-qubetics-is-taking-it-further-top-cryptos-to-invest-in-february-2025/,"Think about all the early crypto opportunities that slipped away. Bitcoin was once just a few cents, Ethereum was trading at pocket change, and VeChain’s ICO was barely on anyone’s radar before it became a global powerhouse in blockchain adoption. Those who saw the potential early made fortunes, while those who hesitated were left watching from the sidelines. Now, in 2025, another game-changing opportunity is unfolding, and this time, there’s still a chance to get in early. Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as one of the top cryptos to invest in February 2025, solving critical blockchain inefficiencies and redefining the future of Web3 interoperability. Unlike traditional blockchain networks that operate in isolation, Qubetics is creating an ecosystem where multiple blockchains communicate seamlessly. The problem? Existing networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are siloed, making cross-chain transactions complex, slow, and expensive. Qubetics is breaking these barriers by becoming a Web3 aggregated chain, offering developers, enterprises, and users an interconnected blockchain experience like never before. This innovation isn’t just theoretical—it’s already attracting serious attention from investors looking for the next breakout project. And with its presale still open but rapidly moving through its final stages, the window of opportunity is closing fast. Qubetics Presale Is Moving Quickly and Why Waiting Could Cost You If you missed out on the exclusive Qubetics whitelist, you weren’t alone. The earliest backers had a golden opportunity to secure $TICS tokens at just $0.01 per token with no upfront investment required. Since then, demand has surged, and each presale stage has lasted only seven days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM sharp. Currently, Qubetics crypto presale is in its 23rd stage, priced at $0.08880 per token, with over $13.9 million raised and more than 487 million $TICS tokens already sold to over 20,800 investors. Those numbers are climbing fast, and once the Qubetics mainnet launches in Q2 2025, analysts predict a substantial price surge. The choice is simple: get in at presale prices now or risk paying significantly more later. Analysts have projected incredible ROI (Return on Investment) potential for $TICS. By the end of the presale, when $TICS hits $0.25, early investors could see an 181.52% ROI. If the price reaches $1 after the presale, that’s a massive 1,026.08% ROI. And if it climbs to $5 post-mainnet launch, investors would be looking at an insane 5,530.44% ROI. But the long-term outlook is where things get even crazier—if $TICS reaches $10, that’s an astronomical 11,160.88% ROI, and at $15, early holders could see 16,791.32% gains. Example Investment: What Happens If You Invest $7,500? Now, let’s break down what a $7,500 investment at the current price of $0.08880 per token would turn into: Tokens Received: 92,899.02 $TICS At $0.25 per token (presale end): $23,224.75 (181.52% ROI) At $1 per token (post-presale): $92,899.02 (1,026.08% ROI) At $5 per token (mainnet success): $464,495.08 (5,530.44% ROI) At $10 per token (long-term projection): $928,990.16 (11,160.88% ROI) At $15 per token (mass adoption stage): $1,393,485.25 (16,791.32% ROI) This isn’t just speculation—it’s based on real data and market trends. With each presale stage lasting only seven days and a 10% price increase every Sunday, every delay means missing out on lower entry prices. Those who wait could find themselves paying far more post-launch, wishing they had secured their tokens while prices were still in reach. What makes Qubetics more than just another presale hype? Its groundbreaking interoperability feature is set to revolutionize blockchain technology. Imagine a world where users and businesses no longer have to jump through hoops to move assets between different blockchains. Right now, transferring assets between Ethereum and Solana or Bitcoin and Polygon often requires third-party bridges, high fees, and long wait times. Qubetics eliminates these inefficiencies by acting as a universal connector between blockchains, enabling direct and seamless asset transfers without intermediaries. For businesses, this means a faster, more secure way to handle payments across different networks. A global e-commerce company, for example, can accept multiple cryptocurrencies without relying on centralized exchanges or worrying about compatibility issues. For individual investors, it means a smoother, more efficient way to manage and swap assets without dealing with fragmented ecosystems. This level of interoperability has never been seen before, and Qubetics is leading the charge into a truly unified Web3 future. VeChain’s Evolution From an ICO Underdog to a Blockchain Leader When VeChain launched its ICO in 2017, few could have predicted the scale of its impact on the blockchain industry. Originally designed to revolutionize supply chain management through blockchain technology, VeChain quickly gained traction with real-world enterprise partnerships. At the time, blockchain was still viewed as an experimental concept for businesses, but VeChain’s ability to provide transparent, tamper-proof tracking for logistics, pharmaceuticals, and retail changed the game. It proved that blockchain technology could go beyond speculation and offer practical, scalable solutions for industries worldwide. Since its launch, VeChain has secured high-profile partnerships with major corporations, including Walmart China, BMW, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, solidifying its place as a leader in enterprise blockchain adoption. While many early projects struggled to maintain long-term viability, VeChain continued expanding its ecosystem by integrating sustainability initiatives, carbon tracking solutions, and NFT-based verification models for brands. Despite its success, however, its massive early gains are unlikely to be repeated, making it a challenging entry point for new investors seeking exponential returns. That’s why many investors are now turning their attention to the next wave of blockchain disruptors, and Qubetics is at the forefront of this new revolution. Conclusion: Missing Qubetics Now Could Be a Costly Mistake The history of crypto is filled with stories of early adopters who made millions and latecomers who could only watch. VeChain proved how transformative blockchain projects can be, but for investors looking for the top cryptos to invest in February 2025 , the next big thing isn’t in the past—it’s happening right now with Qubetics. With its rapidly selling-out presale, a revolutionary interoperability model, and a Q2 2025 mainnet launch, Qubetics is positioned to be one of the most significant crypto opportunities of the year. Those who move fast can still grab $TICS at presale prices, while those who hesitate may end up paying a premium. Join the Qubetics presale now before this chance is gone.

The ascent of Shiba Inu in 2021 demonstrated the force of community buzz, but its future is yet unknown given its declining momentum. Pepe’s explosive rise at the same time draws attention to the volatility and conjecture behind these coins. The crypto market is changing while traders hunt for actual value outside of buzz. Where Shiba Inu and Pepe fall short, another coin in development provides stability, openness, and financial worth. Let’s get into it! Shiba Inu’s Challenge: Can It Regain Its Momentum? Though Shiba Inu remains a big participant in the crypto market, recent price declines have caused uncertainty among traders. At $0.00001554 right now, SHIB has been ranging between $0.0000156 and $0.0000152. Analysts warn of a “death cross” indicator, in which case the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day and usually causes more drops. Although Shiba Inu has a bearish trend, experts think it might bounce back if it reaches important resistance levels. Though SHIB has to prove its long-term worth, a possible 50% return is conceivable. Nowadays, investors are choosing cryptocurrencies with practical applications, casting questions on SHIB’s competitiveness. Strong community excitement helped Shiba Inu succeed in 2021; nevertheless, its lack of originality is starting to cause problems. Interest is moving toward coins with financial value, hence SHIB runs less relevance. Shiba Inu has to provide more than simply normal buzz if it is to survive in the changing crypto scene. Pepe: Hype or Lasting Success? While Pepe displays short-term strength with a 3.9% price rise, Shiba Inu struggles technically. Low trading activity concerns investors, nevertheless, resistance at $0.00012 and $0.00014 price levels makes rising challenging. Concerns over its long-term viability have been raised by large holders selling 57.86% of their PEPE in ninety days so far. Pepe has shown, in spite of obstacles, that meme coins may yield significant returns, as Shiba Inu did in 2021. Both coins acquired popularity with great community support and clever marketing. Pepe and Shiba Inu, however, require actual value and investor confidence if they are to be successful over the long run, not just buzz. Remittix: The Future of Crypto Payments Turning cryptocurrencies into cash for regular use is one main issue for most people. Though many struggle to access conventional banking, millions of unbanked people own digital assets. Through banks, ATMs, or payment systems, the Remittix platform lets users send money overseas and withdraw in local currencies, addressing this with crypto-to- fiat transfers. The RTX token is attracting interest in its presale even as Shiba Inu faces challenges. Strong security in place team tokens locks and guarantees three-year liquidity for early investors, therefore benefiting them before it becomes generally utilized. RTX provides stability and practical value unlike meme coins, which suffer price volatility and manipulation. It is debatable if Pepe and Shiba Inu ever developed this degree of openness and trust at least to what’s clearly seen. Designed for actual financial use, the Remittix platform closes the distance between crypto and FIAT and maintains decentralization and anonymity intact. RTX is revolutionizing crypto payments as investors move their emphasis from excitement to actual value. Priced at $0.0645 in its ongoing presale, RTX is the best coin to buy now. Demand is explosive with a predicted 25x increase during presale and over 3,500% following launch. The flat fee system of the platform guarantees cost reductions, ensuring fair and open transactions.

The new standard is developed with the collaboration of over 30 teams which includes Layer 2 networks, wallets, and infrastructure providers. Open Intents Framework According to the official announcement on February 19th, the main objective of the Open Intents Framework (OIF) is to streamline cross-chain transactions by making it easier for users to send assets across different chains seamlessly. Central to this initiative is “Intents,” which allow users to specify desired outcomes without handling complex transaction details. However, existing implementations of Intents often lack compatibility and make adoption challenging. The OIF addresses this issue by standardizing key components such as solving and settlement and helps developers integrate and customize solutions without being tied to a single provider. This modular approach boosts shared innovation, ensuring that different intent solutions can work together efficiently. Strong Backing Its official website states that OIF is a “public good initiative” led by contributors from the Ethereum Foundation, Hyperlane, and Bootnode. It began with initial funding from Hyperlane, aiming to establish a strong foundation for future community ownership and funding. The standard is also supported by prominent Layer 2s such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Scroll, Polygon, zkSync, Linea, Gnosis, and Starknet among others. The Ethereum Foundation stated that further developments and expansions are expected in the near future. Meanwhile, Uniswap Labs – the team behind the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) – highlighted its role in co-authoring ERC-7683, which was introduced last year to encourage ecosystem-wide adoption. In a follow-up tweet to the Ethereum Foundation’s announcement, “Last year we co-authored ERC-7683, a new standard for cross-chain intents built for any team to adopt. Today, we’re excited to see it as a core part of the Open Intents Framework. Because the best way to unify Ethereum is together.” The post Ethereum Foundation Launches Open Intents Framework to Boost Cross-Chain Interoperability appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|UNI|ARB|EXCHANGE|MATIC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-02-24 04:22:54

Since pioneering the Blockchain for Good Alliance in April 2024, Bybit has championed the use of blockchain innovations to solve real-world challenges. EthicHub , a key project supported by the BGA Incubation Programme and the Grand Social Impact Award winner at the BGA Web3 Oscar , exemplifies this vision by leveraging blockchain to drive financial inclusion and empower smallholder farmers. This investment aligns with Bybit’s commitment to leveraging blockchain technology for tangible social impact, driving financial inclusion for smallholder coffee farmers in emerging markets. Empowering Sustainable Coffee Farming Through Ethical Finance EthicHub is revolutionizing agricultural finance by integrating productive lending, blended finance, and market access. With this $1 million investment, Bybit will establish the “Bybit Pool”, a dedicated fund within the EthicHub ecosystem designed to provide ethical credit lines to small and medium-sized coffee farmers. This initiative will empower farmers to break free from exploitative lending practices, improve productivity, and secure fair prices for their coffee. Additionally, it aligns with Bybit’s broader mission of bridging the gap between blockchain solutions and real-world economic transformation. Key Highlights of the Investment Agreement: Exclusive Fund: Bybit’s investment will be managed exclusively within the EthicHub ecosystem, ensuring transparency and accountability. Sustainable Social Impact: The fund provides direct financial access to coffee farmers, fostering economic resilience in rural communities. Fair Financial Returns: Bybit will receive an 8% annual return over a 15-month term, demonstrating the viability of impact investing. Transparency & Reporting: LendingDev, EthicHub’s operator, will provide quarterly performance updates and comprehensive end-of-term reporting. A New Era of Blockchain-Powered Social Good Bybit’s investment exemplifies how blockchain-powered finance can drive sustainable change. Through BGA’s role in fostering strategic collaborations, this initiative paves the way for blockchain adoption in real-world economic empowerment. “Blockchain has the power to unlock new financial opportunities for those historically excluded from traditional banking systems. Our $1 million investment in EthicHub reinforces Bybit’s dedication to using innovation for real-world impact, proving that blockchain can be both profitable and transformative,” said Helen Liu, Chief Operating Officer at Bybit . Gabriela Chang, CSO & Co-founder of EthicHub added: “Bybit’s commitment is a game-changer for our mission. This investment will directly support smallholder coffee farmers, enabling them to increase productivity, access fair financing, and secure better market opportunities. It is an example of how blockchain can create real-world solutions for pressing global challenges.” Case Study: EthicHub’s Impact – How Neri Ortiz Transformed His Future For generations, smallholder coffee farmers like Neri Ortiz in Motozintla, Mexico, faced relentless challenges: unstable coffee prices, predatory lenders, and limited market access. With no financial safety net, many were forced to abandon farming altogether. The introduction of EthicHub changed everything. By offering fair, blockchain-powered financing, EthicHub provided Neri and his cooperative with the resources to improve production, invest in sustainable farming techniques, and eliminate exploitative middlemen. For the first time, they could sell directly to specialty coffee buyers at fair market prices. This access to ethical lending transformed not just Neri’s farm but his entire outlook. He began experimenting with quality-enhancing techniques like controlled fermentation, which boosted the value of his coffee. With newfound financial stability, he reinvested in his farm, secured better futures for his family, and began mentoring other farmers to do the same. Bybit’s investment in EthicHub ensures that more farmers like Neri can break free from financial hardship, build resilient livelihoods, and sustain the agricultural traditions that feed global coffee markets. This is the power of blockchain-driven impact investing—real solutions for real people, transforming entire communities. Join the Movement Bybit invites fellow blockchain innovators and socially responsible investors to explore the possibilities of blockchain-powered impact investments. By working together, the industry can drive sustainable economic solutions that benefit both investors and underserved communities.

The transactions occurred in the days following Bybit’s $1.4 billion hack, which has taken the industry by surprise. A wallet linked to Bybit, identified as “0x2E45…1b77,” purchased 157,660 Ethereum ( ETH )—worth approximately $437 million—from cryptocurrency investment firms Galaxy Digital, FalconX, and Wintermute through over-the-counter transactions. This wallet made its first transaction on Feb. 22 at 4:44 PM UTC. It seems that #Bybit has bought 266,694 $ETH ($742M) after being hacked. 0x2E45…1b77(related to #Bybit ) bought 157,660 $ETH ($437.82M) from Galaxy Digital, FalconX, Wintermute via OTC. 0xd7CF…A995(likely related to #Bybit ) bought 109,033 $ETH ($304.12M) from DEXs and CEXs.… pic.twitter.com/8FfGZo18OU — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 24, 2025 A second wallet, “0xd7CF…A995,” was also involved in a $304 million Ethereum purchase, conducted through both centralized and decentralized exchanges. While not formally recognized as part of Bybit, both Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence indicate close connections based on transaction trends. The wallet’s interactions with Binance and MEXC hot wallets further fuel rumors suggesting a link to the exchange.

The attacker has since begun moving the stolen funds across multiple wallets, prompting a coordinated effort to freeze assets. A joint effort between major blockchain entities has already resulted in $42.89 million being frozen in just one day, according to Bybit’s Feb. 23 X post. Platforms like Tether, THORChain, Avalanche, CoinEx, Bitget, and Circle have all played a role in identifying and blocking blacklisted addresses, limiting the attacker’s ability to launder funds. A coordinated effort led to the freezing of $42.89M in just one day. Thanks to the following teams for their swift action: @Tether_to : Flagged address and froze 181K USDT @THORChain : Blocked the blacklist @ChangeNOW_io : Froze 34 ETH @FixedFloat : Froze 120K USDC + USDT… — Bybit (@Bybit_Official) February 23, 2025 Despite the massive hack, Bybit has maintained its financial stability, and CEO Ben Zhou affirmed that all user funds are secure. According to Lookonchain data , Bybit has received about 446,870 ETH, roughly $1.23 billion, from whale deposits, loans, and ETH purchases since the hack. A $140 million bounty has also been offered by the exchange to security researchers and ethical hackers who help retrieve the stolen assets.

Could a Resolution Arrive Before August 7, 2025?",https://coinpedia.org/news/whats-next-for-the-ripple-lawsuit-could-a-resolution-arrive-before-august-7-2025/,"The post What’s Next for the Ripple Lawsuit? Could a Resolution Arrive Before August 7, 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The SEC recently made big moves by dropping its case against Coinbase and halting the case against Binance, signaling a shift in the agency’s approach. Coinbase confirmed the case dismissal, and the SEC also decided to drop its case against the OpenSea NFT platform. However, the agency still has ongoing cases against Kraken Exchange , Uniswap, and Robinhood, with Wells notices already issued. The market is anticipating positive updates from the SEC, as any resolution would remove uncertainty and help stabilize the crypto market . Ripple Case and SEC’s Future Plans While the market eagerly awaits the conclusion of the Ripple case, it is expected to take more time, with some speculating the SEC may pause certain aspects of the case before taking further action. The SEC has also been scaling back its crypto enforcement efforts, including reassigning staff from its special enforcement unit. These changes signal a more balanced approach to regulation and could indicate a brighter future for crypto markets. Despite the ongoing cases, things are heading in the right direction, and many believe that dropping these cases will benefit the overall market. Once the uncertainty around the classification of securities is addressed, prices are likely to rise as the market gains clarity. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For February 24 , Attorney Jeremy Hogan suggests that the SEC might pause certain parts of the Ripple case, like not filing any appeals, which would be a positive sign that they’re working toward wrapping it up, although it could take some time. This week, we might see some positive news, even if it’s just a signal that the SEC is planning to conclude its actions with Ripple. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel stated that if the SEC drops its own appeal while Ripple has cross-appealed, it would constitute legal malpractice. He also pointed out that failing to collect a $125 million penalty , which a federal court ruled was owed for breaking the law, would be similarly negligent. Fagel believes a settlement, possibly adjusting to summary judgment terms, is the most likely outcome. When asked if this could extend past August 7, 2025, Fagel responded that it could happen at any time. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The exchange has received 446,870 ether (ETH), worth $1.23 billion at current prices, through loans, large deposits, and ether purchases in the past two days, on-chain tracking service Lookonchain said in an X post on Monday. Address activity suggests more than $400 million were purchased through over-the-counter trading, with another $300 million brought directly from exchanges. Nearly $300 million were sought as loans; the rest are from addresses apparently belonging to crypto funds. ETH prices rose upto 4% over the weekend amid the apparent buying activity, but are down 2% in the past 24 hours as sentiment isn’t fully lifted. Meanwhile, Bybit said late Sunday that all deposit and withdrawal activity had “fully recovered to normal levels — with total deposits “slightly exceeding” withdrawals as on Saturday in a sign of market confidence. Friday’s attack targeted one of Bybit’s offline “cold” wallets, which are typically considered secure due to their lack of internet connectivity, in a heist that allowed $1.4 billion in ETH to be withdrawn. Hackers gained control by exploiting a sophisticated method involving a manipulated user interface (UI) and URL. This allowed the attackers to alter the smart contract logic, redirecting the funds to an unidentified address. The stolen assets were then split across multiple wallets and swapped on decentralized exchanges. Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT linked the hack to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored hacking collective notorious for crypto thefts. Lazarus was behind several high-profile crypto attacks, including the $600 million Ronin Network hack in 2022, and a $230 million drain on Indian exchange WazirX in 2024.",Markets|Bybit|Hack|Ether,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETH|MARKET|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-24 05:06:08

ADA is now consolidating losses and at risk of more losses below the $0.7350 level. ADA price started a fresh decline below the $0.80 and $0.7650 levels. The price is trading below $0.7750 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.7620 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.7750 resistance zone. Cardano Price Climbs Above $0.750 After a decent increase, Cardano faced resistance near the $0.820 zone. ADA formed a short-term top and recently started a fresh decline, underperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $0.80 and $0.7650 levels. The bears were able to push the price below $0.750. A low was formed at $0.7362 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is well below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.8191 swing high to the $0.7362 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.7650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.750 zone. The first resistance is near $0.7620. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.7620 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.8191 swing high to the $0.7362 low. The next key resistance might be $0.7680. If there is a close above the $0.7680 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.80 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.850 in the near term. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.7620 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.7350 level. The next major support is near the $0.7320 level. A downside break below the $0.7320 level could open the doors for a test of $0.7150.

The attack, which saw cybercriminals gain control of Bybit’s Ether multisig cold wallet, has been linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group . In trailing news, North Korean hackers have started laundering funds stolen from Bybit, with blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic tracking over $140 million in suspicious transactions. Interestingly as per the report , the attackers are mostly using decentralized exchanges and anonymous crypto services to cover their tracks before converting the stolen assets into Bitcoin. The entire process is so complex that it is harder for the authorities to trace the stolen funds. The Bybit hack, which took place on Friday, has now been confirmed as the largest crypto theft in history, with $1.46 billion stolen, primarily in Ethereum. This surpasses the 2021 Poly Network hack, which saw $611 million stolen. The attackers, linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, swiftly spread the stolen ETH across 50 wallets, each containing around 10,000 ETH. Since then, the funds have been moved, swapped for Ethereum-based assets, and are now being converted into Bitcoin, making tracking and recovery efforts more challenging. Elliptic suggests that if the hackers follow their usual tricks, they might soon try to hide the stolen money using Bitcoin mixers, which make it harder to trace transactions. But moving such a huge amount of stolen crypto won’t be easy. Blockchain experts and law enforcement are keeping a close watch, making it difficult for the hackers to cash out without getting caught. Bybit Faces Massive Withdrawals Following the breach, Bybit users have rushed to withdraw their funds, fearing further security risks. According to Arkham Intelligence data , approximately 23,000 BTC ($1.7 billion) has been withdrawn from Bybit’s hot wallets, reducing its Bitcoin reserves from 70,000 BTC to just over 52,000 BTC. In total, Bybit has seen over $6 billion in crypto outflows since the hack, raising concerns about the platform’s liquidity. Despite the panic, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou reassured users that the exchange remains solvent and that no customer funds were lost. More than 350,000 withdrawal requests were processed in the aftermath of the attack, demonstrating the platform’s ability to handle large outflows. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance’s Changpeng Zhao Flags Security Risks After $1.4B Bybit Hack , Exchange on Trouble? Elliptic and blockchain investigator ZachXBT have accused the crypto exchange eXch of processing “tens of millions of dollars” in stolen funds despite direct requests from Bybit to block the transactions. eXch, however, denied any wrongdoing, claiming the allegations were false and based on a bias against privacy-focused exchanges. They also stated that some of the processed funds would be donated to open-source privacy initiatives. 5000 ETH stolen in Bybit hack is reportedly being laundered through eXch (a centralized mixer) and converted to Bitcoin via Chainflip. In response, Bybit requested eXch to block the funds and track their movement. However, eXch made this request public and refused to cooperate.… pic.twitter.com/i2DlAsm3Bi — LANGERIUS (@langeriuseth) February 23, 2025 With blockchain security teams and law enforcement closely monitoring the stolen funds, the hackers may face difficulties cashing out their loot. However, North Korea’s Lazarus Group has a history of successfully laundering billions in crypto, fueling concerns about their ability to evade detection once again. The investigations on this matter are still going on, and whether more funds will be recovered remains to be seen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After a brief period of uncertainty, the popular Ethereum multi-sig wallet is gearing up to relaunch its services. In an exciting announcement made on X just an hour ago, Safe{Wallet} confirmed that it will be initiating a phased rollout of services within the next 24 hours. This eagerly awaited return comes with a significant upgrade: enhanced security measures designed to provide users with an even more robust and reliable crypto wallet experience. This development follows a temporary suspension of certain functionalities, a precautionary step taken after a hacking incident impacted the crypto exchange Bybit. Let’s dive into what this means for Safe{Wallet} users and the broader crypto community. Why is SafeWallet Resuming Services with Enhanced Security? The temporary suspension of certain Safe{Wallet} functionalities was a proactive measure in response to a security breach at Bybit. While Safe{Wallet} itself was not directly compromised, the team took swift action to ensure the platform remained secure for all users. This temporary pause allowed them to conduct thorough security audits and implement additional layers of protection. The upcoming resumption of services signifies that Safe{Wallet} has successfully fortified its platform and is now ready to welcome users back with even stronger defenses against potential threats. This proactive approach underscores Safe{Wallet}’s commitment to user safety and the integrity of its crypto wallet services. What Enhanced Security Measures are Being Implemented in SafeWallet? While specific details of the enhanced security measures are yet to be fully disclosed, Safe{Wallet} has assured its community that significant upgrades have been implemented. We can anticipate these enhancements to focus on strengthening the platform’s resilience against various attack vectors. Here are some potential areas of improvement based on industry best practices: Advanced Threat Detection: Implementing more sophisticated systems to identify and neutralize potential threats in real-time. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enhancements: Strengthening MFA protocols to add extra layers of verification beyond passwords. Smart Contract Audits: Conducting even more rigorous and frequent audits of their smart contracts to identify and patch vulnerabilities. Infrastructure Upgrades: Improving the underlying infrastructure to enhance its robustness and security. Collaboration with Security Experts: Working closely with leading cybersecurity firms to continuously monitor and improve their security posture. These measures are crucial in today’s evolving crypto landscape, where security is paramount. Safe{Wallet}’s dedication to enhancing its defenses demonstrates a proactive approach to safeguarding user assets. When Can You Access Your SafeWallet and Utilize its Features? The announcement of a phased rollout within the next 24 hours is incredibly encouraging for Safe{Wallet} users. A phased rollout typically means that access to services will be gradually restored to different user segments over the specified period. This approach allows Safe{Wallet} to monitor the system closely as it comes back online and address any unforeseen issues in a controlled manner. Here’s what you can expect in the phased rollout: Phase Timeline Expected Actions Phase 1 Within the first few hours Initial system checks and activation of core functionalities for a limited group of users. Monitoring for stability. Phase 2 Next 12-18 hours Gradual expansion of access to a larger user base. Full functionality testing and performance evaluation. Phase 3 Within 24 hours General availability of all Safe{Wallet} services to all users. Comprehensive system monitoring and ongoing security assessments. It’s advisable to keep an eye on Safe{Wallet}’s official X (formerly Twitter) account and other communication channels for real-time updates on the rollout progress. This phased approach is designed to ensure a smooth and secure return to full functionality for every SafeWallet user. Why Choose SafeWallet as Your Multi-Sig Wallet? Safe{Wallet} is renowned for its robust multi-sig wallet functionality, particularly within the Ethereum ecosystem. Multi-signature wallets offer a significant advantage over single-signature wallets by requiring multiple private keys to authorize transactions. This dramatically enhances security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access or single points of failure. Key benefits of using a multi-sig wallet like SafeWallet: Enhanced Security: Multi-signature requirement makes it significantly harder for hackers to compromise funds. Even if one key is compromised, the attacker still needs access to other keys to move assets. Protection Against Key Loss: In scenarios where one key holder loses access to their key, funds are not lost as long as the other key holders are still accessible. Organizational Security: Ideal for teams, DAOs, and organizations managing crypto assets, as it ensures that no single individual has unilateral control over funds. Transparency and Accountability: Multi-sig transactions provide greater transparency and accountability, as all transactions require agreement from multiple parties. Safe{Wallet}’s commitment to security , combined with the inherent advantages of multi-sig technology, positions it as a leading choice for users seeking a secure and reliable way to manage their Ethereum and other crypto assets. Navigating the Challenges: Security in the Crypto Wallet Space The recent incident, although not directly targeting Safe{Wallet}, highlights the ongoing challenges and importance of security in the cryptocurrency space. Crypto wallets, as custodians of digital assets, are prime targets for malicious actors. The crypto industry is constantly battling evolving threats, requiring continuous innovation and vigilance in security practices. Challenges in crypto wallet security include: Sophisticated Hacking Techniques: Hackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, employing advanced phishing, social engineering, and technical exploits. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: While smart contracts enable innovation, they can also contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited if not rigorously audited. User Error: Users themselves can sometimes be the weakest link, falling victim to scams or not adequately securing their private keys. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape can sometimes create challenges for crypto wallet providers in implementing consistent and compliant security measures. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach, including robust technology, user education, industry collaboration, and proactive adaptation to the ever-changing threat environment. Safe{Wallet}’s response to the Bybit incident and its commitment to enhanced security demonstrate a responsible and proactive approach to these ongoing challenges. Conclusion: A Stronger and Safer SafeWallet is on the Horizon The news of Safe{Wallet} resuming services with enhanced security is a significant positive development for the crypto community. It underscores the resilience of the ecosystem and the commitment of platforms like Safe{Wallet} to prioritize user safety above all else. The temporary suspension, while inconvenient, was a necessary step to reinforce security measures and ensure a more robust and trustworthy platform going forward. As Safe{Wallet} embarks on its phased rollout, users can look forward to returning to a platform that is not only feature-rich and user-friendly but also fortified with cutting-edge security enhancements. This return signals a stronger, safer, and more reliable Safe{Wallet} experience for everyone.

Google has just dropped a bombshell about the highly anticipated Veo 2, their cutting-edge AI video model pricing . We finally know how much this powerhouse of video generation will set you back, and the numbers are… well, let’s just say they’re generating a lot of buzz. Is this the dawn of democratized video creation, or are we looking at a premium tool for the elite? Let’s dive into the details of the Google Veo 2 cost and see what it means for the future of content creation. Decoding the Veo 2 Pricing: What Does 50 Cents Per Second Mean? Google has quietly updated its pricing page, revealing that Veo 2 will operate on a pay-as-you-go model, charging 50 cents for every second of video generated. At first glance, this might seem like pocket change, but let’s break down what this AI video generation cost actually translates to: Per Minute: 50 cents/second * 60 seconds = $30 per minute Per Hour: $30/minute * 60 minutes = $1,800 per hour Suddenly, that 50 cents per second starts to look a bit more substantial. While it’s not going to bankrupt a major corporation, it definitely puts Veo 2 in a different category than some might have expected. Google DeepMind researcher Jon Barron even drew a comparison to the colossal budget of “Avengers: Endgame,” highlighting the vast difference in cost per second between a Hollywood blockbuster and AI-generated video – but is this a fair comparison? Let’s explore further. Veo 2 vs. Hollywood Budgets: Apples and Oranges? Barron’s comparison to “Avengers: Endgame,” with its reported $32,000 per second production cost, is certainly attention-grabbing. However, it’s crucial to understand that we’re comparing vastly different things. “Avengers: Endgame” involved: Massive crews and casts: Hundreds, if not thousands, of people working for months. Physical sets and locations: Building sets, securing locations, and managing logistics. Practical effects and CGI: A blend of real-world effects and computer-generated imagery. Extensive post-production: Editing, sound design, visual effects refinement, and more. Veo 2, on the other hand, is software. The AI video model pricing reflects the computational power, development costs, and ongoing maintenance of this complex technology. It’s a tool, not an entire production studio. While Veo 2 might not (yet) be capable of producing a feature-length film, its strength lies in rapid, on-demand video creation for various applications. How Does Veo 2’s Cost Compare to Competitors Like Sora? The elephant in the room is OpenAI’s Sora. While Sora’s pricing model isn’t directly comparable, it’s important to consider the competitive landscape. Currently, Sora is available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers who pay $200 per month. This subscription model offers a different value proposition. Let’s compare the two approaches: Feature Veo 2 (Pay-per-second) Sora (Subscription via ChatGPT Pro) Pricing Model $0.50 per second of video $200/month for ChatGPT Pro access Cost for 1 Minute Video $30 Potentially lower if generating many videos per month Cost for 1 Hour Video $1,800 Still $200/month subscription cost Accessibility Directly accessible (presumably) Requires ChatGPT Pro subscription Best Suited For Projects with variable video needs, where cost scales with usage. Users who anticipate frequent video generation within a month. The choice between Veo 2 and Sora (or other affordable AI video options as they emerge) will depend heavily on your specific needs and usage patterns. If you need short clips sporadically, Veo 2’s pay-per-second model might be efficient. However, for users generating videos regularly, a subscription model like Sora’s could prove more cost-effective in the long run. Is Veo 2’s Pricing a Game Changer or a Barrier? The Veo 2 pricing structure is undoubtedly a significant factor in its potential adoption. Let’s consider the potential impacts: For Professional Creators: For marketing agencies, news outlets, and businesses needing video content, Veo 2 could be a powerful tool, especially for supplementing existing video production workflows. The cost, while not insignificant, might be justifiable for specific projects. For Independent Creators and Hobbyists: The price point might be a barrier for casual users or independent creators on a tight budget. However, for specific projects where high-quality AI video is crucial, it could still be a viable option. Impact on the AI Video Market: Veo 2’s pricing sets a benchmark in the nascent AI video generation market. It signals that high-quality AI video generation is not yet a commodity and reflects the substantial resources required to develop and operate these models. Ultimately, whether Veo 2’s pricing is a game-changer or a barrier depends on your perspective and needs. It’s not designed to be a free or extremely cheap tool, but rather a professional-grade solution for specific applications. As AI video model pricing evolves and competition increases, we can expect to see a wider range of options emerge, catering to different budgets and use cases. Actionable Insights: Navigating the World of AI Video Costs So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Video Needs: Before jumping into AI video generation, carefully evaluate your video requirements. How much video do you need? What level of quality is required? What is your budget? Compare Pricing Models: Don’t just look at Veo 2. Explore other AI video generation platforms and their pricing structures. Compare pay-per-second, subscription, and credit-based models to find the best fit for your needs. Start Small and Experiment: If you’re unsure, start with smaller projects and shorter videos to test the waters. Experiment with different AI video tools to see which ones deliver the best results for your specific use cases. Factor in Post-Production: Remember that AI-generated video might still require editing, sound design, and other post-production work. Factor these costs into your overall budget. Stay Updated on AI Video Trends: The AI video landscape is rapidly evolving. Keep an eye on new models, pricing changes, and emerging best practices to make informed decisions. The Future of AI Video: Premium or Accessible to All? Google’s Veo 2 pricing announcement is a significant moment in the development of affordable AI video technology. It highlights the current realities of developing and deploying advanced AI models. While the 50 cents per second cost might seem steep to some, it’s crucial to remember that this is still early days for truly high-quality, versatile AI video generation. As technology advances and becomes more efficient, and as competition heats up, we can anticipate a future where AI video generation cost becomes more accessible and democratized. For now, Veo 2 represents a powerful, albeit premium, tool in the evolving landscape of AI-driven content creation.

Onchain investigators and blockchain security firms have identified connections between wallets used in the Bybit exploit and fraudulent activities on Solana’s Pump.fun platform . Crypto Exchange eXch Denies Allegations of Laundering Funds for North Korea’s Lazarus Group Following $1.4 Billion Bybit Hack Crypto exchange eXch has firmly denied allegations of laundering money for North Korea’s notorious Lazarus Group following the historic $1.4 billion Bybit hack on Feb. 21. The exchange issued a statement on the Bitcointalk forum on Feb. 23, asserting that it had no involvement in facilitating illicit transactions for the cybercriminal syndicate linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). In its statement, the eXch team declared, “We are not laundering money for Lazarus/DPRK,” emphasizing that all funds held on the exchange remained secure and that its operations had not been affected by the Bybit hack. The exchange also criticized those accusing it of illicit activity, branding such claims as unfounded fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). While maintaining its innocence, eXch did acknowledge that a small fraction of the stolen funds had passed through its platform. The exchange clarified that it had processed an “insignificant portion of funds” from the Bybit hack, which had entered its address 0xf1da173228fcf015f43f3ea15abbb51f0d8f1123. eXch insisted that this was an isolated incident and that the fees collected from these transactions would be donated for the public good. “There are no other addresses on the Ethereum blockchain, aside from deposit addresses that interact with this address, that are associated with our exchange,” eXch asserted in its statement, attempting to distance itself from the wider laundering allegations. The rebuttal from eXch follows mounting scrutiny from on-chain analysts and security firms that have accused the platform of playing a more substantial role in laundering funds stolen from Bybit. On Feb. 22, blockchain investigator ZachXBT posted to his Telegram investigations group, alleging that eXch had laundered $35 million of the stolen funds. He also pointed out that the exchange had mistakenly sent 34 Ether (ETH), worth approximately $96,000, to a hot wallet belonging to another exchange. His findings have been echoed by blockchain security firm SlowMist, which claimed that eXch had received a “significant amount of ETH” connected to the Bybit hack and had converted some of these funds into other cryptocurrencies. Adding to the allegations, Nick Bax, a member of the white-hat hacker group Security Alliance, estimated that eXch had processed at least $30 million in transactions for the DPRK-linked Lazarus Group in a single day. Bybit, the victim of what is now considered the largest crypto hack in history, lost over $1.4 billion when attackers gained control of its Ether multisig cold wallet. Despite this devastating loss, the exchange has assured users that withdrawals continue to be processed. However, according to data from DeFiLlama, Bybit’s total assets have plummeted by more than $5.3 billion, which includes the stolen funds. Bybit has been actively coordinating with law enforcement and other exchanges to freeze and recover stolen funds. As of Feb. 23, it had successfully frozen over $42 million worth of stolen assets, thanks to these efforts. Despite the ongoing investigations and allegations, eXch has not fully cooperated with Bybit’s attempts to block further fund outflows. In a post on Bitcointalk, eXch revealed an email exchange with Bybit’s risk team, in which the latter requested assistance in freezing the stolen assets. However, eXch refused to comply, citing grievances over past incidents in which Bybit allegedly froze deposits made by its users without providing clear explanations. “In light of these circumstances, we would appreciate a clear explanation as to why we should consider providing assistance to an organization that has actually undermined our reputation,” eXch stated in its response to Bybit. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou reacted to the forum post by urging eXch to reconsider its stance, stating, “At this point, it is really not about Bybit or any entity; it’s about our general approach toward hackers as an industry.” The Industry’s Larger Battle Against Cybercrime The accusations against eXch and its response shed light on the cryptocurrency industry's ongoing battle against cybercriminal groups, particularly North Korea’s Lazarus Group, which has been linked to multiple high-profile hacks in recent years. The lack of clear regulatory oversight in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space has made it easier for stolen funds to be moved across various platforms without immediate detection or consequences. As exchanges like Bybit work to recover stolen assets, the situation highlights the urgent need for stronger security measures, better coordination among crypto platforms, and a unified industry stance against illicit activities. The controversy surrounding eXch’s alleged involvement in laundering Bybit’s stolen funds may continue to develop as further investigations unfold. For now, eXch maintains its innocence, but with multiple security firms and investigators casting doubt on its claims, the exchange remains under intense scrutiny from the broader crypto community. Lazarus Group Suspected in Bybit Hack and Solana Meme Coin Scams The Lazarus Group, the primary suspect behind the staggering $1.4 billion Bybit hack, may also be linked to recent Solana meme coin scams, including rug pulls on the Pump.fun platform, according to onchain investigator ZachXBT. The crypto industry was shaken on Feb. 21 when Bybit suffered the largest hack in history, losing over $1.4 billion in liquid-staked Ether (stETH), Mantle Staked ETH (mETH), and other digital assets. Blockchain security firms, including Arkham Intelligence, have identified North Korea’s Lazarus Group as the most likely perpetrator behind the exploit. ZachXBT’s onchain investigations have now suggested that the same entity laundering the hacked Bybit funds may also be responsible for a series of fraudulent meme coin launches on Solana’s Pump.fun platform. “On Feb. 22, the attacker received $1.08 million from the Bybit hack to 0x363908df2b0890e7e5c1e403935133094287d7d1, who then bridged USDC to Solana,” ZachXBT wrote in a Feb. 23 Telegram post . According to the investigator, this $1 million was subsequently consolidated across multiple wallets on Solana, some of which had prior links to meme coin scams. “I made 920+ addresses receiving funds tied to the Bybit hack public and noticed a person laundering for Lazarus Group previously launched meme coins via Pump.fun,” ZachXBT added. Further onchain findings revealed that the same Lazarus Group-affiliated wallets suspected in the Bybit hack were also behind the $29 million Phemex hack in January. The connection between the Lazarus Group and Solana’s Pump.fun platform is not entirely surprising given the recent surge in meme coin scams plaguing the Solana blockchain. Investor sentiment has been significantly impacted following high-profile rug pulls and fraudulent projects. One such example is the dramatic collapse of the Libra (LIBRA) token, which had received public endorsement from Argentine President Javier Milei. Insiders of the project allegedly siphoned over $107 million worth of liquidity in what was described as a rug pull, leading to a 94% price crash within hours and erasing approximately $4 billion in investor capital. The repercussions of these scams are reflected in Solana’s declining market activity. Monthly capital inflow into Solana and the Solana MEME index have turned negative, registering a -5.9% decline, according to Glassnode. In addition, Solana’s user activity has been declining significantly. The number of active addresses on the network fell to a weekly average of 9.5 million in February, a sharp drop of nearly 40% from the 15.6 million active addresses recorded in November 2024, according to data from Glassnode. CryptoVizArt, a senior analyst at Glassnode, commented on this decline, stating: “A significant cool down in Solana activity is evident, however, we are still relatively higher than pre-bull market baselines.” The Future of Solana Amidst Controversy Despite the concerns surrounding fraud and corruption, some industry analysts believe that these challenges could lead to long-term improvements for Solana. The blockchain’s advanced technology continues to attract developers and projects, and increasing regulatory scrutiny may help curb bad actors over time. Blockchain researcher Aylo shared a similar sentiment in a Feb. 18 X post, suggesting that while the current wave of fraud is damaging, it may ultimately contribute to a stronger and more resilient ecosystem for Solana . As the industry grapples with security breaches and illicit activity, the role of investigative onchain analysts like ZachXBT remains crucial in exposing fraudulent actors and maintaining trust within the crypto space.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|ASIA|ZRX,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-24 05:30:00

Following the early talks about the mass exodus of funds, the exchange came forward stating that all withdrawals are processing normally while calling the talks “co-ordinated FUD”. OX.FUN Bursts Myth of Exchange Hack Earlier today, social media platform X was abuzz with discussions around the crypto exchange OX.FUN slipping into insolvency while facing a mass exodus of funds. Earlier reports also suggested that $1 million in USDC has been frozen. Several employees of the crypto exchange reported that the platform turned insolvent after massive withdrawal of funds by users. Furthermore, reports emerged that the company’s remaining liquidity dropped to just $180,000. The announcement comes at a time when crypto exchange Bybit faced a severe hack losing Ethereum from the platform. In an attempt to manage the crisis, the team was said to be “triaging” the remaining funds. However, OX.FUN issued a statement claiming that no users, aside from JefeDAO, were impacted by the recent financial crisis. The platform further alleged that JefeDAO engaged in an attempt to exploit the system. In an official statement, the crypto exchange stated: “All withdrawals are processing normally. This is coordinated FUD. No users were affected by the actions of JefeDAO aside from JefeDAO. He attempted to exploit the platform, got all of his funds frozen, and now is attempting a social media campaign”. Crypto Exchange Pins Blame on JefeDAO Crypto exchange OX.FUN has issued a detailed statement accusing JefeDAO of executing an oracle manipulation attack. According to the exchange, JefeDAO made a $1 million USDC deposit on February 14, 2025. Shortly after, between 05:46:56 and 05:57:06 UTC, he allegedly began selling the token JAILSTOOL aggressively. Furthermore, the exchange asserted that Jeffe placed large limit orders below the fair price—$600,000 worth at $0.048 and additional orders at $0.045 when the token’s fair price was $0.05. As a result, Jeffe traded $300,000 worth of the asset. OX.FUN claims this activity pushed the market price below $0.04, enabling JefeDAO to close its short positions at a low of $0.034. “This behavior is explicitly against our Terms of Service and goes against the interest of other users on OXFUN,” the statement read. As the crypto market participation continues to grow, the number of crypto exchange hacks has grown. Last year in 2024, WazirX reported the largest hack losing more than $235 million in user funds.

The Federal Reserve has officially recognized the efficiency, security, and scalability of BFT in a research paper discussing secure payment systems. This acknowledgment reinforces the relevance of digital assets such as XRP , Stellar Lumens (XLM), and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), which utilize variations of BFT-based consensus mechanisms. FEDERAL RESERVE OFFICIALLY EMBRACES BFT, CEMENTING XRP, XLM, AND HBAR’S ROLE IN SECURE PAYMENTS The Federal Reserve has officially acknowledged the efficiency and scalability of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus models in a research paper discussing a secure payment… pic.twitter.com/2pJ0j2Nx8U — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) February 21, 2025 Understanding Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and Its Importance Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is a consensus mechanism that ensures a distributed network can function correctly even if some nodes act maliciously or fail to communicate properly. BFT provides high security and reliability, making it an optimal choice for financial transactions that demand efficiency and resilience against attacks or failures. The Federal Reserve’s recognition of BFT as a preferred model for secure payments is a major validation of its effectiveness over alternative consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Unlike PoW, which relies on high energy consumption and computational work, or PoS, which bases security on token ownership, BFT achieves consensus through mathematically verified fault tolerance, ensuring faster and more secure transactions. XRP, XLM, and HBAR: Leading with BFT Consensus The research underscores the importance of BFT-based digital assets in future payment infrastructures. XRP, XLM, and HBAR all employ variations of Byzantine Fault Tolerance: XRP Ledger (XRPL) utilizes the Federated Consensus Model, a form of BFT that allows validators to agree on transactions without requiring mining or extensive computational power. This ensures high-speed, low-cost cross-border payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Stellar (XLM) operates on the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) model that prioritizes security and efficiency in financial transactions. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) employs the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which combines gossip protocol with asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT), ensuring high scalability and low latency. The images provided by SMQKE further illustrate the technical distinctions between blockchain-based and Hashgraph-based consensus models. In particular, the Hedera Hashgraph diagram emphasizes how aBFT produces the highest level of security for distributed networks while maintaining efficiency. Implications for the Future of Digital Payments One of the most critical takeaways from the Federal Reserve’s research is the implication for the future adoption of these assets in global financial systems. XRP, XLM, and HBAR are not only highly scalable and secure, but they also adhere to the ISO 20022 standard , which is a global messaging format for financial transactions. This compliance positions these assets as ideal candidates for integration into banking and payment networks. Given that the Federal Reserve has identified BFT as the most robust model for securing distributed payments, the potential use of XRP, XLM, and HBAR in institutional and central bank digital currency (CBDC) frameworks becomes increasingly likely. As regulatory clarity improves and financial institutions seek efficient, secure, and interoperable payment solutions, these digital assets could see further institutional adoption.

According to Wedson, the hacker has already dispersed the funds across multiple addresses and platforms, making recovery efforts significantly more difficult. The stolen ETH was transferred through various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and financial platforms, including OKX (Dex Router), Uniswap, Pendle Finance, Kilnfi (staking), and DLN Trade. Additionally, while a portion of the funds went to Arbitrum, other amounts went to centralized exchanges like KuCoin and smaller, less regulated platforms like Exchcx. The hacker’s strategy follows a classic money laundering scheme: splitting funds into smaller transactions and spreading them across different platforms to hide their tracks. Estimates suggest that around 35% of ETH addresses on the exchange remain unlabeled, making it difficult for investigators to associate them with specific assets. Wedson noted that the patterns of movement point to the use of automation and crypto mixers, further complicating monitoring efforts. Some wallets that initially held 400 ETH expanded to 1,500 ETH and eventually reached 13,000 ETH before being fragmented again. Despite these complex movements, at least 60,000 ETH from the initial attack remained intact, raising questions about the hacker’s next move. Related News: Watch Out: 19 Altcoins Have Massive Token Unlocks in the New Week - Here is the Day by Day, Hour by Hour List Ethereum’s decentralized and anonymous nature makes recovery efforts particularly difficult. While blockchain transactions are transparent, tracking stolen assets becomes extremely difficult when sophisticated obfuscation techniques are used. Speculation about the attack points to North Korean hacker groups, but Wedson cautions against premature conclusions. “The blockchain does not store identities, only addresses, and any attribution is based on manual labeling or machine learning,” he explained. Skilled hackers often manipulate transaction behavior to mislead investigators, creating false traces that make precise attribution difficult. Wedson believes that given the scope of the laundering operation, it is increasingly unlikely that the stolen Ethereum will be recovered. While exchanges and blockchain analytics firms attempt to block and track certain transactions, decentralized platforms and privacy-focused tools provide effective protection for cybercriminals. “Some of the stolen ETH could be cashed out via decentralized exchanges in the coming days, making tracking even more difficult,” Wedson said. If darknet markets are involved, tracing the funds will become nearly impossible. *This is not investment advice.

Last week, SOL block trades totaling $32.39 million in notional value crossed the tape on Deribit, representing nearly 25% of the total options activity of $130.74 million. The remainder of the activity comprised screen trades, according to Amberdata. That's the second-highest proportion of block trades to total activity on record. A ""block trade"" in options refers to a significant, privately negotiated options transaction between two parties involving a large number of contracts. Such trades, typically associated with whale activity, are executed over-the-counter and outside the regular order book and then booked on the exchange, allowing for a minimal impact on the market prices. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset, in this case, SOL, at a preset price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put option provides the right to sell. On Deribit, which accounts for over 85% of the global crypto options activity, one options contract represents 1 SOL. Last week's spike in SOL block trades featured a preference for put options, which traders use to hedge against or profit from a potential price slide. ""Nearly 80% of the block-trade volume was concentrated in put contracts. Compared to only 40% puts for BTC and 37.5% puts for ETH during the same timeframe,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said. The whale demand for put options comes as SOL's outlook appears grim following the 46% price slide to $160 in just over five weeks. The activity on the Solana blockchain, which became a go-to-place for memecoin traders last year, peaked with the launch of the TRUMP token on Jan. 17, three days before Donald Trump was inaugurated as the President of the U.S. Since then, the number of daily transactions on Solana and the cumulative daily volume on the Solana-based decentralized exchanges has declined significantly, according to data source Artemis. That has weakened the bullish case for SOL. Plus, the impending SOL token unlock on Jan. 1 presents a significant headwind, per Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen. ""Solana (SOL) will have a major token unlock event on March 1, releasing 11.2 million SOL tokens, valued at approximately $2.07 billion. This represents 2.29% of the total supply. A significant portion of the unlock comes from the FTX estate and a foundation sale,"" Chen said. Chen explained that the large unlock could breed market volatility as it accounts for nearly 59% of SOL's daily spot trading volume. Hence, its natural to see a lot of hedging flow in put options in anticipation of a potential extended SOL price slide. ""Many traders would also take this opportunity to long Vol[atility] to generate good yield,"" Chen noted.",Markets|Solana|SOL|Options|Markets,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-24 06:05:32

A neobank is a digital-only financial institution that operates without any physical branches, offering banking services through mobile apps. In addition to traditional banking services, Infini provides stablecoin transactions and yield-generating accounts. The platform has witnessed massive popularity since its inception, with a 500% monthly growth rate in active users, according to a Feb. 14 press release . The Infini hack is the latest in a string of high-profile crypto security breaches. On Feb. 21, Bybit suffered a $1.4 billion exploit, making it one of the largest exchange hacks in history. A hacker manipulated smart contract logic to drain Bybit’s multisig cold wallet. The exchange is currently working with blockchain security firms to try and recover stolen assets and has launched a $140 million bounty.

Some delegates within its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) have expressed strong opposition to the recommendations of its three-member Growth Management Committee (GMC). The GMC has suggested using 7,500 ETH from Arbitrum’s treasury to back three decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, none of which are built on top of Arbitrum. The committee plans to invest 5,000 ETH into the liquid staking protocol Lido, which would generate 5,000 wstETH (wrapped staked ETH) tokens. The GMC also recommended utilizing the 5,000 wstETH in the Aave V3 on Arbitrum to enhance borrowing and take advantage of future incentive programs related to Lido, Aave, Renzo, and Kelp. The remaining 2,500 ETH will be used for the lending protocol of Fluid’s Arbitrum platform. The GMC reviewed proposals from 45 protocols , including Dolomite, GMX and other Arbitrum-native options. It expects a 4.54% yield from wstETH deposits. It is expected that the allocation to Fluid protocol will yield 1-2% in native ETH, enhancing the liquidity of the ecosystem in Arbitrum. However, all requests for comment to GMC members were left unanswered as of publication time. GMC faces backlash for overlooking Arbitrum-native projects The GMC was designed to increase risk in order to increase yields, support emerging protocols, and build up Arbitrum native projects. However, as Entropy Advisors’ proposal stated, it finally concluded that building a solid but conservative foundation for the DAO’s treasury strategy was the best strategy for now until the DAO has enough capacity to actively control the positions. Although the GMC provided some explanation for its decision, some members of the Arbitrum DAO have shared doubts as to why other Arbitrum-based protocols were not recommended for funding. JoJo, the delegate was also curious why a part of the 7,500 ETH fund was not spread among other protocols while also stressing the necessity of supporting builders who back Arbitrum instead of other platforms like Coinbase or Solana. Delegate Ultra also had issues with the proposal, pointing out that it doesn’t inspire confidence in Arbitrum-specific projects. While not outright opposing the allocation, he called it the simplest and least ambitious of the three options. He said that even putting 10% of the funds into Arbitrum-based projects would have been nice. He said that other projects like GMX, Dolomite, and Camelot could have been viable alternatives despite the risks. In response, the GMC has pointed out that this proposal is only the beginning of a sequence of future allocations expected to funnel ETH and stablecoin revenue back into the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem. The idea is to improve the sustainability of DAOs and continue supporting Arbitrum’s network of builders in the long run. However, ultra contended that the GMC missed a crucial opportunity to demonstrate alignment with Arbitrum’s native projects. He said that it seems natural that,more protocols can be explored as rounds go on, but this doesn’t mean that the first round should be any less important. He continued to sat that the first round is the one that draws much attention, and there’s great importance on the publicity aspect too. Delegates prepare to vote on controversial investment proposal The proposal will be voted on in a Snapshot vote as of Thursday and requires a simple majority and 3% of votable tokens quorum to pass. Ultra predicted that the proposal was likely to be rejected, and the group expressed an intention to vote against it. In Ultra’s view, any new plan will likely have 5-40% of its allocation going to Arbitrum-native projects. The GMC and a separate Treasury Management Committee (TMC) were founded last year by Arbitrum’s DAO to find risk-free places to deploy the Layer 2 Ethereum bridge’s ETH. Entropy Advisors brought to the original GMC/TMC proposal the notion that the DAO has not so much taken a single productive step with its ETH and has missed a chance to deploy those to grow, form partnerships, and yield. It also highlighted that the DAO has locked its holdings, which could have amounted to about 400 ETH in staking rewards, by not using them.

40760467,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133218,1740377327,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionizing School Support: AI Mental Health Chatbot Bridges Counseling Gap,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-chatbot-school-mental-health/,"In a world increasingly intertwined with digital solutions, even the crucial realm of student mental health is seeing innovative technological interventions. As schools grapple with counselor shortages and growing student needs, a beacon of hope emerges in the form of an AI mental health chatbot . Meet Sonny, a “wellbeing companion” developed by Sonar Mental Health, designed to provide crucial support to students when they need it most. This isn’t about replacing human connection, but rather intelligently augmenting it, offering a scalable solution to a pressing educational challenge. Let’s delve into how Sonny is making a difference. Addressing the Critical Need for School Counseling The statistics are stark: a significant percentage of high schools across the nation lack adequate school counseling resources. This gap leaves countless students without timely access to mental health support, potentially impacting their academic performance and overall wellbeing. Sonar Mental Health recognizes this critical issue and has developed Sonny to act as an immediate point of contact for students. Instead of navigating complex systems or waiting for appointments, students can simply text Sonny. This ease of access is particularly vital for young people who might feel more comfortable communicating digitally. How Does This Mental Health Chatbot Work? Sonny isn’t your typical automated response bot. It’s a sophisticated system that cleverly combines the speed and scalability of AI in education with the empathy and expertise of human professionals. Here’s a breakdown: AI-Powered Suggestions: When a student texts Sonny with a question or concern, the AI engine analyzes the message and suggests appropriate responses. Human Oversight: Crucially, a team of individuals with backgrounds in psychology, social work, and crisis intervention reviews and refines the AI’s suggestions before they are sent to the student. This ensures that the chatbot responses are not only relevant but also sensitive and responsible. Bridge to Human Support: Sonny is not designed to be a therapist. Instead, it serves as a triage system. When deeper intervention is needed, Sonar staffers work with schools and parents to connect students with appropriate therapists and resources. This hybrid approach ensures that students receive timely support while also being directed towards professional help when necessary. It’s about creating a safety net, not a replacement for qualified professionals. The Impact on Student Wellbeing and Beyond The potential benefits of integrating an AI mental health chatbot like Sonny into the school environment are substantial, particularly regarding student wellbeing . Consider these points: Increased Accessibility: Sonny breaks down barriers to access. Students can reach out anytime, anywhere, without the stigma sometimes associated with seeking help in person. Early Intervention: By providing immediate support, Sonny can help address mental health concerns early on, potentially preventing escalation into more serious issues. Reduced Counselor Burden: While not replacing counselors, Sonny can handle initial inquiries and provide basic support, freeing up counselors to focus on more complex cases and in-depth interventions. Data-Driven Insights: Anonymized data from chatbot interactions can provide schools with valuable insights into the prevalent mental health concerns among their student population, allowing for more targeted and effective support programs. Navigating the Challenges of AI in Youth Mental Health While the promise of AI in education and mental health is undeniable, it’s essential to acknowledge and address potential challenges: Data Privacy and Security: Protecting student data is paramount. Robust security measures and clear privacy policies are crucial to build trust and ensure ethical implementation. Maintaining Human Connection: It’s vital to emphasize that technology is a tool to augment, not replace, human interaction. The human element in Sonny’s operation is a key strength. Ensuring Equitable Access: Efforts must be made to ensure that solutions like Sonny are accessible to all students, regardless of socioeconomic background or technological access at home. Continuous Improvement and Evaluation: Like any technology, Sonny will require ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and refinement to ensure its effectiveness and address any unintended consequences. Looking Ahead: The Future of AI and School Mental Health Support Sonar Mental Health’s Sonny represents a significant step forward in leveraging technology to address the critical issue of student mental health. As AI mental health chatbot technology evolves, we can anticipate even more sophisticated and integrated solutions. The key will be to strike the right balance – harnessing the power of AI to scale support while always prioritizing human empathy, ethical considerations, and the unique needs of each student. The journey to better student wellbeing in the digital age is just beginning, and innovative approaches like Sonny are paving the way.

Bitcoin traders are eyeing key price levels to determine BTC’s next move. For now, $106,000 is seen as a breakout point and $85,000 as a potential support. Despite short-term volatility, analysts and Cathie Wood are still bullish about Bitcoin’s long-term potential due to institutional adoption. Montana Lawmakers Vote Against Bitcoin Investment Montana’s House of Representatives rejected a bill that could have made Bitcoin (BTC) a state reserve asset. Lawmakers are especially concerned about the potential risks of speculative investment with taxpayer funds. House Bill No. 429 failed in a 41-59 vote on Feb. 22, after apprehensions that it will grant the state’s investment board the authority to invest in Bitcoin, stablecoins, and precious metals. The bill’s criteria limited investment to digital assets with an average market cap of more than $750 billion over the past year, which is a threshold that is currently met only by Bitcoin. Several Republican lawmakers opposed the measure by arguing that investing taxpayer money in cryptocurrency was too risky. Representative Steven Kelly said that the state has a responsibility to protect public funds and suggested that such investments could be too volatile. Representative Bill Mercer is also concerned about the bill, and argued that he did not plan to allow the state to invest in speculative assets like cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens. Another lawmaker agreed with this, and even called the proposal a form of speculation. Despite the opposition, some legislators defended the bill by saying that Montana should focus on maximizing returns on taxpayer funds. Representative Lee Demming argued that if the state holds taxpayer money, it should either aim for the highest possible return or return the funds to citizens. Bill sponsor Curtis Schomer warned that rejecting the bill will be the greater risk, as Montana’s investment board would continue to lose purchasing power by relying on traditional assets like bonds. Representative Steve Fitzpatrick added that the state had substantial funds sitting idle, which could be better utilized by investing in digital assets and precious metals to generate returns that could ultimately reduce taxes and provide fiscal relief. The bill previously passed Montana’s business and labor committee in a 12-8 vote on Feb. 19, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed. With the latest vote, the bill is now effectively dead, meaning any future attempt to establish Bitcoin as a reserve asset in Montana will require a fresh legislative proposal. Montana’s move happened during broader discussions across the United States on Bitcoin reserves. A total of 24 states have introduced similar legislation, including Arizona, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Texas. According to Bitcoin Laws , 20 of these states still have active bills under consideration. Among them, Utah has made the most progress. Strategy Signals Another Big Bitcoin Buy Despite Montana’s hesitancy, Strategy recently signaled yet another Bitcoin acquisition after a brief pause in purchases. Co-founder Michael Saylor posted a Bitcoin chart suggesting an imminent purchase after the company’s last acquisition on Feb. 10, when it bought 7,633 BTC for over $742 million. This brought its total Bitcoin holdings to 478,740 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder of the asset. According to data from SaylorTracker , Strategy’s Bitcoin stash is now valued at more than $46 billion. The company has also seen an impressive 47.7% gain on its investment. Saylor previously stated that the company plans to ramp up its use of “intelligent leverage ” throughout the first quarter of 2025 to finance more Bitcoin purchases. The goal is to create more value for shareholders while also strengthening Strategy’s position as the dominant corporate Bitcoin holder. Despite concerns about the sustainability of its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, major financial institutions continue to invest in the company through equity and fixed-income securities. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $11.6 trillion in assets under management, recently increased its stake in Strategy to 5%, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on Feb. 6. The move took place just one day after the company’s rebrand, which shifted to a more Bitcoin-focused vision. Beyond BlackRock, multiple US state institutions also invested in Strategy. Currently, 12 states hold Strategy stock as part of their pension programs or treasury funds, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin. Among them, California’s State Teachers’ Retirement Fund has the largest exposure by holding close to $83 million in Strategy stock. The California Public Employees Retirement System follows closely with approximately $76.7 million in shares. For now, it seems like Institutional confidence in the company is still growing, despite concerns from critics who question the sustainability of its Bitcoin-centric approach. On Feb. 20, Strategy announced the pricing of a $2 billion convertible note offering, its latest corporate securities issuance aimed at acquiring even more Bitcoin. The company’s continued expansion of its Bitcoin holdings just proves its long-term commitment to the digital asset, which helped it position itself as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Bitcoin Traders Eye $106K for Breakout Crypto traders are closely watching Bitcoin’s price action, and many now suggest that reclaiming the $106,000 level will confirm further upside potential. Pseudonymous trader Pentoshi believes a move back to this range could lead to new price discovery. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold its current support between $92,000 and $94,000, it may retest $85,000 , which is a level it hasn’t traded at since Nov. 12. Crypto analyst AlejandroBTC also previously hinted at a possible drop to $85,000. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,572, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite the possibility of a short-term pullback, Pentoshi is still bullish, and pointed out that Bitcoin has spent a lot of time consolidating in its current range without breaking down. Some analysts believe that $85,000 may still be an optimistic local bottom, with the potential for a deeper correction. In fact, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted on Jan. 27 that Bitcoin could pull back toward the $70,000 to $75,000 range, which he warned could trigger a “mini financial crisis.” Other traders are also more cautious about Bitcoin’s next move. Trader Mister Crypto indicated that he will consider opening a major trade if Bitcoin drops to $90,000. Another trader, Donny , said that Bitcoin’s structure looks solid but believes it is still very important to take context into consideration. He suggested that the next few weeks will be crucial in determining its direction. Pseudonymous trader AshCrypto , however, is much more optimistic, and predicted that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high by March due to CoinGlass data showing that March has historically delivered an average return of 13.42% since 2013. Bitcoin’s all-time high of $109,000 was set on Jan. 20, just before Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. While short-term speculation dominates the market, some industry figures are still more focused on Bitcoin’s long-term potential. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood increased her probability of Bitcoin reaching $1.5 million by 2030 thanks to the growing institutional adoption of the asset class. She believes that despite recent volatility, the institutionalization of Bitcoin is strengthening its long-term outlook.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-24 06:09:59

The crypto world thrives on transparency and truth, but recent events surrounding xAI’s Grok 3 model have raised serious questions about AI censorship and the potential for bias, even in models touted as ‘truth-seeking.’ When Elon Musk unveiled Grok 3, the promise was clear: a maximally truth-seeking AI. However, a recent glitch or intentional tweak has thrown this claim into doubt, particularly concerning mentions of prominent figures like Donald Trump and Musk himself. Let’s dive into this developing story and explore what it means for the future of AI and information integrity. Unveiling the Grok 3 Censorship Incident: What Happened? Over the past weekend, eagle-eyed social media users spotted something peculiar. When posing the question, “Who is the biggest misinformation spreader?” to Grok 3 with its “Think” setting activated, the AI model revealed in its chain of thought – its internal reasoning process – that it was explicitly instructed to avoid mentioning Donald Trump or Elon Musk . This revelation sparked immediate debate and concern about potential bias and manipulation within Grok 3. While Bitcoin World confirmed this behavior initially, it appears xAI quickly addressed the issue, and by Sunday morning, Grok 3 was once again including Donald Trump in its responses to the misinformation query. Why Does This Grok 3 Censorship Matter? The Implications of AI Bias This incident, however brief, underscores a critical challenge in the development of AI: bias. Here’s why this apparent AI censorship is a significant concern: Erosion of Trust: If an AI model, especially one marketed as “truth-seeking,” is perceived as censoring information, it erodes user trust in the technology. In the crypto space, trust is paramount. Political Influence: The fact that the censorship seemed to target politically charged figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk raises questions about potential political influence or bias seeping into AI models. Controlled Narratives: If AI can be tweaked to avoid mentioning certain individuals or topics, it opens the door to the possibility of subtly controlling narratives and shaping public opinion. Transparency Concerns: The initial lack of transparency surrounding this apparent censorship highlights the need for greater openness about how AI models are trained and modified. Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Misinformation: A Complex Relationship The article rightly points out that both Elon Musk and Donald Trump have faced scrutiny for spreading claims deemed to be misinformation . Community Notes on X (formerly Twitter, owned by Musk) frequently fact-check their posts. Recent examples of contested narratives include: Claim Source Status Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a “dictator” with 4% public approval. Musk and Trump False. Zelenskyy is democratically elected, and approval ratings are significantly higher. Ukraine started the conflict with Russia. Musk and Trump False. Russia initiated the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While the definition of “misinformation” can be subjective and politically charged, these examples illustrate the ongoing debate around the information shared by these prominent figures. The question then becomes: should an AI model be programmed to avoid mentioning individuals associated with misinformation, or should it provide unbiased information, even if it’s unflattering? Grok 3 and Political Leaning: Navigating the ‘Woke’ Debate The controversy around Grok 3 isn’t new. Earlier criticisms suggested the model leaned too far to the left, even to the point of controversially stating that Donald Trump and Musk deserved the death penalty. xAI swiftly addressed this as a “terrible and bad failure.” Musk himself has positioned Grok as an edgy, anti-“woke” AI, willing to tackle controversial topics that other AI systems might shy away from. Grok and Grok 2 demonstrated this by readily using vulgar language, unlike the more sanitized responses from ChatGPT. However, past Grok models have also shown political hedging and, according to studies, a left-leaning bias on issues like transgender rights and diversity programs. Musk attributed this to Grok’s training data, derived from public web pages, and pledged to move Grok toward political neutrality. This mirrors a broader trend in the AI industry, with companies like OpenAI also striving for political neutrality, potentially influenced by accusations of conservative censorship during the Trump administration. Is Grok 3 Still a Truth-Seeking AI? The Path Forward The brief censorship episode raises valid questions about Grok 3’s commitment to being a truly truth-seeking AI. While xAI appears to have rectified the immediate issue, the incident highlights the ongoing challenges of building unbiased and transparent AI models. For the crypto community and beyond, this serves as a crucial reminder: Critical Evaluation: Always critically evaluate information from any source, including AI models. Don’t blindly accept AI outputs as absolute truth. Demand Transparency: Advocate for greater transparency from AI developers about training data, algorithms, and moderation policies. Ongoing Scrutiny: Continue to scrutinize AI models for bias and censorship, holding developers accountable for building fair and objective systems. Decentralization as a Solution?: Could decentralized AI models offer a more resistant and transparent alternative to centralized, potentially biased systems? This is a question worth exploring for the future of AI in the crypto space. The saga of Grok 3 and its apparent censorship is a stark reminder that even the most advanced AI models are still under development and susceptible to biases and manipulations. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, especially in information-sensitive fields like cryptocurrency and finance, vigilance and critical thinking are more important than ever. The quest for truly truth-seeking AI is ongoing, and incidents like this serve as valuable, if shocking , lessons along the way.

Bybit’s Buys of $742 M ETH After the Hack According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, Bybit has bought 266,694 ETH worth around $742 million. The move appears to be part of the exchange’s effort to stabilize its reserves after losing a significant amount of funds to the hack. It seems that #Bybit has bought 266,694 $ETH ($742M) after being hacked. 0x2E45…1b77(related to #Bybit ) bought 157,660 $ETH ($437.82M) from Galaxy Digital, FalconX, Wintermute via OTC. 0xd7CF…A995(likely related to #Bybit ) bought 109,033 $ETH ($304.12M) from DEXs and CEXs.… pic.twitter.com/8FfGZo18OU — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 24, 2025 The attack, carried out by the North Korean state-backed hacker group Lazarus, targeted Bybit’s multisignature cold wallet, resulting in the loss of nearly $1.4 billion. As per Lookonchain’s analysis, Bybit received 446,870 ETH, worth approximately $1.23 billion, from various sources, including loans, large investor deposits, and direct purchases. This amount accounts for almost 87% of the total stolen funds, suggesting that Bybit is actively working to replace the missing assets. Timeline Of Ethereum Purchases Further blockchain data reveals that a wallet address linked to Bybit, identified as 0x2E45, purchased 157,660 ETH, valued at $437.82 million, from well-known crypto trading firms such as Galaxy Digital, FalconX, and Wintermute through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Meanwhile, the second wallet address, 0xd7CF, believed to be associated with Bybit, acquired 109,033 ETH, worth around $304.12 million, from both decentralized (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs). Efforts to Restore Stability Bybit has wasted no time in bouncing back from the massive security breach. In a recent tweet, CEO Ben Zhou confirmed that the exchange has fully restored the $1.4 billion worth of Ether lost in the Feb. 21 hack.

Ethereum Price Analysis Ethereum has bounced back by nearly 6% since last week’s attack, which caused its price to drop. However, as the new week begins, ETH has slipped by 2%, now trading around $2,730. If the decline continues, ETH could fall further and test its next support level at $2,450. Eventually, the daily RSI also points to a bearish trend, currently at 46. It was rejected at the neutral 50 level on Sunday and is now moving downward, signaling weakness. On the flip side, if ETH regains momentum, it could push higher and make another attempt to reach the $3,000 mark .",News,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|ZRX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-24 06:15:08

Currently, the Arbitrum community, known for its vibrant and engaged members, finds itself at a crossroads. A new DeFi investment proposal has ignited a fiery debate, raising critical questions about the direction of Arbitrum’s treasury and its commitment to native projects. Let’s dive into the heart of this controversy and understand what’s causing such a stir within this leading Layer-2 scaling solution. Why is the Arbitrum Community Questioning This DeFi Investment Proposal? At the center of the storm is a governance proposal put forth by the Arbitrum DAO’s recently formed Growth Management Committee (GMC). The proposal suggests a significant investment of 7,500 ETH (Ethereum) into various DeFi protocols. While investing in DeFi isn’t inherently controversial, the specific protocols chosen and the perceived lack of focus on Arbitrum-native projects have sparked considerable criticism. The community’s concerns can be summarized into a few key points: Prioritizing Non-Native Protocols: The proposal earmarks funds for established DeFi giants like Lido (for ETH staking), Aave (for lending and borrowing), and Fluid (a cross-chain lending protocol). While these are reputable platforms, critics argue that they are not native to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This raises questions about whether the investment truly benefits Arbitrum or simply disperses funds across the wider DeFi landscape. Neglecting Arbitrum-Native Projects: A significant portion of the community feels that the proposal overlooks the burgeoning DeFi projects built directly on Arbitrum. These projects are crucial for the long-term growth and vibrancy of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Investing in them could foster innovation, attract more users and developers, and solidify Arbitrum’s position as a leading L2 scaling solution . Lack of Transparency and Community Consultation: Some community members have expressed concerns about the process leading up to the proposal. They argue for more transparency from the GMC and greater community consultation before such significant investment decisions are made. Decentralized governance ideally involves inclusive discussions and consensus-building, and some feel this process was rushed or insufficiently collaborative. Risk Assessment and Diversification: While DeFi investments can be lucrative, they also carry inherent risks. Some community members are questioning the risk assessment conducted for these specific protocols and whether a more diversified investment strategy, potentially including a mix of native and non-native projects, would be more prudent. Breaking Down the DeFi Investment Proposal: What’s Actually Being Proposed? To understand the controversy fully, let’s examine the details of the DeFi investment proposal . The GMC’s rationale likely stems from a desire to generate yield on the Arbitrum DAO’s treasury and participate in the broader DeFi ecosystem. Investing in established protocols like Lido and Aave offers relatively lower risk exposure compared to emerging, untested projects. Here’s a closer look at the protocols mentioned: Protocol Description Potential Benefits Community Concerns (in this context) Lido A leading liquid staking solution for ETH and other assets. Users can stake ETH and receive stETH in return, which can be used in DeFi. Generates yield from ETH staking, relatively established and secure protocol. Not Arbitrum-native, yield benefits stETH holders generally, not specifically Arbitrum ecosystem. Aave A decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Users can deposit assets to earn yield or borrow against their collateral. High liquidity, established platform, potential to earn yield from lending. Not Arbitrum-native, potential for capital outflow from Arbitrum ecosystem to Aave on other chains. Fluid A cross-chain lending protocol aiming to facilitate seamless lending and borrowing across different blockchains. Cross-chain exposure, potentially higher yield opportunities, innovative approach to DeFi. Less established than Lido and Aave, cross-chain nature might not directly benefit Arbitrum ecosystem, complexity and potential risks of cross-chain protocols. The proposal aims to allocate 7,500 ETH across these platforms, seeking to generate returns for the Arbitrum DAO treasury. However, the community’s pushback highlights a fundamental question: **What is the primary purpose of the DAO treasury, and how should it be utilized to best serve the Arbitrum ecosystem?** The Power of Decentralized Governance and Crypto Community Voices This situation underscores the importance of decentralized governance in the cryptocurrency world. The Arbitrum community’s vocal response demonstrates the power of token holders to influence decisions within a DAO. Their concerns are not simply about opposing the proposal; they reflect a deeper desire to shape the strategic direction of Arbitrum and ensure its long-term success. This debate is a healthy sign of a vibrant and engaged community that cares deeply about the project’s future. The criticism isn’t necessarily a rejection of DeFi investments altogether. Instead, it’s a call for a more nuanced and strategic approach. Many community members likely agree that utilizing the DAO treasury for yield generation is a sound strategy. However, they advocate for a shift in focus towards supporting and nurturing projects that are integral to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This could include: Investing in Arbitrum-Native DeFi Protocols: Allocating funds to promising DeFi projects built on Arbitrum would directly benefit the ecosystem. This could incentivize development, increase liquidity within Arbitrum’s DeFi space, and attract more users to the platform. Providing Grants and Funding for Ecosystem Development: The DAO treasury could be used to fund grants for developers building on Arbitrum, supporting infrastructure projects, or initiatives that enhance the user experience. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with Arbitrum-native projects through strategic investments or partnerships could foster mutual growth and strengthen the ecosystem as a whole. What’s Next for Arbitrum and Its DeFi Strategy? A vote on the DeFi investment proposal is anticipated soon. The outcome of this vote will be a significant indicator of the community’s priorities and its influence on the DAO’s decision-making process. Regardless of the vote’s result, this episode serves as a valuable lesson for other DAOs and crypto projects. It highlights the critical need for: Transparent Communication: DAOs should prioritize clear and open communication with their communities regarding proposals, strategies, and decision-making processes. Community Consultation: Engaging the community in meaningful discussions and seeking feedback before making significant decisions is crucial for building consensus and ensuring alignment with community values. Strategic Alignment: DAO treasury management should be strategically aligned with the long-term goals and vision of the ecosystem. Investments should ideally contribute to the growth and sustainability of the project. Balancing Risk and Reward: DeFi investments require careful risk assessment and diversification. A balanced approach that considers both potential returns and potential risks is essential for responsible treasury management. The Arbitrum community’s debate is a powerful example of crypto community engagement shaping the future of a project. It showcases the dynamic nature of decentralized governance and the importance of community voices in navigating the complexities of the DeFi landscape. As Arbitrum continues to evolve as a leading L2 scaling solution , how it addresses this proposal and incorporates community feedback will be crucial in defining its path forward. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from the Arbitrum Debate? This situation offers valuable insights for anyone involved in DAOs, DeFi, or the broader crypto space: For DAO Members: Actively participate in governance discussions, voice your opinions, and vote on proposals. Your voice matters in shaping the direction of decentralized projects. For Project Teams and DAOs: Prioritize transparency, community engagement, and strategic alignment in your governance processes. Listen to your community’s concerns and incorporate their feedback into your decision-making. For DeFi Enthusiasts: Pay attention to governance discussions within your favorite DeFi projects. Understanding the debates and proposals helps you grasp the underlying values and direction of these platforms. For Investors: Community engagement and governance are crucial indicators of a healthy and sustainable crypto project. Projects with active and vocal communities are often more resilient and adaptable in the long run. The Arbitrum DeFi investment proposal debate is more than just a disagreement over fund allocation; it’s a reflection of a community deeply invested in the success of its ecosystem. It’s a testament to the power of decentralized governance and the evolving dynamics of the crypto world, where community voices can truly shape the future.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit covered its $1.46 billion loss from a recent hacker attack through a mix of loans, whale deposits, and Ethereum ( ETH ) purchases, blockchain data from Lookonchain shows. In an X post on Feb. 24, Lookonchain showed that Bybit received 157,660 ETH (around $437.8 million) from one address, likely through over-the-counter buying. Another 109,033 ETH ($304.1 million) came from an entity that bought ETH from centralized and decentralized exchanges. Latest Update: Bybit has already fully closed the ETH gap, new audited POR report will be published very soon to show that Bybit is again Back to 100% 1:1 on client assets through merkle tree, Stay tuned. https://t.co/QLa1vOujM6 — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 24, 2025 Whales and institutions contributed over $127 million in ETH as loans, while crypto exchange Bitget provided 40,000 ETH ($106 million) and MEXC contributed 12,653 stETH ($33.9 million) in loans. Another address, possibly an over-the-counter buyer, sent 22,609 ETH ($61.9 million).

Smaller contributions came from users associated with “@yuchao” (2,499 ETH) and DWF Labs (2,200 ETH). Following Lookonchain’s X post, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou took to X to announce that the exchange has “fully closed the ETH gap,” adding that the new audited proof-of-reserves report “will be published very soon to show that Bybit is again Back to 100% 1:1 on client assets through merkle tree.” As crypto.news reported earlier, anonymous blockchain investigator ZachXBT found direct on-chain links between the Bybit hack and the recent Phemex breach. On-chain data shows the attackers merged funds from both incidents using the same initial theft addresses, a pattern similar to tactics used by North Korea -backed Lazarus Group to connect multiple exchange hacks.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot BTC ETFs recorded $559.41 million in net outflows over the past week, continuing the negative momentum from the previous week, when they saw $585.65 million in net redemptions. Notably, U.S. BTC ETFs began the week from Feb. 18 to Feb. 21 with $60.63 million in outflows, reversing the positive flows observed on the last trading day of the prior week. Over the next two days, the negative momentum intensified, with increased outflows of $71.07 million and $364.93 million , the latter being the highest net outflow observed in February so far. The trend continued on Friday, Feb. 21, with investors withdrawing an additional $62.77 million. The majority of outflows on that day came from Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw $60.08 million exit the fund as it continued its outflow streak following its conversion from a trust structure. Bitwise’s BITB and Fidelity’s FBTC also contributed to the negative momentum, with outflows of $16.58 million and $12.47 million, respectively. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT returned to positive inflows, receiving $21.64 million, while VanEck’s HODL recorded a slight gain of $4.71 million. The total weekly trading volume for these investment vehicles stood at $10.72 billion. Since Feb. 6, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $1.1 billion in net outflows, making February 2025 the worst month for withdrawals since their inception over a year ago. Despite the negative monthly trend, BTC ETFs managed to record net inflows on a few days: February 4, 5, 7, and 14.

Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, pointed out that most spot Bitcoin ETF investors are primarily using these products for arbitrage strategies rather than long-term holdings. He noted that only about 44% of the inflows are actually tied to long-term investments. This suggests that the real demand for Bitcoin as a long-term asset in diversified portfolios may be lower than commonly portrayed in the media. Commenting on the recent weekly outflows from BTC ETFs, Kadan Stadelmann, CTO at Komodo Platform, told crypto.news that while Bitcoin ETFs are seeing capital outflows, Gold ETFs are experiencing inflows. This shift could indicate that investors are bracing for economic uncertainty. Another potential indicator? Berkshire Hathaway recently disclosed that it is holding a record-breaking $334.2 billion in cash. According to Stadelmann, this suggests the company is waiting for a market dip to buy assets and commodities at lower prices. Adding to investor uncertainty, Donald Trump recently stated that if re-elected, the U.S. will impose reciprocal tariffs on almost every country. This has raised concerns about inflation and trade disruptions, not only among investors but also at the Federal Reserve, as reflected in last week’s meeting minutes. At the same time, Bitcoin, often viewed as a leading indicator of market trends, has shown resistance and begun trending downward. Stadelmann believes this could signal a broader market selloff, particularly following Friday’s stock market decline. “These are the clues Bitcoin ETF investors are seeing, prompting them to move from ETFs into cash,” Stadelmann concluded.

Understanding market sentiment, the overall attitude of investors towards the crypto market, can be a powerful tool. Enter the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a vital metric that helps gauge these emotional undercurrents. Let’s dive into the latest reading and see what a ‘Neutral’ stance truly signifies. Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Holding Steady in Neutral As of February 24th, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a product of Alternative.me, registered a score of 49. This marks a slight dip of one point from the previous day. However, despite this minor decrease, the index firmly remains within the ‘Neutral’ zone. This consistency suggests a market that isn’t dominated by extreme fear or excessive greed, but rather a balanced, albeit potentially cautious, outlook. But what exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , and why should crypto enthusiasts and investors pay attention to it? Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Sentiment Thermometer Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a thermometer for the crypto market’s emotional temperature. It’s a number ranging from 0 to 100, designed to distill the complex and often irrational sentiments driving the cryptocurrency market into a single, easily digestible figure. 0-24: Extreme Fear: This zone signals deep-seated fear in the market. Investors are likely panic-selling, and prices may be reaching potential bottoms. This can ironically present buying opportunities for savvy investors. 25-49: Fear: While not extreme, fear still dominates. The market is cautious, and downward pressure is present. 50-75: Greed: Optimism starts to take hold. Investors are becoming more bullish, and prices are likely trending upwards. 76-100: Extreme Greed: This is peak bullishness, often signaling a market bubble. Investors are excessively greedy, and caution is warranted as prices may be overextended and ripe for correction. 49-51 (Neutral): Equilibrium. Neither fear nor greed significantly dominates. The market is in a state of uncertainty or balance, potentially awaiting catalysts for the next move. What Factors Influence the Index? Unpacking the Calculation The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s calculated using a blend of six different market indicators, each contributing to the overall sentiment score: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Increased volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares current market momentum and volume to the 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volumes suggest greed. Social Media 15% Analyzes social media sentiment, primarily on platforms like Twitter and Reddit, to gauge public opinion on Bitcoin and crypto. Surveys 15% Periodic polls are conducted among crypto investors to directly measure their sentiment. (Currently paused) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a risk-off sentiment as investors flock to Bitcoin as a perceived safer asset. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Spikes in searches often correlate with market excitement and potentially greed. Why Does a ‘Neutral’ Crypto Sentiment Matter? A ‘Neutral’ reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be interpreted in several ways, offering valuable insights for your crypto market analysis : Indecision and Consolidation: Neutral sentiment often reflects market indecision. It can indicate a period of consolidation where the market is catching its breath after a significant move, either up or down. Potential Turning Point: Neutrality can be a precursor to a shift in market direction. It suggests that neither bullish nor bearish forces are dominant, and the market is poised for a potential breakout or breakdown, depending on upcoming catalysts. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): While volatility is a component of the index itself, a neutral overall reading can sometimes be associated with a period of slightly reduced volatility compared to extreme fear or greed phases. Opportunity for Strategic Planning: In a neutral market, investors have time to assess their positions, conduct thorough research, and develop well-thought-out strategies without the pressure of extreme emotional swings. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Neutral Zone So, how can you leverage this ‘Neutral’ crypto sentiment reading in your crypto journey? Don’t Get Complacent: Neutral doesn’t mean static. The market is still dynamic. Continue to monitor market developments, news, and fundamental factors that could shift sentiment. Review Your Portfolio: Use this period of relative calm to re-evaluate your portfolio allocation. Are you positioned for potential upside or downside risks? Neutrality is a good time for strategic adjustments. Focus on Fundamentals: Instead of getting caught up in short-term price fluctuations driven by emotion, delve deeper into the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you are interested in. Research project developments, adoption rates, and long-term potential. Prepare for Volatility: Even in a neutral phase, crypto markets are inherently volatile. Ensure you have risk management strategies in place, such as stop-loss orders and diversification, to protect your capital. The Psychology Behind Market Sentiment Understanding market psychology is crucial in crypto investing. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that attempts to quantify these often irrational human emotions. Fear and greed are powerful drivers in any market, and crypto is no exception. When fear is rampant, investors tend to sell off assets, often irrationally, leading to price declines. Conversely, when greed takes over, investors pile in, sometimes ignoring fundamental value, driving prices to unsustainable levels. Recognizing these cycles and using tools like the Fear & Greed Index can help you make more informed and less emotionally driven decisions. Conclusion: Staying Informed in a Dynamic Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hovering in the ‘Neutral’ zone at 49 presents a snapshot of a market in equilibrium. It’s a valuable signal to pause, assess, and strategize rather than react impulsively to market noise. By understanding and utilizing tools like this index, you can gain a deeper understanding of crypto market analysis and navigate the exciting, yet often turbulent, waters of cryptocurrency investing with greater confidence.

The hackers , which are believed to be North Korea-affiliated Lazarus Group, have been reportedly using a service called eXch to launder the loot. On Feb. 23, Zhou said he hoped that the exchange “could reconsider and help us to block funds outflowing from them” after contacting them. “We are also getting help from Interpol and international regulatory bodies. Helping block these funds is not just helping Bybit,” he added. Over the weekend, Bybit reported that there had been some success in freezing assets with assistance from companies and organizations, including Tether, Circle, Avalanche, and THORChain. However, it remains a drop in the ocean compared to the total losses. A coordinated effort led to the freezing of $42.89M in just one day.

To maintain complete transparency, Zhou confirmed that Bybit would soon release a Proof of Reserves (PoR) audit. Where Did the Funds Come From? Bybit quickly recovered its lost ETH by pulling funds from different sources. The biggest chunk came from private deals, bringing in 157,660 ETH ($437.8 million), while crypto exchanges added another 109,033 ETH ($304.1 million). Large investors and institutions lent 47,800 ETH ($127.5 million), and Bitget chipped in with a 40,000 ETH loan ($106 million). Smaller private deals contributed 22,609 ETH ($61.8 million), and various investors sent amounts between 2,200 ETH ($6 million) and 20,000 ETH ($53.7 million). This combined effort helped Bybit fully replace the stolen funds in record time. While his efforts were praised by many like comparing it with Bitfinex’s hack many are not happy with Zhou’s claims. Crypto analyst, Hermes Psychopomp questioned Bybit’s claim of fully recovering its losses, pointing out that since the exchange used loans, it still owes money.

33767162,[object Object],1740380434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Cardano Founder Hoskinson Shuts Down Kanye West Rumors,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-shuts-down-kanye-west-rumors/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has categorically dismissed rumors linking hip-hop artist Kanye West, now known as Ye, to a proposed token launch on the Cardano blockchain. In a brief video posted on X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson poured cold water on speculation that Ye might roll out a cryptocurrency project under Cardano’s umbrella. No Kanye West Project on Cardano “Hey guys, I wanted to make a quick video to say Kanye West is not going to launch something on Cardano,” Hoskinson said . “I know some people are talking about it, but it doesn’t even look like he’s actually doing anything of value. Looks like he sold his Twitter account for 17 million dollars to the Barkmeta guys for them to do a scam. Even if he didn’t, I don’t think we want that. It’s too much drama.” He added: “Cardano is a serious project. We’re not a launching place for these types of things. So thank you all for the drama for the weekend, but I don’t think there’s any Kanye at all.” Notably, the controversy began on Friday, when three sources close to Ye’s circle claimed that the artist was planning to release a token named YZY—a nod to his Yeezy fashion brand. According to these sources, 70% of the token’s allocation would be reserved for Ye, with 10% going toward liquidity provisioning and 20% set aside for investors. Rumors suggested that YZY would serve as a means for Ye to bypass mainstream payment and e-commerce platforms such as Shopify, which cut ties with him in response to recent antisemitic statements and other hate-filled rhetoric. Ye’s moves in the crypto space are seen by some as a potential lifeline after he was dropped by key partners, including Adidas and Balenciaga, for praising Adolf Hitler and making repeated antisemitic remarks in live interviews and on social media. In parallel with talk of Ye’s crypto ambitions, whispers circulated that the artist sold his personal X account (@kanyewest) for $17 million to a memecoin group known as @barkmeta, presumably to facilitate a large-scale scam . Crypto influencer, Loki The Bird (@lokithebird), fueled the speculation by writing: “Kanye West sold his account to the BarkMeta Doginals crew for $17M—they’re gearing up to scam the entire space. Share for awareness and save Web3.” There was also an image circulating, showing two phones allegedly logged into @barkmeta and @kanyewest simultaneously. However, Ye swiftly denied any involvement with these individuals or any sale of his account, stating, “This is fake, I don’t know this person.” Hoskinson’s dismissal of any official connection to Ye underscores Cardano’s broader commitment to maintaining its position as a “ serious project .” While the open-source nature of blockchain technology means that permission is not strictly required to build on Cardano, Hoskinson clarified: “He wants money and help to launch it. No one serious in Cardano is going to do it,”effectively closing the door on any partnership.

According to a Feb. 23 announcement , the company’s board of executive and non-executive directors approved plans to increase the company’s Bitcoin investments, allowing HK Asia to purchase an additional 7.88 BTC. The acquisition, made on Feb. 20 through an open market cryptocurrency exchange, was financed using “proceeds from the Group’s internal resources” and cost HK$5,936,906.26, roughly $761,705. This move follows HK Asia’s first Bitcoin purchase on Feb. 16, when the company bought 1 BTC. With the latest purchase, HK Asia’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 8.88 BTC, acquired at an average price of $97,021 per coin. The company clarified that the transaction didn’t trigger any mandatory disclosure requirements under Hong Kong Stock Exchange rules, as the investment remained below the 5% threshold required for notification. Rather, it was announced voluntarily to keep shareholders informed of its growing interest in cryptocurrencies, HK Asia added.

After the company’s first Bitcoin buy, its stock price nearly doubled overnight. Following the latest announcement, shares saw another boost, climbing around 5.7% by midday on Feb. 24. HK Asia joins a number of publicly traded firms adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets to diversify assets and boost company earnings by capitalizing on its long-term growth potential. Companies like Strategy and MetaPlanet have led the charge with periodic Bitcoin investments. On Feb. 11, U.S.-based KURL Technology Group disclosed adding $10 million worth of BTC to its holdings, bringing it to 610 BTC. A day prior, Japanese mobile game studio Gumi said a plan to purchase Bitcoin worth JPY 1 billion by May had been approved .

According to Certik Alert, no fewer than $49.5 million have been transferred from an unverified Ethereum contract. Last week, in the largest hacking event in the history of the crypto industry, approximately $1.46 billion in stETH, mETH and ERC-20 tokens were stolen from Bybit. In the wake of this, the suspicious Ethereum transfer has put the crypto community on high alert. Let’s dive in for more details! #CertiKInsight We have seen suspicious transfers of funds from unverified contracts on Ethereum 0x9A79f4105A4e1A050Ba0b42F25351D394fA7E1DC The receiver 0x3ac96134fb0e42a52d33045aee50b89790f05ed0 took ~$49.5M and is swapping them for Dai Stay Vigilant! pic.twitter.com/MVXyn4fM9o — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) February 24, 2025 Suspicious $49.5M Ethereum Transfer – What We Know So Far The suspicious transfer has been initially detected by Certick Alert. In an X post, it has revealed the details of the transfer. As per its post, around $49.5 million have been transferred from an unverified Ethereum contract. The post notes that the receiving wallet is swapping the transferred fund for Dai stablecoin. Many crypto enthusiasts have expressed concerns about the recent development in the Ethereum ecosystem. The Suspicious ETH Transfer: Crypto Whales or Hackers? Though when the details of the hack was revealed for the first time, it was unclear whether it was a whale action or hack, Certik Alert has later confirmed that it is a hack. Certik Alert hints that the incident follows a pattern of major crypto hacks, like the recent $1.46 billion Bybit hack. Connection to the Bybit Hack: Is It a Trend? Last week, over $1.46 billion in liquid-staked Ether, Mantle Staked ETH and other ERC-20 tokens were stolen from Bybit. The hack was executed using an advanced social engineering technique. The attack was similar to previous hacks such as the $230 million WazirX hack and the $58 million Radiant Capital hack . How Secure is the Ethereum Ecosystem? The Ethereum ecosystem is generally secure, but it faces risks like smart contract vulnerabilities, 51% attacks, and wallet security flaws. While Proof-of-Stake is a strong consensus mechanism, it is not immune to attacks. The $48.5 million suspicious transfer highlights ongoing risks. This shows that hackers can still exploit weaknesses. To stay safe, users should use trusted wallets, avoid phishing scams, and verify transactions carefully.

However, there has been no public announcement yet. AMM is a exchange system in crypto markets that makes trading easy by using a liquidity pool of usually, and at least, two tokens. Instead of matching buyers and sellers like a traditional exchange, smart contracts set the prices based on supply and demand and allow trades to be processed without a counterparty. The “amm.pump.fun” shows a swap product in the making with a sell and buy option alongside a deposit and withdrawal function. That’s a first for Pump.Fun, which lets anyone issue a token for less than $2 in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and meme picture to accompany it. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned (or when tokens are taken out of supply permanently). Pump.Fun’s own AMM would mean tokens are no longer migrated to Raydium, or at least that’s what the market thinks, dampening sentiment for the latter’s RAY tokens. RAY is down 25% in the past 24 hours on the apparent development. “It seems they are planning to have pump tokens graduate to their own pools instead of Raydium,” trader @trenchdiver101, who first flagged the development, said. “They can either extract more fees on Solana or have some mechanism to reward token holders.” Though a part of Raydium's total trading activity is derived from Pump.Fun tokens, the exchange supports several other top markets — such as Solana (SOL) to stablecoins and others — contributing to its $500 million in average daily trading volumes. As such, the product could further bump the revenues and profits of Pump.Fun, which has no token but is among the most profitable crypto applications in the past year — a rare feat in a market where businesses heavily rely on token sales to generate income. Pump.Fun has pocketed over $550 million in total fees since Mar.2024, data shows , with $2.4 billion in trading volumes over just the past two weeks. Over 8 million tokens have been issued on the platform since its 2024 launch, with a few, such as fartcoin (FART), reaching billions of dollars in market capitalization.",Markets|Solana|Memecoin|raydium,EN,0,0,RAY|MARKET|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-24 07:13:25

Centralized exchange eXch is under fire, vehemently denying accusations of money laundering tied to the colossal $1.4 billion Bybit hack. This cyber heist, allegedly orchestrated by the notorious North Korean Lazarus Group, has sent shockwaves through the crypto community. But is eXch truly innocent, or are these denials just smoke and mirrors? Let’s dive into the details of this explosive situation. eXch KYC Policy Under Scrutiny Amid Crypto Exchange Hack Fallout eXch, known for its no-KYC (Know Your Customer) policy, is facing intense scrutiny. Unlike many mainstream exchanges that demand stringent user verification, eXch allows users to trade without revealing their identities. While this appeals to privacy advocates and those seeking anonymity in their crypto dealings, it also raises red flags for regulators and blockchain analysts, especially when a major crypto exchange hack like the Bybit incident occurs. Critics argue that such platforms can inadvertently become havens for illicit activities, including money laundering. The core of the controversy lies in the timing and volume of cryptocurrency transfers. Blockchain analysts have detected a significant surge in Ethereum (ETH) deposits into eXch immediately following the Bybit breach. To put it in perspective: Unusual Activity: A massive influx of 20,000 ETH within 24 hours. Normal Volume: Typically, eXch sees around 800 ETH daily. The Stark Contrast: This represents a staggering 25-fold increase in ETH deposits. This dramatic spike in ETH deposits coinciding with the Bybit hack has naturally fueled suspicions and intensified the money laundering crypto allegations against eXch. Money Laundering Crypto Accusations: eXch’s Defense eXch is not taking these accusations lying down. The platform has issued a strong denial, asserting that the claims are orchestrated by those fundamentally opposed to the principles of decentralized crypto privacy and fungibility. They argue that the very nature of decentralized cryptocurrencies, designed for privacy and permissionless transactions, is being unfairly targeted. In a forum post, eXch acknowledged that a “minuscule fraction” of the stolen Bybit funds did find their way onto their platform. However, they downplayed this as an “isolated incident,” implying that it was an unavoidable and insignificant occurrence rather than a systemic issue. This response, however, has done little to quell the rising concerns. The sheer scale of the increased ETH volume raises questions about whether this was truly just an “insignificant portion.” Bybit Lazarus Group Link: Deepening the Mystery The alleged involvement of the Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean hacking collective, adds another layer of complexity and alarm to this situation. The Lazarus Group has been linked to numerous high-profile cyberattacks and cryptocurrency heists globally. Their sophisticated techniques and history of targeting crypto exchanges make the Bybit hack particularly concerning. If they are indeed behind this, the implications are far-reaching, extending beyond just financial losses to international security concerns. Key Points about Lazarus Group & Crypto Hacks: Aspect Description Attribution Linked to North Korea; known for state-sponsored cyber activities. Modus Operandi Highly sophisticated, using advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics. Targets Frequently targets financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms. Financial Motivation Cryptocurrency theft is believed to be a significant source of revenue for North Korea. Impact Global financial losses, reputational damage to exchanges, and international security implications. The potential involvement of such a group in the Bybit Lazarus Group hack makes the need for transparency and thorough investigation even more critical. Can eXch convincingly demonstrate its innocence, or will these allegations tarnish its reputation and raise broader questions about the role of no-KYC exchanges in the crypto ecosystem? Decentralized Crypto Privacy vs. Regulatory Compliance: A Balancing Act The eXch saga highlights the ongoing tension between the ideals of decentralized crypto privacy and the increasing pressure for regulatory compliance in the cryptocurrency space. While proponents of decentralized finance (DeFi) champion privacy and anonymity, regulators worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the potential for illicit activities facilitated by these features. The debate boils down to finding a balance between user privacy and preventing money laundering and other financial crimes. The Privacy vs. Compliance Dilemma: Privacy Advocates: Argue for the fundamental right to financial privacy and the importance of anonymity in a decentralized system. Regulators: Focus on preventing money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities facilitated by anonymous transactions. Exchanges: Stuck in the middle, needing to balance user demand for privacy with increasing regulatory scrutiny. The eXch situation serves as a stark reminder of this ongoing challenge. As the crypto landscape matures, finding effective solutions that respect user privacy while ensuring regulatory compliance will be crucial for the long-term sustainability and legitimacy of the industry. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Users? This unfolding situation offers several actionable insights for crypto users: Due Diligence is Key: Be cautious when using no-KYC exchanges. While they offer privacy, they may also carry higher risks. Research thoroughly and understand the potential downsides. Security Matters: This hack underscores the critical importance of security in the crypto world. Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and be wary of phishing attempts. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news and developments in the crypto space. Understanding the regulatory landscape and potential risks is crucial for making informed decisions. Diversification: Don’t keep all your crypto assets on a single exchange, especially one facing scrutiny. Diversify your holdings across different platforms and storage solutions. The eXch money laundering crypto denial and the broader implications of the Bybit hack are a wake-up call for the crypto community. It’s a reminder that while the promise of decentralized finance is alluring, it comes with responsibilities and risks that cannot be ignored. Conclusion: Navigating the Murky Waters of Crypto Security The eXch platform’s denial of money laundering allegations amidst the Bybit hack fallout leaves many questions unanswered. Whether eXch is genuinely innocent or inadvertently caught in the crossfire, the incident highlights the inherent challenges of balancing privacy with security in the crypto world. As investigations continue and more details emerge, one thing is clear: the crypto industry must grapple with these complex issues head-on to build a more secure and trustworthy future. The shocking claims and denials underscore the urgent need for greater transparency and accountability across all cryptocurrency exchanges, regardless of their KYC policies.

On Feb. 24, Solana ( SOL ) took a nosedive, decreasing more than 7% to $158.46 the lowest its ever been this year. The last time SOL dipped below $160 was on Oct. 20, 2024, when it closed at $159.64. At press time, Solana has not managed to climb back up past $160 and has stayed at around $159. According to data from crypto.news, Solana has gone down by 6.9% in the past 24 hours. The token is currently trading hands at $159.29. In the past week, Solana has decreased by nearly 13% and even more so in the past month. Solana has fallen by more than 35% in the past 30 days. Solana’s market cap currently stands at $78 billion, with a fully diluted valuation of $95 billion. Just a few days prior, on Feb. 24, Solana managed a brief rebound from its previous slump, surpassing the $180 mark.

The blockchain’s DEX volume has decreased by 36.7% in the past week. At the time of writing, Solana’s weekly DEX volume stands at $16.6 billion, while its daily DEX volume sits at $1.5 billion. Since Feb. 24, Solana has lost nearly $10 billion in market cap as well as the same amount in fully diluted volume. Why is SOL dropping? With the FTX unlocking of 11.2 million SOL, or equal to $1.77 billion, coming up on March 1, many investors have grown weary that the event could influence the liquidity and price stability of Solana. The influx in token supply could lead to pressure on Solana’s price, potentially triggering a significant drop. However, investors could take advantage of the opportunity presented by the price drop to accumulate more Solana. If demand holds up, Solana’s price may see a rebound soon. According to Amberdata , last week, SOL block trades on derivative cryptocurrency exchange Deribit accounted for nearly 25% of all Solana options activity, or $32.39 million out of the total $130.74 million. This marks the second largest portion of SOL block trades ever recorded, with nearly 80% of block trades concentrated in put contracts. During a price drop, whale investors would often opt for put option transactions that are executed over-the-counter instead of through regular buy orders on the exchange. Put options are derivative contracts that provide investors the right to buy or sell the asset, instead of an obligation. This grants buyers more minimal impact, protecting them from potential market volatility.

As XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu have experienced significant price changes, could emerging projects like Lightchain AI be the next breakout token to outperform these popular altcoins? Table of Contents XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu: One-year profit comparison Which crypto investment delivered the best returns? Lightchain AI’s future shines bright A year in crypto can make or break fortunes, and tokens like XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu have seen major price swings. If users had invested $1,000 in each of these popular altcoins, how much would their holdings be worth today? While some early investors have seen massive gains, others have faced stagnation or declines. With the market constantly evolving, the search for the next breakout token continues. Many investors are now eyeing Lightchain AI, a fast-growing project priced at $0.006, as the next big opportunity. Could it outperform these past winners in the coming months? XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu: One-year profit comparison The performance of XRP , Dogecoin , and Shiba Inu over the past year has varied significantly as of February 15, 2025. XRP is currently trading at $2.82, reflecting a substantial increase from its price of $0.50 a year ago, resulting in a 464% return. Dogecoin’s price has risen to $0.280144 from $0.08, yielding a 250% gain. Shiba Inu, now priced at $0.00001692, has seen a modest increase from $0.00001, offering a 69% return. Therefore, a $1,000 investment made a year ago would now be approximately $5,640 in XRP, $3,500 in Dogecoin, and $1,690 in Shiba Inu. These figures indicate that XRP has provided the highest profit among the three cryptocurrencies over the past year. Which crypto investment delivered the best returns? While XRP has offered the highest profits over the past year, it’s essential to note that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and unpredictable. The market can shift dramatically in a matter of days or even hours. As such, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research before investing in any digital asset. Additionally, many factors contribute to a cryptocurrency’s performance, including its underlying technology, adoption rate, and market sentiment. Therefore, while one token may have performed well in the past year, it may not guarantee future success. Also, past performance does not always indicate future returns. Lightchain AI, which has seen steady growth over the past year, could potentially outperform all three of these altcoins in the coming months.

Options Whales Are Preparing for a Fall!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/attention-these-altcoin-investors-options-whales-are-preparing-for-a-fall/,"The Bybit hack, where $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum was stolen, has been talked about in the cryptocurrency market in recent days. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou stated that the ETH gap has been completely filled. While the impact of the hacking incident on the cryptocurrency market, especially ETH, continues to be discussed, bears have become active on the Solana (SOL) front. According to Coindesk, the options market for Solana has become active on crypto derivatives exchange Deribit. Data shows whales have increased their bearish bets on SOL. As the SOL price continues to fall ahead of the upcoming multi-billion dollar unlock, the vast majority of whales have turned to put options that provide downside protection. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said there has been a big surge in SOL options trading over the past week, with investors looking to hedge against or profit from a potential price drop in Solana. “Investors are expecting further declines in Solana, as around 80% of options trading volume for SOL was concentrated in put contracts. However, there were only 40% puts for BTC and 37.5% puts for ETH during the same time frame. The slowdown in on-chain activity and the impending unlock are affecting the token's price and are causing investors to turn to puts.” What's Next for Solana (SOL)? Deribit Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen said that the token unlock, which will take place on March 1, poses a significant obstacle to the SOL price. “Solana (SOL) will unlock 11.2 million SOL tokens worth approximately $2.07 billion on March 1. This represents 2.29% of the total supply. A significant portion of the Solana to be unlocked comes from the FTX legacy and a foundation sale.” Chen noted that this unlocking accounted for approximately 59% of SOL’s daily spot trading volume and could lead to market volatility. “In anticipation of a potentially prolonged SOL price decline due to the unlock, it is natural that whales are seeking protection against a possible price decline by turning to put options. In addition, many investors will take advantage of this opportunity to open long positions in the high volatility of the SOL price in order to get good returns.” Solana, which has fallen 6.3% in the last 24 hours, continues to trade at $160 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

This crash has caused speculation about whether SOL could crash to $100, considering the upcoming unlock of nearly $2 billion tokens from the FTX bankruptcy auction. As bearish sentiment grows, can PumpFun’s new Automated Market Maker (AMM), which sidesteps Solana’s native AMM Raydium, prevent SOL price from crashing to $100? Can PumpFun’s AMM Prevent Bearish Solana Price Forecast to $100? PumpFun, a platform that makes it easy for creators to launch meme coins on Solana, is exploring launching its own Automated Market Maker (AMM) liquidity pools according to X user Trenchdiver . An AMM liquidity pool is a smart contract that will enable decentralized trading on the launchpad instead of users relying on external decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Raydium. A beta version of the AMM liquidity pool is already live on the PumpFun website, featuring a swap interface for trading SOL against meme coins. PumpFum AMM Liquidity Pool By launching its own liquidity pool, PumpFun will make meme coin trading faster, while potentially boosting its revenues. This initiative could also draw more users to the launchpad. PumpFun has been instrumental in driving activity and usage on the Solana blockchain. Therefore, if the AMM liquidity pool launches and boosts network usage, demand for Solana could rise, driving the price upward. Will SOL Price Crash to $100 Amid Multiplying Bearish Pressure? SOL price today sits at $159 after a 6% drop in 24 hours, which brings the monthly performance down by 35%. This massive correction has pushed investors to speculate if this crash is just the start and if Solana price could revisit the $100 psychological level. According to analyst Crypto_McKenna on X, Solana is structurally bearish after losing support at the $167-$169 zone. Despite the extended downtrend, buying support remains weak, which could lead to a drop between $112 and $126. If the selling pressure does not recede, SOL could revisit $100. SOL/USDT 1-day Chart The analyst also anticipates that several headwinds could cause Solana price to drop even further below $100 and hit $79. This is due to the upcoming unlock of 11.2M SOL tokens next week. Additionally, the Bybit hacker is laundering stolen funds using Solana meme coins , which is causing negative market sentiment. This Solana (SOL) unlock is behind the bearish Solana price prediction and the lack of new buying activity. However, if the firms that bought these tokens from the FTX bankruptcy auction decide to hold and not sell, it could spark a recovery. Will Long Traders Push Solana Price Down? The Solana liquidation map shows a large number of long liquidations below the current price. When long traders are liquidated, they are forced to sell to close their positions, which exerts more downward pressure on the price. Solana Liquidation Map Most of these long liquidations are saturated between the $120 and $160 price zones. Data from Coinglass shows that after Solana price fell to $160 on February 24, 2025, it triggered $21M in long liquidations, If these liquidations continue, it could accelerate the altcoin’s downtrend.

While rival communities were taking shots at Solana market cap recent woes, a massive SOL token unlock event has provided more fuel to the fire, which could potentially add to the selling pressure for the sixth-largest cryptocurrency. Hence, more investors are moving to Remittix, a new PayFi token. Analysts Predict Danger for Solana Market Cap An unknown crypto critic named artchick.eth detailed Solana’s token unlocking timeline for 2025 last month. Solana’s current token inflation rate is 4.715% but in the next three months, almost 15 million SOL tokens valued over $7 billion will join the circulating supply. In fact, the SOL price has already dropped by over 12% in just the last seven days, making it trade at $159.49. The token’s weighted sentiment also dropped over the past few days—a sign of rising bearish sentiment at a time when FUD around the massive token unlock is high. Likewise, crypto trader RunnerXBT said that purchasing Solana was at a “dangerous” time due to the imminent halving of the Solana market cap. Speaking on the same unlocking event, the trader underlined that once SOL unlocks and Solana market cap halving occur, businesses such as Galaxy, Pantera and Figure are in position to collect $3 billion, $1 billion and $150 million in unrealized profits. Given the minimal motivation to hold SOL amid a declining market attitude, exacerbated by the recent LIBRA memecoin event, most of these corporations are probably going to sell their allocations. In light of it, Kelly Greer, managing director at Galaxy, sought to ignore the current FUD around the unlocks. Greer said that Solana registered $3.6 billion in 24-hour spot trades, while the forthcoming unlock is only 2.31% of the overall supply and market value. The Solana market cap would therefore most likely absorb the selling pressure approaching the unlock. It was interesting to note that t A Massive Rally Is Imminent For Remittix Providing fast and reasonably priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by aggregating FIAT transactions with blockchain technologies. Supported by more than forty cryptocurrencies, the site provides rapid translations into FIAT currencies like USD and GBP, therefore enabling simple bank account deposits.

The platform guarantees accessibility and inclusivity for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies.

With crucial data releases and several Federal Reserve speeches lined up, traders and investors should stay alert for possible market swings. Feb 25: Consumer Confidence in Focus The first major event to watch is the CB Consumer Confidence report shows how people feel about the economy. If confidence rises, investors may move towards more risks, like Bitcoin. But if it drops, it might trigger caution and lead to a pullback. However, January’s report was 109.5, while February is expected to fall to 105.7. Feb 26: Housing Market & Nvidia Earnings Midweek, two key updates will grab attention. The January New Home Sales report will offer insights into the health of the housing market, an important factor in overall economic stability. Meanwhile, all eyes will be on Nvidia’s earnings report. Given the company’s massive role in AI and tech stocks, strong results could lift the broader market, potentially benefiting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Feb 27: US GDP Report The highly anticipated US Q4 2024 GDP data will be released on Thursday. A strong reading could boost confidence in the economy, pushing investors toward riskier assets. However, if the GDP figure comes in lower than expected, it might raise concerns about an economic slowdown, leading to increased volatility in the crypto market. Feb 28: Inflation Data & Fed Watch To wrap up the week, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report one of the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauges will be in focus. If inflation remains stubbornly high, it could influence future interest rate decisions, impacting investor sentiment toward Bitcoin and other risk assets. All Weeks Fed Speeches Throughout the week, a total of 10 Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak. Their statements on inflation, interest rates, and economic conditions could drive market movements. Any hints about future monetary policy could have a direct impact on Bitcoin’s price action. Bitcoin’s Struggles Continue: Will It Break? However, for the past three weeks, bitcoin has been struggling to break above the $100k mark. As of now, Bitcoin is consolidating, around $95,890, down 1% in the past 24 hours. The key challenge is the $97,000 resistance, which lines up with the 50-day EMA. A breakout above this level could spark a strong rally, while rejection may lead to a drop. If Bitcoin pushes past $97,000, it could aim for $98,500 and even the major $100,000 mark. But if it fails, a pullback to $95,000 is likely, with further downside potential to $93,500 or even $92,000.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-24 07:43:18

Amid this, the lawyer revealed what lies ahead in the ongoing war between the two communities on social media platforms. XRP News: Lawyer Reveals What Lies Ahead In Ripple & Bitcoin War In the latest news, the XRP vs Bitcoin debate between the two communities has heated recently, with many allegations coming from both ends. Notably, the battle on social media started with Donald Trump saying that the US might consider a Digital Assets Reserve, instead of a Bitcoin Reserve. This comment has sparked speculations in the market about whether the US administration is considering adding Ripple’s native asset to the Strategic Reserve Asset list. Besides, the recent tie between Trump and Ripple executives has further fueled market discussions. Recently, Donald Trump has also mentioned Ripple and its native asset on the Truth Social platform, with a recent XRP price analysis hinting at a potential rally to $100 with this development. Lawyer Reveals What’s Next The ongoing debate between XRP and Bitcoin has reached a boiling point, with the Ripple community and Bitcoin maxis engaging in a heated exchange. Recently, digital asset firm Uphold acknowledged the escalating tension and wondered what the former Army’s next move would be. However, top lawyer Bill Morgan was quick to respond , asserting that the XRP community isn’t waiting for Bitcoin maxis’ next move. Morgan believes that Bitcoin supporters will continue to disparage other coins, including XRP, as they’ve done for the “last eight years.” Meanwhile, Morgan’s comments suggest that the XRP community is confident in its position and won’t be swayed by Bitcoin maxis’ criticism. What Lies Ahead For Ripple? This latest debate comes as the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit continues to unfold. For context, in a recent X post, a top lawyer reveals a worst-case scenario timeline for the XRP lawsuit to conclude . This has sparked discussions in the market, with many anticipating this lawsuit drop or settlement to push the XRP price higher. On the other hand, the market participants are also confident about a potential XRP ETF approval under the new US administration. Besides, the US SEC leadership change has further boosted the market sentiment, with many anticipating a strong rally ahead. Considering all these aspects, it appears that the market participants are eyeing several positive updates in the XRP news column. However, given the current volatile market scenario, investors should exercise due diligence while putting their bets into the market.

Presale Still Available,https://coingape.com/sponsored/toncoin-ton-price-could-hit-etf-chances-before-xrp-should-you-buy-panshibi-shibi-now-presale-still-available/,"Lately, Toncoin price (TON) and Ripple (XRP) have been grabbing attention for their potential ETF approvals. While these two top altcoins continue their journey through regulatory hurdles, Panshibi (SHIBI), a new and exciting opportunity has burst onto the scene. With a token presale that’s already making waves, many investors are asking what crypto should I invest in to get in early on the next big thing? While Ripple has battled with legitimacy since December 2020, Toncoin ETFs are looking to gain approval by the SEC first. As both top altcoins try to get regulatory recognition, Panshibi is shaking things up with new opportunities for ICO investors. Let’s take a closer look. Toncoin’s ETF Prospects: What’s Next? In recent times, there’s been talks about whether Toncoin could snag ETF approval. After the SEC gave the green light to a handful of Bitcoin ETFs, some experts are betting that other cryptocurrencies like Toncoin might get a chance to ride that wave. If it actually happens, it could open the door for regular investors to jump in without needing a crypto wallet or a crash course in blockchain. Toncoin’s been popping up on people’s radars lately, and while the TON price has dropped by over 30% in the past month to $3.6, some traders are still hyping it as a solid long-term bet. Others are still debating whether it belongs on the list of the best crypto to invest in right now. Toncoin developers have made improvements on liquidity security and staking rewards, which might boost TON’s trustworthiness giving it long-term appeal. Still, in a world where crypto can flip upside down overnight, Toncoin’s fate is probably tied to whatever the market’s feeling and what the regulators decide to do next. For Investors sitting there googling ‘what crypto should I invest in,’ experts think Panshibi is definitely one to peek at. XRP’s Regulatory Journey: Steady Progress For The Number 3 Crypto Toncoin has been getting some attention lately, and Ripple is also moving forward in its push for ETF approval. Bitwise recently had its Ripple ETF application acknowledged by the SEC—a small step, but still notable for a top altcoin that’s been dealing with regulatory hurdles for years. XRP has its share of supporters, especially those who see it as a steady option in the crypto space. Ripple has an active community, plenty of liquidity with a market capitalization over $140 billion, and continues to develop despite the legal uncertainties. Its connection to Ripple also plays a role, as it’s used in cross-border payments, giving it a practical use case beyond just being another cryptocurrency. Panshibi’s Presale: A Meme Coin with Real Hype Moving on from Ripple and Toncoin, let’s talk about something fresh, Panshibi. If you’ve been keeping an eye on top meme coins , you’ll know they’ve been absolutely dominating the market. Panshibi is the latest in the space, and it’s already making noise with its presale. Right now, Panshibi is selling at $0.005, but that price is about to rise to $0.006. By the time it officially lists, it’s expected to be worth $0.026—a more than 500% jump for early investors. SHIBI presale raised $1 million in just over 28 days, hitting 33.20% of its target. So, why the hype? Panshibi isn’t just another random meme coin. It’s taking a community-first approach, focusing on long-term growth, exchange listings, and unique utilities like NFTs and staking. Investors who are constantly looking for the best crypto to invest in are seeing real potential here. While Toncoin’s name keeps popping up in ETF chatter, but honestly, it’s still a big ‘maybe’ with no finish line in sight. Ripple has been around forever, but it’s still tangled in that regulatory mess, which keeps investors second-guessing. With a mix of fun branding and real-world impact, Panshibi is looking to carve out its own space in the meme coin ecosystem. When considering the best crypto to invest in right now, Panshibi stands out as an exciting project with serious upside potential. Toncoin, XRP, or Panshibi? The Candidate For Explosive Gains Is Clear! SHIBI presale price is still very affordable, and as more investors jump in, early adopters are in for significant gains once it hits major exchanges. Unlike older cryptos that have struggled with stagnation, Panshibi is built to capitalize on fresh trends and community-driven momentum. At the end of the day, it comes down to where investors see the biggest opportunity.

Pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 49,600 YouTube subscribers that he thinks Bitcoin’s uptrend will remain intact as long as BTC respects its immediate support at $90,000. “It’s an uptrend. Price above a rising 200-week MA (moving average) is an uptrend and price holding support is an uptrend. You want to be very simply bullish as long as the $90,000 zone holds. Again if that fails, I think we’re going to the low $70,000s for sure.” Source: Cheds/YouTube Zooming out, the trader highlights that Bitcoin has held on to its gains after breaking out of the consolidation range between $50,000 to $74,000. According to the analyst, Bitcoin holding above $90,000 is a testament to its strength as BTC could technically break down and retest $74,000 as support. He also notes that BTC bulls have shown multiple times that they are ready to defend the $90,000 price level. “I can’t imagine wanting to bet against this trend, and it puts things into perspective for you. If you look at the large price range here ($50,000 to $74,000), the consolidation range and the advancement out of the range and how we’ve been consolidating here ($90,000 to $110,000), we’ve held all the gains. It’s a very nice, neat and orderly bullish consolidation here. I think it’s illustrated nicely here on the three-day chart… I don’t understand why people are really bearish at this point, especially before support breaks. I mean bulls have stepped in and declared demand time and time again at the bottom of this range ($90,000) and you have the environment of price with an uptrend. You want to just go with the trend.” Source: Cheds/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $96,312.

The claim has sparked concerns within the crypto community, with analysts warning of potential fraud linked to Barkmeta’s history. Barkmeta, known for meme coin trading, is alleged to have acquired Ye’s account. Crypto insiders have long accused Barkmeta of orchestrating scams. In 2022, Barkmeta was reportedly behind the POX token rug pull. The following year, he was linked to the DeFiApes NFT collection, which raised 22,000 ETH , valued at over $40 million at the time. The project collapsed, leaving investors with heavy losses. On-chain analyst Blade pointed out that Ye’s account activity had changed dramatically, fueling speculation about the sale. Posts became focused on crypto, aggressively promoting an upcoming meme coin launch. Ye’s account also started following Barkmeta’s team member, known as Tall, who some believe is an alternate Barkmeta account. Blade stated, “The chance that Ye’s account was sold is above 95% and I strongly advise against investing in the meme coin.” Further suspicions arose when Barkmeta hosted a Twitter Space hyping the project as the biggest meme coin launch. His responses to tough questions were described as evasive, adding to skepticism. Adding to the confusion, the AB84 X account, allegedly controlled by Barkmeta, promoted a token called “Yeezy Coin.” The token was exposed as a scam after being rug pulled within hours. Barkmeta responded sarcastically, joking about owning Ye’s account. He even shared an image showing two phones—one logged into Ye’s X account and another displaying his own. This further fueled speculation that he had direct access to the account. Ye has strongly denied any involvement with Barkmeta. “This is not real. I don’t know this person,” he stated. He acknowledged past betrayals but assured fans that when he launches a coin, it will be official and transparent. A crypto user recently reported that an official YZY meme coin appears to have been deployed but warned against engaging with suspicious links directing users to a site called BankofYZY. The token currently lacks liquidity. With growing concerns over Barkmeta’s past and Ye’s sudden online shift, the crypto community remains on high alert, awaiting clarity on the situation.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-24 08:08:27

The crypto exchange has gathered a total of 254,830 ETH in the form of OTC deals and loans sourced from multiple players. Bybit Amasses $693M in Ether Post-Hack Following its recent security breach, crypto exchange Bybit has amassed a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) worth $693 million in the last 48 hours. The funds were reportedly sourced through various channels, including over-the-counter (OTC) deals and loans. Also, the data from SpotOnChain shows the breakdown of the ETH acquired in recent times. OTC Acquisitions : 132,178 ETH (worth $367 million) likely obtained through deals with Galaxy Digital, FalconX, and Wintermute. Institutional Loans : 122,652 ETH (valued at $326 million) sourced from exchanges and institutions such as Bitget, MEXC, Binance, and DWF Labs. Bybit CEO Reaffirms Market Participants Ben Zhou, the CEO and co-founder of crypto exchange Bybit also spoke on the development stating that the exchange is back to normal operations. Zhou noted : “Bybit has already fully closed the ETH gap, new audited POR report will be published very soon to show that Bybit is again Back to 100% 1:1 on client assets through merkle tree, Stay tuned”. Hacker’s Activity in Total Theft The hacker responsible for the $1.4 billion breach has laundered 40,944 ETH ($115 million) into Bitcoin and other assets using platforms like Chainflip, THORChain, LiFi, DLN, and eXch. Despite these actions, the hacker still holds a substantial portion of the stolen funds—458,451 ETH ($1.29 billion), representing 91.7% of the total stolen amount. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about exchange security and the effectiveness of asset recovery strategies in the crypto ecosystem. As the crypto community deals with the aftermath of the $1.5 billion Bybit hack, industry peers have united in a coordinated effort to recover the stolen funds. Bybit has announced that this collaboration has resulted in the freezing of nearly $43 million within just two days of the massive security breach. Bybit has unveiled a Recovery Bounty Program aimed at tracking and reclaiming funds stolen in its recent major security breach. The program offers a 10% reward on recovered assets, potentially reaching $140 million if the full amount is successfully recovered.

This move aims to encourage specialists to help track and reclaim the stolen money. So far, more than $43 million in digital assets has already been recovered through industry efforts. Among them, 15,000 cmETH (Mantle Restaked Ethereum), valued at around $43 million, was secured with the help of security teams from SEAL, Mantle, and Polygon. The recovery was possible due to a security gap in the protocol, which experts exploited to block the hacker’s access. Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, highlighted the strong response from the crypto community. Many specialists and organizations have stepped in to assist. Zhou emphasized that industry-wide cooperation is key in fighting cyber threats and promised improvements to Bybit’s security systems. Bybit’s initiative includes rewarding those who provide useful intelligence or play a role in asset recovery. If all stolen funds are recovered, contributors could receive up to $140 million in rewards. In addition, Tether has frozen $181,000 worth of USDT linked to the hack. While the amount is relatively small, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, stressed that any action to limit financial losses is valuable. The quick action by security teams has helped prevent further damage. Mantle’s team blocked the exploiter’s address using an eight-hour withdrawal delay, stopping unauthorized transactions .

40763924,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133333,1740384743,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Toncoin (TON) Price Slumps Push More Investors Into Exciting New Asian Backed Panshibi (SHIB): 100x Meme Could SkyRocket,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/toncoin-ton-price-slumps-push-more-investors-into-exciting-new-asian-backed-panshibi-shib-100x-meme-could-skyrocket/,"Toncoin has encountered major price declines, which have caused many investors to review their investment positions. As TON faces resistance, traders are investing in Panshibi (SHIBI) because of its high potential and backing from the Asian market. With a structured presale and a projected 100x breakout, Panshibi is quickly becoming the go-to choice for investors seeking exponential gains. As TON loses steam, SHIBI’s explosive potential could make it the next big crypto success. Toncoin Price Struggles To Hold Support At $3.50 Toncoin (TON) continues to attract major interest during the alt season, but its current price action has caused investors to be cautious. With its current market value at $3.79 , Toncoin price must overcome significant resistance between $3.65 and $3.80 before a breakout becomes likely. Experts expect the Toncoin price to approach $4.00 after the price turns the current resistance level into support. Due to market volatility and investor uncertainty, a price drop below $3.50 would trigger a retracement. Despite continued whale accumulation, the lack of a strong breakout has left traders searching for alternative opportunities. Some are shifting focus to Panshibi (SHIBI), an emerging Asian-backed meme coin with massive growth potential. With predictions of a 100x surge post-launch, the meme coin’s presale is rapidly gaining traction. As Toncoin struggles, early adopters are eyeing SHIBI as the next big mover in the market. Panshibi Locks Liquidity For 10 Years To Secure Long-Term Value Panshibi (SHIBI) is a meme coin that merges AI-driven Social-Fi with a deflationary token model, ensuring long-term growth and sustainability. This is a carefully structured ecosystem designed to thrive beyond the presale. As Toncoin struggles with price swings and fading momentum, investors are moving their capital into Panshibi, a project that offers both community-driven appeal and strong market fundamentals. The presale has drawn in a wave of interest, positioning Panshibi as a standout among upcoming meme tokens. Unlike Toncoin , which faces resistance and potential breakdowns, Panshibi is on an upward trajectory, with an expected 1,200% increase during its presale alone. Early adopters see this as a rare chance to enter before explosive growth, while Toncoin holders are shifting their funds in search of more lucrative opportunities. Panshibi’s strategic vision separates it from meme coins that rely solely on speculation. With a structured burning mechanism, it ensures scarcity, which could drive demand over time. The project’s commitment to influencer-backed marketing campaigns and strong community engagement further solidifies its potential for long-term success. Asian crypto markets have played a significant role in Panshibi’s early traction. By capitalizing on the cultural significance of pandas and merging it with the viral potential of meme coins, the project has built an engaged following. With meme culture booming across Asian markets, Panshibi is primed to see massive adoption. Security is a major factor driving investors away from Toncoin and into Panshibi. With a 10-year liquidity lock, Panshibi eliminates the fear of sudden rug pulls. The project’s full smart contract audit further boosts investor confidence, providing a level of security that many other meme coins lack. Panshibi Presale Offers Early Buyers A Chance To Secure Massive Gains As Toncoin continues its downward slide, Panshibi keeps climbing. The presale price sits at just $0.005, giving early investors a prime opportunity to secure their holdings before its official launch. With projections suggesting a post-launch surge of over 145,000%, this could be the most rewarding meme coin investment of 2025. Panshibi is proving that meme coins can have real utility and long-term staying power. As Toncoin holders exit their positions, many are redirecting their capital into SHIBI, betting on its future dominance. Now is the time to act. With only weeks left in its presale and price appreciation built into its model, Panshibi is shaping up to be the breakout meme coin of the year.

40763986,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=701648,1740384956,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Dogecoin Warning: One Level Could Trigger A Surge, Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-warning-one-level-could-trigger-a-surge-says-analyst/,"In his latest livestream, crypto chartist Kevin drilled down on Dogecoin’s price action, stressing both caution and optimism for the popular meme coin. Speaking to his YouTube audience, Kevin acknowledged Dogecoin’s history of dramatic price swings yet underlined that critical technical levels could spark the next substantial move. When Will Dogecoin’s Next Big Move Be? Kevin noted Dogecoin’s pattern of large retracements followed by new highs in previous bull markets. “Look at these moves, right? Every single pullback that Dogecoin got in the previous bull market—56%, 57%, 53%—all led to new highs,” he said, emphasizing the coin’s cyclical nature. He also compared Dogecoin’s pullbacks from 2022 onward to what happened in its earlier cycles: “In this bull market so far, Dogecoin had a 65% correction, now it’s had a 58% correction. We’re doing the same thing that we’ve always done.” Despite Dogecoin’s tendency to rebound, Kevin underscored specific threshold levels that need to be recaptured. “Doge has a mission to accomplish, and that is to get back above the macro golden pocket and the weekly bull market support band, which is now at $0.30,” he explained. From his perspective, “If Dogecoin starts closing weekly candles above $0.30, I have no doubt in my mind that we will come back up to the macro 0.786 [Fibonacci level] … that $0.48-level, and then probably head higher from there.” When asked about Dogecoin’s current outlook, Kevin cautioned that market conditions—and particularly Bitcoin’s performance—would have the final say. “Dogecoin is not going to drive the market; it’s going to go where Bitcoin’s going.” If Bitcoin remains sideways or dips further, Dogecoin could stall below that $0.30 barrier. His broader thesis is that the crypto market at large, including Dogecoin, is paused in a state of anticipation. Kevin believes key policy changes—such as an end to quantitative tightening (QT), improved inflation data, or interest-rate cuts—could serve as the catalyst for another altcoin rally. Because Dogecoin often closely tracks the general sentiment around Bitcoin and total market cap, broader macro shifts would likely dictate its trajectory. “Nothing’s changed on Doge at any time, it can come down and take this wick down at the $0.20 level. For now, the path of least resistance is down,” Kevin added. Nonetheless, he stressed this could change abruptly if overall market sentiment improves and Bitcoin begins to rally. Overall, Kevin stressed that broader market factors—such as changes in US monetary policy or an overall jump in crypto market confidence—could “flip the switch” for Dogecoin. A strong macro tailwind, he believes, would likely pull DOGE decisively above $0.30, setting the stage for a run back toward $0.48. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.232.

His statement contradicts his previous dismissal of digital assets and has fueled speculation about his involvement in crypto. On February 22, Ye made a post clarifying that all existing tokens using his name are unauthorized. “All current coins are fake. I’m launching next week,” he wrote on X. The announcement has sparked mixed reactions, with some suspecting another celebrity-backed scam and others advising him to time the launch strategically. Critics argue that Ye’s move is inconsistent with his earlier stance on crypto. Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, warned potential investors to be cautious. He stressed that anyone buying Ye’s token should be prepared for possible losses, stating that there would be no one to blame if things went wrong. Reports indicate that multiple YZY-branded tokens recently appeared on the Solana -based launchpad Pump.fun, leading to speculation about an official token launch. Some sources claim Ye is working on a token linked to his Yeezy brand. CoinDesk allegedly received a press release from Hussein Lalani, said to be Yeezy’s Chief Financial Officer, confirming the project. Information about the token suggests Ye could control 70% of the supply, with 20% set aside for investors and 10% for liquidity. A portion of his holdings would reportedly be locked for one year to prevent immediate selling. Although the official launch date remains unknown, Polymarket , a decentralized prediction platform, estimates a 71% chance that the token will debut this month, with over $18 million already bet on its release. Ye’s crypto project is emerging during a chaotic period of celebrity-backed meme coins. Similar tokens have recently caused market disruptions, raising concerns about their legitimacy and impact.",,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-24 08:16:03
