Despite XRP prices trading sideways for the past two or so months now, these holders have been ramping up their accumulation, fueling a new buying frenzy. On Wednesday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this trend, revealing in a tweet “ Whales bought 150 million XRP in the last 48 hours” . Notably, this surge in accumulation coincides with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledging three additional spot XRP ETF filings, bringing the total number of pending applications to six in just under two weeks. On Wednesday, the SEC officially acknowledged three separate filings for spot XRP ETFs from asset managers WisdomTree, Canary Capital, and CoinShares, marking a crucial step in the ongoing push to introduce institutional-grade XRP investment products. According to the SEC’s official statement, the agency has opened a public comment period to assess whether the applications comply with Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934. Investors and stakeholders have 21 days to submit feedback once the filings appear in the Federal Register. The commission then has up to 240 days to approve or reject the applications. These latest filings come just days after the SEC acknowledged three similar XRP ETF applications from Bitwise, Grayscale, and 21Shares, signaling a potential shift in regulatory sentiment and an accelerating path toward spot XRP ETF approvals. Meanwhile, the push for XRP ETFs extends beyond the U.S. According to sources, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) has approved the world’s first spot XRP ETF, with only a trading launch date pending. Furthermore, building on Marinez’s findings, the surge in ETF filings has reignited buying activity among large investors. In a Thursday tweet, crypto analytics platform Santiment emphasized this trend, highlighting a significant rise in XRP accumulation among major holders. “There are 261 more 100,000 XRP wallets than 10 weeks ago, a strong sign of confidence from key stakeholders,” the firm reported . Santiment further noted that despite a stagnant broader crypto market, XRP has sustained strong momentum, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in recent months. The XRP Ledger’s market cap is up 6% on the day and has posted a 9% gain over the past week, making it one of the few assets in positive territory. Since November 11, 2024, XRP’s price relative to BTC has surged by 297%. That said, whales’ and sharks’ sustained accumulation suggests confidence in XRP’s long-term trajectory, especially with the potential approval of a spot ETF on the horizon. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.57, reflecting a 0.50% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-23 22:06:47

The attack targeted liquid-staked Ether (stETH), Mantle Staked ETH (mETH), and various ERC-20 tokens, causing an industry-wide shock. According to CryptoQuant data, Bybit’s Ether reserves rebounded significantly within two days of the breach. The exchange now holds over 201,600 Ether, about 45% of the 439,000 ETH it possessed before the attack. Following the exploit, reserves had plunged to just 61,000 ETH. Support and Spot Buying Fuel Recovery A significant factor in Bybit’s resurgence has been aggressive spot buying. The exchange reportedly purchased 106,498 ETH worth $295 million through over-the-counter (OTC) trades, as per Lookonchain data. In addition, major crypto platforms and industry leaders rallied to support Bybit. Binance transferred 50,000 ETH, Bitget contributed 40,000 ETH, and HTX Group co-founder Du Jun provided 10,000 ETH, among other donations. Industry Confidence Remains Strong Despite the turmoil, Bybit maintained operational stability, processing over 350,000 withdrawal requests within 10 hours post-exploit, according to CEO Ben Zhou. This responsiveness helped retain user confidence, reinforcing the exchange’s credibility. Emergency Funding and Asset Impact Bybit secured approximately $390 million in emergency liquidity, with major contributions including $127 million from Binance-affiliated investors and $53 million from a single whale wallet. However, DefiLlama data indicates that Bybit’s total assets dropped by more than $5.3 billion in the wake of the attack. An independent proof-of-reserve audit by Hacken, however, confirmed that Bybit’s reserves still exceed its liabilities. “Despite the significant loss, Bybit’s reserves remain strong and fully back user funds,” Hacken stated. The Hack’s Origins and Investigation Investigators, including Arkham Intelligence and ZachXBT, have traced the attack to the North Korean Lazarus Group. Similarities between this hack and previous incidents, such as the $230 million WazirX breach and the $58 million Radiant Capital exploit, suggest a recurring method of deception. Security expert Meir Dolev explained that Bybit’s Ethereum multisig cold wallet was compromised through a misleading transaction, tricking signers into approving a malicious smart contract logic change. “This allowed the attacker to gain control of the wallet and move all ETH to an unknown address,” Dolev told Cointelegraph.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETH|TRADING|ARKM|BNB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-23 22:08:00

A Bybit statement confirms that the coordinated effort led to the freezing of nearly $43 million barely two days after the jarring security breach. Exchanges Team Up To Recover Funds According to Bybit’s X post , a total of $42.85 million have been frozen across a handful of exchanges in the wake of the attack. Decentralized exchange THORChain blacklisted several addresses linked to the North-Korean hacking syndicate while Coinex provided Bybit’s team with key insights. ChangeNow froze 34 ETH ($97,000) in addresses linked to the hack while the Avalanche restricted access to 0.38755 BTC ($37,124). Lightning Network-based exchange FixedFloat froze 120,000 in USDC and USDT stablecoins, mirroring the efforts of Bitget and other centralized exchanges. “Respect to their teams for their timely responses,” said Bybit on X. “They helped us monitor and block the blacklisted addresses.” Per the statement, stablecoin issuers Tether and Circle are flagging addresses linked to the Bybit hack with Tether freezing 181,000 USDT. Taking Proactive Steps Following The Bybit Hack While law enforcement agencies and exchanges are keen on recovering stolen funds from the Bybit hack, the top crypto exchange is taking proactive steps to protect its users. In collaboration with Pump.fun and Solana Foundation President Lily Lui, the team confirmed the removal of a Solana-based token with ties to marauding hacker groups. Onchain data indicates that the Lazarus Group is bridging its assets to Solana and using fake KYC data to deposit funds on exchanges. In an advisory to users, Bybit warned that scammers are pretending to be officials of the exchange to obtain sensitive personal information. “Bybit will never ask for your personal info, deposits, or passwords,” read the warning. “Always double-check official sources and report anything suspicious.” On the other hand, Ethereum community members are mulling over the prospects of a blockchain rollback to stifle the efforts of Bybit’s attackers The post Bybit Hack: Exchanges Freeze $42 Million From Exploit – Here’s All appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|Ethereum News|Exchange News|Bybit|Bybit hack|Circle USDC|Solana blockchain|Tether USDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|USDT|ETH|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-02-23 22:11:00

Ethereum (ETH) rebounds 8% as community anticipates bullish resolution to Bybit hack Ethereum (ETH) suffered a significant setback on Friday as hackers, allegedly linked to the Lazarus Group, drained 401,346 ETH (~$1.4 billion) from the Bybit exchange. Despite the severity of the breach, Bybit swiftly reassured users, restoring withdrawals and ensuring no customer suffered direct losses. With operations returning to normal within hours, speculation surrounding how the exchange will resolve the stolen funds has become a major driver of Ethereum’s price action. Notably, top analysts—including early Bitcoiner Arthur Hayes— suggested a blockchain rollback to reverse the illicit transactions. However, key Ethereum stakeholders strongly opposed this solution. On February 22, Tim Beiko, Core Protocol Developer at the Ethereum Foundation, published a detailed post outlining why a rollback is not a viable option to remediate the Bybit hack. “From the perspective of the Ethereum protocol, there is nothing to distinguish that transaction from other legitimate transactions on the network. There is no protocol rule that was broken where patching the issue would isolate the hacked funds, like in the case of the Bitcoin exploit.” —Tim Beiko, Ethereum Foundation, Feb 22, 2025 Ethereum Price Action, Feb 23, 2025 | (ETHUSDT) Within 24 hours of Beiko’s statements, ETH price rebounded sharply erasing all the losses it suffered on Friday. As seen above, ETH price surged 8% from a low of $2,616 to reclaim the $2,800 territory by press time on Sunday, February 23. Why Tim Beiko’s Statements Propelled Ethereum Price Ethereum traders have reacted positively to Beiko’s rejection of a rollback, signaling confidence in Ethereum’s long-term stability. However, with prominent mixers like TornadoCash under intense scrutiny from regulators after recent legal battles with the U.S. SEC, the Bybit hacker now faces significant hurdles in laundering the stolen ETH. This leaves two plausible paths forward for ByBit: retrieval or confiscation of the funds through law enforcement as evidenced by the $140 million bounty declared by the team. Alternatively, the Exchange may have purchase the lost ETH worth $1.4 billion from the open market to balance its books. Both scenarios present fresh bullish narratives for Ethereum’s near-term price action: ETH Supply Reduction via Litigation: If law enforcement intervenes, the stolen 401,346 ETH could be locked up in lengthy legal proceedings, effectively removing it from active circulation. Historical precedent suggests that such cases can take years to resolve. For context, customer refunds from the FTX liquidation in 2022 only began distribution on February 18, 2025—over two years later—totaling $800 million across 162,000 accounts. Bybit Buyback Driving ETH Market Demand : Should Bybit opt to buyback the lost 401,346 ETH from the open market to balance its books, it would effectively squeeze market supply further, inevitably skewing demand and supply dynamics and driving up Ethereum prices. With Ethereum stabilizing above $2,800 amid rising volumes, the bullish momentum could accelerate as the resolution discourse picks up steam in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Price Forecast: $3,000 rebound viable as community weighs Bybit hack solutions Having reclaimed all losses from the momentary crash on Friday, Ethereum price forecast remains cautiously bullish as ETH approaches key resistance levels amid renewed buying pressure. The daily chart shows ETH/USDT trading at $2,808, with a 1.63% gain. The ETH price has pushed above the short-term moving averages, suggesting bullish momentum could extend toward the next resistance at $2,826.02. The orange line, representing a lower timeframe moving average, has acted as dynamic support, preventing a breakdown over the past week. However, overhead resistance from the purple and blue moving averages near $2,994 to $3,039 could limit the upside. Ethereum Price Forecast | ETHUSDT The Volume Delta indicator reflects a net positive buying trend, with 27.97K in net volume favoring the bulls. This indicates growing accumulation, but the lack of a significant breakout suggests buyers remain cautious. The recent two-day bullish move of 8.04% shows that buyers are in control, but the 8.03% drop from a previous move highlights lingering volatility. A confirmed close above $2,811.87 could clear the path for a run toward $3,000, while failure to hold support at $2,771 could reignite selling pressure.

Elon posted on X (formerly Twitter) that this sudden demand came directly from President Donald Trump. Right after Elon’s tweet, a memo went out from the Office of Personnel Management in Washington, according to a report from the Financial Times. The memo specifically asked federal employees to write down five things they did in the past week. They have until midnight on Monday. It also told employees not to include classified info. The demand from Elon matches exactly how he handled things at Twitter after taking it over. He had previously asked Twitter workers to quickly justify their roles or risk getting fired. President Donald Trump seemed happy with Elon’s new government approach, posting on Truth Social Sunday that Elon was “DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.” Elon’s team at the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, known informally as “D.O.G.E,” has already made massive cuts throughout federal agencies. D.O.G.E has canceled hundreds of government contracts and put tens of thousands of government staff on suspension. Trump’s administration has faced criticism over some firings—especially veterans and cyber security experts—and even had to rehire some people at the agency that manages America’s nuclear weapons because they mistakenly fired key staff. D.O.G.E recently offered federal workers a choice: either return to the office full-time or resign. The White House estimated around 200,000 workers might take this deal. But by the time the scheme ended earlier this month, about 77,000 employees actually resigned. On Friday, Trump fired General CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, plus five other senior Pentagon officials. Next week, the Defense Department will also fire 5,400 probationary workers, under the guidance of Elon’s D.O.G.E following the confirmation of Pete Hagseth as Defense chief. Should all federal employees be required to send a short email with some basic bullet points about what they accomplished last week? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 23, 2025 Even though Saturday’s email request came officially from the government’s Office of Personnel Management, it didn’t repeat Elon’s threat of automatic firing. But Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, quickly responded. Everett promised that his union would legally challenge any firings he called “unlawful.” Everett added that Elon and Trump have again shown disrespect to government workers and the services they perform. “It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,” Everett said. How will the US economy be affected by all this? Economists say these cuts might become the largest firing of government employees in US history. The White House, guided by Elon’s D.O.G.E group, has already fired tens of thousands of workers or convinced them to quit. The US federal government employs more people than any other organization nationwide. Economists aren’t exactly sure how many jobs Trump’s administration plans to cut, but it’s definitely in the tens of thousands, based on current evidence. There were about 220,000 federal employees with less than a year of tenure as of May 2024, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. On top of that, more than 75,000 federal workers agreed to quit after being offered buyouts. Those employees will keep receiving paychecks through September even though they don’t work anymore. Bloomberg economists think total job losses won’t exceed 300,000 but could easily surpass 100,000. Losing a job can seriously hurt families. People who suddenly lose income often have trouble quickly finding a new position. According to data from the Labor Department, unemployment benefits only cover around one-third of what someone earned before losing their job. Data showing exactly how many federal workers lost jobs might not appear in official unemployment reports for at least a month. According to a Piper Sandler report from February 16, those who took the severance deals won’t even be counted officially until September. But weekly unemployment claims in Washington, D.C., already rose 36% by the week ending February 8, indicating early signs of significant job losses. Economists like Tedeschi, former chief economist for the Biden administration’s White House Council of Economic Advisers, said these layoffs alone won’t severely damage the broader US economy. Tedeschi explained that even if around 200,000 probationary workers lose jobs immediately, it would only reduce America’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) by about 0.1%. “This, on its own, is not recessionary,” Tedeschi said.

Amidst these fluctuations, an interesting technical indicator suggests that Dogecoin’s long-term rally is still intact. This technical indicator’s outlook was pointed out by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, who used the Gaussian Channel, a popular momentum tool, as evidence that Dogecoin’s bullish momentum is still in play despite the current selling pressures. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Go On A 110-Million Memecoin Buying Spree—What’s Next For DOGE? Gaussian Channel Shows Continued Bullish Strength For Dogecoin Dogecoin’s price trajectory has been highlighted by a decline since mid-January. This decline has seen Dogecoin fall by as high as 47% from a lower high of $0.4159 on January 18. The price correction is even more pronounced when considering its multi-year high of $0.475, which it achieved on December 9, 2024, from which Dogecoin has now corrected by approximately 54%. This notable correction has also seen the development of a few bearish signals on the Dogecoin price chart. One such bearish development is the rejection at a macro resistance and the failure to reclaim the macro golden pocket in the recent week. However, despite the notable correction in the Dogecoin price, the meme coin seems to be still trading in an uptrend in the longer term. This long-term outlook is revealed through the analysis of Dogecoin on the weekly candlestick timeframe using the Gaussian Channel. The Gaussian Channel is a lesser-known technical analysis tool that helps identify trends and cycles in price movements by highlighting green and red zones in different market cycles. The green zones represent periods of upward momentum, where the price is expected to keep growing. On the other hand, red zones indicate periods of correction or consolidation, during which the market pauses before resuming its upward trajectory. According to a Dogecoin price chart shared by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade on social media platform X, Dogecoin entered into its most recent green zone on the Gaussian Channel in 2024. However, despite the recent correction, it has remained in this green zone, indicating that Dogecoin’s uptrend is still active in the long term. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Long-Term Price Target For DOGE With the Gaussian Channel still indicating the green zone for Dogecoin, the rally could resume anytime soon. According to Trader Tardigrade’s projection, this rally will be enough to push DOGE above multiple resistance levels at $0.3, $0.4, and the recent multi-year high of $0.475. If momentum builds and buying pressure increases, Dogecoin may even retest its all-time high of $0.7316, which has remained unchallenged since the peak of the 2021 bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Tightens — CZ Says There’s ‘No Escape’ From Crypto Beyond these immediate targets, Tardigrade’s analysis suggests that the meme coin’s long-term trajectory could extend well beyond the $1 mark. The forecast envisions an even more aggressive rally that could see Dogecoin climbing as high as $4.1. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.247, up by 1.5% in the past 24 hours but down by 25% since the beginning of February.

40748170,https://coingape.com/?p=240504,1740350765,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"XRP Price Nears Breakout Zone, Is a Rally To $5 on the Horizon?",https://coingape.com/xrp-price-nears-breakout-zone-is-a-rally-to-5-on-the-horizon/,"XRP price is trading in an important area as analysts watch the $2.6 mark to decide the future of the altcoin. While analysts have indicated that crossing this level and further breaching the $2.77 mark would support the continuation of the upward movement. Currently, the resistance is found at $2.60, $2.85, and $5.85 in the long term while the support level is $2.33. XRP Price Approaches Key Resistance Levels Dark Defender has noted that XRP price is currently at the $2.60 level which is a key level that will determine the direction in the short term. A breakout above $2.77 will help signal a continuation of an up move, to higher prices. The analyst also notes that Ripple price is establishing higher lows and that implies that there is more buying pressure in the market. Technical indicators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI), also reflect bullish momentum. The RSI trendline has been creating higher lows, indicating an increasing demand for the asset. If XRP price manages to stay above the $2.60 resistance, the next target stands at $2.85, followed by a long-term projection of $5.85. However, if it fails to break through, support remains at $2.33. Also, according to analyst Egrag Crypto , predicted that XRP price may reach $67 if higher levels will be broken. He stated that if the price closes above 3$ on the monthly chart, then pump signals of an upward trend would have been established fully. However, the analyst also informed his followers that he expected XRP to pull back in the short-term, potentially testing $0.90 before shooting up once again. Ripple Forms a Cup and Handle Pattern More so, another analyst Thom Sieloff, identified a cup and handle formation in the daily timeframe. This pattern is widely considered a bullish continuation signal, often resulting in an upward price move. XRP price has been consolidating between $2.40 and $2.70, forming the handle portion of the pattern. According to technical projections, the breakout point for this structure is expected around $2.68 to $2.70. Historically, this pattern leads to a 20-30% surge upon breakout. If XRP price follows this pattern, the potential price target could reach $3.36 before facing further resistance. Traditionally, a stock or crypto (like $XRP ) forming a cup and handle pattern may increase by 20-30% from the breakout point, based on the depth of the cup projected upward from the resistance level, potentially targeting around $3.36 (a ~25.37% increase from $2.68) in this case.… — Thom Sieloff (@RealThomSieloff) February 21, 2025 Potential For an Altcoin Rally Market sentiment indicates that a confirmed breakout in XRP price could trigger an altcoin rally. Several analysts suggest that if XRP manages to hold above resistance levels, it could set the stage for an uptrend. The formation of bullish structures, coupled with increasing demand, supports this outlook. The possibility of an altcoin rally is further supported by growing institutional interest. Recent movements in the cryptocurrency market, including discussions around the MicroStrategy ETF, highlight increasing capital inflows into digital assets. XRP price action remains a key factor in determining whether this rally materializes. Despite positive technical signals, regulatory concerns remain a factor in the broader market. The SEC continues to maintain regulatory oversight on digital assets, influencing investor sentiment. However, XRP price has demonstrated resilience, recovering from past regulatory challenges. Nevertheless, the altcoin season is at risk if Ethereum fails to maintain the critical $2,600 support level, as highlighted by analysts. A drop below $2,425 could trigger further declines, delaying the anticipated altcoin rally.

The project will debut a stablecoin called USP on Ethereum and Solana blockchains in the second half of 2025, according to Bloomberg. Pi will use smart contracts to mint its USP stablecoin and minters will earn yields in the form of another token called USI. Competing With Tether The stablecoin will be backed by yield-bearing real-world assets such as bonds and over-collateralized with assets like Treasuries and money-market funds. “We view Pi Protocol as the evolution of stablecoins,” Collins told Bloomberg before comparing it to Tether. “Tether has been extremely successful in showcasing demand for stablecoins. But they keep all the yield. We believe 10 years later the market is really ready to evolve.” Collins, who was CEO from 2013 to 2015, and his partners sold Tether to the operators of the Bitfinex exchange in 2015. Back then, USDT stablecoin’s market value was less than $1 billion, today it is close to record highs of more than $140 billion. Pi Chief Executive Officer Bundeep Singh Rangar said, “You want assets that are non-correlated to crypto that are mid- to high yield, low risk.” “We have a mechanism that assesses the quality of the asset. They are ones that are vetted on their loss ratio and origination of where they are coming from,” he added. Regulations are shifting. Yield-bearing stablecoins will be the next trillion-dollar asset class — Pi Protocol (@piprotocol) February 18, 2025 Stablecoins got a green light this year with the election of US President Donald Trump. In his first days in office, he signed an executive order promoting US dollar-pegged stablecoin adoption while Congress is working on a regulatory framework for them. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also wants to chip away at Tether’s market dominance. At the company earnings call last week, he said that the firm aims to make USDC “number one” but admitted that this ambition was a “stretch goal.” A Crowded Space USP is entering an extremely competitive stablecoin market that is dominated by Tether which has a share of 60% from a current supply of $141 billion. Circle’s USDC has seen its supply and market share grow in recent months, and it is currently $56 billion, giving it a market share of 24%. The third largest stablecoin is USDS, formerly DAI, which has just under $9 billion in circulation and a market share of almost 4%.

Brazil’s approval of the first spot XRP ETF and the US SEC’s acknowledgment of Grayscale’s application mark major milestones – we’ll cover this topic in detail below. While XRP gains momentum, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is gaining attention among whales by potentially tackling Bitcoin’s biggest issues—slow transactions and high fees. Let’s check out the deets below. XRP Price Prediction: Could XRP’s Price Get Higher With Recent ETF Developments? On February 20, 2025, Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) approved the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Index Fund, making it the first spot XRP ETF in the world. Managed by Hashdex, a well-known crypto asset manager, the fund will be available on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange. The official trading date is still unknown, but Hashdex has confirmed the approval and plans to share more details soon. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s XRP ETF application has cleared a key step as the US SEC formally acknowledged it . While this doesn’t mean approval is guaranteed, it’s a significant step forward, especially given Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Many expected a rejection, so this acknowledgment boosts confidence in XRP’s future. Some analysts even believe that XRP could surpass Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency. Crypto analyst, Maxi shared their prediction for XRP where they expect it to hit $74.30 by December which would be a 2800% boost. How PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Might Improve Bitcoin With Faster Transactions, Lower Fees, and Ethereum Compatibility Bitcoin has long struggled with slow transactions, high fees, and network congestion. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana have introduced solutions to improve scalability, Bitcoin’s core technology remains largely unchanged. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , a hybrid Layer-2 solution, could offer a way to enhance Bitcoin’s efficiency without modifying its core network. By handling block times off-chain before finalizing them on Bitcoin’s base layer, PlutoChain might help reduce congestion and speed up processing. One of its biggest advantages could be speed. Instead of waiting nearly 10 minutes for confirmation, PlutoChain’s blockchain may complete block times in about two seconds. This improvement could make Bitcoin more practical for everyday payments, global transfers, and microtransactions. Lower costs are another potential benefit. By significantly reducing transaction fees, PlutoChain might make Bitcoin more accessible for regular use. Its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility could also allow Ethereum-based applications—such as DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and AI-powered tools—to connect with Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Early tests suggest PlutoChain has potential, with reports showing it processed 43,200 transactions in one day without issues. Security remains a major focus, with audits from firms like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . The project also emphasizes decentralized governance, allowing the community to influence upgrades and decisions. With its fast transactions, lower fees, and cross-chain capabilities, PlutoChain could help Bitcoin become more scalable and versatile, making it better suited for mainstream adoption. The Bottom Line With ETFs bringing new momentum to XRP, its price could see massive gains if adoption continues. Analysts predict a potential 2,800% surge, which could push XRP closer to the top of the crypto market. Meanwhile, PlutoChain might offer even greater utility by potentially improving Bitcoin’s speed, cost, and functionality. If it delivers on its features, it could change how Bitcoin is used, making it more efficient and practical. ———— Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

Solana Expert Say This Hidden Altcoin is Set to Skyrocket 8000x,https://thecoinrise.com/the-next-big-thing-in-2025-solana-expert-say-this-hidden-altcoin-is-set-to-skyrocket-8000x/,"Solana’s recent performance has caused panic among many altcoin investors after it succumbed to a double-digit loss over the past few weeks. Investors are now looking for new alternative tokens that can help them return to profits. This has brought them to Propichain, a new crypto token that stands out for its approach to tokenizing housing investments and bringing liquidity to the real estate sector. Read on to see why experts are confident that Propichain will outshine Solana in 2025. Solana Could Drop Below $150 in February Solana has become one of the worst-performing tokens over the past few weeks. Like many altcoins, Solana suffered double-digit losses at the start of February due to the widespread market crash. Some investors expected a swift Solana recovery. However, this momentum worsened in mid-February. Market charts now show that Solana had dropped by 14% over the past week to its current price of $166.52. With Solana struggling to regain momentum, many altcoin holders are now looking for more stable or high-growth alternatives to offset losses. In search of safer or more profitable opportunities, many investors are turning to Propichain—a real estate-backed crypto project that combines AI-powered tools with metaverse technology. Propichain: How Artificial Intelligence is Spearheading the Future of Real Estate Investing What if real estate investing didn’t have to be complex or require high capital and years of experience to be profitable? This is the solution that Propichain (PCHAIN) sets out to provide via its AI-backed investing ecosystem. Propichain is a novel real estate trading platform that offers new opportunities to multiply returns. Whether you’re a risk-taker or a cautious planner, PCHAIN opens doors to a new way of thinking about property investments. As a Propichain user, the first major benefit you enjoy is access to lower-cost investing powered by asset tokenization. Propichain allows you to buy shares in desired assets at a fraction of the cost. Imagine a $6 million property becoming 6,000 tokens at $100 each, allowing you to own a slice of prime real estate without committing a fortune. This increases participation opportunities by creating avenues for lower-budget traders to maximize returns. With Propichain’s (PCHAIN) fractional tokens, you can start earning rental income. You can also receive loans from DeFi ecosystems, using Propichain’s fractional tokens as collateral. Once investors take advantage of asset tokenization to reduce costs, Propichain further enhances their experience with AI-driven automation and precision trading tools. By combining affordability with precision trading, Propichain ensures that even first-time investors can navigate the market with confidence. For instance, It might flag a high-risk, high-reward opportunity in an emerging neighborhood or suggest a safer bet in a stable suburban area. This allows you to stay ahead of the competition while maximizing gains from participation in the housing sector. Propichain’s AI tools also provide real-time property valuations, ensuring that you can capitalize on low-price opportunities while avoiding overpayments. Traders can also enjoy greater investing efficiency through Propichain’s automated trading beefits. This enables traders to complete investment deals with AI-driven commands. For instance, you can instruct the system to “ allocate 10% of my portfolio to office apartments if employment rises by 10% .” This hands-free approach ensures you never miss an opportunity, even while asleep or dining with family.’ Beyond AI-driven insights, Propichain further enhances investor confidence with immersive metaverse tours, allowing users to visually assess properties before making decisions. These tours allow you to take virtual leaps into uncharted markets, inspect properties in a bustling urban center, or a tranquil rural retreat—all from your couch. With Propichain’s metaverse-backed tours, you can collaborate with developers and fellow investors, brainstorming ways to maximize returns from the housing sector. Even better, these virtual tours allow traders to find more investing opportunities, which translates to potentially higher returns. In addition to metaverse-backed property tours, Propichain also provides high levels of security for traders. It leverages BlockAudit-certified smart contracts to ensure every move is transparent and secure. These smart contracts also automate payments for leasing, rental, and even revenue splits. Additionally, Propichain’s recent CoinMarketCap listing has also increased its market hype, drawing more investors to its ecosystem. Best Crypto Tokens for 2025: Propichain VS Solana Many investors have been impressed with Propichain’s approach to tokenizing housing investments. These investors claim that its RWA tokenization benefits make it a more attractive project than established coins like Solana. Already, many investors have joined Propichain’s ecosystem, buying over $2 million worth of tokens from its ongoing presale, which is now in its second round. PCHAIN currently trades at $0.011. By round three of this presale, its value will grow to $0.023. By the time of its listing, PCHAIN’s value will grow to $0.032, taking its entire presale ROI to 800%. Many analysts agree that now is the best time to join Propichain’s ecosystem as this is the lowest its value will ever be again. Even better, buying PCHAIN now will help capitalize on its expected 10,000x growth. This could see a $1,000 investment grow to $120,000 by early December. Don’t delay any longer.

Whether it’s Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) rebounding from market corrections, Bittensor TAO expanding its AI-powered blockchain ecosystem, or Qubetics redefining real-world asset tokenization, this week is full of exciting moves in the market. Out of these, Qubetics ($TICS) is making the biggest headlines. With its Web3 aggregation and asset tokenization marketplace, it’s solving one of the biggest pain points in crypto—real-world adoption. With over $13.9M raised and its presale stage nearing the next price jump, Qubetics is easily one of the top cryptos to join now before the bull run truly kicks in. Qubetics: Bringing Real-World Assets On-Chain Like Never Before Blockchain has been around for over a decade, but there’s still a massive gap between the crypto space and real-world assets. Traditional finance still relies on outdated systems, while businesses and investors struggle with inefficient processes and expensive intermediaries. This is exactly what Qubetics is solving with its Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace. Imagine being able to fractionally invest in real estate, commodities, and fine art through blockchain—all while enjoying instant settlements, lower fees, and full transparency. That’s what Qubetics is building: a one-stop shop where businesses can tokenize assets and investors can trade them seamlessly. For businesses, this means easier access to liquidity. No more waiting weeks or months for financing approvals—tokenized assets can be instantly traded, collateralized, or used in DeFi ecosystems. Whether it’s a real estate firm issuing tokenized property shares or a gold mining company offering blockchain-based reserves, Qubetics is set to revolutionize how real-world assets are owned, traded, and managed. And it’s not just businesses that benefit—retail investors now have access to previously untouchable markets. Ever wanted to own a fraction of a rare painting, a slice of a luxury hotel, or a stake in a global supply chain? Qubetics makes it happen, lowering entry barriers and democratizing access to wealth-building opportunities. Qubetics Presale: The Ultimate Early Investment Opportunity Qubetics’ record-breaking presale is proving to be one of the hottest opportunities in the market right now. The presale follows a structured format, where each stage lasts seven days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. Currently, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.08073, with the project in its 22nd stage. Investor demand has driven over $13.9 million in funding, with more than 21,000 token holders and 487 million tokens sold. Market analysts predict that by the end of the presale, $TICS will hit $0.25, bringing a 209.67% ROI. The excitement doesn’t stop there—after the presale, projections show potential price milestones of $1 (1138.69% ROI) and $5 (6093.48% ROI). Once the Qubetics mainnet launches in Q2 2025, early investors could see prices reach as high as $10 to $15, delivering an ROI of up to 18,480.45%. The race is on to secure TICS at its current price before the next stage’s increase. Bitcoin Cash: Can It Break Past $40K? Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) has had a rollercoaster ride, moving in and out of major resistance levels. As one of the most recognized Bitcoin forks, it maintains its low-fee, fast transaction model, making it a preferred choice for everyday payments. Despite market volatility, Bitcoin Cash has seen renewed interest from institutional investors, thanks to its scalability and increasing adoption among merchants. But the big question is: can it sustain momentum and break past the $40K resistance level? With the broader market heating up, a major breakout could be imminent. The next few weeks will determine whether Bitcoin Cash solidifies its position as a top altcoin or struggles to keep up with stronger players. Bittensor TAO: AI and Blockchain Converging for Innovation Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the fastest-growing sectors in tech, and Bittensor TAO is bridging the gap between AI and blockchain in a way no other project has. By creating a decentralized neural network, Bittensor allows machine learning models to collaborate, improve, and monetize their contributions. Why is this important? Traditional AI models are centralized and controlled by tech giants. Bittensor flips the script by making AI an open-source, decentralized ecosystem, where anyone can contribute to and benefit from AI-driven computations.

With its history of explosive rallies, many are wondering – could SHIB repeat its past performance and turn early holders into multi-millionaires by 2026? Meanwhile, PlutoChain could advance Bitcoin’s scalability with its Layer-2 solution by delivering 2-second block times and processing 43,200 transactions during its testnet phase. Unlike traditional Layer-2s, PlutoChain brings Ethereum-based applications into Bitcoin’s ecosystem and unlocks DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain functionality. Let’s break it down below! Shiba Inu Price Prediction – Can SHIB Create Multi-Millionaires by 2026? Shiba Inu’s history of explosive rallies has already turned some early holders into millionaires, and the question now is – can it happen again? SHIB’s growing presence in DeFi, gaming, and real-world payments is adding utility beyond its meme origins, which strengthens its long-term value proposition. Whale accumulation remains a key driver, with large users strategically buying dips, often signaling potential price breakouts. Technical indicators suggest that SHIB must break through key resistance levels to sustain upward momentum, which could make its trajectory in the coming years one to watch closely. PlutoChain Is a Hybrid Layer-2 Solution That Could Expand Bitcoin’s Capabilities Bitcoin has long been the dominant force in digital assets, but its slow transaction speeds and high fees limit its ability to function as a seamless payment network. PlutoChain might step in to solve this challenge with its Layer-2 technology and potentially bring speed, scalability, and interoperability to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. With 2-second block times, PlutoChain might significantly improve transaction efficiency, which could make Bitcoin more practical for everyday use. During its testnet phase, it successfully processed 43,200 transactions in a single day, which could demonstrate its ability to handle high demand. Additionally, PlutoChain introduces EVM compatibility, which allows Ethereum-based applications to integrate within Bitcoin’s network – something previously unattainable. Governance is another area where PlutoChain could set itself apart. Unlike Bitcoin’s rigid upgrade process, PlutoChain empowers its community to propose and vote on network improvements, which might ensure ongoing evolution. Security remains a priority as well, with PlutoChain undergoing audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi to reinforce trust in its reliability. Beyond payments, PlutoChain could expand Bitcoin’s functionality by unlocking new use cases, including DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain applications. PlutoChain could pave the way for a more scalable and adaptable blockchain ecosystem by addressing Bitcoin’s limitations. Final Words Shiba Inu has already made history with its explosive gains, and 2026 could bring another wave of opportunity for early holders. If adoption in DeFi, gaming, and payments continues growing, SHIB’s long-term value could rise significantly. Meanwhile, PlutoChain could tackle one of Bitcoin’s biggest challenges – scalability. It might start to gain attention because it could push Bitcoin toward a brighter future simply by offering faster transactions and cross-chain functionality. ——— Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

Per the South Korean news agency Yonhap , the incident allegedly took place on February 21 in the city of Incheon. USDT OTC ‘Theft’ – Police Searching for Suspect Speaking on February 23, officers at Incheon Seobu (West) Police Station said that the “thief” arranged to meet the “victim” on the first floor of a commercial building in West Incheon’s Seoknam District. Incheon Seobu Police Station, in Incheon, South Korea. (Source: hyolee2 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The unnamed “victim” was described as a man in his “thirties.” Police said the “victim” responded to a “post in a KakaoTalk open chatroom” from a vendor offering to “sell USDT coins” at a low price. Officers said the “victim” and the suspect exchanged chat messages via the app and eventually arranged to meet. The USDT market cap over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) Police Unsure of Suspect’s Nationality The suspect allegedly told the “victim” that they would transfer the coins to the former’s wallet and then take the cash as payment. However, the “victim” explained: “I put the cash on the floor in a paper bag to complete transaction. But while I was looking away for a moment, [the suspect] ran away with it.” The police said that they believed that the suspect came from a “Central Asian country,” but admitted they did not know exactly what the suspect’s “nationality” was. A police official told the media that investigators were hunting for the suspect for alleged “theft”-related offenses. However, they added that they would not decide on “specific charges” until they had “arrested” the suspect. On February 23, Cryptonews.com found several posts in crypto-related KakaoTalk open chatrooms from individuals saying they wanted to swap coins for cash as part of in-person deals.

33767162,[object Object],1740353417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin ETFs Post Second Straight Week Of $500 Million Outflow — Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-post-second-straight-week-500-million/,"The US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) recorded their second consecutive week of significant outflows over the last five-day trading period. This recent run of disappointing performances reflects the ongoing shift in investor sentiment in the United States. Over the past year, strong inflows into the US Bitcoin ETF market have constantly been associated with positive action for the BTC price. Fittingly, the price of Bitcoin has been consolidating over the past few weeks, struggling to pick up any real momentum. Bitcoin ETFs Record Fourth Consecutive Outflow Day According to the latest market data , the US Bitcoin ETFs registered a total daily outflow of $62.77 million on Friday, February 21. This latest round of withdrawals marked the fourth straight day (and the eighth day in the last nine trading days) that the crypto-based products would witness a net capital outflow. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker GBTC) accounted for a larger percentage of Friday’s total outflow, recording over $60 million in withdrawals to close the week. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw the second-highest outflows on Friday, losing $16.58 million of its total assets. Fidelity Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) was the only other exchange-traded fund that saw net outflows ($12.47 million) on Friday. It is worth noting that BlackRock’s IBIT (the largest Bitcoin ETF by net asset) and VanEck’s CBOE posted positive capital inflows of $21.64 million and $4.71 million, respectively. This $62.77 million single-day net withdrawals put the US-based Bitcoin ETFs’ weekly record to negative outflows of over $559 million. Notably, this weekly performance was mostly inflated by the significant withdrawals seen on Thursday, February 20. Data from SoSoValue shows that nearly $365 million flowed out of the Bitcoin ETF market on Thursday. Withdrawals from BlackRock’s IBIT ($112 million) and Fidelity’s FBTC ($88 million) mostly accounted for the outflows seen on the day. As mentioned earlier, this past week marked the second consecutive week of significant outflows from the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs. The exchange-traded products registered a similar net weekly outflow of over $585 million between February 10th and 14th. It is worth mentioning that the Ethereum ETF market also saw a net daily outflow of $8.92 million on Friday. Nonetheless, the US ETH exchange-traded funds registered a cumulative net inflow of $1.61 million in the past week. Bitcoin Price At A Glance The premier cryptocurrency continues to move sideways within the $94,000 – $99,000 range. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands around $96,610, reflecting a mere 0.6% decline in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin ETFs|bitcoin price|BTCUSDT|Sosovalue|US Bitcoin ETFs,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-23 23:30:17

Could this Ripple Prediction Mint You A Millionaire?,https://nulltx.com/ripple-price-prediction-xrp-to-hit-5-trillion-market-cap-could-this-ripple-prediction-mint-you-a-millionaire/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has put forward a bold prediction for XRP, saying its market capitalization reached an astonishing $3.7 trillion – we’ll check out the details below. Meanwhile, PlutoChain , a hybrid Layer-2 solution, might gain momentum by fixing Bitcoin’s key limitations. With smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Bitcoin network, PlutoChain could boost the network’s scalability and functionality while maintaining robust security. We’ll cover the deets below. Ripple Price Prediction: Why Does This Analyst Believe that XRP’s Market Cap Could Explode? Egrag Crypto’s analysis is built around the logarithmic measured move, a tool for evaluating long-term exponential growth. According to his model, XRP’s market cap could soar to $3.7 trillion, translating to a price of roughly $58 per token. For a more immediate outlook, the non-logarithmic measured move presents a more conservative target. This approach suggests XRP’s market capitalization will first reach $200 billion, setting a new all-time high of $3.5 per token. Interestingly, the analyst also believes XRP could hit a $1 trillion market cap within the current cycle. He attributes this possibility to the Fibonacci 1.618 level—often called the “golden ratio”—which aligns closely with $978 billion. Given that XRP surged 15,000% in the last market cycle, Egrag Crypto sees this target as entirely feasible. Several factors would need to happen for XRP to reach these ambitious valuations. Institutional adoption and regulatory clarity stand out as primary drivers, with the ongoing discussions around XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) serving as a key example of how institutional interest could increase demand. PlutoChain’s Hybrid Layer-2 Solution Could Finally Make Bitcoin Scalable and Add New Functionalities to Its Network Bitcoin’s biggest pain points—slow transactions and high fees—have limited its practicality for everyday use. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might offer a long-awaited breakthrough. By introducing a hybrid Layer-2 solution, it could make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more adaptable without sacrificing security. PlutoChain’s Layer-2 network processes block times in just 2 seconds, a huge leap from Bitcoin’s usual 10-minute confirmation time. This could allow users to send transactions or interact with Bitcoin-based applications with near-instant finality. Next to speed, PlutoChain could change Bitcoin’s role in decentralized finance. Its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility might let developers bring DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and AI-driven applications into the Bitcoin ecosystem—something that was previously impossible. Early performance tests suggest PlutoChain’s network could handle up to 43,200 transactions per day without congestion. To back up its security claims, the project has undergone audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . Community governance could also play a major role. PlutoChain’s model may let users propose and vote on protocol changes, ensuring the network evolves in a way that aligns with user needs. PlutoChain might not only reduce Bitcoin’s network congestion and fees but also unlock new use cases that could change how the industry views Bitcoin’s utility. The Bottom Line While XRP’s long-term price predictions remain speculative, analysts like Egrag Crypto suggest that its market cap could reach new heights if key adoption and regulatory factors align. Whether or not these forecasts come true, they show the growing interest in blockchain scalability and real-world use cases. On the other hand, PlutoChain could offer a hybrid Layer-2 solution that might finally address Bitcoin’s speed and cost inefficiencies. With faster transactions, lower fees, and compatibility with Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, PlutoChain might redefine Bitcoin’s utility. ——- This article is not financial advice.

Which Crypto Has 15,800% Potential?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-xrp-or-official-magacoin-which-crypto-has-15800-potential/,"As we approach March 2025, the cryptocurrency market is buzzing with speculation about which tokens could deliver astronomical returns. Three contenders stand out: Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin; XRP, backed by Ripple’s institutional partnerships; and THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN, a newcomer with explosive presale momentum. Each represents a different facet of the crypto ecosystem – meme-driven, institutional-backed, and community-powered. With global crypto adoption surpassing 1 billion users, the stage is set for potential breakout performances. Dogecoin (DOGE) Analysis Dogecoin, the pioneer meme coin, has a history of defying expectations. Its community-driven price spikes, often fueled by celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk’s tweets, have led to impressive rallies. However, sustaining such growth becomes increasingly challenging as the market matures. Expert predictions for DOGE in 2025 vary widely: Some experts forecasts a maximum value of $0.392. While others suggest a more conservative range of $0.17 to $0.202. One expert presents an optimistic scenario of breaching $1, potentially reaching $1.072. While DOGE maintains a strong community, its ability to replicate past parabolic runs remains uncertain. The 2025 landscape may require more than meme power to achieve 15,800% gains. XRP (Ripple) Analysis XRP’s trajectory is closely tied to Ripple’s legal battles and institutional adoption. Recent favorable rulings in its SEC case have bolstered investor confidence. XRP’s integration into global payment networks positions it well for potential growth. Price predictions for XRP in 2025 are bullish but varied: Some experts project XRP reaching between $5 and $7 7 . More conservative estimates suggest a range of $0.426124 to $0.5841545. XRP’s potential for explosive growth hinges on regulatory clarity and increased adoption in cross-border payments. While significant gains are possible, reaching 15,800% from current levels appears ambitious. THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN: The Potential 15,800% Breakout Token THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN has emerged as a dark horse, combining political backing with crypto innovation. Its presale success, raising $3.5 million by February 20, 2025, signals strong investor appetite. With a current price of $0.0001978 and an anticipated listing price of $0.007, MAGACOIN presents an enticing opportunity for explosive growth. Key factors driving MAGACOIN’s potential include: Limited supply of 100 billion tokens, creating scarcity Strong community backing with over 60,000 supporters Unique blend of political branding and crypto innovation Analysts predict a potential 1000% surge post-listing, with some suggesting even higher possibilities given the token’s unique positioning. ACT FAST! ENTER MAGA50X NOW AND CLAIM YOUR 50% EXTRA BONUS! Comparative Growth Potential: Which Crypto Has the Edge? While Dogecoin and XRP offer established track records, their potential for 15,800% growth faces significant hurdles: Dogecoin: 122-196% potential growth from current prices to 2025 highs. XRP: Predictions range from 100% to 1,300% growth, falling short of the 15,800% target. THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN, however, stands out with its explosive presale momentum and unique market position. Its limited supply and growing demand create a perfect storm for potential hypergrowth. While achieving 15,800% gains remains speculative, MAGACOIN’s early-stage entry point and viral traction make it the most likely candidate among the three to approach such astronomical returns. Secure Your Stake in THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN Before the Next Surge! As we look towards 2025, Dogecoin and XRP remain strong contenders in the crypto space, but their ability to deliver 15,800% returns is constrained by market cap and existing adoption levels. THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN, with its presale dominance and projected hypergrowth, emerges as the most attractive high-reward investment opportunity. The combination of scarcity, political backing, and community-driven demand positions MAGACOIN uniquely in the market. While all cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, MAGACOIN’s potential for exponential growth makes it a compelling option for investors seeking outsized returns. Don’t miss out on this limited-time opportunity to be part of MAGACOIN’s journey. Early entry could be crucial for maximising potential returns with the next price increase imminent and exchange listings on the horizon.

The majority are now focusing on newer projects with more upside potential. RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as one of the top choices, offering a more lucrative alternative with its AI-driven trading and yield optimization approach. This has attracted the attention of a popular Solana whale, who has moved $10 million into RCOF, anticipating its potential 55,000% rally. Solana’s Price Trajectory: A Week of Investor Uncertainty Like most cryptocurrency assets, Solana fell to its current price of $174.46 . However, the coin bounced off the $170 support area, and if it continues its upward trajectory, Solana could cross the $200 mark yet again. For the most part of the year, the value of Solana has oscillated around the $200 zone, and with other altcoins poised to gain 10x or more, investors are taking a closer look at these opportunities. More and more investors are now targeting RCO Finance due to its high utility and ability to generate greater returns, which is a more desirable option in the current market. Why RCOF Could Outperform Solana in 2025 At the core of RCO Finance is its Robo Advisor, an advanced AI-driven tool created to address the complexities of the cryptocurrency market. This will enable investors to make more informed decisions in a market always evolving. Let’s take a look at Solana during the second half of 2024. The crypto asset reached a six-month high of $188 on expectations of a more cryptocurrency-friendly regulatory environment with President Trump at the helm. Bitcoin also surpassed $100,000 in November 2024, and investors who entered early amassed significant profits. A tool like the Robo Advisor could have caught emerging trends early, allowing investors to join at favorable prices. By continuously monitoring market conditions, the Robo Advisor provides timely suggestions, enabling users to adjust their portfolios so as to secure profits. The Alpha platform is in the final stages of development, and this will bring new improvements to the Robo Advisor. As the bull run approaches, this is one tool everyday savvy investors should have in their arsenal. On top of the Robo Advisor, RCO Finance offers exposure to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 categories. This range provides investors with the power to build diversified portfolios based on their financial goals. Whether investors are interested in old school stocks, cryptocurrencies, or emerging assets like tokenized real estate, RCO Finance has you covered. RCO Finance also offers a KYC-free experience, allowing you to invest and trade without having to go through time-consuming procedures. This will help you get into the market immediately to grab opportunities as they arise. Holders of the RCOF tokens also have the added benefit of earning passive income through staking. Now, investors can lock tokens and let their money work for them. Token holders also have unlimited access to all the features mentioned above. The Beta platform is now live, and investors can interact with some of the platform’s AI features. The platform will receive regular updates to ensure it functions at the best level possible. Join the Token Presale Today One token is currently priced at $0.1, and analysts claim that the token is still highly undervalued. Soon, the price will rise to $0.13, and by then, your potential profit margins will be lost forever. A modest investment of $2,000 could lock in $80,000 or more at the end of the presale. With 10,000 users already onboard, RCO Finance’s popularity will only increase from here. RCO Finance has been audited by SolidProof . The company thoroughly scanned its smart contracts and platform’s codes, and RCO Finance surpassed expectations. The audit confirms the platform’s commitment to making sure that investments are safe and secure. Investors who get in now could secure life-changing profits. Don’t miss the opportunity to secure your financial future in 2025.

While the altcoin has shown some stability over the past day, there is no indication of price recovery. Amid these developments, X digital asset analysis handle More Crypto Online has shared some market updates highlighting important price levels for the XRP market. Related Reading: Altseason On The Way? Key DeFi Developments Signal Major Crypto Surge XRP Bulls Await Breakout Confirmation As Market Remains Neutral In a new X post on February 22, More Crypto Online provides an intriguing XRP price analysis identifying the needed conditions for a bullish or bearish development. According to these analysts, XRP is currently in neutral consolidation range indicating neither bulls nor bears are welding market control. Based on the Elliot Wave Theory, it is understood the altcoin is holding well above the critical price of $2.47 which allows a bullish orange scenario to remain viable. XRP enthusiasts must avoid any decisive price fall below this support level which could activate a yellow bearish scenario. In this case, XRP could slide into a downtrend with potential support levels identified at $2.34, $2.22, $2.11, and $1.95. On the other hand, aside from staying above $2.47, More Crypto Online states that market bulls must force a price surge above the $2.75 resistance zone to confirm any bullish breakout. Thereafter, XRP could surge to above $3.30. Interestingly, fellow analyst Egrag Crypto presents a higher validation point for the XRP bullish case, stating a monthly close above $3.00 is needed to show sufficient buying pressure for a sustained uptrend. As reported by NewsBTC, this development would pave the way for a new all-time high of around $6.00.

At press time, XRP trades at $2.56 reflecting a 0.84% in the past day. Meanwhile, the altcoin’s monthly losses have now increased to 16.18%. XRP has failed to struggle to regain its bullish form from November 2024 due to multiple factors including widespread market uncertainty. However, data from CoinMarketCap reflects that the altcoin community remains largely bullish with expectations of long-term profitability. This optimism can be attributed to factors such as the growing potential of XRP Spot ETF amidst strong investor confidence in the new US administration’s pro-crypto approach. Interestingly, this policy change has shown significant rewards as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) abruptly withdrew its lawsuit against Coinbase Exchange. If a similar development occurs in the Commission’s case against Ripple, it could translate into a major bullish driver for the XRP market.

Web3Bay (3BAY) – The Best Crypto Gem to Buy Right Now Web3Bay is redefining online commerce by ditching middlemen and slashing transaction fees, empowering both buyers and sellers to fully control their dealings.

The rising interest in Bitcoin-native applications marks Stacks as a significant player in the blockchain arena. With Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and recent value surges, Stacks gains from the network’s unmatched security and established reputation.

This positions Stacks as the best crypto gem to buy right now for those intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin’s Layer-2 advancements.

With AI-powered trading, cross-chain compatibility, and privacy-focused tools, 1FUEL redefines digital asset management. Investor interest is soaring, with over $2.32 million raised in its ongoing ICO, solidifying its position as one of the most anticipated Web3 projects of 2025. Shiba Inu news: price dips as market struggles for a rebound Shiba Inu (SHIB) maintains a low price at $0.00001568 after experiencing a seven percent decline during the past week and a 2% decline in the previous 24 hours. Shiba Inu presents strong resistance to investors because its trading volume exceeds $170.04 million, while its market capitalization stands at $9.24 billion. A death cross on Shiba Inu’s daily chart, where the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, suggests further downside. Whale transactions for Shiba Inu declined by 79% during the preceding three-month period, indicating that major investors show less interest in the coin. In other Shiba Inu news, the upgraded ShibaSwap system provides better liquidity pool features and real-time reporting, which boosts investor interaction. The destruction rate for Shiba Inu tokens increased by 120%, removing 128 million tokens in seven days. The analysts at Telegaon believe Shiba Inu will reach $0.0000728 by 2025 because adoption will rise and market sentiment will transform. The ongoing development and burning processes create long-term potential for SHIB, although investors should exercise caution. Why is Bonk dropping? Factors behind Iis recent decline Bonk (BONK) has a current market value of $0.00001627 and a market capitalization of $1.25 billion, with daily transactions reaching $81.88 million. Bonk’s price has dropped significantly by 52.67% over the last month, mostly because traders have withdrawn their funds, and its system has been minimally innovated. Even though market sentiment declines, Bonk maintains its position in the market through its dedicated community members who show interest in meme tokens. According to the latest Bonk news, the weekly chart indicates a bullish engulfing pattern demonstrating emerging buyer interest. Experts predict that improved market sentiment could lead to such indicators becoming signals that the price might reverse. Integrating Bonk into Decentralized Finance applications will create new use cases that bring sustained value to the platform. The Telegaon analysts project that Bonk will achieve an average value of $0.000032 in 2025 when specific positive factors emerge. The success of the meme coin depends on ecosystem growth and adoption so that it may experience a powerful resurgence. 1Fuel’s roadmap: The future of decentralized trading and multi-chain transactions The crypto space highly praised 1Fuel (OFT) because of its revolutionary technology and practical real-world applications. The forthcoming secure multi-chain wallet combined with decentralized exchange functions will transform trader management of digital assets. Users can easily exchange tokens through the platform’s cross-chain system using a single-click operation while avoiding multiple wallet management issues. 1Fuel operates a peer-to-peer exchange that lets users privately complete secure, unmediated, and rapid trades. Through its staking program, investors obtain substantial returns, up to a maximum of 30% APR. 1Fuel utilizes AI-powered trading technologies and intelligent features to dominate DeFi operations. The anticipation grows stronger as the Beta Wallet launch approaches. All investors who purchase $2,000 worth of tokens in the presale period will receive front-line access to the product. Early backers receiving first access to Beta Wallet features will happen earlier because $3 million is reached during the presale period ending on February 23. About 218 million tokens have been sold in the presale phase of 1Fuel, while the project has collected more than $2.32 million, bringing it close to finishing its presale period. Analysts expect the value of $0.018 tokens to surpass 100x its initial price point when major exchanges integrate them, leading experts to consider this venture one of the most promising crypto opportunities.

40750447,https://nulltx.com/?p=145690,1740355724,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Meme Coin Market Struggles Could Cement 1Fuel (OFT) Exchange Innovation at the Forefront for Investors,https://nulltx.com/meme-coin-market-struggles-could-cement-1fuel-oft-exchange-innovation-at-the-forefront-for-investors/,"Given the unstable nature of the meme-based cryptocurrency market and recent predictions not in their favor, crypto investors want to ensure their investments are in safe hands. Therefore, it is not surprising that these investors are considering 1Fuel (OFT) Exchange, a platform with its DeFi token in the presale stage that is expected to have a 100x gain in the first year of its launch, as the successor. Read on to understand why. Meme Coins struggle in the market and most could soon take a dive When meme coins entered the crypto world, the community blossomed. However, with meme coins, every investment automatically becomes risky as is evident in certain meme coins. Two noteworthy examples are the recent PEPE price predictions made by experts, who say that a crash from its current price of $0.000009 is imminent and analyses showing that PENGU might drastically drop from $0.0088 very soon. Pepe, a deflationary frog-themed meme coin created to honor Pepe the Frog has made a name for itself by being honest with its community about its lack of utility since launching. Still, it quickly rose as one of the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. Yet, Pepe’s price prediction implies a crash soon, and with a 65.6% drop from an ATH of 0.00002825, the downtrend might be even closer than expected. PENGU, the official coin of the NFT project “Pudgy Penguins” was launched on the 17th of December, 2024, and quickly rose to an ATH of $0.05738. This token was designed solely to boost engagement within its community by giving early access to NFT drops, helping them unlock special features, and providing special in-game experiences. Since its launch, PENGU has taken a nosedive, dropping by 84.6% from it’s all-time high to a current price of $0.0088. Despite the achievements and contributions of these meme coins to the crypto market, their future remains uncertain. Experts predict that several meme coins will either break beyond resistance points and reach a new ATH by 2025 or embark on another bearish run. Investors who have since been worried and anticipating a price crash are starting to find alternative projects to safeguard their liquidity. 1Fuel: Taking over the crypto-verse with innovation 1Fuel is a new project already causing a sensation in the community. It is set to take the reins from its predecessors and lead everybody willing to give it a chance to crypto paradise. Although it is still in its fourth presale stage, it has pulled off a sale of 219 million tokens raising $2.3 million in the process. With its wallet launch already upon us, investors can expect smooth sailing transactions with their one-click solution for cross-chain transactions. Analysts forecast 1Fuel to gain at least 100x in the first year of its launch and this already has investors buzzing. Still selling at $0.018, 1Fuel is the way to go for crypto enthusiasts and experts alike. We live in a world where one right decision can set you up for life and earn you financial freedom and this possibility is further amplified in the crypto-verse. That decision is 1Fuel, a project that promises privacy and security for your investments through a privacy mixer and cold storage solutions. Make that decision right now by joining the presale. You can join the 1FUEL presale and cop your tokens at a current low price of $0.018 before prices increase.

Solana Under Pressure as Bybit Hacker Launders Stolen Funds Through Pump.Fun Memecoins Solana (SOL) experienced another wave of steep losses on Sunday despite early recovery tailwinds within the crypto market. Notably, top altcoins like Ethereum, and Tron (TRX) erased considerable portions of losses booked in the aftermath of the Bybit crash on Friday, while Solana price has plunged even further. The chart below shows how Solana price declined by 4% within the daily timeframe, trading at $167 lower that the $170 bottom recorded during the initial crash on Friday. Solana (SOL) Price Action Feb 23, 2025 The latest SOL price slump has been linked to reports that hackers linked to the $1.4 billion Bybit hack are using the solana’ memecoin launchpad Pump.Fun platform to launder the funds stolen from ByBit. Citing official data from Solana blockchain explorer Solscan, Blockchain analytics platform WuBlockchain alerted market watchers to a series of transactions linked to the stolen funds. According to Solana blockchain explorer Solscan, blockchain analytics platform WuBlockchain identified suspicious transactions tied to the stolen assets: “Bybit exploiter is laundering money by issuing memecoins on Pump.Fun. The Bybit exploiter (5STkQy…95T7Cq) transferred 60 SOL to 9Gu8v6…aAdqWS, who then launched a token called QinShihuang (500,000), which has traded over $26 million.” WuBlockchain, Feb 23, 2025 This move could effectively nullify the possibility of a rollback , an outcome which has propelled Ethereum price by 8% as it reclaimed the $2,800 territory at the time of writing. However, it sparked negative sentiment for the Solana network, as key opinion leaders began to berate the blockchain for a second major link to an high-profile exploit, a week after controversy broke out around Argentina President Javier Milei’s involvement with the LIBRA memecoin rug-pull . “Solana is being used to launder stolen funds from Bybit. No need to beg for rollback, it has always been a wash chain.” – CardanoHumpback, Feb 22, 2025 $2 Billion FTX Unlock Could Compound Solana’s Short-Term Woes With SOL now trading below its previous local bottom, concerns are mounting over further downside risk. Adding to the bearish outlook is the ongoing repayment process for victims of the collapsed FTX exchange. According to Bitget, over $800 million in funds were distributed to 160,000 customer accounts starting February 18. Bitcoin researcher PeddyXBT has pointed out that an additional 11.2 million SOL (approximately $2.03 billion) is due for distribution on March 1, less than a week away. FTX Estate set to Unlock 11.2 million SOL ($2.03 billion) While he noted that over-the-counter (OTC) sales could mitigate immediate selling pressure, the 4% decline in SOL price on Sunday suggests majority of traders are exercising caution. In summary, Solana’s Pump.Fun being used to launder Bybit hack funds—mere days before the $2 billion FTX asset unlock—could prompt strategic investors to reduce their SOL exposure. If selling pressure intensifies, further declines may be on the horizon in the coming trading sessions. Solana Price Forecast: $150 Breakdown Likely if Bearish Risks Crystalize Solana price forecast charts suggests further downside as bearish signals mount, with SOL trading at $168.08 after a 4% weekly decline. The daily chart shows price action constrained below the midline of the Bollinger Bands at $185.89, reflecting ongoing selling pressure. SOL remains pinned beneath the 50-day moving average at $185, reinforcing the bearish outlook as long as it struggles to reclaim this level. Trading volume at 1.44K suggests weakening market participation, limiting upside potential. Solana Price Forecast (SOLUSDT) The Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator at -21.90 signals a firm grip by bears, extending a prolonged negative momentum streak. If this pressure continues, SOL could break below the lower Bollinger Band at $160.58, paving the way for a retest of psychological support at $150. A confirmed breakdown below this threshold could trigger an extended decline toward the next demand zone near $135. Conversely, a decisive bounce off current levels, backed by increased buying volume, could see SOL reclaim $170. A move past the $185 resistance would invalidate immediate bearish projections and open the door to a potential recovery toward $211. However, without a shift in trading volume dynamics, bearish risks remain dominant.

Meanwhile, a new comedic contender called Panshibi (SHIBI) priced at $0.005 has raised over $1 million in presale, signaling a craving for higher-upside meme coins. As LTC struggles with whale-driven resistance, SHIBI might steal the spotlight in a market hungry for fresh comedic narratives. Litecoin Gains Under Pressure Litecoin (LTC) trades near $127 but struggles to surpass key resistance between $90 and $130, reflecting a wider trend of sideways movement. Market observers highlight that Litecoin gains are largely stifled by whale manipulation, as these major holders appear to sell on price spikes and buy during dips. Despite a 50% rise in LTC’s price during its recent consolidation phase, an enduring breakout remains elusive. The asset’s inability to crack $130 has limited upward potential, triggering cautious sentiment among traders expecting a more sustained push. Analytics firm IntoTheBlock reveals that whale behavior ties in closely with Netflow readings on exchanges, indicating how major LTC holders tend to shift tokens for quick trades. This pattern, often referred to as “ramping up withdrawals and deposits,” underscores the barrier to consistent Litecoin gains. Even so, a sudden uptick in trading volume like February’s 60% surge can spark fleeting rallies. Some analysts foresee a run toward $180 if LTC finally pushes past $130 , though any failure near resistance might send the price tumbling back to $150 or lower. Panshibi’s Final Surge While Litecoin’s gains fluctuate due to significant whale activity, Panshibi (SHIBI) has gained attention through its successful presale and humorous panda theme. Priced at $0.005, Panshibi offers a structured approach to meme coin security, locking liquidity for ten years and team tokens for two. These measures address concerns that plague many meme projects like sudden rug pulls thus fostering trust among speculators. The contract has also been audited, boosting confidence for those wary of quick collapses. Early adopters highlight Panshibi’s AI-based “social-fi,” which nudges the community to stake and complete quests, prolonging engagement well after launch. Some LTC holders, frustrated by whale suppression and modest Litecoin gains, have begun experimenting with $SHIBI in search of higher returns. Supporters say Panshibi’s lighter brand and quest-based rewards might stand out if the meme coin sector reignites this year. Although there’s no guarantee of explosive growth, the token’s structured tokenomics and comedic angle appeal to traders used to dog- or frog-themed assets. Should LTC’s sideways pattern continue, Panshibi could siphon off investor attention as the next meme star. In a hyper-volatile environment, novelty plus security often command premium interest. Conclusion As many track Litecoin gains for clues on altcoin sentiment, Panshibi’s presale emerges as a strong contender among meme coins. Whale manipulation keeps LTC pinned between $90 and $130, hindering a meaningful breakout. Meanwhile, Panshibi’s success so far demonstrates traders’ readiness to explore new comedic tokens that promise more than just hype. If LTC rallies past critical resistance, it might pave the way for broader altcoin optimism but if whales maintain their grip, capital could flow toward fresh comedic narratives like Panshibi ($SHIBI). In a market torn between caution and speculation, both LTC and Panshibi could shape the meme coin storyline in the months ahead.

Analysts Weigh In,https://nulltx.com/is-pepeto-the-best-presale-to-invest-in-will-shib-ever-recover-analysts-weigh-in/,"Investors often look for chances to make significant profit. While old tokens such as Shiba Inu ($SHIB) have issues, new projects like Pepeto ($PEPETO) attract interest because of strong basics and market promise. Pepeto costs only $0.000000112 each in presale and has raised over $4.7 million. Compared to standard memecoins that depend solely on buzz, # PEPETO builds an ecosystem with staking, a chain bridge, and its exchange for memecoins. With clear allocations and a plan for long-term growth, many analysts say Pepeto might be the top crypto purchase in 2025. Shiba Inu’s Struggles: Road to Recovery Shiba Inu ($SHIB) was once a top memecoin but now struggles in a hard market. In the past month, its price fell by 22.50% and its current price is $0.0000157 with a market cap of $9.26 billion. https://x.com/pepetocoin/status/1874260504891240897?s=46 {Embed} Despite the drop a notable event occurred – SHIB burned over 6 million tokens with an 800% increase in its burn rate. Token burns may cut supply and help value over time; however, experts doubt this will reverse selling and lift SHIB’s price. Why Investors Are Betting on PEPETO Over SHIB The difference between # PEPETO and SHIB shows why many investors now search for new projects with fresh ideas. While SHIB cannot get back its past strength, Pepeto’s presale attracts investors because of strong basics and a community plan. Pepeto uses staking and controls liquidity to provide lasting strength, unlike SHIB. SHIB burns tokens to reduce supply, yet it holds too many coins which can slow future growth. Investors who seek high gains see more promise in Pepeto. PEPETO vs. SHIB: Which Has the Better Future? Shiba Inu has a loyal community and a record of market gains, yet its recent losses create doubts about its chance to keep growing. Pepeto aims to be the new memecoin by linking meme culture with actual blockchain use. With its fixed presale, clear plan along with fresh method, #PEPETO comes up as a strong rival in the field. Investors who missed the first SHIB rally now view Pepeto as a possible means for big gains. At the same time, #WALLSTREETPEPE proved that new memecoins with solid bases may beat older tokens. If Pepeto holds its pace, it might outdo older memecoins like SHIB in the next market surge. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xDqgktMKkU {Embed} Conclusion: Is Pepeto the Best Memecoin Investment Right Now? As the crypto market gets ready for its next cycle, the search for the best meme coin to buy grows stronger. While SHIB still struggles, Pepeto’s presale success shows its potential. By raising over $4.7 million, smart money goes into # PEPETO . Its ecosystem-based plan with an early entry price makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. { Add Hyperlink to Banner: http://pepeto.io } To participate in the ongoing presale or to start staking PEPETO, visit Pepeto’s official website at pepeto.io .

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 857,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on the OTHERS chart, an altcoin index that tracks the market cap of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins. According to Pentoshi, OTHERS appears to be carving a local bottom at $250 billion and is now threatening to shatter its immediate resistance at $281 billion. “Alts potential low time frame double bottom forming from $250 billion. Still think we played this very well overall, and looking for it to go back toward $281 billion once again. Reclaim that and we get a nice move up for some actual relief.” Source: Pentoshi/X A double-bottom pattern is a bullish reversal structure indicating that an asset or index has formed a solid demand area and is setting the stage for an upside burst. Pentoshi predicts that OTHERS can surge by about 15% if it takes out resistance at $281 billion. “Looking better and better, the market has had numerous opportunities to sell off. Potential lower high at $320 billion range.
