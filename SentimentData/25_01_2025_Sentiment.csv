As Bitcoin and Ethereum soar, CATZILLA gains traction, outpacing DOGE and SHIB in investor interest and growth potential. Table of Contents CATZILLA: A new giant roars in the meme coin arena Dogecoin‚Äôs trend hints at potential growth in altcoin season Shiba Inu Price poised for a bullish surge after recent dip Conclusion In the current crypto surge, attention is shifting toward a newcomer as Bitcoin and Ethereum soar. Major investors show increasing interest in CATZILLA, while veteran favorites like DOGE and SHIB face challenges in keeping pace. The question on many minds is whether this emerging digital asset could become the next big sensation with phenomenal growth potential. CATZILLA: A new giant roars in the meme coin arena As Bitcoin and Ethereum push the crypto market upward, all eyes are on CATZILLA, the new contender poised to disrupt the meme coin space. With DOGE and SHIB facing waning momentum, CATZILLA is stepping into the spotlight, blending viral meme culture with massive growth potential. Its playful yet chaotic theme ‚Äî a Godzilla-sized cat wreaking havoc ‚Äî taps into Japanese kaiju-inspired storytelling, captivating both crypto investors and anime fans alike. CATZILLA is more than just a meme; it‚Äôs a movement. With its bold narrative, unique gameplay, and vibrant community, this new meme coin has the potential to redefine the space, offering a fresh perspective on the intersection of entertainment and financial opportunity.

Its 14-stage presale structure ensures early investors benefit from gradual price increases, with a projected 700% ROI already turning heads. The coin operates on three pillars of value: Epic Gameplay: A gamified experience that keeps players and investors engaged. A Unified Mission: Challenging crypto manipulation with a vision for fairness and decentralization. A Thriving Community: A hub for cat lovers, anime enthusiasts, and crypto degens seeking financial freedom.

Intereted investors wouldn‚Äôt want to miss the opportunity to join the feline frenzy! CATZILLA is gaining momentum, and the next 12,000% superstar could be just around the corner. Dogecoin‚Äôs trend hints at potential growth in altcoin season Dogecoin is showing signs of bouncing back. Recently, the price has been between about 30 and 43 cents. While it has dipped by nearly 8% in the past week, it‚Äôs still up over 165% in the last 6 months. The nearest resistance is just below 50 cents, with more significant resistance above 60 cents. If DOGE manages to break these levels, it could ride the bullish wave. The Moving Averages suggest sideways motion, but relative strength and stochastic indicators suggest more room for upward movement. The market may soon favor altcoins like Dogecoin, sparking new interest and possibly leading to notable gains. Shiba Inu Price poised for a bullish surge after recent dip Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a recent price dip. Its current range is $0.00001827 to $0.00002364. This drop marks a 10.64% decline over the past week and 16.27% over the month. Yet, it shows a 15.58% rise over six months. The price is near support at $0.00001625. If it stays strong, SHIB could break past $0.00002699 resistance. The RSI is under 50, suggesting the market may shift upward. Potential growth could lead to breaking the second resistance at $0.00003236, a rise of about 27% from the current range. Keep an eye on these levels for signs of a bullish trend. Conclusion As DOGE and SHIB show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the leading meme coin aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it combines governance rights, loyalty rewards, and staking benefits.

On Friday, Committee Chair James Comer sent letters to prominent crypto executives, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, seeking information about reported banking restrictions. The inquiry aims to assess whether financial institutions acted independently or were influenced by government pressure to deny services to crypto firms. 1/ Today we, along with some of the most important crypto companies and investors, received a letter from @GOPoversight asking for information on the recent debanking of lawful companies and individuals.

In the last cycle, February kicked off altcoin season. Could it happen again? Two key factors must align: 1) Bitcoin dominance must decline. 2) Bitcoin must hold a stable price above $100,000.

We‚Äôll have to wait a bit longer‚Ä¶ but the clues are starting to appear.‚Äù Source: Negentropic/X Earlier this week, Happel and Alleman said that BTC appears ready to break out based on the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI), which evaluates several aspects of the Bitcoin market, including wallet activity and transaction volume. At the time, they predicted that the crypto king was en route to a $110,000 price tag but would first meet resistance around $106,000.

To read full editions, subscribe . SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce ‚Äî two days after being named leader of a new crypto task force ‚Äî revealed SAB 121 would be no more. Bye, bye SAB 121! It's not been fun: https://t.co/cIwUc0isUE | Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 ‚Äî Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) January 23, 2025 Some context: A Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, represents interpretations and policies followed by SEC divisions in administering federal securities laws-related disclosure requirements . The SEC published SAB 121 in March 2022. It notably said that an entity ‚Äúshould present a liability on its balance sheet to reflect its obligation to safeguard the crypto-assets held for its platform users.‚Äù Why does the crypto industry care so much about the agency rescinding this? Cantor Fitzgerald Howard Lutnick explained the issue pretty well in a video he posted to X in September ‚Äî a couple months before Trump nominated him to lead the Commerce department. There‚Äôs a misunderstanding that TradFi players don‚Äôt want to transact in bitcoin, Lutnick claimed . He added that for banks to custody a client‚Äôs bitcoin, ‚Äúthey would have to set aside their own money equal to that amount in sort of like a jail.‚Äù Indeed, financial organizations told SEC Chair Gary Gensler that the bulletin ‚Äúhas curbed the ability of the associations‚Äô members to develop and bring to market at scale certain digital asset products and services.‚Äù The upshot? As VanEck research execs wrote in a December post detailing 2025 crypto predictions, this repeal ‚Äúwill pave the way for banks and brokers to custody spot crypto, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial infrastructure.‚Äù Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer argued in a Friday note that this SAB 121 rescission ‚Äúrepresents an even more meaningful game-changer for bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem‚Äù than a potential strategic bitcoin reserve does. While SAB 121 was published in 2022, it wasn‚Äôt until last year that Congress sent a bill overturning the guidance to Joe Biden‚Äôs desk. He vetoed it . Ava Labs deputy general counsel Wee Ming Choon told me last month that rescinding SAB 121 would be an act of ‚Äúgood will‚Äù that a new agency administration could take quickly.

This upward momentum follows news of a US executive order establishing a national digital asset stockpile, contributing to a positive market environment. Amid this backdrop, CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC has provided a fresh perspective on Ethereum‚Äôs current trajectory. Shayan highlights an interesting divergence between the increasing open interest in Ethereum futures and the price, which has yet to reach previous highs. Related Reading: Ethereum‚Äôs Price Stalls Below $3,500 as Leverage Ratios Climb‚ÄîWhat Next? Growing Futures Market and Divergent Price Action According to Shayan in a post recently uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, Ethereum‚Äôs open interest‚Äîan indicator of active futures contracts‚Äîhas surged to its highest levels in recent weeks, indicating heightened market participation and growing interest among traders. The analyst notes that the rise in ETH‚Äôs open interest and slow price response suggests a disconnect between market sentiment and price performance. While futures traders appear optimistic, this optimism has not yet translated into Ethereum breaking key resistance levels. The analyst wrote: Interestingly, there is a divergence between Ethereum‚Äôs price and futures market activity. Despite the significant increase in open interest, the price has yet to break its previous highs, showcasing a potential imbalance between market expectations and price action. Shayan also notes that elevated open interest could lead to volatility. Historically, large buildups in open interest have been followed by significant price swings as positions are liquidated. Although the direction of the next move remains uncertain, current activity and sentiment lean toward a potential bullish breakout. Shayan suggested that if Ethereum can surpass critical resistance, it could pave the way for a more prolonged rally. Market Concerns And Bearish Indicators In contrast, another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, presents a more cautious outlook. Darkfost points to a range of bearish factors, including increasing Ethereum inflows and reserves on Binance. According to the data shared by Darkfost, since September 2024, Ethereum inflows have consistently outpaced outflows, leading to a rise in exchange reserves. This trend reflects selling pressure, as more Ethereum is moved to exchanges, potentially indicating an intent to sell rather than hold. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Revival: What the Signs Say About Its Next Move Additionally, Binance‚Äôs taker buy-sell ratio has remained bearish for months, showing a consistent dominance of sell orders. Darkfost reveals that the shift in these metrics suggests that some investors may be locking in profits or reallocating capital elsewhere, leading to a more cautious market sentiment.

Table of Contents Ethereum‚Äôs Pectra upgrade set to launch in March Why does Bitcoin‚Äôs price keep rising? Why Remittix is turning heads Conclusion The market is accustomed to abrupt changes and contradictory patterns, with Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) frequently setting the pace. While Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency‚Äôs gold due to its prominence as an economic vault, Ethereum‚Äôs interesting trends are driven by its programmable blockchain technology. Yet, beyond these giants lies a rising contender shaking up the industry: Remittix (R TX) . Let‚Äôs explore these dynamics and uncover why RTX is the talk of the town. Ethereum‚Äôs Pectra upgrade set to launch in March Ethereum ‚Äôs evolution continues with the much-anticipated Pectra upgrade, set for March 2025. Designed to enhance scalability, user experience, and network health, this upgrade promises to redefine how Ethereum operates. Key features like EIP-7702 introduce account abstraction, enabling batch transactions, one-time gas fees, and sponsored payments. Meanwhile, EIP-2537 revolutionizes zero-knowledge cryptography, boosting privacy and security. Validators, too, stand to benefit from EIP-7002, allowing flexible staking withdrawals and an increased staking balance cap. The Pectra Upgrade demonstrates Ethereum‚Äôs unwavering commitment to innovation, which draws in both developers and investors. A breakthrough might push ETH‚Äôs price above $6,000, even though it is now facing resistance at $4,093. Its long-term survival, however, depends on frequent revisions and market adoption. You might also like: SOL holders back Remittix: The altcoin set to change the future of global transfers Why does Bitcoin‚Äôs price keep rising? With Bitcoin‚Äôs price currently at $104,000, the trajectory of the leading coin is influenced by both long-term investor confidence and data-driven forecasts such as the NVT Golden Cross. This metric, which compares Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap to transaction volume, signals an impending price surge when it hits local bottom zones. Analysts suggest that BTC is gearing up for sustained growth. This confidence is evident on exchanges such as Binance, where rising optimistic sentiment and positive buy-sell ratios are prevalent. Despite not being as programmable as Ethereum, Bitcoin‚Äôs price grows because its strength as a decentralized asset keeps it at the top of the cryptocurrency market. Why Remittix is turning heads In a market dominated by giants, Remittix emerges as a game-changing player redefining cross-border payments. Positioned as a bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional fiat systems, RTX leverages blockchain to solve age-old inefficiencies in global transactions. Picture what it would be like to send $1000 to a family member abroad using Solana, and they receive the exact amount in their bank account with no hidden fees, no inflated exchange rates, and no crypto expertise required. That‚Äôs the simplicity and power of Remittix. Beyond its seamless user experience, RTX is disrupting a $190 trillion industry with its transparent fee model and extensive network support for 30+ fiat currencies and over 40 cryptocurrencies. Freelancers, businesses, and individuals alike benefit from its Remittix Pay API, which allows crypto payments with fiat settlements, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. With its current presale price of $0.0297, RTX presents an investment opportunity that is too good to pass up. Early adopters stand to gain significantly, with projections indicating increases of up to 5,000% following launch. Supported by a thorough smart contract examination and a dedication to transparency, the presale has already generated $5.6 million. Remittix is well-positioned to take the lead in the PayFi industry as the need for creative payment solutions increases. Conclusion While Ethereum and Bitcoin carve out their respective paths, the crypto world‚Äôs gaze is increasingly turning to Remittix. With its unique combination of blockchain technology and fiat systems, RTX is a unique way to solve practical financial problems. Remittix‚Äôs promise of faster, cheaper, and more transparent payments puts it in a position to change the game as Ethereum gets ready for its next update and Bitcoin maintains its leadership. With its presale gaining momentum, RTX is more than just a token; it‚Äôs a movement redefining global commerce.

Larsen join in this request,‚Äù Ripple Labs legal team member Michael Kellogg wrote. The SEC recently filed its brief, arguing against the ruling that retail sales of XRP ( XRP ) were not securities. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of the New York District Court ruled that XRP was not a security, marking a notable victory for Ripple and the broader crypto industry. However, the court determined that Ripple violated securities laws in its institutional sales of the XRP token. Read more: Ripple leadership blasts SEC after filing appeal Ripple and the SEC have remained locked in a legal battle since the U.S. securities watchdog filed a lawsuit against the company and its executives in December 2020. Despite this being standard procedure in the U.S. court system, market observers are speculating whether the new SEC leadership might withdraw its appeal before Ripple files its cross-appeal brief. On Jan. 21, acting SEC chair Mark Uyeda announced a crypto task force to look into the agency‚Äôs approach to regulation of the sector amid plans to develop a clear framework. SEC has also been said to be looking at withdrawing certain crypto lawsuits. Two days later, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a crypto executive order establishing a working group to address crypto regulation and legislative proposals. The executive order also referenced a potential digital assets stockpile.

To read full editions, subscribe . Crypto‚Äôs new viral app isn‚Äôt very new at all. Solana-based social project Clout saw its downloads take off after launching an iPhone app that lets users buy tokenized versions of social media profiles. This is very similar to the premise behind the viral 2023 app friend.tech, which was itself a rehashing of BitClout, a Crypto Twitter tokenization app that went viral in 2021. Friend.tech‚Äôs founding team already stepped away from the platform, while BitClout‚Äôs founder was just charged with fraud by the DOJ and the SEC. Clout hasn‚Äôt leaned away from its forefathers. The project posted a meme today riffing on Justin Timberlake‚Äôs famous line as Sean Parker in The Social Network: ‚ÄúDrop the ‚ÄòBit.‚Äô Just ‚ÄòClout.‚Äô It‚Äôs cleaner.‚Äù ‚ÄúIntegrity and healthy tokenomics!‚Äù was Clout founder Ben Pasternak‚Äôs reply when I asked him what sets his app apart. At the time of writing, Clout was #34 on the App Store‚Äôs finance chart. The app is so congested that I haven‚Äôt been able to land a transaction all day. And Clout isn‚Äôt the only so-called SocialFi app grabbing Solana users‚Äô attention. Tribe.run ‚Äî which is still in invite-only mode ‚Äî has also seen some momentum for a tokenized X profile app that creates token-gated group chats called tribes. I managed to snag an invite and have been enjoying the app, which features a nostalgic Windows 98-esque design. Tribe comes with an airdrop feature built in where I was able to send some of my token to my group chat members. This feature is enabled by Solana zero-knowledge compression . When I asked Tribe founder Bill Zheng why he thinks his app can succeed where friend.tech, for instance, failed, he said the former app had a ‚Äúfundamental flaw‚Äù in that creators had no incentive to stay engaged. Tribe employs a subscription model where tribe members must pay a certain amount of SOL to stay in the group chat ‚Äî giving the tribe creators a reason to stick around. Outside of Solana, Kaito AI has seen success with its Yaps platform that doles out points for users who are active ‚Äî or who yap a lot, in internet parlance ‚Äî on Crypto Twitter. SocialFi‚Äôs resilience underscores the resilience of Elon Musk‚Äôs social media platform. X remains the center of the online crypto world, and until that changes, crypto social apps will keep testing out new ways to monetize Crypto Twitter.

Notably, its trading venue, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, filed for the in-kind redemption model with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The BlackRock iShares Trust In-Kind Redemption The proposed rule change from Nasdaq anchors on the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As demanded, it seeks to allow specifically qualified or authorized participants to transfer the trust‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings. If approved, this rule change will allow authorized participants to redeem their proceeds in BTC instead of cash. The in-kind model is ideal for most exchange-traded fund products. However, in the runup to the approval last year, the issuers compromised as the Gary Gensler-led SEC preferred the cash creates model. Detailing what this means for the market, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst James Seyffart noted that it won‚Äôt mean much for retail traders. He said with in-kind redemption, the entire Bitcoin ETF market will trade more efficiently. Wow. Way too many questions and this stuff goes pretty deep in the weeds. So i‚Äôll keep it high level and answer ‚ÄúWhat does this mean?‚Äù Not all that much for individual retail investors. Mostly what it means is that ETFs should trade even more efficiently than they already do‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/LWYsKmo5sH ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 This filing comes after BlackRock recently launched the BTC ETF variant on CBOE Canada. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Outperforming The asset manager is the biggest Bitcoin ETF issuer in the world, with the IBIT holdings topping $60 billion. IBIT crossed the $50 billion milestone for the first time in December 2024, an impressive feat attained after just one year. BlackRock has continued to stun the market; per current data, it has recorded three consecutive days of inflows. Farside Investors data pegs this at $661.9 million on January 21, $344.3 million, and $154.6 million on January 22 and 23, respectively. The positive trading milestone of IBIT also extended into January 24. Per market data, it recorded over $2 billion in trading volumes in the first few hours. Setting the Pace for Competitors Market experts noted that with BlackRock pushing for in-kind redemption, other crypto ETF issuers may follow soon. BlackRock is, however, to file similar in-kind redemption for its Ethereum ETF product. While it is setting a pace in key ETF offerings, it has subtly distanced itself from the alternative crypto ETF filings as it is becoming a trend. Coingape reported multiple ETF filings earlier as asset managers woke up to the pro-crypto US SEC. One of the recent high-profile filings is the Grayscale Bitcoin Adapters ETF . This offering was designed to track the performance of publicly traded firms with a Bitcoin exposure.

This makes them the second and third fund managers to do so after Canary Capital. Grayscale And Coinshares File For Litecoin ETF In an X post , the President of the ETF Store, Nate Geraci, revealed that Grayscale and Coinshares have filed with the US SEC to offer a Litecoin ETF. In Grayscale‚Äôs case, the asset manager filed a 19b-4 form to list and trade its Grayscale Litecoin Trust as an ETF. Meanwhile, Coinshares filed an S-1 form with the Commission to offer an LTC ETF. These are the second and third applications for such ETF following Canary Capital‚Äôs filing last year. This continues the flurry of crypto-related ETFs that have flooded in ever since US President Donald Trump took office and designated Mark Uyeda as the acting US SEC Chair . There is optimism that the new SEC administration would be more open to approving these funds, unlike the previous administration under Gary Gensler. Moreover, Trump has already vowed to make the US the crypto capital . It is worth mentioning that Grayscale has also filed for a Bitcoin Adapters ETF and a Solana ETF. The asset manager refiled to convert its Solana Trust into an ETF. Meanwhile, besides a Litecoin ETF, Coinshares has also filed with the US SEC to offer an XRP ETF. Coinshares becomes the sixth asset manager to file for an XRP ETF after REX Shares filed for one earlier this week. LTC Price Surges The LTC Price surged to as high as $122 on the back of these Litecoin ETF filings. These filings undoubtedly provide a bullish outlook for the crypto, considering that it could drive significant inflow into its ecosystem. Moreover, this development is timely as it comes at a time when the LTC price outlook was looking bearish due to Whales offloading their tokens and a drop in the network‚Äôs hash rate. Interstingly, the Litecoin ETF looks to be the next crypto that the SEC will approve based on predictions by market experts. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had previously noted that Canary Capital filing an amended S-1 form indicates that the SEC was already engaging with them on the application. Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas had also previously explained that Litecoin could get the nod ahead of XRP and Solana because of its non-security status.

It is considered to be more efficient as it allows APs closely monitor the demand for the ETF and to act fast by buying or selling shares of the fund without cash being involved in the process. Retail investors are not eligible to participate. When the SEC first approved spot bitcoin ETFs including IBIT last January, the agency allowed to launch the funds with cash redemption, instead of bitcoin.

However, the token is now testing a key resistance level at $2.10, a level historically associated with selling pressure and price declines. $7.18 Million LDO Inflows into Exchanges As LDO‚Äôs price surged, on-chain data from CoinGlass revealed an inflow of $7.18 million worth of LDO tokens into exchanges, hinting that long-term holders or whales may be preparing to sell. Source: Coinglass The inflows into the exchanges suggest that long-term holders or whales have moved their holdings to the exchanges for a potential sell-off. However, this could lead to selling pressure and further price decline. Looking at such a dump in the past 24 hours indicates that history may repeat itself. Lido DAO (LDO) Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, LDO appears bullish but is currently at a crucial resistance level of $2.10. LDO‚Äôs daily chart shows that its price has reached this level more than twice, and each time, it has witnessed a price drop of over 28%, from $2.08 to $1.47. Source: Trading View However, this time, due to past history, investors have begun dumping their holdings and speculating that LDO could once again drop by 28% to reach the $1.47 level. Conversely, if the current sentiment for LDO continues and the price breaches the resistance level, closing a daily candle above $2.10, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 65% to reach the $3.50 level. However, in the cryptocurrency market, such a rally is easily achievable. LDO is currently trading near $2 and has experienced a price surge of over 15.50% in the past 24 hours.

Your teacher told you to write it as if to an alien, a being who had never encountered a cookie before, which meant touching on each sense ‚Äì sight, sound, smell, touch, taste. You might not have realized it then, but describing something in a way that allows people to get a clear picture is actually quite hard. Let me try to describe Matheus Pagani, founder and CEO of Venture Miner. Matheus is a male with light caramel skin and dark brown hair. Even though his hair is cut close, you can tell it‚Äôs curly. He‚Äôs got a thick dark brown, almost black beard, which connects to a mustache. His eyes are dark brown behind thin wire glasses. His bottom lip sticks out a little further from his top lip, giving him a look of assurance, but not arrogance. Picturing him yet? How confident are you? Oh yeah, and he‚Äôs Brazilian. Got it? Let‚Äôs see what Matheus Pagani actually looks like. Is this what you had come up with in your head from my description? Doubt it. Whenever I told you he was Brazilian, did you accessorize him in bright colors and a feathered headdress? Something like this? If so, check your bias, but also you‚Äôre thinking like an AI. That was what ChatGPT came up with from the prompt ‚Äúsome Brazilians having fun.‚Äù Pagani showed this and other examples spit out by our generative AI (Italians have fun by sitting around long tables with multiple generations eating pizza) during the AI2Web3 Bootcamp in NYC in early December. The bootcamp, run by Pagani and Build City, brought together 59 participants across all skill levels to learn how the two buzziest (and often misunderstood) technologies can be brought together to create useful products and services. Pagani used a version of the middle-school assignment to explain how and why AI made the significant leaps that have kept us all excited and on edge over the past few years. Before there was largely only text data being used to train AIs, and as the exercise highlights, that only goes so far. But mix text information with visual data, and you get a fuller picture. And understanding this, getting hands on with both AI and blockchain technology to understand its core components is what the bootcamp was all about. For Pagani, these skills are going to be relevant for nearly all people ‚Äì engineers, tech users, journalists, artists, doctors ‚Äì real soon. ‚ÄúWe want to join brilliant minds from all backgrounds to come and work with AI and Web3, since the junction of their multiple perspectives can uncover new use cases that we would never envision just with a specialized Web3 or AI mindset alone,‚Äù Pagani said. ‚ÄúNowadays we have tools to easily enable any non-technical enthusiasts to build practically functional applications and systems just with ""plain English,"" so what matters is bringing passionate people interested in solving problems together with the proper education. When you have this combination, you just need to light the match and watch it burn.‚Äù Mind-Boggling Building What makes the intersection of these two technologies so exciting is just how much you can build in such a short amount of time without really any prior technical experience. Not only will AI source whole codebases with the right prompt, but the crypto industry is also building tools to help make developing at the intersection of both more intuitive and accessible. For instance, Coinbase, who sponsored the bootcamp, launched AgentKit in November. The framework allows developers to build AI agents with their own crypto wallets , enabling the agents to interact autonomously with blockchain networks. This could be used to build a squad of agents that can monitor the markets and execute trades automatically based on predefined rules and guardrails. ‚ÄúOne day, we‚Äôll have AI agents own their own cars and operate their own taxi service that gets paid by customers in crypto and then uses that crypto to purchase repairs,‚Äù Lincoln Murr, associate product manager at Coinbase, told the attendees. Coinbase currently has a grants program ongoing for building with AgentKit. ‚ÄúWhat you build doesn‚Äôt have to be useful; we have a bias towards cool stuff,‚Äù Murr told the bootcamp, hoping to inspire projects and applications that no one has yet thought of. Ora Network also has an interesting model for developers looking to build AI-enabled Web3 applications or vice versa. The network allows developers to utilize current large language models, including Meta‚Äôs Llama3 and Stable Diffusion, but it also enables developers to build their own models and offer a so-called initial model offering (IMO) to crowdfund its continued development. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of winner-takes-all right now in AI, but with this model, we‚Äôre allowing the crowdfunding of AI building and training, so people can have a share of the models, which is empowering if we think these models will run society in a decade,‚Äù Alec James, partnerships and growth lead at Ora, said during the bootcamp. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the case, we‚Äôll want that development distributed.‚Äù Near, Fleek and Alora were also among the companies that sponsored the bootcamp and presented their various tools and programs for building at the intersection of these two innovative technologies. Can Devs Do Something? During the final day of the bootcamp, nine teams presented working prototypes for projects that blended Web3 and AI. These projects ranged from AI assistants meant to help you pick gifts, order delivery or diversify your financial portfolio to applications to help crypto operators pump out memecoins with big virality potential. Jackie Joya, a participant who had flown in from San Francisco, said the bootcamp has really inspired her to keep building. With a background in animal science, Joya is still new to engineering, but was amazed how much a novice could build with the tools available. Other participants, across all skill levels, said similar things. Choudhury Imtiaz, a market researcher from Bangladesh, who is in the U.S. on an H-1B1 Visa waiting for a placement, hasn‚Äôt heard of Web3 before the bootcamp, but was able to pitch a team project on the last day. And Isayah Culbertson, who has worked as an engineer for both crypto and AI projects separately, was able to learn skills for building with both, which he thinks has the potential to change the world for the better. ‚ÄúI see the combination accelerating the research and development of so many different fields, while also allowing for a more equitable distribution of wealth generated from that R&D,‚Äù he said.",Opinion,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SPONSORED|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 21:55:52

Table of Contents Chainlink SUI BeerBear Conclusion The crypto world is buzzing with speculation and profit-hunting, but not all coins are equal when it comes to massive gains. Altcoin titans like SUI and LINK may have solid reputations, but they‚Äôre losing steam. Meanwhile, a hidden gem called BeerBear is capturing the attention of speculators with its growth potential. Chainlink Chainlink has long been a favorite among altcoin fans, but its glory days appear to be fading. The Chainlink chart reveals a history of volatility in recent years. Despite occasional recoveries, the asset has failed to maintain higher levels, indicating weak long-term momentum. LINK‚Äôs recent growth appears more like short-term speculation rather than a foundation for future gains. The chart lacks clear signals of stability or the potential for significant growth. It‚Äôs hard to get excited about a coin that keeps teasing gains but fails to deliver. The LINK army is starting to dwindle, and the market sentiment is shifting toward other opportunities. SUI SUI entered the market with promise but its hype is wearing thin. The price has stagnated, and many experts are finding it hard to argue for any substantial upward movement. With trading volume declining and whales exiting the scene, SUI looks more like a fading star than a new powerhouse.

According to its registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the new product will trade on NYSE Arca. It sets a new path for Grayscale as one of the key promoters of alternative crypto ETF products. Grayscale Bitcoin Adapters ETF: a Strategic Move The Grayscale Bitcoin Adapters ETF is new and will seek to track the shares of publicly listed companies with a Bitcoin treasury strategy. If approved, the ETF filing will hold these companies‚Äô shares in weighted proportion. The ETF will represent an indirect exposure to Bitcoin via these companies‚Äô shares. According to the filing, the fund will hold at least 80% of its constituent shares. It confirmed that it may also invest in alternative securities that provide similar exposure to the underlying constituents. The Grayscale Bitcoin Adapters ETF will largely invest in US and non-US companies with a BTC exposure. The filing noted that the company must trade on a developed stock market to be eligible. It also placed a $100 million market capitalization benchmark for the firm, with a six-month average daily turnover of at least $1 million. Here‚Äôs the strategy details. Will be an equity ETF that holds the stock of companies that hold Bitcoin as a part of their corporate treasury. pic.twitter.com/KVgUw5BViP ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 Grayscale confirmed that all securities to be included must have a free float. This must include at least 10% of their outstanding shares. This ETF from Grayscale Investments is one of the few it has filed today. As reported by Coingape, Grayscale has also filed to list a Litecoin ETF with the US SEC. The asset manager is one of the key pioneers in the digital currency ecosystem. Favorite Firms to Make the Grayscale ETF List The most popular publicly traded firm with a Bitcoin exposure is business intelligence and software firm MicroStrategy. This firm acquired 11,000 BTC recently, now holding over 2% of the total Bitcoin supply, and generally borrows capital to fund its purchases. Earlier, MicroStrategy announced a $1.05 billion BTC redemption for its convertible notes due in 2027. This underscores its active Bitcoin strategy, which complements the conditions Grayscale set for the Adapter ETF. Other firms eligible for inclusion in the ETF include Riot platforms, Mara Holdings, Metaplanet, and KULR Technologies. Over the past few months, these firms have intensified their BTC acquisition strategies with the benefit of the share price. All Eyes on the US SEC The US SEC has received a lot of applications for ETF-related rule changes in the past few weeks. BlackRock filed for in-kind redemptions for IBIT ‚Äì the iShares Bitcoin Trust, a move many believe was long due. Beyond Bitcoin-linked ETF products, other cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana, have also bagged similar filings. The projection hinges on the positive shift at the US SEC under the Donald Trump administration. With all eyes on Mark Uyeda and potentially Paul Atkins, it remains to be seen how the markets regulator will attend to these filings.

39402839,https://coingape.com/?p=235349,1737756275,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Breaking: CoinShares Files For XRP ETF With US SEC,https://coingape.com/coinshares-files-for-xrp-etf-with-us-sec/,"CoinShares has submitted a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). The move is part of a surge in cryptocurrency ETF filings as financial firms seek to expand options for digital asset investments in the U.S. market. CoinShares Seeks Approval for XRP ETF CoinShares has submitted a registration statement on form S-1 to launch a physical XRP exchange-traded fund. This comes under the backdrop of more financial firms seeking Cryptocurrency ETFs after the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the earlier part of last year. Apart from CoinShares‚Äô XRP ETF filing, several other applications for cryptocurrency ETFs were submitted on January 25. CoinShares also submitted an S-1 for a spot Litecoin ETF, indicating that there is growing interest in altcoins ETFs. At the same time, Grayscale filed a 19b-4 application to have its Solana Trust (GSOL) and Litecoin Trust turned into ETFs. Grayscale Investments also submitted a 19b-4 application to convert its Solana Trust and Litecoin Trust into spot ETFs. Similarly, BlackRock, an asset management company, has also submitted an application for in-kind creation and redemption of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Regulatory Landscape Shifts Under New SEC Leadership The filings occur at a time when there could be shifting regulatory environment under the new administration. Prior to this, the former SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, resigned and Trump nominated Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto chair, for the position. Market participants are hopeful that Atkins‚Äôs pro-crypto stance could lead to more ETF approvals in the market. The SEC, under acting chair Mark Uyeda, has also established a new cryptocurrency task force headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce to help develop better guidelines for the industry. The task force is to consider the registration issues, improve the disclosure requirements and employ the enforcement tools more effectively. This change in the regulatory landscape might be beneficial for cryptocurrency ETFs, including those that are linked to XRP and other altcoins. Will Ripple Vs SEC Case Influence XRP ETF Filings? Despite the XRP ETF filing, Ripple Labs, the company associated with XRP, is still embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC. The lawsuit centers on whether XRP should be classified as a security, a decision that could affect the cryptocurrency‚Äôs regulatory status and its prospects for ETFs. Ripple recently requested an April 16, deadline for its appeal and cross-appeal briefs in the case. Lawyers following the matter speculate that the new SEC leadership may opt for a resolution rather than prolonging litigation. Pro-XRP legal expert Bill Morgan opined that the SEC could try to negotiate a settlement or even dismiss the appeal particularly under the leadership of Atkins. Such a resolution could remove all legal ambiguities for XRP and also increase the chances of approval of the ETF. While this XRP ETF filing is ongoing, the XRP price has appreciated by 1.5% at the time of writing, trading at $3.12. Concurrent with XRP ETF approval speculation, analysts have predicted the XRP price would rally after a crucial bullish breakout toward the $10 high.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A veteran crypto investor has identified Rexas Finance (RXS) as the next Ripple (XRP). Table of Contents A familiar story of disruption Presale success sets the stage Real-world utility Comparisons to Ripple A veteran‚Äôs insight The way forward The cryptocurrency market is well-known for its surprises; chances arise from unanticipated directions. Although popular names like Bitcoin and Ethereum rule headlines, experienced investors constantly search elsewhere for the next great investment. Inspired by early breakout analogies to Ripple (XRP), a seasoned crypto investor recently named Rexas Finance (RXS) as the next major contender. As a concept that could change the market, Rexas Finance has been progressively attracting attention and causing ripples in the crypto world. A familiar story of disruption The early years of Ripple were defined by its aim to transform global payments. As institutions started using XRP‚Äôs technology, the coin‚Äôs value shot up, paying early investors handsomely. In 2025, Rexas Finance aims to upend another important component of the financial system: the tokenization of actual assets. Rexas Finance seeks to bring real estate, commodities, and other physical assets onto the blockchain. By streamlining ownership, trade, and fractional investment, this invention aims to open a fresh field of opportunities for both people and businesses. Presale success sets the stage In its eleventh presale round, Rexas Finance has produced amazing outcomes so far. The presale has drawn interest from investors, with over $37.8 million raised and 407.2 million tokens sold. Priced at $0.175, RXS offers a low starting point for investors wishing to get early on a project with great future development capacity. This degree of presale success reflects the excitement of the early Ripple days when visionary investors realized blockchain technology had the power to transform industries. The difference now is that Rexas Finance is using years of industry evolution to build a stronger and complete ecosystem from the beginning.

The platform‚Äôs tokenization system will facilitate transactions faster and more effectively, allowing investors to convert assets into blockchain-based tokens. Having a fraction of a high-value asset, such as a luxury house, will become as easy as purchasing a stock. This invention opens the path for more general acceptance and major development possibilities by bridging the gap between conventional finance and blockchain. Certik has already audited Rexas Finance, increasing investor trust in its openness and security. Moreover, its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have given more exposure, enabling RXS to reach a larger spectrum of investors. Comparisons to Ripple Making a comparison to Ripple is about vision rather than only commercial potential. While Rexas Finance aims to transform asset ownership, Ripple aims to solve inefficiencies in world banking. Both initiatives use blockchain technology to develop answers and point out important flaws in current systems. Ripple became well-known because of its potential to attract institutional interest. Likewise, Rexas Finance presents a modern solution that fits the direction of finance, drawing in individual and institutional investors. The presale is entering its later phases, and RXS is ready to hit the market hard. According to analysts, its unique value proposition could drive its valuation tremendously, paying early investors in ways evocative of XRP‚Äôs climb. You might also like: 3 altcoins below $10 with potential to turn $600 into $10,000 A veteran‚Äôs insight The experienced investor who selected Rexas Finance lists some factors explaining his optimistic view. Firstly, the time is perfect. Projects with clear use cases should trump speculative tokens as the crypto market prepares for a 2025 bull run. Second, RXS‚Äôs emphasis on tokenizing actual assets fits general market trends. Blockchain-based solutions that smoothly interact with current financial systems have increasingly piqued the curiosity of institutional investors. Finally, presale pricing offers a chance to lock in a share of a high-potential initiative before it goes public. Given the hope of a notable surge, early adopters could find gains that match those of early XRP investors. The way forward The market for cryptocurrencies is ready for a surge in 2025. Once leading the charge, Ripple proved blockchain technology could transform sectors. Rexas Finance is poised to carry that fire into fresh ground. With its emphasis on asset tokenization, successful presale, and expanding network of supporters, RXS is more than a token; it‚Äôs a movement. Investors who lost out on Ripple‚Äôs early days now have a second chance on a project that could change the crypto environment. As the seasoned investor said, ‚ÄúRexas Finance is the future ‚Äî more than the next big thing.‚Äù For more information on Rexas Finance, visit their website , whitepaper , X , or Telegram .

The blockchain‚Äôs co-founder Vitalik Buterin noted that Layer 2s in 2025 represents a significant evolution from their experimental beginnings in 2019, having achieved certain decentralization milestones, secured billions of dollars in value, and scaled Ethereum‚Äôs transaction capacity by 17-fold, all while simultaneously lowering fees. However, Buterin stated that challenges remain, particularly around scaling and heterogeneity. Blob Space and Interoperability Challenges In his latest blog post , Buterin pointed out that Ethereum‚Äôs current blob space ‚Äì a resource for storing and processing data on the blockchain ‚Äì barely meets the demands of today‚Äôs Layer 2s and their use cases. As such, this limitation could hinder the platform‚Äôs ability to accommodate future growth. Additionally, the heterogeneity of Layer 2s creates challenges when it comes to interoperability, composability, and user experience. While Ethereum‚Äôs initial vision for scaling involved a shard-based system of homogenous blockchains, Buterin noted that Layer 2s have instead evolved into a fragmented ecosystem of chains created by different actors, each with different standards and infrastructure requirements. To address these challenges, the Ethereum co-founder outlined several key steps. On the Layer 1 side, Ethereum must accelerate scaling blobs and expand the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and gas limits to handle activities such as proofs, large-scale DeFi, deposits, withdrawals, and mass exit scenarios. On the Layer 2 front, he stressed the need for improved security, ensuring guarantees such as censorship resistance, light client verifiability, and the absence of trusted parties. Interoperability across Layer 2s and wallets must also be prioritized to enable easy interactions across chains through standardized addresses, message-passing protocols, bridges, and efficient cross-chain payments. For users, Ethereum should feel like a unified ecosystem rather than a collection of disparate chains, Buterin added. Strengthening ETH as a Triple-Point Asset Buterin also stated that Ethereum‚Äôs future as a strong triple-point asset ‚Äì functioning as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account ‚Äì requires a ‚Äúmulti-pronged‚Äù strategy to maximize the value of ETH . The first step is to cement ETH as the primary asset across the combined Layer 1 and Layer 2 Ethereum economy. This includes prioritizing ETH, the main collateral for decentralized applications and financial ecosystems. Next comes incentivizing Layer 2s to allocate a portion of their fees toward the broader Ethereum ecosystem, which could generate sustainable funding. This may involve burning part of the fees, staking them, or channeling proceeds into public goods for the Ethereum network. Third, while rollups offer opportunities for Layer 1 to capture value through MEV, it‚Äôs important to maintain flexibility, recognizing that not all rollups can adopt this model due to different application requirements. Finally, Ethereum could explore raising the blob count as a potential revenue stream.

Despite the market‚Äôs inherent volatility, price action remains robust, fueling optimism among investors and analysts.

Market sentiment is growing increasingly positive, with analysts predicting a massive move into price discovery. Among them, crypto expert Carl Runefelt has shared an intriguing technical analysis on X, highlighting a bullish setup for XRP. According to Runefelt, the price is forming a bullish pennant pattern on the 4-hour timeframe, a classic indicator of potential upward continuation. This pattern suggests that XRP is consolidating before a significant breakout, which could propel the price into uncharted territory. As excitement builds, investors are watching closely to see whether XRP can sustain its momentum and capitalize on the bullish market environment. A breakout from the bullish pennant could confirm XRP‚Äôs trajectory toward new milestones, reinforcing its position as one of the market‚Äôs most dynamic assets. XRP About To Enter Price Discovery XRP is on the verge of entering price discovery as the broader crypto market signals a bullish rally. Following a strong pump in early November, XRP‚Äôs price action has remained resilient, fueling optimism for substantial gains in the months ahead. As the market flirts with a decisive phase, XRP continues to stand out as a top contender for life-changing returns for investors and traders. Renowned crypto analyst Carl Runefelt has shared an insightful technical analysis on X, highlighting a bullish setup for XRP. According to Runefelt, the price is forming a bullish pennant pattern on the 4-hour timeframe, a classic indicator of potential upward continuation. Based on this setup, Runefelt has set a price target of $4.20 in the coming weeks, aligning with broader expectations of a market-wide rally. The bullish pennant suggests that XRP is consolidating before its next major move. If the pattern holds, the breakout could propel XRP into uncharted territory, confirming its position as a leading asset in this market cycle.

With its strong price action and favorable technical setup, XRP has the potential to deliver significant returns. Investors and traders are closely watching as XRP prepares for its next move, with anticipation building for what could be a pivotal rally. Price Testing Critical Levels XRP is currently trading at $3.19, following a massive surge above its previous all-time high last week. The recent price action highlights XRP‚Äôs strength as it continues to attract investor interest during this bullish phase. However, the asset has entered a brief consolidation phase, which could signal preparation for its next move. For bulls to maintain momentum and sustain the uptrend, reclaiming the $3.25 resistance level is critical. Breaking above this mark would likely reignite buying pressure and pave the way for another push toward new all-time highs. Achieving this would reinforce the bullish structure and solidify XRP‚Äôs position as one of the market‚Äôs top-performing assets. Conversely, holding above the $3.05 support level is equally important to confirm the ongoing trend. This level has become a key line of defense, and a breakdown below it could signal weakness, potentially leading to a deeper correction and testing lower demand zones.

Significantly, CoinShares submitted applications for a spot XRP ETF and a Litecoin (LTC) fund, indicating an increasing enthusiasm for altcoin investment offerings. CoinShares Targets Litecoin And XRP ETF CoinShares‚Äô submission arises as the US ETF market is progressively concentrating on cryptocurrency investments, after the approval and resulting success of funds investing in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in 2024. The firm has submitted an S-1 registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the XRP ETF, aimed at providing investors with direct exposure to the market‚Äôs second largest altcoin.

Skepticism Surrounds Proposed Litecoin ETF Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the XRP ETF filing, the altcoin has shown a mixed response in the market. XRP recently emerged from a nearly three-year consolidation period below the $0.50 mark, boosted by excitement surrounding pro-crypto regulatory shifts under President Donald Trump. Currently, XRP is experiencing remarkable momentum, boasting a staggering 500% year-to-date gain, trading at approximately $3.10.

According to the Cornerstone report titled ‚ÄúSEC Cryptocurrency Enforcement‚Äù, the last year of Gensler‚Äôs tenure witnessed a significant drop in crypto enforcement. ‚ÄúAfter reaching the highest number of cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions in 2023, the SEC brought a total of 33 actions in 2024, a 30% decrease from the year prior. Half of the actions were brought in September and October‚Ä¶ In 2024, the SEC brought 33 cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions against 90 defendants or respondents. Of these actions, 25 were litigations and eight were administrative proceedings. The most frequent allegations continued to be fraud and unregistered securities offerings. Of the 33 enforcement actions brought in 2024, 73% alleged fraud, 58% alleged an unregistered securities offering violation, and 39% alleged both.‚Äù According to Cornerstone, 50% of all enforcement actions came in the final quarter of 2024. However, despite the fall in enforcement actions, fees for penalties imposed by the SEC against crypto firms reached new record heights. ‚ÄúMonetary penalties imposed in 2024 against digital-asset market participants reached a record high of $4.98 billion, almost entirely because of one multibillion-dollar settlement‚Ä¶ During 2024, the SEC obtained a total monetary settlement of $4.55 billion in SEC v. Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. et al., of which $4.05 billion consisted of disgorgement and prejudgment interest. This was the largest monetary penalty ever imposed in a cryptocurrency-related enforcement action.‚Äù Three days ago, President Trump named Mark T. Uyeda as Acting Chairman of the SEC.

Table of Contents Solana continues rally amid increased demand Remittix attracts massive capital inflows Solana (SOL) is regaining strength after its blockchain experienced record-high DEX volumes on January 19. Although SOL is yet to hit the $300 price level, analysts are optimistic that the rally will continue for the next few weeks. Meanwhile, another DeFi altcoin is dominating the headlines; the new Remittix PayFi protocol. By looking to simplify cross-border payments and remittances, Remittix is attracting thousands of new investors during its presale. Solana continues rally amid increased demand Solana reached a new all-time high price of over $290 on January 20 after the release of Donald Trump‚Äôs TRUMP token on its blockchain. After this rally, Solana‚Äôs price saw a minor correction though investors remain bullish. The SOL/USDT monthly chart also confirms the bullish theories as Solana recently broke out of a cup and handle pattern. Solana‚Äôs social dominance has also peaked in the last seven days. With more conversations around Solana, analysts expect SOL‚Äôs price to increase because of high demand. Solana‚Äôs decentralized exchange volume also surpassed $27 billion on January 19, which was more than BNB Chain and Ethereum combined. If the bullish trend continues, it could positively impact Solana‚Äôs price. Solana currently trades for $256.43 after a 24-hour increase of 16.82%. Since Solana‚Äôs Momentum Indicator reflects bullish dominance on the daily chart, Solana‚Äôs price could test the critical $300 resistance soon.

In the early stages of its presale, Remittix has accumulated over $5.4 million, with a massive adoption rate. Remittix‚Äôs appeal lies in its aim for seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion within 24 hours and the removal of hidden fees. Using the platform individuals will be able to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat and deposit funds in local bank accounts without third-party intermediaries. User security is the top priority on Remittix as the platform will use a fully audited smart contract to process every transaction. With no central authority, Remittix ensures that each transaction is peer-to-peer and has no banking restrictions. Remittix is also committed to transparency because the platform uses blockchain technology to provide a public ledger for all transactions made on the platform. All payment records are 100% immutable, enhancing user trust in Remittix‚Äôs new PayFi ecosystem. You might also like: Ripple bounces back as Remittix gains traction Remittix will further support cross-border e-commerce transactions through its Pay API. Merchants will be able to use Remittix to receive payments in cryptocurrency from customers and cash out in 30+ fiat currencies or 50 different cryptocurrency pairs. The user-friendly Checkout feature will give customers the same level of security as traditional payment methods, putting Remittix at the forefront of DeFi. The Remittix PayFi ecosystem is powered by a native RTX token, which will offer utility and governance rights to long-term investors. VIP-tier holders will enjoy staking rewards with up to 18% APYs as well as premium voting privileges that convert them from investors to significant stakeholders in the Remittix ecosystem. Given Remittix‚Äôs user-first approach and low-cost payment solution, analysts expect this new PayFi protocol to outshine Solana‚Äôs blockchain. As Remittix bridges the gap between traditional and digital currencies, the RTX token is expected to record several demand-induced price jumps. Currently, RTX tokens are selling for $0.0297, giving traders a lower entry point before the price increases in the next presale phase.

Such a significant investment hints at the possibility of even greater gains, with experts suggesting another 50% rise could be next. XYZ: First all-sports meme token XYZVerse is rewriting the playbook for meme coins by fusing the global passion for sports with the viral appeal of crypto. Positioned as the ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù of sports-driven meme tokens, XYZVerse aims to unite sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, offering a unique way to engage with football, basketball, MMA, esports, and beyond ‚Äî all within its thriving ecosystem. The momentum behind meme coins is undeniable, with the market surging by 500% in 2024. XYZ is aiming to become the G.O.A.T. of this trend, projecting a 4,900% increase by the end of its presale. Starting at $0.0001, early investors enjoy a 99% discount on the target price of $0.1 in the 15th and final presale stage.

In the last month, the coin‚Äôs value rose by 8.33%, indicating a positive trend. However, the past week showed a decline of 12.74%, suggesting some short-term volatility in the market. Currently trading between $0.34 and $0.43, Dogecoin faces the nearest resistance level at $0.49 with support at $0.24. The 10-day simple moving average is at $0.35, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.37, pointing to a recent dip in momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 38.01, which is approaching the oversold territory, while the Stochastic indicator at 14.42 confirms this potential overselling. The MACD level of -0.0036 suggests bearish momentum may continue in the short term. Based on these indicators, Dogecoin might experience further fluctuations. If the price breaks above the $0.49 resistance, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.62, offering a potential increase of over 40%. Conversely, if it falls below the $0.24 support level, it might test the second support at $0.1163. Traders should monitor these key levels and indicators for signs of a potential reversal or continued trend. Conclusion Dogecoin‚Äôs impressive rally signals market excitement, but XYZVerse, the first all-sport meme coin, aims for 20,000% growth, poised to become a cultural icon in the 2025 bull run.

The vision was formalized on Thursday, when signed an executive order establishing a working group on digital asset markets. The order reaffirms the administration‚Äôs commitment to key crypto principles, including coding transparency, self-custody, and fair banking access, aiming to integrate blockchain technology responsibly into the U.S. financial system. This idea of blending blockchain with traditional financial systems is bold, and Graphite Network offers the means to make it happen with its scalable and compliant solutions tailored to meet the modern financial needs of banks and financial institutions of all sizes. Speaking to crypto.news, Graphite Network CTO Marko Ratkovic said: ‚ÄúWhile it‚Äôs clear that the world is changing and the new US administration is becoming more open to cryptocurrencies, concrete regulations are still up in the air. What‚Äôs certain, though, is that Graphite Network offers the infrastructure banks need to make this transition. We can help traditional finance connect with the decentralized economy, and this support is just as important for mass adoption as the regulations will be.‚Äù Bank Integration Demo is built to address pressing challenges facing financial institutions as they struggle to implement blockchain adoption on their own through: Building Reliable Infrastructure: Graphite Network‚Äôs blockchain is built on a Proof-of-Authority Polymer 2.0 consensus mechanism, ensuring high security, scalability, and energy efficiency. This will assist financial institutions in adopting blockchain technology without compromising their existing and legacy business. Bridging Compliance and User Empowerment : By integrating ZKP-based KYC processes and reputation scoring, Graphite Network bridges the gap between institutional requirements and user autonomy. Strategic Partnerships: Graphite Network continues to collaborate with banks and other financial institutions and tailoring blockchain solutions to address any specific needs. Other bank-compliant Graphite Network‚Äôs features Predictable Fees, Even During Peak Activity Graphite Network‚Äôs Layer 1 blockchain is built to keep fees reasonable, even during periods of high network activity. For banks and financial institutions, this predictability is crucial for managing costs and ensuring smooth operations. In contrast, Ethereum lagged in 2024, with fees spiking unpredictably ‚Äî averaging $3.52 per transaction during peak times. Such volatility can disrupt cost projections and scalability, making Graphite Network a more reliable choice for institutions integrating blockchain technology. Non-Intrusive KYC Graphite Network‚Äôs optional KYC system is a game-changer for balancing privacy and compliance. The system is built with Zero-Knowledge Proof technology which allows third parties to verify user data such as age or location without revealing personal information. This ensures data security and privacy while providing regulatory agencies and financial institutions with a verifiable, compliant system. User data submitted during the KYC process is kept off-chain to minimize the likelihood of data breaches or unauthorized access. Trust Score and Interaction Preferences Graphite Network‚Äôs Trust Score reflects a user‚Äôs reputation based on things like their KYC status, transaction history, account activity, and interactions with others. It even looks at whether any fraud claims are associated with their account. However, Graphite Network doesn‚Äôt impose strict rules‚Äîit lets users decide how they want to manage their interactions. They can choose whether to complete KYC, who to engage with, how to filter transactions, and more. This flexibility is important because it gives users control over their own decisions. For banks, this is useful because it allows them to have insight into the trustworthiness of users without forcing everyone into a one-size-fits-all system. Banks can also benefit from knowing that users can set their own preferences while still maintaining the ability to track and assess risk through the Trust Score. Reputation-Based Smart Contracts Graphite Network will also provide tools for banks and businesses to develop smart contracts that consider reputation metrics, enabling customization of services for targeted user groups. A bank, for example, could create a contract to issue loans only to customers with verified credit scores or a history of account activity, meeting both business objectives and regulatory standards. Directed Fund Management Graphite Network is planning to introduce tagged addresses to improve transparency and accountability in blockchain transactions. These addresses will be linked to specific purposes, such as business-related payments or loan servicing, ensuring that funds are directed where they‚Äôre intended. For example, if a bank transfers funds to a loan repayment-tagged address, it will be clear that the payment is for that purpose. If the funds are later misused ‚Äî say, spent on unauthorized transactions ‚Äî the system will flag it immediately. Additionally, smart contracts will be able to block transactions from suspicious addresses, adding an extra layer of security. While this feature isn‚Äôt live yet, it‚Äôs a significant step toward making blockchain transactions more secure and trustworthy for financial institutions.

Entry-point nodes onboard transactions, earning 50% of transaction fees in @G, while authorized nodes validate blocks, earning 100% of fees for independent transactions and 50% for transactions involving entry-point nodes. This structure ensures fair rewards for both types of nodes, creating a secure, scalable, and incentivized network that transforms participation into an income opportunity. Marko Ratkovic, recently reiterated one of Graphite Network‚Äôs central visions, explaining: ‚ÄúOne of our key goals is to democratize access to blockchain revenue streams. With our dual-layer node system, we‚Äôve ensured that participants at every level can earn rewards while supporting the growth and security of the network.‚Äù Bank Integration Demo is closely tied to @G, Graphite Network‚Äôs native token, which is weaved into key operations across the network as well, including paying fees, verifying accounts, distributing rewards, and more.

Table of Contents Rollblock keeps soaring higher Bitcoin breaks records post-Trump inauguration XRP hits a new all-time high Solana surge fueled by Trump token mania Conclusion Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration triggered a crypto market surge, with Bitcoin, Solana, XRP, and Rollblock rallying strongly to the joy of ambitious investors. Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly stance, with promises to create U.S. crypto stockpiles, and the appointment of a crypto ‚Äúczar‚Äù has catalyzed massive market movement, creating numerous opportunities for investors to make big gains. Rollblock keeps soaring higher Rollblock is an online crypto casino that is taking the GambleFi space to a whole new level. Unlike its competitors, it incorporates blockchain technology into its offering, providing provably fair gaming to anyone who gets close enough to play its array of exquisite games. Even though Rollblock is at presale, it already has a working product, which blows all other GambleFi projects out of the water. This is the reason its presale keeps soaring higher each day. Currently priced at $0.047 in stage 9, the Rollblock presale has raised close to $10 million from the public. This demonstrates strong investor confidence, with the current price being a 300% increase from its debut price. Analysts have predicted an RBLK surge to $1 in due course, a development that would fetch early investors massive profits. Bitcoin breaks records post-Trump inauguration Following Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, Bitcoin surged to $109,114, the highest it has been in its entire existence. The daily trading volume also rose above $120 billion as investors, both traditional and retail, pocketed BTC. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows also approached $1 billion 24 hours after the inauguration, which further accelerated BTC‚Äôs momentum. With Trump expected to enact crypto-friendly policies in the coming weeks, BTC could still break new records. You might also like: XRP, PEPE, and RBLK see major price action causing FOMO XRP hits a new all-time high In the week of Trump‚Äôs inauguration, XRP climbed nearly 40% to hit a high of $3.4. This took XRP‚Äôs market cap above $190 billion, taking it closer to Ethereum. The surge was fueled by general feelings that the SEC‚Äôs case against Ripple would soon be thrown out. Once there‚Äôs a new positive development regarding this case, one can expect XRP to rally again. Crypto analysts believe a surge to $4 is very close, and once XRP is freed from SEC‚Äôs shackles, a surge to $10 could be on the cards. Solana surge fueled by Trump token mania A few days before his inauguration, Trump launched the TRUMP token on Solana . This token surged stupendously immediately after its launch, going from $1 to above $70. It also boosted Solana‚Äôs price, with SOL hitting close to $300 in the aftermath of Trump‚Äôs inauguration. Solana is now among the top 5 biggest coins by market cap thanks to this development. A bullish SOL run is expected in the coming weeks, and smart investors are positioning themselves to take full advantage of it. Conclusion Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration has injected life into the crypto market, sending BTC, SOL, XRP, and RBLK to break new price levels. For maximum profits, though, savvy investors are banking on RBLK. It is smaller than the other coins, has a low entry-level price, and it‚Äôs got a lot of room for growth.

The cryptocurrency surged by over 30% before experiencing fluctuations, ultimately settling at $244 a week later. This has led some crypto analysts to adopt a bearish view, predicting that the asset might decline to $100. At the same time, a new project in the PayFi sector is gaining momentum during its presale, having swiftly raised over $5.8 million. Remittix (RTX) is capturing interest by addressing real-world challenges and improving efficiencies in the global payments market. So, what features are attracting DeFi enthusiasts to Remittix, and how might Solana (SOL) perform in the first quarter of 2025? Solana (SOL) Sees 6% Price Drop in Just 24 Hours After Solana's dramatic rise last week, the asset is now undergoing a significant price correction. It has fallen by 6% in just the past day, reducing its monthly gain to 26.5% from over 40%. Yet, there is a glimmer of hope for investors, as Solana's trading volume has increased by 9% overnight, indicating that some investors are taking advantage of what they consider a buying opportunity. With this latest decline, Solana's (SOL) market cap has dipped below the crucial $120 billion threshold. The cryptocurrency continues to face criticism for its relatively high inflation rate and persistent network outages, though some improvements to these issues have been observed over the past year. Remittix Raises the Standard for Global Payments Remittix (RTX) is tackling banking inefficiencies to revolutionize global payment processing. By combining blockchain's transparency with fiat's reliability, the platform enables users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currency and transfer funds to bank accounts worldwide. Remittix offers 24-hour transaction times and flat fees, providing a modern alternative to traditional financial systems. Designed for both businesses and individuals, Remittix (RTX) features the powerful RemittixPay API, streamlining payment processes. This tool allows businesses to accept crypto payments and settle them in fiat, supporting more than 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs, thus facilitating cross-border financial transactions with unmatched versatility. A key highlight of Remittix (RTX) is its dedication to financial inclusion. Operating 24/7 without relying on traditional banking infrastructure, the platform gives underbanked communities access to global financial systems, aligning with its mission to democratize financial access and reduce global economic disparities. Remittix Presale Dominates, Exceeding $5.8 Million In its ongoing presale, the $RTX token is priced at $0.0297 and has already raised more than $5.8 million. The token is central to the Remittix ecosystem, enabling governance, staking, and rewards. Analysts forecast a potential 800% increase in value by the end of the presale, with the possibility of a 5,000% surge post-launch, positioning Remittix as a game-changer in the burgeoning PayFi industry.

With such a wild increase, it is important to address the following question: Who owns the most Ripple ( XRP )? You see, a token‚Äôs distribution has to be diverse, as concentration means that the majority holder of the token can heavily manipulate the price at any major buy or sell position. Understanding who holds the most XRP can be key for investors to make a long-term buying or selling decision about this popular cryptocurrency. In this article, we‚Äôll provide an overview of the number of XRP holders, the token holder distribution, and the possible impacts of this ownership in the future. Overview of XRP holders Ripple Labs, the creator of the XRP token, is reported to hold the largest share of the token‚Äôs supply, amounting to 46 billion XRP. Also, Chris Larsen, the co-founder of Ripple Labs, reportedly holds 5 billion XRP. Major cryptocurrency exchanges also hold a substantial amount of XRP, with Binance holding 1.83 billion tokens. As of January 24, 2025, XRP is trading at approximately $3.16 per token. The cryptocurrency has experienced an intraday high of $3.18 and a low of $3.04. The 24-hour trading volume stands at $8.2 billion, contributing to a market capitalization of around $182 billion. XRP 1D chart | Source: crypto.news How many people own XRP? Due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain network, it is almost impossible to calculate the number of XRP holders . However, it is possible to track the multiple wallet addresses that hold this token. According to the latest data collected by Bithomp , there are approximately 6,032,259 active XRP account holders who hold a total of 99,986,575,397 XRP. While these numbers provide an estimate of XRP holders, the actual number may be different, as many users may hold multiple wallets, and some wallets will also belong to many crypto exchanges.

Meanwhile, the top 20 holders own 50.30% of the total supply, and if we talk about the top 50 and top 100, they hold 63.71% and 71.74% of the total supply. As for centralized crypto exchanges, Upbit is the leader among XRP owners, with 4.37% of the total supply, followed by Binance with 1.31%, Bitbank with 0.58%, and Korbit with 0.12%. Distribution of XRP among holders If we look at the distribution among XRP owners, we can see that wallets in the range of 1 million to 10 million XRP account for 6.42% of the total XRP supply. Following this, wallets between 100,000 to 1 million XRP hold 11.14%, and smaller XRP holders with 1000 to 100000 XRP own 7.53% of the total supply. Meanwhile, holders with 1000 or fewer XRP tokens make up a small percentage of the total XRP token supply, highlighting the dominance of larger accounts in this token. Ripple Labs and XRP ownership Founded in 2012, Ripple Labs is the creator of XRP, a company that focuses on real-time payment solutions. Its primary offering is known as RippleNet, a technology used by major institutions for cross-border payments. While Ripple Labs does hold the largest share of XRP tokens, amounting to 46 billion XRP tokens, most of it is locked in escrow with scheduled releases to manage token supply effectively. This major ownership does promote the ecosystem‚Äôs growth, but it also points to the centralization of the token‚Äôs supply, which goes against the core principles of blockchain technology. The impact of XRP ownership distribution As mentioned above, a few entities hold a significant portion of the XRP token supply, with the top 20 holders collectively controlling 50.53% of the total supply. While it is common for many cryptocurrencies which are in their early stages to have a concentrated supply among a small number of holders, it is not good in the long run especially when it comes to price stability and market behaviour. If major holders were to sell off their XRP holdings in a small amount of time it can drastically affect the token‚Äôs price, and more importantly, it can dent the project‚Äôs reputation forever. It is advisable to do your research before investing in any token and take a look at its tokenomics, total supply, and the convention of token holders as well.

This again provides some optimism concerning ETH, which has continued to underperform in this market cycle. Ethereum Price Eyes $4,000 With This Bullish Pattern In a TradingView post, BasicTrading revealed that a breakout to $4,000 looks to be on the horizon for the Ethereum price following the formation of a rising channel pattern. This bullish prediction came as the analyst noted that ETH had been retesting the previous all-time high resistance and was not able to break it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 However, this time, it could be different following the rising channel pattern. The analyst added that with the bullish break and retest and Ethereum price action, the breakout is about to happen. With Ethereum likely to break this psychological $4,000 resistance level soon enough, the analyst suggested that this could ultimately pave the way for ETH to reach and possibly surpass its current ATH of $4,800. BasicTrading remarked that the sky is the limit for the Ethereum price if it manages to break above its current ATH. Interestingly, the crypto analyst raised the possibility of ETH rising to between $20,000 and $25,000 if it replicates its historical performance from previous bull cycles. This price range represents the upper resistance trendline of the rising channel. However, the analyst stated that the Ethereum price must first achieve a clear breakout of its current ATH before a rally to as high as $25,000 can become a possibility. This bullish projection for ETH comes just days after crypto analyst Ali Martinez explained why it wasn‚Äôt time to give up on Ethereum despite its underperformance in this market cycle. Martinez mentioned that a decisive breakout above $4,000 could send ETH to $7,000. ETH To Reach Five Digits In This Bull Run Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has also backed BasicTrading‚Äôs bullish outlook as he predicted that the Ethereum price would at least reach $10,000 in this market cycle. The analyst asserted that ETH will come back with a ‚Äúvengeance‚Äù in the coming months. He added that $10,000 is the bare minimum once Ethereum breaks out. CrediBULL Crypto further opined that $20,000 is certainly not unreasonable by the end of this cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Gets Massive $12,000 Price Tag From Research Lead Ahead Of Major Upgrade Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price, stating that ETH‚Äôs hated rally that will bring it to $12,000 is loading.

At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,400, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Some have faith in Ethereum due to its extensive developer community, while others lean towards Ripple for its banking connections. However, a growing segment is betting that Remittix could offer the best prospects for future returns. By simplifying international payments, Remittix has built a reputation for its low transaction fees and fast processing times. This article explores the distinctions among Ethereum, Ripple, and Remittix, and why experts predict Remittix might surpass the others. Current Status of Ethereum and Ripple At present, Ethereum (ETH) trades at around $3.21k, showing a -3.31% decrease in the past day. Throughout the last month, Ethereum has declined by -5.95%, prompting some investors to seek new avenues. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is valued at approximately $3.06, with a -2.96% drop over the previous week. Despite Ripple's partnerships with significant financial entities, ongoing regulatory challenges hinder its widespread adoption. Both Ethereum and Ripple are major players, yet their prices have encountered obstacles. Despite these setbacks, many still view Ethereum and Ripple as key assets in the crypto world. ETH supports numerous decentralized applications, and XRP is designed to enhance global banking transactions. Nevertheless, this popularity does not assure their status as a smart crypto investment in 2025. Emerging coins that offer direct solutions, like Remittix, could gain an advantage if they continue to offer lower fees and faster transactions compared to Ethereum or Ripple. Remittix: A Sensible Choice for 2025 Remittix (RTX) is a token designed for cross-border money transfers. Over the past month, Remittix has surged by +88%, partly due to a wave of new users. Unlike Ethereum, which can experience high gas fees, and Ripple, which often focuses on large financial institutions, Remittix serves individuals needing quick transfers. Many freelancers and small businesses commend Remittix for enabling them to convert digital funds into local currency in less than 24 hours. By maintaining low costs and fast processing, Remittix provides a practical service that resonates with everyday users. Analysts believe RTX could increase by another +40% if its adoption continues. WhileETH and XRP remain important within the crypto ecosystem, tokens like Remittix could soon surpass them in daily usage. Observers are already calling Remittix the smart crypto investment in 2025 because it tackles issues that older networks haven't fully resolved. 2025 Predictions: Why Remittix Could Excel Looking forward, Ethereum is set to evolve through enhancements, aiming to lower fees and increase speed. Ripple is optimistic that better regulations will allow XRP to flourish in bank-focused agreements. However, everyday users might opt for an easy-to-use tool like Remittix (RTX) if it remains more affordable and faster than either Ethereum or Ripple. Word-of-mouth could attract even more people to Remittix due to its simple, cost-effective transactions. Investors searching for a smart crypto investment in 2025 often focus on real-world applications. If a platform can address everyday money transfer challenges, it has the potential for steady growth. This is the main advantage of Remittix: it prioritizes real-world needs, drawing interest from both new and seasoned traders. While ETH and XRP may keep their loyal user bases, many experts believe Remittix could see wider adoption, making it a strong contender in the coming years. Conclusion Deciding between Ethereum, Ripple, and Remittix depends on what you're looking to achieve. Ethereum (ETH) supports a multitude of apps, and Ripple (XRP) works with global banks. Yet Remittix (RTX) is focused on solving everyday problems‚Äîlike slow and expensive remittances‚Äîmaking it an appealing choice for those in need of practical solutions. If it continues to gain momentum, Remittix might outshine established projects by addressing issues neither Ethereum nor Ripple can fully solve.

With its vast potential and intriguing features, Remittix is expected to create many millionaires. As interest swells, people are beginning to realize the impact of this presale token. Let's explore why Remittix is gaining so much attention and could be a game-changer! Ethereum Faces Price Drop Amid Market Challenges With the broader cryptocurrency market facing challenges, Ethereum (ETH) is losing its charm. Its price recently dipped below $3,300, reflecting a bearish sentiment among investors. Despite these hurdles, Ethereum's future remains promising, especially with the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). If approved, these ETFs could clear the way for substantial institutional investors, impacting Ethereum's value in the coming years. Ethereum is currently struggling to maintain upward momentum. Its failure to stay above the $3,400 mark has raised concerns among traders. This price drop is largely due to decreased demand from long-term holders and a reduction in funds flowing into Ethereum-based investment products. Now testing key support levels, Ethereum might face additional losses if it cannot stay above current levels. However, there remains hope for Ethereum's long-term prospects. The approval of Ethereum ETFs could attract major institutional investments, likely boosting Ethereum's value. Analysts suggest that as more investors get on board, if institutional access becomes easier, Ethereum's price could soar once again. Even though Ethereum is experiencing temporary setbacks, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs might serve as a catalyst for future growth. Investors should keep an eye on these developments, as they could influence Ethereum's performance in the upcoming months and years. RTX Poised for Significant Growth in the 2025 Bull Market For those seeking a potential cryptocurrency investment, RTX is worth watching. As the cryptocurrency landscape expands, RTX is gaining traction due to its capability to solve critical issues in the $180 trillion cross-border payment industry. This sector, which deals with international money transfers, can be slow and costly. Remittix aims to revolutionize this by enabling faster, cheaper, and more secure payments through blockchain technology. The Remittix platform allows users to send money directly to bank accounts worldwide. With rapid transfers and no hidden fees, it converts over forty different cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies like dollars or euros, making it a more affordable option than traditional banking systems. Through the Remittix Pay API, businesses can also accept cryptocurrency payments and convert them into fiat, offering a straightforward way to manage digital assets. The $RTX token is at the core of Remittix's platform. It is essential for staking, governance, and earning platform rewards. The token's limited total supply of around 1.5 billion adds to its demand and exclusivity. Currently priced at $0.0297 during the presale stage, the RTX token presents an excellent investment opportunity. Experts predict the token could see a 25x increase during the presale and over 1,500% gains post-launch. RTX presents a strong choice for those looking to invest in the top coins to buy now or the best coin to invest in today. It is expected to see a significant increase in value during the 2025 bull run, thanks to its innovative solution to a major global issue.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) says the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) has closed Pulaski Savings Bank. The FDIC has been appointed as the receiver and has transferred all deposit accounts and most of the bank‚Äôs assets to Millennium Bank. The FDIC says it will have to pay about $28.5 million from its Deposit Insurance Fund to cover the cost of the failure, pointing to ‚Äúsuspected fraud‚Äù as the primary factor driving the expense.

The US witnessed two bank failures last year, starting with the closure of Republic First Bank in April, which had $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits.

Key Bitcoin Investors Have Been In Accumulation Mode Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the total number of sharks on the Bitcoin network has registered an increase recently. The indicator of relevance here is the ‚ÄúSupply Distribution,‚Äù which tells us about the amount of BTC wallets that belong to a particular group. Addresses or investors are categorized into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. For example, wallets holding 5 tokens are put into the 1 to 10 coins group. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Hits 60-Day Low: Is This Bullish? In the context of the current topic, the wallet range of interest is 100 to 1,000 BTC. At the current exchange rate, the lower end of the range converts to $10.5 million and the upper one to $105 million. Thus, the only addresses that would qualify for the cohort would be the ones belonging to the large traders. This group is popularly known as the sharks. The sharks are certainly not the largest entities on the network‚Äîthat title belongs to the whales‚Äîbut they are still influential due to their notable holdings. Below is the chart for the Bitcoin Supply Distribution shared by the analytics firm, which shows the data for these key investors over the last few months. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for the 100 to 1,000 coins group saw a sharp upwards trajectory during the last few weeks of 2024, implying a large amount of new shark-sized investors popped up on the network. The growth in the indicator has significantly slowed down this year, but it has nonetheless continued as the metric‚Äôs value has just set a new record of 15,777 addresses. Bitcoin has seen a pause in its bull run recently, so to see the sharks still be interested in buying the asset could naturally be a positive sign for things to come in the near future. The sharks haven‚Äôt been the only investors accumulating recently, as the analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out that the shrimps and crabs have also been seeing positive flows. The shrimps and crabs refer to the Bitcoin investors owning up to 1 and 10 BTC, respectively. As is apparent from the chart, these small entities have combined bought 25,600 BTC during the past month, which is equivalent to 1.9x the Monthly Issuance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capital Inflows See Notable Slowdown, But Is This A Worry? The Monthly Issuance is the amount that miners have produced/mined over the last 30 days. Thus, it would appear that the retail investors have been absorbing almost twice as much supply as the miners have been minting. BTC Price Bitcoin has been moving sideways over the last few days as its price is still floating around the $105,100 level.

The market offers everything from well-known players like Solana to trendy meme coins such as Pepe. However, there's a new contender making waves for all the right reasons. Remittix, a crypto-to-fiat payment service, is transforming how cryptocurrencies interact with traditional banking systems. Remittix‚Äôs presale has already raked in over $5.6 million, with projections to soar by 100x. This impressive growth sets it apart from other altcoins, leading top crypto analysts to consider it the most promising altcoin emerging from the market this year. Solana: A Dominant Force in Blockchain Solana is often mentioned in discussions about blockchain leaders, and for good reason. It has become a go-to platform for developers focused on DeFi and dApp projects, thanks to its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low costs. One of the standout features of Solana is its ability to scale without compromising security. The platform has recently explored a deflationary model to boost its network's sustainability and efficiency. Leveraging Solaxy‚Äôs layer-2 solutions, Solana has improved its ecosystem, attracting both institutional investors and retail traders. Yet, challenges remain. High gas fees during peak times and network congestion have been points of contention. While Solana remains one of the top altcoins to watch, these issues might open doors for newer and innovative projects like Remittix. Pepe: The Resilient Meme Coin Pepe has made a name for itself in the meme coin arena. What started as a playful, community-driven token has grown into a formidable presence in the crypto market. Gaining traction after its listing on major exchanges like Coinbase, Pepe‚Äôs value saw a surge in December 2024. The appeal of Pepe is undeniable, but so is its famous volatility. Recently, the token has struggled to maintain its momentum, testing significant support levels. This performance is typical for meme coins, which often prioritize hype and community engagement over utility. This is why major investors and everyday users seek the stability that Remittix provides . Remittix: Transforming Crypto-to-Fiat Transactions Unlike Solana and Pepe, Remittix is not just another blockchain or meme coin. It's redefining how cryptocurrency is used practically. With over 295 million tokens sold, Remittix‚Äôs presale has already amassed over $5.6 million, and the excitement continues to build. So what makes Remittix stand out? Its main focus is simplifying crypto-to-fiat conversions. Whether you're a business looking to accept crypto payments or an individual sending money internationally, Remittix has you covered. Users can convert over 40 cryptocurrencies directly into fiat, transferring funds to any bank account globally. And the best part? There are no hidden fees, ensuring you know exactly what you're paying. Why Remittix Stands Out: ‚óè Innovation: Remittix provides unmatched convenience in bridging traditional finance with cryptocurrency.‚óè Transparency: A comprehensive smart contract audit has confirmed the system‚Äôs reliability, instilling trust.‚óè Accessibility: Supporting over 50 crypto pairs and more than 30 fiat currencies, it offers a truly global solution.‚óè Future Plans: Post-presale, Remittix aims to list on Uniswap and major centralized exchanges to ensure high liquidity and adoption. These aspects have led analysts to highlight Remittix as one of the top altcoins to monitor. Remittix Emerges as the Leader While both Solana and Pepe have their strengths, Remittix stands out as the most promising investment for 2025. Its innovative take on crypto-to-fiat exchanges, coupled with transparency and a global reach, could revolutionize how cryptocurrencies are perceived in everyday life. Remittix should be at the top of your list if you're scouting for the best cryptocurrencies to keep tabs on.

Sun‚Äôs Vision For The Ethereum Price In a recent social post on X (formerly Twitter), Sun proposed a plan that he believes could propel the Ethereum price to unprecedented heights, targeting a price of $10,000. Sun‚Äôs strategy hinges on a radical overhaul of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) and the Ethereum protocol itself. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Reserve: Eric Trump‚Äôs Deleted Tweet Raises Eyebrows The TRON founder asserts that under his leadership, immediate and decisive actions could almost double the current price peak for ETH. One of his primary proposals is to halt the sale of ETH for a minimum of three years. By doing so, Sun aims to stabilize the currency‚Äôs supply and bolster market confidence. To cover operational costs during this period, Sun suggests leveraging Aave (AAVE) lending, staking yields, and stablecoin borrowing, thereby ensuring that the ETH supply remains intact while aligning with deflationary goals. In addition to halting sales, Sun proposes imposing significant taxes on Layer 2 (L2) projects. He believes this move could generate at least $5 billion annually for Ethereum, either in stablecoins or tokens. The revenue from these taxes would be utilized to repurchase and burn ETH in a decentralized manner, further enhancing scarcity and potentially driving up demand. Major Staff Cuts To Transform Ethereum Foundation Into Meritocracy In his social media post, Sun also emphasized the need to streamline operations within the Ethereum Foundation. He suggests a significant reduction in staff, retaining only the most capable team members. Those who remain would receive substantial salary increases, transitioning the Ethereum Foundation into a merit-based organization that rewards high performance. Furthermore, the TRON founder calls for adjustments in node rewards and a stronger focus on fee-burning mechanisms. By reducing node rewards, Sun believes Ethereum can solidify its deflationary status, reinforcing its position as a store of value. Related Reading: Cardano Will Reach $1.50 Once The $1.10 Resistance Breaks ‚Äì Details The focus, according to Sun, would shift exclusively toward Layer 1 (L1) development, prioritizing scalability, security, and broader adoption. Sun is confident that these initiatives could lead the Ethereum price to surpass $4,500 within the first week of implementation, laying the groundwork for long-term success. While this only represents Sun‚Äôs vision for the Ethereum price, any of these proposals, if viable for driving another leg up of the altcoin, could ultimately be adopted by the co-founders or the developers of the platform. As of this writing, the Ethereum price hovers around the $3,200 mark, reflecting a loss of 4% over the past 24 hours. This decline has widened the gap between the current price and its ATH of $4,878, representing a difference of 34.5%.

39425018,https://coinpedia.org/?p=410164,1737772467,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,XRP Price Prediction For January 25,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-january-25/,"The post XRP Price Prediction For January 25 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In recent market movements, XRP has seen mixed price action and is down by more than four percent on the weekly chart. At press time, XRP is trading at $3.12 and has slightly drifted to the green zone. The Key Scenario: Price Expected to Reach New Highs There is a scenario where XRP could make one more move to the upside before a potential shift in trend. As of now, the price is expected to rise, potentially reaching a new peak. However, the crucial question remains: will this push higher lead to further gains, or will it mark the peak of the rally before a correction begins? After a five-phase pattern, a major top or larger correction typically follows, signaling increased risk. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a bearish trend, but the current rally could be nearing its end. Potential Breakout Targets: Where Could the Price Head Next? On the smaller time frame, XRP is facing resistance at its all-time high of $3.30. A breakout above this level could see the price surge towards new targets, including $4.19, $5, and possibly even $6.61. XRP recently completed an internal triangle pattern, which broke out to the upside on January 13 . However, the price failed to break above its all-time high and has since entered a consolidation phase. There is no clear breakout signal at the moment, and the price is holding above key support levels between $2.52 and $2.94. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP vs. Bitcoin: Is Ripple Lobbying Against U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? CEO Reacts , These support levels have been respected multiple times, and the price recently reacted to the $2.81 level, which represents a 50% retracement. The expectation remains for a continuation to higher prices, with potential moves to $4.90 or even $5. However, it‚Äôs also possible that XRP may form another low before continuing upwards. Traders should watch for a breakout above $3.30‚Äì$3.40 to confirm the continuation of the bullish trend. Until that happens, a pullback to the lower support levels remains a possibility. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin Whales Start Accumulating As Trump Era Begins,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/inauguration-effect-bitcoin-whales-start-accumulating-as-trump-era-begins/,"Following Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration on January 20th, Bitcoin (BTC) has remained range-bound, trading between $101,000 to $110,000. However, a new report by CryptoQuant states that behind this routine price action, Bitcoin ‚Äòwhales‚Äô are quietly back to accumulating the premier cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Whales Back In Accumulation Mode According to the report, large BTC holders ‚Äì commonly referred to as Bitcoin ‚Äòwhales‚Äô ‚Äì have re-entered the accumulation phase. Recent data shows a significant uptick in the monthly percentage growth of BTC holdings among these large investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast Of $150,000 ‚ÄòToo Low‚Äô Amid Rising Adoption, Crypto Trader Says Notably, Bitcoin whale holdings increased from a decline of -0.25% on January 14 to a growth of 2% by January 17, marking the highest monthly growth rate since mid-December. In absolute terms, these investors‚Äô BTC holdings rose from 16.2 million on November 4 to 16.4 million as of January 24. The surge in whale accumulation appears to be driven by several bullish developments early in Trump‚Äôs administration. For example, the US president has already signed an executive order establishing a Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. This Working Group has been tasked with proposing a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies ‚Äì including stablecoins ‚Äì within six months. Additionally, the group will evaluate the potential creation of a national digital asset stockpile, fueling speculation about a potential US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Besides growth in whale holdings, selling pressure for BTC has declined sharply since major profit-taking in December. This aligns with a recent report which found that BTC profit-taking has dropped by 93% from its December peak. The report reads: Bitcoin holders realized daily profits as high as $10 billion as Bitcoin approached $100K in December. However, daily realized profits have fallen to levels around $2-$3 billion in January, which indicates market participants may have finished selling Bitcoin for the most part. Moreover, the traders‚Äô unrealized profit margins have declined near zero, a level which typically marks a price floor during bull markets. However, the report also highlights that overall Bitcoin spot demand has weakened over the past month, raising concerns about the likelihood of another bullish rally. Specifically, the rate of demand growth for Bitcoin has fallen from 279,000 BTC in early December to just 75,000 BTC at the time of writing. Analysts Confident Of Another BTC Rally Despite the cooling of on-chain demand, crypto analysts remain optimistic about another major price rally for Bitcoin. For instance, a recent report suggested that BTC could target a price as high as $249,000 during Trump‚Äôs presidency. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Hit Its Peak In Summer 2025? Analysts Weigh In Another report by Bitfinex predicted that BTC is likely headed to $200,000 by mid-year amid mild price pullbacks. However, a lot depends on how the US Federal Reserve handles interest rate adjustments this year. From a technical standpoint, BTC‚Äôs cup-and-handle pattern projects a price target of as high as $275,000. At press time, BTC trades at $106,074, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

CEO Reacts,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-vs-bitcoin-is-ripple-lobbying-against-u-s-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-ceo-reacts/,"The post XRP vs. Bitcoin: Is Ripple Lobbying Against U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? CEO Reacts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is climbing towards new all-time highs , with a major breakout on the horizon. A key driver of this upward momentum is a recent executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President which includes the creation of a U.S. government Bitcoin Reserve . This move has raised excitement in the crypto world, particularly for Bitcoin enthusiasts. However, amidst the Bitcoin Reserve news, XRP is facing a lot of heat on social media. Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot Platforms, has claimed that the biggest challenge to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) isn‚Äôt the Fed, Treasury, or banks‚Äîit‚Äôs Ripple. Rochard argues that Ripple is spending millions of dollars lobbying politicians to block the SBR, fearing it could hurt their marketing narrative and push their own agenda for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For January 25 , Ripple-Bitcoin Clash Heats Up Rochard even accused Ripple of trying to sabotage Bitcoin mining under the Biden administration and said Ripple has now ‚Äúdeclared war‚Äù by attempting to block the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to him, Ripple should have focused on its own business and not interfered with the SBR. Face the facts: Ripple / XRP has been the leading source of anti-bitcoin misinformation for more than a decade. They have aggressively lobbied policymakers around the world to try to ban bitcoin mining. Weaponizing woke ESG narratives to promote their centralized token, Rochard said.

In a new video on the state of the markets, pseudonymous analysts DonAlt and Cred say the launch of Trump‚Äôs official memecoin (TRUMP) potentially squandered a massive fortune for the 47th President. After its initial launch on January 17th, TRUMP soared to a $72 billion fully diluted market cap in a couple of days, making it among the top 20 crypto assets in existence ‚Äì with Trump and his affiliates holding 80% of the supply. Then, Trump abruptly launched a second official coin called MELANIA, which triggered an immediate crash in the price of TRUMP as investors realized their coins can essentially be diluted by new Trump family tokens. Crypto trader Cred says the move hammered the seemingly unstoppable rise of TRUMP. ‚ÄúIt feels like one of the worst decisions of modern financial history, not to be too hyperbolic about it. But if you look at like how much it went up, how quickly it got to the tens of billions in market cap. The liquidity that was there. The attention. The mind share. It was literally cannibalizing the entirety of the market and you spawned it out of nowhere and then you just fumble that on a Melania coin.‚Äù Fellow trader DonAlt says he agrees, warning that Trump and his team‚Äôs 80% allocation will be unlocked over time, potentially hitting the open market. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying this is going to go to zero anytime soon. I think if anything is probably going to just stabilize and bleed over a while. But I would not want to hold anywhere close to the unlocks because I mean just by the way that they launched Melania coin I‚Äôm like 90% certain that you‚Äôre going to get dumped on your head.‚Äù TRUMP has now dropped from an all-time high of $72.62 on January 19th to $29.43 at time of publishing. The level of involvement that Trump directly had in the launches of both coins ‚Äì which are attributed to the Trump-affiliated organizations CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC ‚Äì is debatable. When asked about his new memecoin two days ago, Trump said he wasn‚Äôt closely following its progress. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know much about it other than I launched it. I heard it was very successful. I haven‚Äôt checked it.‚Äù Although his memecoins may have faltered, many in the industry are celebrating a number of Trump-fueled digital asset developments this week. On Thursday, President Trump signed an executive order to analyze the creation of a government-held strategic crypto reserve, prohibit the development of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and promote stablecoins. Trump‚Äôs new leadership at the SEC also eliminated a controversial accounting guideline that effectively prevented banks from holding crypto assets on behalf of their customers.

Data analyzed by the on-chain intelligence firm CryptoQuant now shows that Official Trump (TRUMP) has recorded roughly $38 billion in total trading volume across centralized crypto exchanges since its release on January 17. The token‚Äôs spot trading volume topped $17 billion on January 19; however, the recent figure indicates that the volume has almost doubled over the past few days. The TRUMP Pump CryptoQuant found that the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Binance, dominated the spot trading volume with $16 billion, while other platforms like OKX and Bybit followed suit with $7 billion and $6 billion, respectively. The Trump meme was promoted as a cryptocurrency created to express support for and engagement with Trump‚Äôs beliefs and ideals. These coins exist on the Solana blockchain, and 200 million TRUMP are currently in circulation, with the total supply expected to grow to one billion over the next three years. Less than two days after its launch, TRUMP became one of the top 20 altcoins on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap (now at number 25), with a market cap of nearly $15 billion. The rally also made the token the second-biggest meme coin, trailing behind Dogecoin (DOGE). Official Trump‚Äôs pump had never been seen before in the crypto space, so during the next few days after its launch, it ranked as the top trending token across the entire sector. Significant Correction Amid the growth in Official Trump‚Äôs market cap and spot trading volume, the token‚Äôs price skyrocketed from 0 to $72 in less than 48 hours. Although the meme coin‚Äôs price had corrected significantly by the time of writing, and it was trading at $35.88 on CoinMarketCap, TRUMP is still up more than 450% from its January 18 trading price of $7. Noteworthily, Official Trump‚Äôs market cap now hovers around $7.18 billion, and analysts have attributed this drop in price and market cap to the launch of MELANIA, a competing meme coin by First Lady Melania Trump. Interestingly, President Trump attempted to downplay the success of TRUMP at a press briefing a day after his inauguration; however, it cannot be denied that the memecoin‚Äôs pump created new crypto millionaires overnight.

Companies like grayscale Investment grayscale Investment - Investment platform and CoinShares are leading the charge, targeting popular altcoins such as Litecoin, XRP, and Solana. But with the SEC‚Äôs response still hanging in the balance and a major shift in government leadership, could 2025 be the year these crypto ETFs finally break through? Grayscale‚Äôs New ETF Filings Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, recently pointed out a key development on Twitter. He noted that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) had filed a 19b-4 form to list and trade Grayscale‚Äôs Litecoin Trust. This is an effort to address issues that have caused problems for crypto investments in the past, like ensuring better security and clearer rules around custody. The proposed Litecoin ETF would track the price of Litecoin, allowing investors to benefit from its price movement without needing to actually own the coins. This is a step up from Grayscale‚Äôs existing Litecoin Trust and could make it easier for investors to gain exposure to Litecoin without the usual complications. Solana ETF Waiting for SEC Decision Grayscale is also working to convert its Grayscale Solana Trust into a Solana ETF. The SEC was expected to make a decision on this proposal by January 23, 2025, but there has been no public comment yet. The delay might mean that the SEC is taking extra time to review the proposal, possibly under new guidelines or a fresh perspective. CoinShares Joins the Race: New ETFs for Litecoin and XRP! Not far behind, CoinShares has filed for two new ETFs ‚Äîone focused on Litecoin and another on XRP. CoinShares hopes to make it easier for more people to invest in crypto by offering these funds, which aim to bring crypto closer to traditional investment products. Other companies, like Bitwise, ProShares, WisdomTree, and REX Shares, are also filing for XRP ETFs. This shows that there‚Äôs a growing demand for these types of investment products. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : BlackRock‚Äôs New Filling For In-Kind Bitcoin ETF Redemption About to Change BTC ETF ERA , Regulations Are Shifting! These ETF filings are happening during a time of change in the U.S. government. With President Trump taking office on January 20, 2025, many believe the SEC could take a more crypto-friendly approach. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently stepped down, and President Trump appointed Paul Atkins , a former regulator who has supported cryptocurrencies, to lead the SEC. This shift could have a big impact on the future of crypto ETFs. Price Analysis: XRP, LTC, SOL Despite the excitement around the ETF filings, market reactions have been mixed. XRP, one of the top cryptocurrencies, is holding steady at around $3.13, with the potential to break out of its consolidation phase. Litecoin saw a strong price increase, rising to $125‚Äîa 9% jump in just one day‚Äîbringing its market cap to $9.4 billion. Meanwhile, Solana is trading steadily around $252, showing stability in the market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Executive order The narrative U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn into office on Monday and quickly signed a flurry of executive orders. While it took him a few days to get to crypto-specific items, we've seen a number of actions from his administration already ‚Äî not to mention the broader Republican Party. Why it matters These agencies and Congressional bodies' initial actions set the tone for what we can expect as the new Congress and administration really get going this year. Breaking it down There'll be time to go more into detail on some of these later, but for now: White House/Administration Donald Trump signed a highly-anticipated executive order on crypto. Among its provisions are items that: Create a working group composed of Cabinet officials, White House advisers and others tasked with identifying regulations that address crypto and recommending whether they be changed. AI and crypto czar David Sacks will chair this working group. Task the working group with evaluating a digital asset stockpile. Ban any central bank digital currency, with a somewhat broad definition of a CBDC. Revoke former President Joe Biden's executive order on crypto, which mostly just directed his Departments to craft reports about various aspects of crypto and consumer protections. Trump also announced that Sacks would co-chair his President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, now operating under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda , formed a crypto-focused task force headed up by Commissioner Hester Peirce. Trump previously named Paul Atkins as his pick to serve as the agency's chair, once he's confirmed by the Senate. One of the SEC's first moves was to rescind Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 , which directed publicly traded companies holding crypto for their clients to mark those holdings on their own balance sheets. SAB 121 was strongly opposed by the crypto industry, which argued that it made it more difficult for banks to provide certain crypto services. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is now operating under Acting Chair Caroline Pham . Pham named CFTC Senior Policy Advisor Harry Jung as the regulator's lead for crypto industry engagement . Trump has not yet named a nominee to take over as permanent chair. Trump pardoned Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht , saying on Truth Social that he did so ""in honor of [Ulbricht's mother] and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly."" Ulbricht was convicted on criminal enterprise, narcotics distribution and various conspiracy charges and sentenced to double life in prison and 40 years with no parole. Trump announced he would rename the existing U.S. Digital Service as his Department of Government Efficiency, the entity headed up by Elon Musk (Vivek Ramaswamy, who was previously a co-head, has now left to run for Ohio governor). Initially, the entity's website just had the Dogecoin logo on it. Companies are also filing for dogecoin exchange-traded funds now. Trump spoke with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele shortly after signing his crypto executive order, though an official readout of the call did not mention crypto in any form. Senate The Senate Banking Committee has confirmed the creation of a subcommittee focused on digital assets , led by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.). The subcommittee's other members include freshmen Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), who unseated former Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) with $40 million worth of support from crypto political action committee Fairshake, Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who received $10 million worth of support and Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), among others. The Banking Committee is also holding a hearing on Feb. 5, though the specific time and witness list have yet to be announced. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) introduced a joint Congressional Review Act resolution alongside House Rep. Mike Carey (R-Ohio) to overturn the IRS' recent crypto broker rule. The rule, finalized late last month , defines the term ""broker"" for IRS tax reporting purposes, but has already drawn a lawsuit from the Blockchain Association. The industry lobbyists argue the final rule ""puts unlawful compliance burdens on software developers."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the new lead Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, is also asking the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to look into the TRUMP token. She sent an open letter co-signed by Massachusetts Representative Jake Auchincloss. House of Representatives The House Oversight Committee sent out a letter announcing it would investigate whether banks de-banked crypto companies at the government's behest. The House Financial Services Committee has already scheduled two hearings on crypto next month. The first, on Feb. 6, 2025, will focus on the aforementioned debanking. The second, set for Feb. 11, is titled ""A Golden Age of Digital Assets: Charting a Path Forward."" The leading Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Gerry Connelly, asked the panel's leading Republican, Rep. James Comer, to probe Trump's issuance of the TRUMP coin and his ties to World Liberty Financial .

While Bitcoin‚Äôs price held at the $104K level as the week came to a close, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP also managed to prevent major dips. Simultaneously, the global crypto market cap jumped nearly 1% over the past day to rest at $3.58 trillion on Saturday. However, traders appear to be cautious amid the broader market turbulence, as flagged by a 34% decrease in the intraday global market trading volume. Also, meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE hovered into the red zone today. AI coins such as NEAR, ICP, and FIL have followed, mimicking a waning action. So, let‚Äôs delve deeper into some of the most attention-nabbing cryptocurrencies for the day and their price movements on January 25. Crypto Market Today: Market Resilient As BTC, ETH, XRP Prevent Any Major Downfall Despite the broader market volatility brewing in recent days, Bitcoin and top assets have prevented major price downturns, although they are moving sideways and consolidating. Notably, BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL prices were down slightly by 1%-3% from yesterday. Meme coins also witnessed a fall of roughly 2% intraday. Also, the AI Coins sector saw NEAR, ICP, and FIL mimic a similar slumping action. Flagship Crypto At $104K Amid Broader Market Turbulence As of press time, BTC price indicated a nearly 1% drop in value and is resting at $104,240. The flagship crypto‚Äôs 24-hour low and high were $103,805.97 and $107,098.55, respectively. Looking at the broader price chart, it can be seen that the asset is currently moving sideways, flagging a consolidation period. Nevertheless, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance rose by 0.20% from yesterday, reaching 57.84%. Notably, the flagship crypto consolidates and prevents a fall despite $1.24 billion worth of inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, as per weekly data by SosoValue for Jan 23. Crypto market watchers continue to monitor the token for further price shifts amid market uncertainty. Ethereum Price At $3,300 Level ETH price witnessed a 3% dip at the time of reporting and was trading at $3,288. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs 24-hour low and high were $3,270.27 and $3,424.90, respectively. Even the broader price chart for Ethereum underscores a period of consolidation. This sideways trading session comes despite $130.14 million weekly inflows into the Ethereum ETFs as of Jan 23. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has recently posted on X, revealing that whales purchased over 1.14 million ETH in the last 48 hours. Nevertheless, traders and investors appear to be unsure of future movements amid the broader market turbulence. XRP Price Above $3 XRP price also witnessed a fall of nearly 2% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $3.13. The Ripple-backed crypto‚Äôs intraday low and high were $3.09 and $3.20, respectively. Intriguingly, XRP appears to be mimicking the broader market trend, with its weekly chart pointing to a consolidation. Solana Price Holds Above $250 Further, SOL price witnessed a substantial 6% decrease as of press time, resting at $249. The coin‚Äôs 24-hour low and high were $248.35 and $269.81, respectively. Market watchers continue to eye the token amid broader developments, such as stablecoin giant Circle‚Äôs constant minting of USDC on the Solana network. Lookonchain revealed on Saturday that Circle minted another 250 million USDC on the network. Meme Crypto Market Shows Potential Simultaneously, DOGE price witnessed a nearly 3% price drop in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.3484. SHIB price saw a slump of over 2% in value intraday, reaching $0.00001987. Also, PEPE price tanked by 4% over the past day and is sitting at $0.00001497. Besides, other tokens such as TRUMP, BONK, and PENGU have also traded dominantly in the red zone today. AI Cryptos Pump Leading AI coins have witnessed remarkable price dips intraday. NEAR price cracked nearly 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $4.88. Further, ICP price also followed, down by 3% to $9. Moreover, FIL price slipped over 2% to reach $4.99. Overall, the AI cryptocurrency market has raised severe concerns as it showcased a bearish action in line with the broader market turbulence.

Notably, this bearish prediction comes against the backdrop of the rising number of alt projects in the market, which appears to have impacted the supply dynamics. Ali states that ‚Äútoday, there are over 36.4 million altcoins, compared to fewer than 3,000 altcoins during the 2017-2018 alt season and even fewer than 500 altcoins in 2013-2014.‚Äù As a result, speculations of no alts season have also prevailed across the sector.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Small crypto investments, starting at $250 in coins valued at $0.20, can potentially grow to $8,000 with high-return assets. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Changing real-world assets Floki Inu: A rising meme coin Conclusion One of the best ways to gain significantly in the crypto market is to invest money into several cryptocurrencies. Still, small investors can invest as little as $250 and get as much as $8000 by choosing coins with great potential for high returns. With the lowest coins value of $0.2, these could be the leading choices to boost $250 investment to $8000. Rexas Finance: Changing real-world assets Rexas Finance is creating waves with its creative approach to tokenizing real-world assets (RWA). The platform breaks down assets into fractional units. As a result, small investors can own assets that were once reserved for the wealthy. Such assets include real estate, intellectual property, and artworks. Rexas Finance‚Äôs main feature is the Rexas Token Builder, which allows users to tokenize their assets easily. Owners can convert their holdings into digital tokens representing fractional ownership, whether a small parcel of land or an art piece. For instance, if someone owns property and needs funds, they can tokenize part of it and sell shares to investors worldwide. This removes complex paperwork and democratizes asset ownership. Additionally, the Rexas Launchpad facilitates fundraising for tokenized assets. Assets owners can find investors on the platform, making it easy to raise funds. If they need capital to renovate a luxury apartment, they can offer fractional ownership through Launchpad. Investors gain a stake in high-value assets while they secure the resources they need. The platform also shines with Rexas Estate, changing real estate investment. Typically, owning real estate requires significant capital, but Rexas Estate enables fractional ownership via digital tokens. This makes investing in commercial buildings or luxury condos possible without needing millions. Furthermore, these tokens are tradeable, offering liquidity similar to stocks. Rexas Finance extends beyond tokenization with decentralized finance (DeFi) utilities, including staking and yield farming. RXS token holders can stake or provide liquidity, earning rewards over time. These features encourage long-term holding and allow users to grow their investments passively. Its presale phase has already been a huge success, and it is currently in its eleventh presale stage after selling over 408 million out of 425 million RXS tokens. It is trading at $0.175, and crypto experts speculate it will hit $8 after its launch ‚Äî about a 3,900% rise from its current price ‚Äî which is more than enough to turn $250 to $8000. You might also like: Rexas Finance the next Shiba Inu: Why $1000 could hit $50000 by mid-2025 Floki Inu: A rising meme coin Floki Inu is another coin under $0.2 with great potential to turn $250 into $800. Top analysts, including Master Kenobi, predict a significant rally for FLOKI this month. The coin currently sits at $0.0001650, and Kenobi identifies $0.00021 and $0.00028 as key levels to watch before it reaches its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00035. From there, FLOKI could skyrocket to $0.0011, offering a stunning significant return. Technical indicators and ecosystem updates back FLOKI‚Äôs momentum. Analysts like Bluntz note that the coin has completed an ABC correction, a bullish signal often triggering a five-wave upward trend. Furthermore, the coin mirrors PEPE ‚Äòs past price pattern, which saw a 588% gain in 2024. This historical similarity suggests FLOKI could follow suit, riding a delayed but powerful wave of market interest. FLOKI is also gaining momentum because of its ecosystem developments. Its flagship metaverse game, Valhalla, is set to launch soon. The game will introduce play-to-earn features that could drive user adoption. Additionally, FLOKI is on track to release an Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) on the SIX Swiss Exchange in Q1 2025, making it only the second meme coin after Dogecoin to achieve this milestone. This ETP is expected to attract institutional investors, further fueling price rallies. With FLOKI showing strong support levels and increasing mid-term holders, it is poised for a breakout. Whether through retail interest or ecosystem growth, this coin could transform small investments into substantial returns. Conclusion Rexas Finance and Floki Inu are two coins below $0.2 that have the potential to grow a $250 investment into $8,000. Rexas Finance stands out because it is a new cryptocurrency. It has the potential to surge after its launch and yield significant returns for early investors who adopt the coin.

This could benefit the price in the short term, although the long-term consequences could be severe. The greed phase suggests that long-term Bitcoin holders are now excessively optimistic about BTC‚Äôs future trajectory. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Officially Enter Into Greed Territory In an X post, Martinez stated that long-term Bitcoin holders, having experienced every phase of the market cycle, are now letting greed take over. In terms of market sentiment, these holders have moved from capitulation to hope, optimism, and then belief and are now in the greed phase. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash To $99,000, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs Supposed To Happen Next This excessive optimism typically leads these investors to accumulate more BTC impulsively without considering rational analyses. In the short term, this greed phase is bullish for the Bitcoin price since this market sentiment could spark more buying pressure and drive the flagship crypto higher. This buying pressure for Bitcoin already looks to be evident as on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that the number of wallets holding 100 to 1,000 BTC has broken an all-time high (ATH), rising to 15,777 wallets. The platform also mentioned that Bitcoin whales peaked up steam this week with the US inauguration and a new BTC ATH as transactions exceeding $100,00 surged to their highest level in six weeks. This greed phase is good for the BTC price, as it could continue to send the flagship crypto to new highs. However, in the long term, this excessive optimism could put BTC in overbought territory, eventually sparking a massive wave of sell-offs that would send the Bitcoin price tumbling. This greed phase among Bitcoin long-term holders looks to be sparked by optimism around Donald Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto administration and the strategic BTC reserve especially. This still poses a risk for the Bitcoin price since the flagship crypto could be trading well above its actual value if the BTC reserve isn‚Äôt eventually created. What Needs To Happen For BTC To Stay Bullish In another X post, Ali Martinez warned that the Bitcoin price needs to stay above $97,530 to remain bullish. According to him, this price level is the key support level to watch for BTC, as holding above it is crucial to maintaining the current bullish momentum. Bitcoin is currently consolidating around this range after hitting a new ATH of $109,000 earlier this week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims For $150,000-$170,000 With Wave Formation, Here Are The Details Meanwhile, crypto analyst Crypto Rover highlighted the $102,000 support area as the most important for the BTC price right now. His accompanying chart showed that the flagship crypto could drop to as low as $98,000 if it drops below this support level. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $104,900, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The CFPB alleges Capital One misled consumers into believing that its product known as ‚Äú360 Savings‚Äù was offering the best and the highest interest rates in the US. The CFPB, however, says Capital One kept the interest rates on the 360 Savings account low even as they were rising across the country. In the process, ‚ÄúCapital One avoided paying more than $2 billion in additional interest to millions of customers because of these actions.‚Äù While marketing the 360 Savings account as offering attractive rates, Capital One simultaneously launched a similarly named product that was promising significantly higher rates, according to the CFPB. ‚ÄúAround the same time, Capital One created a virtually identical product, ‚Äú360 Performance Savings,‚Äù that differed from 360 Savings only in that it paid out substantially more in interest‚Äîat one point more than 14 times the 360 Savings rate. Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts.‚Äù CFPB says that Capital One deliberately took steps to prevent 360 Savings account holders from finding out about the 360 Performance Savings account. ‚ÄúFor example, Capital One named and marketed the two products similarly; it eliminated nearly all references to the 360 Savings account product on its website and replaced them with references to the essentially identical 360 Performance Savings account, without notice that 360 Savings continued to exist as a distinct product; it excluded 360 Savings account holders from a marketing campaign advertising 360 Performance Savings to Capital One‚Äôs other existing customers; and it forbade its employees from proactively telling 360 Savings account holders about 360 Performance Savings.‚Äù The lawsuit seeks to stop Capital One‚Äôs alleged unlawful conduct and offer compensation to harmed consumers if successful. The financial regulator‚Äôs director, Rohit Chopra, says, ‚ÄúThe CFPB is suing Capital One for cheating families out of billions of dollars on their savings accounts. Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can‚Äôt live up to.‚Äù Capital One boasts a little over $483 billion in total assets as of September 30th of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve.

This change would permit an ‚Äúin-kind creation and redemption,‚Äù but only for a select group of Authorized Participants (APs), not for individual investors. What does it Mean? BlackRock Files For In-Kind Redemption On Jan 24, a Nasdaq submitted a filing on behalf of BlackRock seeking to permit a new redemption model for the IBIT ETF. This model would allow Authorized Participants (APs) but not individual investors to redeem their shares for actual Bitcoin rather than cash. NEW: BlackRock/iShares just filed to allow in-kind creation and redemption on their Bitcoin ETF $IBIT pic.twitter.com/Hy0tIEK81h ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 If the rule change is approved, it would mark a significant change in the way Bitcoin ETFs are managed, offering greater efficiency and cost savings for APs. Currently, the standard redemption model involves cash transactions, but this process often comes with added costs, including bid/ask spreads and broker commissions. The new in-kind redemption model would eliminate these costs, making it a more streamlined and efficient process for institutional investors involved in the ETF. Why The Change Required? Bloomberg‚Äôs Senior ETF Analyst, James Seyffart, expressed his views on the recent filing, stating that BlackRock‚Äôs request should have been granted from the start, especially when the IBIT launched in early 2024 alongside other Bitcoin ETFs. According to Seyffart, this model is not only more efficient but also better for the long-term performance of the ETF. Another key reason behind this proposed change is its potential tax benefits. Chris J. Terry, Chief Architect at Bitseeker Consulting, noted that in-kind redemptions help minimize capital gains distributions for ETFs. By allowing shares to be exchanged for underlying assets, the fund becomes more tax-efficient, benefiting investors in the long run. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Grayscale and CoinShares Push for Altcoin ETFs: Litecoin, XRP, & Solana Next? , BlackRock‚Äôs BTC ETF Outperforms Expectations The move could also reflect blackrock blackrock - Fintech Solution Advisory Investment platform growing dominance in the Bitcoin ETF space.

With Ripple securing high-profile partnerships and driving adoption in key markets, some market participants suggest XRP could climb to $30. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , as a hybrid Layer-2 solution, might be setting the stage for new network upgrades on Bitcoin. By potentially expanding Bitcoin‚Äôs utility and introducing advanced functionalities, it may address some of the network‚Äôs most pressing limitations. Let‚Äôs take a closer look. Ripple‚Äôs ODL Expansion ‚Äì The Path to $30 XRP and the Future of Cross-Border Payments As of January 23, 2025, XRP is trading at $3.14, experiencing a slight decline of 1.26% from the previous close. The intraday high reached $3.27, with a low of $3.14. This minor dip follows a recent surge where XRP surpassed the $3 mark, influenced by investor optimism surrounding Ripple‚Äôs legal developments. Ripple‚Äôs On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) could be a major new upgrade for cross-border payments. It gets rid of the need for pre-funded accounts and makes transactions almost instant. ODL uses XRP as a bridge currency, making it easier and cheaper for financial institutions to convert currencies. From a technical analysis perspective, XRP has established a support level of around $3.00, with resistance observed near $3.50. The 50-day moving average is trending upwards, indicating sustained bullish momentum. Based on this analysis, it seems that breaking through the $3.50 resistance could create a rally towards $4.40, based on a Fibonacci extension pattern. Crypto Patel shared that XRP has just surpassed a $163 billion market cap, marking a 650% rise from its previous value of $0.42. The price hit an all-time high of $2.83, with experts predicting it could soon reach $3. The surge is driven by growing adoption, innovative features, and discussions around a potential ETF. He advises taking 70% profit while holding the remaining for the riskier ride ahead. Could PlutoChain‚Äôs Layer-2 Tech Upgrade Bitcoin with Smart Contracts and New Features? PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is building a Layer-2 solution that could improve Bitcoin‚Äôs capabilities. The goal is to potentially add smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) to Bitcoin, which has been limited by its slow 10-minute block time. This has made Bitcoin less useful for complex applications compared to faster networks like Ethereum or Solana. PlutoChain offers a block time of just 2 seconds on its own chain. This could allow developers to create high-performance dApps while still using Bitcoin‚Äôs secure network. Early testnet results show over 43,200 transactions per day, a good sign for real-world use. Another feature that could make PlutoChain stand out is its governance model. Rather than having a single authority make decisions, users can influence protocol updates, keeping the system decentralized and in tune with the community. It‚Äôs also been audited by trusted firms like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , adding credibility to its security. Additionally, PlutoChain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) , which could bring new opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and AI. It could unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin, turning it into more than just a store of value by adding smart contracts, dApps, and more. The Bottom Line Ripple‚Äôs ODL expansion may prepare XRP for significant growth, with the potential to reach $30 as it transforms cross-border payments. As Ripple continues to drive adoption and forge key partnerships, the future looks promising. At the same time, PlutoChain‚Äôs hybrid Layer-2 solution could enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs capabilities and overcome its transaction speed limitations. PlutoChain might bring a future where blockchain networks become more scalable, efficient, and widely adopted. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The information in this article does not represent financial or investment advice.

The levels made a history of reaching over $200 billion in monthly volume, which has not been achieved by any other network to date. This prompted the SOL price to rise above the consolidation it held in the past few days. However, the bears restricted the rally, suggesting the possibility of continuing the prevailing sluggish trend. SOL price again touched the pivotal resistance at $270 for the fifth time in the past few days, hinting towards the bulls being focused on elevating the levels beyond the consolidation. Meanwhile, the inefficiency is sustaining above the range, indicating the lack of strength, mainly due to a massive drop in the volume. Unfortunately, the technicals have also turned bearish, suggesting the beginning of a descending trend. Will the SOL price drop hard? Can the support at $240 offer the required base to trigger a rebound? After the recent rise from the bottom close to $175 to a new ATH above $295, the market participants turned highly optimistic over the next price action. Meanwhile, the rejection from the same resistance validates the strong presence of the bears that may have turned it extremely rigid. The STOCHRSI has reached the lower threshold, suggesting a rebound could be around the corner. However, the price is testing the crucial 50-day MA, breaking which could drag the levels below $240. Solana Network has become the most favorable platform for memecoins, which has dragged huge liquidity. However, considering the current price action, the hype remains for a short time frame, which badly impacts the SOL price later. Meanwhile, the push for Solana ETFs by big institutions has been making a huge noise, due to which the possibility of a bullish continuation remains higher.

Notably, the asset manager has filed to launch Litecoin ETF and Bitcoin Adapters ETF, which reflects the pro-crypto sentiment hovering in the market under Trump‚Äôs presidency. In other words, this latest move has fueled market optimism with experts predicting a massive breakout in Solana price ahead. Solana Price Eyes Rally Amid Grayscale Push To Launch SOL ETF Grayscale has recently filed with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to launch a Solana ETF in the US, gaining market attention. This filing from the asset manager highlights the growing optimism around crypto ETFs, fueled by a pro-crypto environment under the Trump administration. Besides, experts anticipate a potential rally in Solana price amid this latest development. Notably, Grayscale‚Äôs Solana Trust, the leading investment fund for SOL globally, holds approximately $134.2 million in assets. This accounts for about 0.1% of all Solana tokens in circulation. The firm‚Äôs recent filing aims to transform this Trust into a spot Solana ETF, allowing investors to trade on a regulated securities exchange. Meanwhile, the proposed ETF seeks to mirror the value of SOL held by the Trust, minus expenses, offering a secure and convenient investment option. While the Trust‚Äôs current structure doesn‚Äôt allow for direct SOL ownership, it provides a cost-effective alternative to traditional investments in digital assets. Notably, Coinbase Custody Trust Company is positioned as the Custodian, with BNY Mellon handling administrative responsibilities. Grayscale believes these measures will enhance investor confidence while experts anticipate a surge in Solana price. Pro-Crypto Sentiment Under Trump Sparks Optimism This latest Grayscale filing reflects the favorable crypto regulatory environment emerging under Trump‚Äôs presidency. This is evidenced by similar filings from other asset managers like CoinShares and Canary Capital. It‚Äôs worth noting that CoinShares has also recently filed for an XRP ETF launch with the US SEC. Analysts argue that these moves signify a broader acceptance of digital assets in traditional markets. On the other hand, the recent hint from Donald Trump about a crypto national reserve in the US has further fueled confidence in the top altcoins . Meanwhile, the trust operates as a Delaware statutory trust under agreements involving multiple prominent financial institutions. This structure is expected to offer an added layer of security and compliance for investors, potentially attracting institutional interest. Solana Price Breakout Imminent? Market experts predict Grayscale‚Äôs ETF filing could act as a catalyst for a significant Solana price breakout. As institutional interest in crypto grows, Solana could see increased adoption and investment inflows. Notably, sharing the Grayscale Solana ETF update on the X platform, top market analyst Ali Martinez has recently shared a bold forecast. Lauding the development, Martinez has reiterated his prediction for Solana price rally to $4,700, which has sparked market optimism. Source: Ali Martinez, X However, despite these positive developments, SOL price today was down 5% and traded at $247.33, with its trading volume falling 26% to $6.9 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $269, especially after Grayscale‚Äôs announcement. Further, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SOL stood at 61, indicating strong momentum ahead for the crypto. However, Solana Futures Open Interest fell 2% during writing, in tandem with the declining price of the asset.

Mayer Multiple Reveals When BTC Will Become ‚ÄòOverbought‚Äô",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-181000-mayer-multiple-btc-overbought/,"Bitcoin has still not become overbought according to the Mayer Multiple. Here‚Äôs the level BTC would need to breech in order to enter this territory. Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Has A Value Of 1.37 Right Now In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the Mayer Multiple for Bitcoin. The ‚ÄúMayer Multiple‚Äù here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between BTC‚Äôs spot price and its 200-day moving average (MA). As Glassnode explains, The 200DMA is a widely recognized tool for gauging macro bull or bear bias. The Mayer Multiple measures how far BTC is from this long-term average. When the Mayer Multiple has a value greater than 1, it means the price of the cryptocurrency is trading above its 200-day MA. On the other hand, it being under the mark implies the asset is below this historically important level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shark Wallets Set New Record: Bullish Foreshadowing For 2025? Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple over the last few years: Looks like the Mayer Multiple is greater than 1 right now | Source: Glassnode on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple has a value of 1.37 right now, which means that the asset has a notable distance over its 200-day MA. In the chart, Glassnode has also highlighted three lines where the spot price of BTC would assume a Mayer Multiple equal to a historically relevant value. The green level (bottom) corresponds to the indicator assuming a value of 0.8. BTC being under this level has generally signaled oversold conditions. The line is currently situated around $60,000, meaning that the asset would have to drop under this mark to arrive at the bottoming zone. The red level (top) is located at $181,000 right now. At this price mark, the cryptocurrency‚Äôs Mayer Multiple would reach a value of 2.4. Going beyond this level usually implies that the asset is becoming overbought. ‚ÄúAlthough BTC is above its 200DMA, it‚Äôs quite far from the overbought territory,‚Äù notes the analytics firm. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Hits 60-Day Low: Is This Bullish? Bitcoin would have to break the $181,000 level if it has to cross above this level in the current cycle. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the asset would breach the level in this cycle at all or if it would top out before it can happen. The last line in the graph, the blue one in the middle, is just the 200-day MA of the asset. That is, the line where the Mayer Multiple is exactly equal to 1. BTC dipped under this level for a while during the consolidation period last year. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $106,600, up almost 2% in the last seven days.

While top altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL) have delivered over 25% returns on the monthly chart, ETH is down by 4% testing investors‚Äô patience. As US President Donald Trump is pushing for a Fed rate cut ‚Äòimmediately,‚Äô investors are hopeful of an ETH recovery from here. Analysts Predict Ethereum Price Hitting $20,000 Prominent crypto analyst, CrediBULL Crypto, has expressed strong confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs (ETH) long-term price trajectory. He pointed to ‚Äúcrystal clear high time-frame price action‚Äù (HTF PA) as a key indicator for a major rally. In a recent post, the analyst noted that the current bearish market sentiment aligns perfectly with Ethereum‚Äôs strong technical setup. Furthermore, it also signals a potential comeback for ETH moving ahead. ‚ÄúETH is going to come back with a vengeance in the coming months,‚Äù CrediBULL stated. Source: CrediBULL Crypto CrediBULL set ambitious targets expecting the Ethereum price rally to a minimum of $10K once ETH breaks out of its current range. He further speculated that that $20K by the end of the cycle is ‚Äúcertainly not unreasonable.‚Äù ‚ÄòEthereum is Dead‚Äô Narrative Is Catching Up Again Amid strong underperformance among the peer altcoins over the past year, the sentiment around Ethereum is turning to be extremely bearish. Also, the ETH/BTC pair has hit fresh lows of $0.0300. However, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has offered a contrarian perspective on the ETH/BTC trading pair. He believes that the reversal could be on the horizon amid the prevailing market skepticism. ‚ÄúNow that ETH/BTC has collapsed, everyone thinks it‚Äôs dead,‚Äù he stated. Source: Benjamin Cowen He further added: ‚ÄúIn 2023, no one could believe it would ever drop to 0.03. In 2025, no one believes it will ever go back up‚Äù. However, he expressed confidence in a potential recovery, predicting that the ETH/BTC pair will reverse course within the year. Cowen attributed the delay in this Ethereum price recovery to the ongoing effects of quantitative tightening (QT), which has exerted pressure on risk assets. Donald Trump Pushing for Fed Rate Cuts While addressing business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Donald Trump said he will be pushing for the Fed rate cuts immediately. Amid the inflationary environment and strong US economy, the Fed is willing to hold interest rates higher with the first rate cuts not expected until mid 2025. However, Trump is willing to change this as he goes for a strong economic push during his tenure. The US President said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll demand that interest rates drop immediately. And likewise, they should be dropping all over the world‚Äù. This would bode well not only for Bitcoin but more importantly altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and others, as Trump plans to make America the crypto capital of the world. Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Financial Accumulates Ethereum World Liberty Financial, Donald Trump family‚Äôs DeFi project, has been heavily accumulating Ethereum over the past week ever since his oath-taking. In the latest development, the DeFi project purchased 3,001 ETH and 95 WBTC for $20 million just two hours ago. This whale accumulation can further lead to an Ethereum price surge ahead. Over the past five days, the firm has invested a staggering $210.9 million in crypto assets. This includes $119.95 million spent on 35,995 ETH at an average price of $3,332 and $66.84 million used to acquire 629.1 WBTC. Currently, the fund holds 77,818 ETH valued at $257 million, of which 19,403 ETH are staked through Lido Finance, as per data from SpotonChain . Thus, as Donald Trump signed an executive order for a national digital assets stockpile , there is a high probability ETH could be part of the reserves. On the other hand, inflows into spot Ethereum ETF have shot up significantly. The investment vehicle saw only one day of outflow in the last 8 trading sessions. As of press time, the ETH price is trading 3.26% down at $3,288 with daily trading volumes dropping by 36% under $22 billion.

A Binance listing is often seen as a seal of approval in the crypto world, signaling that a project has both legitimacy and long-term potential. If DogevsPepe does land on Binance, it could experience the kind of explosive growth that turns meme coins into household names. Why DogevsPepe Is Captivating Investors In a market crowded with meme coins, DogevsPepe is proving that mystery and innovation still have the power to captivate.

Stay tuned to find out how Trust Wallet CEO aims to empower Humanity via Web3. CEO Chen reveals her mission behind joining the crypto world. She aims to empower the individuals by using Blockchain, the decentralised technology and its various applications in safeguarding users‚Äô financial and security interests. Chen, along with her friend and founder of Trust Wallet, Viktor Radchenko, are working towards the vision of bringing more and more people into the Crypto world. The genesis of Trust Wallet can be traced to the ICO phase of 2017 when the founder, Viktor Radchenko, felt the urge to hold all of his coins in his hand. Thus, emerged the idea of creating a user-friendly wallet that would hold all of the user‚Äôs coins in his own hand ‚Äì in the form of an application in his mobile phone. Started as an Ethereum wallet for all the ICO tokens, it aims to provide users easy ways to access the Blockchain world ‚Äì making it the largest mobile Wallet in the world. Regarding the financial solutions of Blockchain and Web3 as the way to give a sense of ownership to users via self-custody, Chen believes it helps people in preserving their wealth. She further argues that the crypto wallets also being used by Trust organisations who offer to give charity in conflicted zones ‚Äì where carrying physical money isn‚Äôt possible. Chen highlights how Blockchain via ways such as ZK proof contributes to data ownership by the users in the world dominated by BigTech. At last, she advises people to do self- research who are sceptical of entering the crypto and Web3 space.

Originally capped at 200 million tokens, supply of $TRUMP was set to increase to the tune of 1 billion tokens over the next three years. Within 24 hours of the launch, a momentous $36.15 billion of trading volume came about-the token having already posed a market cap that stood over $9 billion. Riding the meme coin wave along with her husband, Melania Trump, the First Lady, officially introduced her own cryptocurrency, $MELANIA, which will run on the Solana blockchain. Despite their success, both tokens are drawing criticism for their heavy centralization and limited utility. In the midst of this hype, a new project is gaining traction: $PEPETO , the God of Frogs. Unlike $TRUMP and $MELANIA, which lean on branding, $PEPETO offers a robust ecosystem driven by innovation, utility, and community engagement. With over $3.7 million raised in presale and a rapidly growing following of more than 55,000 across social platforms, $PEPETO is proving to be a serious contender in the meme coin space. The Branding-Heavy Approach of $TRUMP and $MELANIA Both $TRUMP and $MELANIA have leveraged their association with the Trump name to generate massive buzz. Early investors have already reaped huge profits, with reports of one whale turning $12 million into $23.8 million within hours of $TRUMP‚Äôs launch. However, skepticism persists, as 80% of $TRUMP tokens are controlled by Trump-affiliated entities, raising concerns about centralization and long-term viability. $PEPETO: Combining Hype with Long-Term Utility In stark contrast, $PEPETO is redefining the meme coin category by delivering tangible value alongside its engaging narrative. Here‚Äôs why $PEPETO stands out: Generous Staking Rewards : With an annual yield of 387%, $PEPETO offers one of the most rewarding passive income opportunities in the crypto market. Advanced Cross-Chain Bridge : This feature reduces transfer times to just 30 seconds while cutting fees, making trading seamless across blockchains. PepetoSwap Exchange : A zero-fee platform designed to improve meme coin trading by addressing liquidity issues and high costs. Community-Centric Governance : Through a DAO structure, $PEPETO ensures its community has decision-making power, building trust and transparency. Affordable Presale Pricing : Currently priced at $0.000000105 per token, $PEPETO provides a low entry point for investors eager to tap into its massive potential. Growing Community and Whale Activity $PEPETO‚Äôs rapidly expanding community, now over 55,000 strong, underscores its growing appeal. Whale activity has also increased, with large-scale investors accumulating tokens in anticipation of major developments. Unlike the volatile surges seen with $TRUMP, $PEPETO‚Äôs focus on utility ensures a more stable growth trajectory, making it a promising long-term investment. The Road Ahead: Why $PEPETO Stands Out While $TRUMP and $MELANIA capitalize on political branding, $PEPETO‚Äôs innovative approach is setting a new standard for meme coins. Its roadmap, which includes the upcoming launch of PepetoSwap and high-profile exchange listings, signals a commitment to sustainable growth. As the presale nears its end, investors have limited time to secure $PEPETO at its current low price before it enters the broader market. How to Get Started with $PEPETO Investing in $PEPETO is simple: Set Up a Wallet : Use MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or any Ethereum-compatible wallet. Fund Your Wallet : Add ETH, USDT, or BNB. Join the Presale : Visit pepeto.io to purchase tokens. Stake Your Tokens : Start earning staking rewards immediately. About $PEPETO Blending the playful charm of meme coins with cutting-edge utility, $PEPETO features a zero-fee exchange, a high-speed cross-chain bridge, and industry-leading staking rewards. Positioned as a leader in the meme coin revolution, $PEPETO is driving a new era of innovation and trust in the crypto market.

The aim is to make the redemption process simpler and to align with regulatory changes under the newly appointed Trump administration. A Step Toward Easier Bitcoin ETF Redemptions On January 24, Nasdaq officially filed the 19b-4 form to seek approval for the rule change that would affect BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF, a major investment fund based in New York. If the proposal is approved, institutional investors will be able to redeem shares directly for Bitcoin, instead of selling Bitcoin through market makers to raise cash. This change would streamline the redemption process by reducing the steps and parties involved. It also aims to lower the selling pressure on Bitcoin during redemption events, which could have a positive impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Experts See Positive Impact on the Crypto Industry The proposal has been welcomed by experts in the field, including Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart. Seyffart believes the change could have a significant impact on the crypto industry. He also points to the repeal of SAB 121 as an important factor in making this change possible. SAB 121 had previously discouraged banks from providing crypto custody services. Trump‚Äôs Pro-Crypto Policies Support Growth This proposal is part of a broader push for crypto-friendly policies under the Trump administration. During his campaign, Trump positioned himself as a supporter of the crypto industry, promising to introduce policies that would help it grow. After winning the election against Kamala Harris on November 5, he wasted no time implementing key measures, such as creating a crypto task force to develop a clear regulatory framework and repealing the SAB 121 guideline.

Moreover, with the latest update of the Grayscale filing on a potential Litecoin ETF, its native token, LTC price maintains its upward trajectory by adding ~20% this year. With the rising bullish action for the Litecoin price, marketers are curious with questions like ‚ÄúIs this a good time to invest in Litecoin?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen will altcoin season begin?‚Äù LTC Coin Price Records Increased Volatility! The Litecoin price has added 5.67% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $1.205 billion, a change of +59.82%. Despite recording a correction of 2.36% in seven days, it has surged 14.23% in 30 days and has a YTD return of +19.27%. This suggests a constant increase in the buying pressure. TradingView: LTC/USDT Moreover, the altcoin has formed a rounding bottom pattern and has been trading within it since December 2024. However, despite increased volatility, it has successfully maintained its value within the range. This suggests a strong bullish sentiment in the crypto market. Litecoin Technical Sentiments The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) successfully retests its neutral point, resulting in it recording a bullish rise. Moreover, the averages display a similar price action, suggesting that this altcoin will continue gaining momentum in the upcoming time. On the other hand, the SMA indicator experienced a bearish convergence in the LTC price chart. This highlights mixed price action for the 19th largest cryptocurrency in the market. Will LTC ever go back up? Suppose, the market favors the bulls, this could push the price of Litecoin toward its immediate resistance level of $128.25. Maintaining the price above that level could push the value toward its upper high of $147.25. Conversely, a bearish reversal could pull the price of this altcoin toward its support of the rounding bottom pattern.

Bitcoin claiming dominance is further strengthening the argument of the expert. Besides, this argument from the crypto expert comes when several positive developments are being noted around altcoins. Is Altseason Not Happening, What‚Äôs Next for Altcoins? Altcoins enthusiasts came across an X post by Ali Martinez and were left slightly disappointed when they read an ‚Äòunpopular opinion.‚Äô Also known as Ali Charts, the crypto expert said that there would not be an altseason because the supply was massive in comparison to a decade ago. Ali Martinez said that altcoins were fewer than 500 in 2013-2014, giving them sufficient advantage to gain traction in the market. But, they have increased in numbers since then with the next surge noted in 2017-2018. That is when, he stated, altcoins increased to something just less than 3,000. Ali Charts said that altcoins are now over 36.4 million in number and make up for a massive supply. Source: Ali Charts, X The most notable surge came in May 2021 followed by sometime after September 2023. The number of unique crypto tokens rose from less than a million to over 15 million during that time, and are now over 30 million in supply. It remains to be seen what happens to altcoins if the altseason doesn‚Äôt pick up, especially since BTC is claiming larger dominance by maintaining the momentum of over $100k milestone. Bullish Sentiments Still Exist Nevertheless, the altcoins community is bullish that the altseason will eventually happen even if it takes more time. The confidence is rooted in the commitments expressed by Donald Trump of making the US the crypto capital of the world. He reaffirmed this commitment while addressing the World Economic Forum at Devos where Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, also said that he was bullish on the crypto future. Moreover, JPMorgan has broken the silence on the possibilities of Solana and XRP ETFs in the future. The American multinational has estimated a total inflow of around $15 billion within one year if SOL ETFs and XRP ETFs are approved. This is now gaining more traction because CoinShares has filed for XRP ETF with the US SEC. If approved, then XRP ETFs will join the list of crypto ETFs which, to date, only has Spot Bitcoin ETF and Spot Ether ETF. Interestingly, Bitwise has also made an advancement for the Dogecoin ETF launch . Bitwise has registered Bitwise Dogecoin ETF entity in Delaware as well, triggering speculation that an official SEC filing will be made soon. Sentiments for Altcoins Ali Martinez may have shared an unpopular opinion about the altseason but sentiments for the future of altcoins are bullish. This was last seen happening when TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins marked significant upticks. A few altcoins that continue to record the highest surge in their values are LTC, BGB, and LEO, with an increase of 4.58%, 7.22%, and 0.39% in their respective values over the past 24 hours.

A new survey by Hong Kong brokerage firm Futu Securities shows that Gen Z is rewriting the financial playbook. Instead of chasing the traditional dream of homeownership, this generation is betting big on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other tokens. According to the survey, Gen Z is three times more optimistic about crypto than real estate, signaling a major shift in how they view financial security. Hong Kong‚Äôs newspaper The Standard, citing data revealed by brokerage firm Futu Securities, reveals the standout finding: 23% of Gen Z respondents feel safer with just two Bitcoin in their portfolio than with HK$1 million (roughly $128,400) for a down payment on a home. In a city where property has always been a symbol of wealth and stability, the change in mindset is significant. You might also like: Hong Kong lawmaker wants to add Bitcoin to national reserves to boost financial security And there‚Äôs good reason for the optimism. Bitcoin surged 125% in 2024, breaking the $100,000 mark in December before settling around $97,000. Meanwhile, Hong Kong‚Äôs property market has struggled to deliver the same level of returns. With numbers like these, it‚Äôs no surprise that virtual assets are becoming a top choice for the younger generation. For 45% of Gen Z respondents, the convenience and security of crypto investments outweigh traditional assets like real estate. It‚Äôs not just about the returns ‚Äî it‚Äôs about flexibility. Cryptocurrencies offer a level of freedom that property ownership simply can‚Äôt match. Economic uncertainty shifts focus Hong Kong residents aren‚Äôt feeling too secure about their finances. On average, they rate their financial security at 6.43 out of 10, according to the survey. With economic uncertainty looming large, more than half of respondents are turning to investments to generate passive income. High earners, in particular, are diving headfirst into diverse and riskier assets. 25% have more than five income streams. 34% invest over half their income. 42% have invested in cryptocurrencies, with 66% seeing profits. It‚Äôs clear that high earners are leading the charge, but Gen Z is following close behind. Generational shift The younger generation is shaping a new narrative around wealth. For many Gen Z, owning property isn‚Äôt the dream anymore. Instead, holding ‚Äútwo BTCs‚Äù feels like a better bet for financial security. The newspaper notes that the sentiment isn‚Äôt just about chasing returns, it‚Äôs also about optimism. Gen Z sees a brighter future for virtual assets. They‚Äôre excited about the potential of crypto, with some saying it offers freedom and flexibility that traditional assets can‚Äôt match. But it‚Äôs not just the kids. 77% of Gen X ‚Äî those born between 1965 and 1980 ‚Äî who are already investing in cryptocurrencies share an optimistic outlook, particularly about Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential. In a commentary to crypto.news, Vivien Wong, partner liquid fund at HashKey Capital, said the shift of investors‚Äôs mindset unveils a ‚Äúcaptivating interplay of influences.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile the tech-savvy souls are undoubtedly drawn to the digital charms of Bitcoin, with its decentralized allure and futuristic appeal, the fluctuating property price in Hong Kong‚Äôs real estate market in the recent few years cannot be overlooked. It‚Äôs as if the younger generation, armed with smartphones and coding languages, is spearheading a financial revolution, where the allure of virtual assets clashes with the property market.‚Äù Vivien Wong Wong noted that the influence of Gen Z extends ‚Äúbeyond social media trends and fashion choices‚Äù as the generation holds ‚Äúsignificant disposable income‚Äù and reshapes ‚Äúcultural trends and financial paradigms.‚Äù ‚ÄúAligned with values such as transparency, inclusivity, and digital native tooling, Bitcoin resonates with Gen Z‚Äôs principles, poised to further expand the cryptocurrency economy. This shift not only underscores the changing dynamics of wealth accumulation, but also hints the tradition meets innovation in the nowadays financial.‚Äù Vivien Wong The Futu report shows that diversification is key. Stocks and cryptocurrencies are the most popular asset classes for growth. U.S. stock trading volumes on Futu‚Äôs platform shot up by 88% in 2024, with sectors like AI, renewable energy, and healthcare leading the charge. As Alan Tse, Futu‚Äôs managing director, puts it ‚Äúdigital assets are becoming an essential part of modern portfolios.‚Äù As a result, the shift isn‚Äôt just about investments. It‚Äôs about a change in how Hong Kongers view financial security.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 105,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historic precedence, Bitcoin may soon have a massive breakout, following the recent correction. However, he warns that a severe correction may follow the next big rally based on Bitcoin‚Äôs usual cycle patterns. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on the cusp of entering a parabolic phase in the cycle once again. That second price discovery uptrend that‚Äôs going to get us into price discovery and to new all-time highs.

So if we just look, generally speaking, in this market cycle, where are we at approximately, we‚Äôre in the parabolic phase of the cycle.

BTC price hit a daily high of No data found for bitcoin on 4 hours ago today after a No data found for bitcoin on 4 hours ago% move on January 25. But this expert and popular crypto analyst is forecasting a potential BTC price crash to $85,000, not in August, but in April. Will such a crash occur? What could happen to crypto markets in this scenario? Bitcoin Price Today is Crashing. Why? Bitcoin price today is down No data found for bitcoin on 4 hours ago%, continuing the rangebound movement it began on January 19. In this sideways movement, BTC has experienced massive volatility that created an all-time high (ATH) at $110,000 with no significant progress. Currently, BTC price trades at No data found for bitcoin on 4 hours ago above the $102.2K to $92.7K range. Hence, the reason for the recent downtick in BTC is the ongoing consolidation. But if there‚Äôs a crash, how low can the price go? One expert analyst poses a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù question, pushing investors to think what would happen if Bitcoin crashed to $85,000. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 4 hours ago. Will Bitcoin Crash to $85,000? Popular analyst Ansem‚Äôs Bitcoin price forecast on X notes a potential crash to $85,000 in April instead of August 2025. ‚Äúmany are saying august reminder, but what if its, april reminder‚Äù The expert points to Bitcoin‚Äôs April 2024 price action, which suggests a potential crash to $85,000. Based on this fractal, Ansem opens up the possibility of the April 2024 fractal repeating history in April 2025. BTC/USD 4-hour chart From a technical standpoint, it makes sense for Bitcoin to crash below $85,000. This move would sweep the sell-side liquidity resting below $90,000. A clear support level below $90K would be around $85,000. Does On-chain Metric Support a Crash? The 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio shows that it is currently in the danger zone. This zone is where 30-day BTC holders with unrealized gains tend to sell, leading to a price reversal. Hence, investors can expect a short-term correction. But interestingly, Bitcoin price action and 30-day MVRV show similar fractals to what elapsed in Q1 2024. Hence, the chances of history repeating are high here. Bitcoin Price vs. 30-day MVRV Key Levels To Watch The four-hour Bitcoin price chart shows that $102K is now the key support level to watch. A breakdown or bounce here will determine where BTC could go next. Most investors expect a bounce from $102K. In such a case, the current ATH at $110K is the key resistance level. Beyond this, the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $120K could be where BTC sets its next peak. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart On the contrary, a breakdown of the $102K support level could send BTC into the buy zone , which extends from $99.1K to $96.7K. There is a high chance that sidelined buyers may accumulate here. However, if the selling pressure is high, then Bitcoin¬†price could revisit the range low of $92.7K. If the crypto analyst Ansem‚Äôs prediction were to come true, bears need to break the $92.7K support level with a daily or weekly candlestick close below it. In such a case, the price could dive toward the next key area of interest at $85K.

With bitcoin already trading above $100,000 for the first time ever, many industry experts have used the opportunity in previous months to outline their respective reasons for when such an altseason will occur. Now, though, a popular analyst with nearly 120,000 followers on X indicated that there might not be such a period during the ongoing cycle. No Altseason? Unpopular opinion: There won‚Äôt be an alt season! Today, there are over 36.4 million altcoins, compared to fewer than 3,000 altcoins during the 2017-2018 alt season and even fewer than 500 altcoins in 2013-2014. With such massive supply, the market have changed significantly. pic.twitter.com/xLVLA2ug2t ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 Martinez‚Äôs reasons are mostly based on the enormous amount of altcoins currently in circulation. As he noted, there were a lot fewer during the previous altseasons that delivered incredible returns for many of them. Now, though, the creation of an altcoin, typically a meme coin, is particularly easy, especially on cheaper platforms like Solana. Consequently, many people have the ability to launch their own, most of which turn out to be flat-out rug pulls that scam investors. After all, what‚Äôs the point of millions of altcoins to exist? Do they all have an actual purpose that benefits the industry? Doubtful. A Different Altseason Instead? CryptoQuant‚Äôs CEO recently shared a somewhat similar opinion. He believes that there will be an altseason this cycle, but it will be entirely different, mostly due to the aforementioned reasons ‚Äì there‚Äôs no viable way that all those millions of alts will explode in value. Instead, he noted that only a handful of alternative coins will chart impressive gains and will lead the pack. This makes a lot more sense and has been observed in the past few months. Assets like XRP, XLM, HBAR, SOL, ADA, and DOGE posted significant increases within triple-digit territory, and some broke their previous all-time highs while others came inches away . Interestingly, many of the projects behind the altcoins in question are based or affiliated with the US, which is also quite logical given the positive changes in the local regulatory landscape after Trump‚Äôs presidential victory.

Ali Martinez, the popular crypto analyst with almost 120,000 followers on X, noted that the bull run is still intact as long as the cryptocurrency remains above $98,000. The primary cryptocurrency experienced massive volatility at the start of the week, as it plunged by over $6,000 on Monday morning to under $100,000 before it exploded out of the gate to a new all-time high above $109,000. This all transpired ahead of Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, and when that arrived, BTC slumped, as he had failed to mention the industry even once. Nevertheless, the $100,000 support held and bitcoin bounced off toward $107,000. However, the bears stopped the asset‚Äôs ascent at that point and pushed it south by a few grand in the past day. Just a few hours ago, the cryptocurrency tested $104,000 but has remained above it. Despite this $3,000 price drop in a day, BTC‚Äôs bull run will continue as long as it remains above $98,000, said Martinez. He outlined that level as particularly important for the asset due to the massive accumulation point it has become. More than 101,000 BTC (valued at $10.5B at today‚Äôs prices) were purchased at around that line, which turned it into a ‚Äòcrucial‚Äô support. Typically, investors, especially those who have arrived at the scene more recently, tend to dispose of their holdings if they see the price tumble below their entry level. The key support level for #Bitcoin is at $97,877, where more than 101,000 $BTC were accumulated. Holding above this level is crucial to sustaining the bullish momentum. pic.twitter.com/4kMR5ZtkWa ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 The post $3K Bitcoin Price Drop: What Level It Must Hold to Stay Bullish appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-25 08:28:04

Some analysts suggest that the new crypto-friendly administration could propel the token‚Äôs price to a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: $30 Million Hack Alert? Crypto Exchange Phemex Suspends Withdrawals After Suspicious Transactions ONDO Targets Rally To New ATH On Friday, tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance saw its native token lead the crypto market with its 11% daily surge. The cryptocurrency surged past the $1.50 mark for the second time this week, reigniting investors‚Äô sentiment about the token. Over the past three months, the token has registered a 120% jump, climbing from the $0.60 mark to its current price range. Moreover, the post-election rally propelled the cryptocurrency to its latest ATH of $2.14, fueled by Donald Trump‚Äôs DeFi project‚Äôs buying spree. In December, Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Financial (WLF) went on a crypto buying spree worth $45 million, acquiring millions in Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and other tokens. Halfway through the month, WLF purchased 134,216 ONDO tokens for 250,000 USDC, propelling ONDO‚Äôs price above the $2 mark. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency‚Äôs bullish momentum was halted after the December 19 market correction, which saw ONDO retrace to $1 in the following days. Since then, ONDO has been unable to reclaim the $1.60 resistance level, hovering between the $1.09 and $1.45 price range for most of the month. Crypto trader Miky Bull noted the token‚Äôs bullish performance as it attempted to break out from its downtrend today. The crypto has been in a one-month downtrend since hitting its latest ATH, with an attempted breakout at the start of the year. Today, the token is attempting another breakout, currently holding above the downtrend line. Per the post, the ‚Äúking of RWA‚Äù‚Äôs breakout could target the $2-$3 price range. However, the cryptocurrency needs to remain above the $1.30 level to confirm the break. Additionally, ONDO should hold near the $1.50 mark to continue its bullish trajectory toward the $1.60 resistance. New Pro-Crypto Administration To Fuel American Tokens? Market watcher Detoshi pointed out that ONDO has recovered a key level after its recent performance, which could support a rally toward a new ATH. According to the post, the token has reclaimed its previous ATH level, which was a crucial resistance before the December pump and significant support during the smaller market corrections. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa also highlighted ONDO‚Äôs performance, stating that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs chart is ‚Äúlooking strong,‚Äù adding that it was a ‚Äúgood beneficiary of a pro-crypto administration.‚Äù Similarly, Analyst Ted Pillows suggested that investors should ‚Äúkeep an eye on Trump and his wallet,‚Äù which includes ONDO, as these tokens are expected to perform well during the next leg up.

Ever since then, the market has been buzzing with Ripple price predictions, primarily focused on the token‚Äôs further growth. One such prediction, made a day ago, states that this third-biggest digital asset of the market would hit $10 within 48 hours due to the charts forming bullish patterns. However, time is running out, raising the question of whether XRP will really hit $10 in the next 24 hours. Can XRP Price Hit $10 in 24 Hours? A crypto analyst, KingXRP, has presented a Ripple price prediction, suggesting a significant rally to $10 today. According to KingXRP X‚Äôs post , his analysis is based on historical patterns and the 2017 bull run. Back then, the token jumped from $0.05 to $3.84 within a short span. Interestingly, this XRP price prediction is possible in theory but not without a catalyst. Even the 500% rally with Donald Trump‚Äôs win in Q4 2024 took over 27 days to surge to prime. At present, XRP trades at $3.10 with low breakout potential due to the market‚Äôs lacking significant bull dominance. To reach the $10 mark, the Ripple token requires at least a 222% rally, which is only possible under the bull run situation or the XRP reserve formation in place of Bitcoin and other confidence-building updates. Though the Ripple token can potentially surge $10, this will not happen in the next 24 hours. Ripple Price Prediction & Analysis Experts believe in XRP‚Äôs long-term potential, considering the increasing adoption of the Ripple token and CEO Brad Garlingouse‚Äôs strengthening ties with Donald Trump. Trump‚Äôs current decision to consider a digital asset stockpile over a Bitcoin reserve shows an outcome favoring Ripple. Many analysts have shared similar Ripple price predictions, including KingXRP, who believes the token will achieve the $8 ‚Äî$10 milestone or higher. XRP price could rip through $8 before a cycle top because of the current bullish fundamentals, says Mikybiil Crypto. Crypto analyst Javon Marks believes that the XRP price could rally to $10 due to the crucial breakout formation on the 9-hour charts, where the $3.18 market acts as the crucial resistance level. Mikybill crypto supports this outlook, as he revealed the pattern that triggered significant rallies in the past amid bullish fundamental and technical indicators. However, before XRP can hit $10, it must reclaim the $3.24, $3.32, and $3.80 key resistance levels. Moreover, bullish formation and factors like XRP ETF approval and others must occur. Reclaiming the key resistance levels at $3.24 and $3.32 is critical for the XRP‚Äôs wave five target at $3.80, says CasiTrades. What‚Äôs Next? With the constant development around the XRP token, the excitement is rising around its price potential. Many analysts‚Äô Ripple price predictions target $10, but that is not feasible in a short period of 24 or 48 hours. Although theoretical explanations prove the possibility, physical factors restrict its growth. As a result, the XRP price hitting $10 in the next 24 hours is improbable due to reduced buying pressure and neutral broader market conditions.

Most altcoins are in the red as well today, with SOL and LINK standing out as the biggest losers within this timeframe from the larger caps. BTC Slips to $104K All eyes in the community were on the US inauguration ceremony on Monday as the self-proclaimed ‚Äòcrypto President‚Äô was about to be sworn in. Even before that highly anticipated event, BTC‚Äôs price went on a rollercoaster, dumping by several grand on Monday morning just to surge to a new all-time high hours later at over $109,000. Once Trump‚Äôs speech finished, it became evident that he had ignored the crypto industry, and bitcoin headed straight south , losing five grand within minutes. Nevertheless, it bounced off and maintained within six-digit territory. Moreover, it climbed on Thursday and Friday and tapped $107,000 yesterday. This is where the bears stepped up and didn‚Äôt allow any further increases. Just the opposite, BTC lost about three grand since then and now sits at just over $104,000. Its market capitalization has retraced to $2.060 trillion on CG, while its dominance remains strong at 55.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView TRUMP Plunges Most altcoins have turned red on a daily scale. Ethereum was stopped at $3,400, and a 4% decrease since yesterday has pushed it to under $3,300. XRP is close to breaking below $3.1 after a 3% drop. Similar declines are evident from DOGE, ADA, AVAX, and XLM. More painful price drops come from Solana, SUI, and Chainlink, with losses of up to 6%. Nevertheless, the poorest performer from the top 100 alts is Donald Trump‚Äôs official meme coin. TRUMP has plunged by over 20% in the past day and now trades below $28. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has seen about $80 billion gone in a day and is down to $3.720 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Notably, the recent hot buzz of the market, VINE token, rides bullish waves primarily attributable to major listings, heightened market interest, and broader trends. As a result, traders and investors thoroughly monitor the meme token, anticipating a potential $1 price target as soon as the next 60 days. Here‚Äôs Why Vine Meme Coin Price Can Hit $1 In The Next 60 Days Listed below are some vital market statistics indicating that VINE token has the potential to hit $1 in the upcoming 60 days. VINE Coin Secures Major Listings Driving Market Interest Notably, the Vine meme coin price remains highly bullish amid major listings secured by the token over the past few days. As Binance, CoinEX, Bitget, and Hyperliquid revealed new listings for the token, a bullish wave engulfed its price movements in the wake of heightened market exposure. Hyperliquid and Binance launched futures listing for the abovementioned cryptocurrency, encouraging further market interaction with the asset. Simultaneously, it‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the crypto exchanges Bitget and CoinEX listed the token, offering it further market visibility. In turn, market sentiments orbiting the meme coin remain highly bullish in light of the listings, driving rising trading volume, increased liquidity, and positively evolving market perception. Speculations Over Vine App Revival Builds Amid Elon Musk‚Äôs Comments Simultaneously, the broader developments surrounding the Vine social media app‚Äôs revival have also bolstered the market sentiment for this token. Intriguingly, American billionaire and entrepreneur Elon Musk recently conveyed that he is looking into bringing back the social media app. Given that this feat happens (the app‚Äôs revival) ahead, market sentiments could further turn bullish over the Vine meme coin price. Also, it‚Äôs worth pointing out that the meme coin was initially announced by the social media app‚Äôs creator, Rus Yusupove, on X this month. Rising Futures OI Underscores Bullish Sentiment Building Further, the token‚Äôs derivatives market has also seen a substantial spike in activity, cementing market optimism. Recent Coinglass data indicated that VINE futures OI surged by a whopping 174%, reaching $72.11 million. Moreover, the asset‚Äôs derivatives volume rose by 275%, reaching $3.04 billion. When coupled with the mem coin‚Äôs recent price upswing, the derivatives data flags a bullish trend prevailing for the asset. This bullish trend appears to be driven by burgeoning market interest, mirroring growing investor participation and money inflow to the token. In turn, speculations of a bullish trend continuation for Vine meme coin price persist. Whale Accumulation Pours Additional Optimism Also, on-chain tracker Lookonchain has recently revealed that whale accumulation for the same token is on the rise. As per an X post on January 25, a crypto trader spent $1.69 million to buy 13.81 million VINE tokens. Intriguingly, this trade maneuver currently boasts an unrealized profit of $3.4 million. As a result, market watchers remain highly optimistic over the asset‚Äôs potential. It‚Äôs also noteworthy that the same trader previously bought 14.64 million tokens using a different wallet address. After selling 9.96 million coins, this trader netted a $4 million profit. Besides, the trader‚Äôs decision to still hold 4.67 million tokens has sparked speculations of further gains. Also, CoinGape recently reported that another crypto trader made a $4.5 million profit on Vine meme coin after nearly losing it all. VINE Price Run Bullish At the time of reporting, VINE price witnessed a 13% surge in value and is currently trading at $0.2886. The coin‚Äôs 24-hour low and high were $0.1082 and $0.4257, respectively. Intriguingly, the weekly chart further showcased gains worth 55% for the asset. The sustained bullish movement, defying the broader market‚Äôs current turbulence, has solidified investors‚Äô optimism about the asset. Overall, with the abovementioned factors coming into play, a potential run to $1 for the Vine meme coin price remains possible in the next 60 days.

Stay tuned to find out how Trust Wallet CEO aims to empower Humanity via Web3. CEO Chen reveals her mission behind joining the crypto world. She aims to empower the individuals by using Blockchain, the decentralised technology and its various applications in safeguarding users‚Äô financial and security interests. Chen, along with her friend and founder of Trust Wallet, Viktor Radchenko, are working towards the vision of bringing more and more people into the Crypto world. The genesis of Trust Wallet can be traced to the ICO phase of 2017 when the founder, Viktor Radchenko, felt the urge to hold all of his coins in his hand. Thus, emerged the idea of creating a user-friendly wallet that would hold all of the user‚Äôs coins in his own hand ‚Äì in the form of an application in his mobile phone. Started as an Ethereum wallet for all the ICO tokens, it aims to provide users easy ways to access the Blockchain world ‚Äì making it the largest mobile Wallet in the world. Regarding the financial solutions of Blockchain and Web3 as the way to give a sense of ownership to users via self-custody, Chen believes it helps people in preserving their wealth. She further argues that the crypto wallets also being used by Trust organisations who offer to give charity in conflicted zones ‚Äì where carrying physical money isn‚Äôt possible. Chen highlights how Blockchain via ways such as ZK proof contributes to data ownership by the users in the world dominated by BigTech. At last, she advises people to do self- research who are sceptical of entering the crypto and Web3 space. She calls it the only way for individuals to make their own decision of staking in Web3 ‚Äì alognwith the sense of gaining risk control.

The altcoin giant, which has held the top position for a long time, is starting to feel the pressure as competitors like XRP and Solana continue to rise. With Ethereum‚Äôs price stuck between $3,200 and $3,500 for weeks, many are wondering if its dominance in the altcoin market is at risk. Ethereum Struggles to Break Through Ethereum‚Äôs (ETH) price has been stuck in a consolidation phase, failing to break past the key $4,000 mark. In the last two months, ETH has dropped by nearly 20%, which has raised concerns about its future price potential. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ratio ‚Äîa measure comparing Ethereum‚Äôs value to Bitcoin‚Äîhas fallen by 19% since early December, signaling a weakening position for Ethereum in the market.

While Bitcoin ETFs have seen inflows for ten consecutive days, Ethereum ETFs have experienced outflows, with $15.9 million leaving the market. This is a sign that investors may be losing confidence in Ethereum. Internal Struggles at the Ethereum Foundation The Ethereum Foundation (EF), which has played a key role in Ethereum‚Äôs development, is also facing internal challenges . High-profile developers like Eric Conner and Danny Ryan have left, citing frustrations and personal issues. Their departures raise concerns about leadership stability and the future direction of the Foundation. Even Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum‚Äôs founder, has admitted that there is a pressing need to improve scalability, security, and the overall user experience if Ethereum wants to stay competitive. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Plans Zero Capital Gains Tax for US Crypto Projects ‚Äì Here Are the Benefits! , Rising Competition from Solana and XRP On top of these internal struggles, Ethereum is facing strong competition from external rivals.

Notably, following this, a flurry of Bitcoin maxis and prominent crypto figures have slammed Ripple. FOX journalist Eleanor Terrett described the situation as ‚Äúopen warfare‚Äù between crypto communities, highlighting the unprecedented hostility. Besides, she also questioned that as the US SEC thread diminished under Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto era, the crypto communities started ‚Äúwarring‚Äù among themselves. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Magazine urged its followers to reject XRP, stating, ‚ÄúBitcoin only‚Äù on America‚Äôs balance sheet. Similarly, Exodus co-founder JP Richardson expressed his belief that Bitcoin, not XRP, should preserve national wealth. Source: JP Richardson, X Adding to the criticism, Julian Fahrer of Apollo Sats labeled Ripple‚Äôs ecosystem an ‚Äúinsider trading operation.‚Äù Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike‚Äôs parent company Zap, accused Ripple of undermining Bitcoin and lobbying aggressively against the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Source: Julian Fahrer, X Ripple Faces Criticism For ‚ÄòLobbying‚Äô Efforts Ripple faces immense criticism amid speculations over a potential US XRP Reserve . Riot Platforms VP Pierre Rochard accused the firm of advancing its agenda at Bitcoin‚Äôs expense. Rochard claimed Ripple targeted Bitcoin mining during the Biden administration and alleged it anticipated Kamala Harris‚Äôs support for a CBDC built on its platform. Messari Crypto co-founder Ryan Selkis echoed similar concerns, accusing Ripple of lobbying to derail the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Selkis argued that XRP‚Äôs inclusion in a national crypto reserve undermines Bitcoin‚Äôs credibility, calling it unnecessary. Brad Garlinghouse and Pro-XRP Enthusiasts Comes In Support Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse dismissed allegations of undermining Bitcoin. He argued Ripple‚Äôs lobbying supports innovation and increases the likelihood of a balanced strategic reserve, potentially including Bitcoin. Garlinghouse reiterated Ripple‚Äôs commitment to advancing the US crypto landscape. While critics remain vocal, Flare co-founder Hugo Philion also expressed optimism about XRP‚Äôs future. He emphasized 2025 as a pivotal year for XRP and Flare‚Äôs growing role in the ecosystem. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan also praised CoinShares‚Äô recent XRP ETF filing , stating, ‚ÄúThe market wants exposure to XRP.‚Äù Will XRP Price Continue To Rally? XRP price today slumped 2.5% to $3.10 amid a broader crypto market downturn. Its trading volume also fell 42% to $5.1 billion. However, despite that, recent reports indicate a continuing rally of the crypto, especially under the Trump administration and other positive XRP news. Notably, US-based crypto like XRP, Solana, and others, have received immense traction as Donald Trump reiterated his stance to make the US the crypto capital. In addition, the latest XRP ETF filings also hint at increasing institutional confidence towards the crypto. On the other hand, a flurry of experts anticipate a potential settlement or conclusion to the long-running XRP lawsuit. Having said that, a recent report also indicates a potential XRP price rally to $15 once the lawsuit ends. Considering all these aspects, it appears that Ripple‚Äôs native crypto is likely to hit new highs in the coming days. The post XRP News: Is Ripple Vs.

According to Ali Martinez, historical trends indicate that Bitcoin‚Äôs downturn may be imminent, despite the anticipation that the asset will rise further amid a changing regulatory landscape, he said in an X post on January 24. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ali_charts Martinez highlighted that during Bitcoin‚Äôs previous halving cycles, the asset reached a market top within specific timeframes. Following the 2012 halving, the market top occurred 367 days later. After the 2016 halving, the peak came 526 days after the halving. Similarly, after the 2020 halving, Bitcoin reached its top 547 days later, marking the start of a bear market. Currently, Bitcoin sits at 276 days since the 2024 halving. If history repeats itself, Martinez predicts that the next market top‚Äîand subsequent bear market‚Äîcould occur between 100 and 270 days from now, translating to a timeline between May and October 2025. ‚ÄúIf history were to repeat itself, the next Bitcoin market top could be 100 to 270 days away, which could be anywhere between May and October 2025,‚Äù he said. Notably, as reported by Finbold, trading expert Trader Tardigrade noted, based on historical trends, Bitcoin might hit the top at the end of March 2025 with a price target of $170,000. Impact of regulatory changes on Bitcoin‚Äôs price This projection comes as most market players anticipate a Bitcoin rally, bolstered by positive regulatory developments spearheaded by President Donald Trump . Barely a week into office, the new administration has unveiled its cryptocurrency agenda, including exploring a strategic Bitcoin reserve to stabilize its price and legitimize it as an asset. Regulatory reforms include a new Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) task force and a working group to draft clearer crypto rules, signaling a shift toward crypto-friendly policies. Additionally, Trump has banned central bank digital currencies ( CBDCs ) to protect Bitcoin and reversed restrictive SEC rules, encouraging banks and institutions to engage with cryptocurrency . In response, banking giants such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) have signaled their willingness to collaborate with regulators to offer cryptocurrency solutions to clients. It‚Äôs worth noting that before Trump‚Äôs election , there was anticipation that Bitcoin would rally significantly, with some dubbing him the ‚Äúfirst crypto president.‚Äù However, Bitcoin has struggled to make a decisive breakout, with the $110,000 remaining a key barrier. What next for BTC Amid this potentially friendly cryptocurrency environment, analysts have set several price targets for Bitcoin. For instance, pseudonymous analyst Crypto General , in an X post on January 24, observed strong signs of an impending rally as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Crypto General The analyst noted that the price has broken out from a consolidation zone near $88,000, with the next major resistance level projected at $130,000. This target aligns with optimism fueled by the Trump administration‚Äôs favorable developments. Technical indicators further reinforce a bullish outlook. Bitcoin has surged past the $100,000 psychological barrier, which is now a strong support level. In the short term, Martinez‚Äôs data suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish trend hinges on maintaining support at $97,877. On-chain data reveals that over 101,000 BTC were accumulated at this price point, making it a pivotal zone for buyers. Bitcoin‚Äôs highest accumulation levels.

So far, the asset‚Äôs latest all-time high sits above $109,000 marking a more than 150% increase in year-over-year performance. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst Gaah has recently examined Bitcoin‚Äôs current position in the market cycle and whether the asset might be nearing a peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Drops 93% From December Peak ‚Äì What‚Äôs Next For BTC? Bitcoin: Is The Top In? According to Gaah‚Äôs analysis, the Index of Bitcoin Cycle Indicators (IBCI)‚Äîa composite metric that includes on-chain data points like the Puell Multiple, MVRV, NUPL, and SOPR‚Äîhas entered the ‚Äúdistribution region‚Äù for the first time in eight months. While this doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúyet confirm a market top,‚Äù it serves as a cautionary signal that Bitcoin could be approaching the final stages of its current bull cycle. For IBCI to hit a definitive top, all its components would need to reach their historical peak levels, according to the analyst. However, as long as the IBCI remains above 50%, the broader market trend remains bullish, indicating continued demand and the potential for further price increases. Beyond the IBCI, Gaah notes that additional on-chain indicators present a mixed picture. While the NUPL metric hovers near its upper range, suggesting a possible end to the bull run, the Puell Multiple remains closer to the lower zone, which could indicate room for continued growth. This interplay of signals suggests that the market may not have reached a definitive top just yet. According to Gaah, historically, a fully realized IBCI peak has preceded corrections and longer-term bear phases. However, the current position offers room for optimism, provided that demand remains strong and other indicators remain supportive. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capital Inflows See Notable Slowdown, But Is This A Worry? Another Diverging Interpretation In contrast to Gaah‚Äôs cautious perspective, another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, highlights a different scenario using the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. This metric, designed to spot local tops and bottoms, recently fell to its lowest point in 60 days, signaling a potential ‚Äúlocal bottom.‚Äù Kesmeci explains that historically when the NVT Golden Cross drops below -1.6, it often indicates that the asset is trading within a bottom range. As Bitcoin recently pulled back by about 7.5% after reaching its all-time high, the metric‚Äôs current reading could be a precursor to renewed upward momentum. Kesmeci wrote: Rather than indicating a specific price level, this metric suggests that Bitcoin may be trading within a local bottom zone. Historically, such signals have often preceded recovery and trend reversals, making it an important indicator to monitor.

Just over the past week, the stablecoin firm has minted more than 5 billion USDC on the Solana network, amid high demand following the launch of TRUMP meme coin. This shows that Circle is increasing its market footprint and can probably eat partially into Tether‚Äôs market cap by being MiCA compliant. Circle USDC Stablecoin Increases Market Footprint Stablecoin firm Circle has been on a USDC minting spree since the beginning of 2025. As a result, the USDC market cap has surged by 8% adding $8 billion and moving past $52 billion. As per on-chain data, a large part of this minting has happened over the past week. On-chain data shows that within a week, the USDC market cap has surged by another $5 billion. Blockchain analytics platform Arkham reports that Circle has minted 250 million USDC on the Solana blockchain today. This latest issuance contributes to a cumulative total of 5 billion USDC minted on Solana since 2025, underscoring the stablecoin issuer‚Äôs growing activity on the network. Source: CoinMarketcap The move highlights Circle‚Äôs continued commitment to expanding its presence on Solana, amid growing demand for USDC in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other applications. Interestingly, the surge in USDC minting came soon after the launch of the TRUMP meme coin triggering a massive frenzy in the market. Closing the Gap With Tether‚Äôs USDT With a large number of USDT mints in the first month of 2025, Circle has been closing the gap with its top rival Tether, the issuer of USDT stablecoin. While Circle‚Äôs market cap surged in January this month, Tether hasn‚Äôt made any move with its market cap staying steady at $139.27 billion. The total circulating supply of USDC has reached 51.9 billion, backed by reserves totaling approximately $52.1 billion. These reserves include $6.1 billion in cash and $46.1 billion managed within the Circle Reserve Fund. The surge comes as the USDC stablecoin issuer is undertaking a few adoption-boosting measures, such as the recent acquisition of Hashnote , a leading issuer of tokenized real-world assets. However, Circle‚Äôs USDC is still less than 50% the size of Tether‚Äôs USDT. Furthermore, over the last year, the USDC stablecoin market cap has doubled, while USDT also clocked a hefty 50% surge in its market cap now reaching $140 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap Circle Introducing Paymaster to Boost USDC Adoption Circle, the issuer of the $48 billion USDC stablecoin, has launched ‚ÄúPaymaster,‚Äù a new feature enabling users to pay transaction fees on Arbitrum and Base using USDC instead of ether (ETH). Paymaster processes USDC payments and converts them into native tokens to settle fees with blockchain validators, the company explained in a blog post. The service, set to expand to Ethereum, Polygon POS, and Solana, charges users a fee equal to 10% of the gas cost per transaction.

After recording huge bullish candles, the buyers seem to have exhausted or they may be waiting for the token to reach a certain range. Meanwhile, the token has successfully defended the support at $103,485, despite a rise in the upward pressure, suggesting the bulls remain vigilant as they appear to be optimistic about the upcoming BTC price rally. The institutions are constantly buying Bitcoin as the spot ETFs witnessed over $500 million in inflows during the past reading day, maintaining the 7-day streak of positive inflow. With this, the total Bitcoin spot ETF assets have reached more than $123 billion. Interestingly, Blackrock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF volume surpassed $1 billion in the first two hours of trading, hinting towards a raised interest among the market participants. On the other hand, the long-term holders have liquidated a huge amount of BTC, which raises concerns over the next price action. However, the token continues to remain elevated as the higer targets still remain active with the hopes of a new ATH. The BTC price has been displaying massive strength since the start of the second fortnight, which hints at the rising strength of the bulls. Meanwhile, the huge wicks formed above and below the candles suggest both bulls and bears are extremely vigilant and exert pressure at frequent intervals. This suggests the price could continue to remain within an ascending consolidation until the end of the month and attract a notable volume onto the platform. Considering the technicals, the CMF is sinking, hinting towards the growing weakness within the markets. Moreover, the DMI levels have also reached the lower threshold, along with the ADX, with fewer chances of a bullish divergence. Bearish reversal can be observed with RSI and MACD displays a drop in the buying pressure with the possibility of a bearish crossover in the upcoming days. Therefore, the Bitcoin price is believed to test the support at $102.5 and initiate a strong upswing towards the final resistance zone between $106,013 and $107,419. Breaking above these levels may only pave the way for a new ATH; meanwhile, it could require a massive influx of buying volume. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President recently suggested that the Trump administration might introduce a zero capital gains tax policy specifically for cryptocurrency projects. But will this policy benefit only US-based projects, or will non-US ventures also see relief? Zero Capital Gains Tax for US Crypto Projects Reports indicate that US-based crypto projects, including popular ones like XRP and HBAR , will benefit from the zero capital gains tax policy. This announcement has stirred excitement in the crypto industry, with many believing that the policy could make US-based projects even more appealing to investors and developers. Non-US Projects Left Behind However, the policy is unlikely to offer any relief to non-US crypto projects. Eric Trump stated that these projects would be subject to a 30% capital gains tax. This creates a clear tax divide between US-based and non-US ventures, raising concerns about the potential impact on global crypto competition. US-based Crypto Projects: An Overview Experts believe the sharp difference in tax rates is designed to give US projects a competitive edge while encouraging crypto companies to establish operations within the United States. The total market cap of US-linked cryptocurrencies now stands at $550 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $37.47 billion. The ‚ÄúMade in USA‚Äù category includes cryptocurrencies with strong ties to the United States. The top ten cryptos in this category by market cap are XRP, Solana, USDC, Cardano, Chainlink, Avalanche, Stellar, Hedera, Sui, and Polkadot. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase CEO Says Trump Forcing Everyone to Up Their Crypto Game, Here‚Äôs why! , Positive Trends for US-Based Cryptos Over the past 30 days, most of the top ten cryptos in this category have shown strong growth. XRP has risen by 42%, Solana by 31.7%, and Cardano by 12.3%. Chainlink, Stellar, and Hedera have also experienced positive movements. However, not all US-based cryptos have performed equally well‚ÄîAvalanche, Sui, and Polkadot saw declines during this period. In conclusion, the Trump administration‚Äôs proposed crypto tax relief policy could be a game-changer for the industry. If implemented, it could create a favorable environment for US-based crypto projects, while potentially challenging non-US players. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Says Trump Is ‚ÄòForcing Everyone to Up Their Game‚Äô, whether they like it or Not. Trump Forcing Everyone to Up Their Crypto Game In a tweet post on X Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared his key takeaways after attending the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, where he met with world leaders, CEOs, and ministers. https://t.co/wOhYg1vmzr ‚Äî Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 24, 2025 Armstrong revealed that nearly every conversation he had at the forum revolved around Trump‚Äôs ambitious plans for digital assets. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is forcing everyone to up their game,‚Äù Armstrong stated, hinting at the pressure mounting on both traditional financial institutions and crypto firms to avoid falling behind. As the CEO of Coinbase, a company equipped to assist governments with custody and trading services, Armstrong emphasized how these developments present an opportunity for Coinbase to play a vital role in shaping the global crypto landscape. Crypto and AI Lead Discussions at Davos Beyond Trump‚Äôs influence, Armstrong pointed out that cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) were the most talked-about topics at Davos. Many leaders are showing a growing interest in how crypto can increase economic freedom and support economic growth, especially in developing countries. He highlighted the inspiration drawn from leaders like President Bukele of El Salvador and President Millei of Argentina, who have used crypto to benefit their economies. Armstrong pointed out that ‚Äúeconomic freedom is the future,‚Äù suggesting a global shift toward free-market ideas backed by blockchain technology. Companies Rushing to Adopt Crypto Armstrong also noted that big companies, including banks and payment providers, are quickly increasing their investments in crypto. These businesses are looking for ways to integrate blockchain technology and stay ahead in the market. However, some challenges remain. For example, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon mentioned that strict regulations still limit what banks can do with Bitcoin. Despite this, Armstrong believes these hurdles will eventually be overcome as the demand for crypto continues to grow. What Does This Mean for Investors? For many, Trump‚Äôs crypto push feels less like an opportunity and more like a mandate.

Critics Question Value & Future Amidst Legal Battle appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple‚Äôs XRP recently surged past the $3 mark, but the cryptocurrency still faces significant scrutiny. The Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) ongoing legal battle with Ripple remains a major concern, especially as some market predictions suggest that former President Trump could dismiss what some view as unfair crypto trials. While Trump is focusing on creating a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve , other important issues, like reforming crypto policies and ensuring fair legal trials, seem to be put on hold. As a result, many in the crypto community feel that XRP is being overhyped and may face long-term challenges. Samson Mow Criticizes Ripple and XRP Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow has reignited criticism, questioning Ripple‚Äôs legitimacy and XRP‚Äôs place in a potential U.S. strategic crypto reserve. I see a lot of posts hating on or listing out reasons why you should hate Ripple/XRP, and I just want to add some perspective. You still don‚Äôt hate them enough and there are still way more reasons why you should hate them. ‚Äî Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 24, 2025 XRP‚Äôs Legitimacy Questioned Mow‚Äôs criticism centers on his belief that XRP lacks real value. He accuses Ripple‚Äôs founders of creating 100 billion tokens ‚Äúout of thin air.‚Äù Mow argues that adding XRP to a U.S. crypto reserve would mean giving taxpayer money to corporations that manipulate token supply. This criticism adds to the ongoing debate about whether altcoins like XRP should be part of a strategic reserve, with Mow strongly supporting Bitcoin for its decentralized nature and scarcity. Mow and Musk Mow‚Äôs views align with elon musk elon musk Elon Musk Is the Co-founder of Tesla, an investor and entrepreneur.

CEO Reacts , Despite XRP‚Äôs price surge, its future remains uncertain, with challenges ranging from SEC scrutiny to vocal critics like Mow. While the price increase shows market optimism, many investors worry that the ongoing legal battle will delay any potential breakthroughs for the token. Ripple‚Äôs Shaky Ground XRP‚Äôs primary role as a cross-border payment solution for financial institutions has contributed to its limited adoption. As legal issues persist, many new investors may prefer tokens that don‚Äôt face the same regulatory challenges, making XRP less appealing. If these issues aren‚Äôt resolved soon, they could pose a serious threat to XRP‚Äôs future under Trump‚Äôs leadership. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It might sound like rocket science, but trust me, it‚Äôs not. By the end of this guide, you‚Äôll know how to mint your own NFT step by step. What‚Äôs the Buzz About NFTs? Let‚Äôs start with the basics. NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token . It is a fancy term. But all it means is that it‚Äôs a unique digital asset. Think of it like a rare trading card or a one-of-a-kind painting, but digital. Each NFT is different and can‚Äôt be swapped one-for-one like Bitcoin or dollars. The coolest part? NFTs can be anything digital ‚Äì art, music, videos, memes, even tweets! In fact, Twitter‚Äôs co-founder sold his first-ever tweet as an NFT for millions. But enough about the hype. Let‚Äôs get to the real deal ‚Äì how you can create and mint an NFT. What Does ‚ÄúMinting‚Äù Mean? Minting is just a crypto way of saying you‚Äôre creating an NFT and adding it to a blockchain . Think of it like publishing a book. When you mint an NFT, you‚Äôre making your digital creation official and unique, giving it proof of ownership and authenticity. How do we do that? Step 1: Choose Your Digital Creation Before anything else, decide what you want to turn into an NFT. It could be: A digital painting you made. A music track. A short video clip or animation. Even a meme you created! Example: Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a photographer. You have a stunning sunset photo that you think people might love. That could be your NFT! Pro Tip: Make sure you own the rights to whatever you‚Äôre minting. Don‚Äôt use someone else‚Äôs work unless you have permission. Step 2: Pick a Blockchain Next, you need to choose a blockchain to host your NFT. Blockchains are like the foundation where your NFT lives. The most popular blockchain for NFTs is Ethereum , but there are others like: Solana Binance Smart Chain Polygon Tezos Each has its pros and cons. For example: Ethereum : Most popular but has high gas fees (more on that later). Solana : Faster and cheaper, but less established. Polygon : Ethereum-compatible and low fees. If you‚Äôre unsure, Ethereum is a safe choice because it‚Äôs widely used. Step 3: Get a Crypto Wallet You‚Äôll need a digital wallet to store cryptocurrency and manage your NFTs. Think of it as your digital purse. Popular wallets include: MetaMask : Great for Ethereum-based NFTs. Phantom : Perfect for Solana . Trust Wallet : Works with multiple blockchains. Set up your wallet (it‚Äôs free) and save your recovery phrase. This phrase is like the key to your safe. Lose it, and you lose access to your wallet. Seriously, don‚Äôt skip this step. Step 4: Buy Cryptocurrency Now that you have a wallet, you‚Äôll need some cryptocurrency to cover fees. The amount depends on the blockchain you choose. For Ethereum, you‚Äôll need ETH . For Solana, you‚Äôll need SOL . You can buy crypto on exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. Once you‚Äôve got your crypto, transfer it to your wallet. Example: If you‚Äôre minting on Ethereum, you might need $50 to $100 worth of ETH to cover fees. Step 5: Choose an NFT Marketplace This is where the magic happens. Marketplaces are platforms where you can mint, showcase, and sell your NFTs. Some popular ones are: OpenSea : The largest NFT marketplace. Great for beginners. Rarible : Lets you mint and sell directly. Foundation : Focused on high-quality art. Magic Eden : Popular for Solana NFTs. Each platform has its vibe. OpenSea is a great starting point because it‚Äôs user-friendly and supports Ethereum and Polygon . Step 6: Upload and Mint Your NFT Now comes the fun part ‚Äì creating your NFT! Here‚Äôs how it usually works: Sign Up on a Marketplace : Connect your crypto wallet to the marketplace. Create a New NFT : Look for a button like ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù or ‚ÄúMint.‚Äù Upload Your File : Add your digital file (image, video, etc.). Add Details : Give your NFT a name and description. Be creative here! Example: ‚ÄúGolden Sunset ‚Äì A serene photograph capturing the last rays of sunlight over the ocean.‚Äù Set Royalties : Decide how much you‚Äôll earn if someone resells your NFT. Common rates are 5% to 10%. Choose Blockchain : Select the blockchain you‚Äôre using. Pay the Minting Fee : This is also called a ‚Äúgas fee.‚Äù It‚Äôs a small cost to process your transaction on the blockchain. Once done, your NFT is minted! And, you‚Äôre officially an NFT creator. Step 7: List Your NFT for Sale You can stop at minting, or you can go a step further and sell your NFT. Here‚Äôs how: Set a Price : Choose between fixed price, auction, or open offers. Promote Your NFT : Share it on social media, forums, or with your community. Example: Let‚Äôs say you set the price for your ‚ÄúGolden Sunset‚Äù NFT at 0.1 ETH (~$160). Now, anyone who loves it can buy it directly from the marketplace. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Your Easy Introduction to Crypto Mining: Get Started Today! , Common Question on Minting NFTs How much does it cost to mint an NFT?

Skyren DAO‚Äôs Dual Strategy Stuns Investors,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/ethereum-killer-or-eth-2-0-companion-skyren-daos-dual-strategy-stuns-investors/,"The post Ethereum Killer or ETH 2.0 Companion? Skyren DAO‚Äôs Dual Strategy Stuns Investors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has been a trailblazer in decentralized finance (DeFi), powering countless applications. However, its scalability issues, high fees, and growing competition have led to questions about its long-term dominance. Skyren DAO (SKYRN)is entering the conversation, not as a direct competitor but as a partner to Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem, bringing innovation and efficiency through its dual strategy. Let‚Äôs explore how Skyren DAO , built on Polygon , is changing the game while complementing Ethereum‚Äôs efforts. Ethereum‚Äôs Strengths and Scalability Challenges Ethereum is still the most widely used blockchain for smart contracts and decentralized apps. However, it struggles with performance: Transaction Speed: The Ethereum base layer processes only 15‚Äì25 transactions per second (TPS) . During peak activity, this results in network congestion. High Gas Fees: Limited throughput causes fees to skyrocket, making small transactions expensive. Rising Competition: Blockchains like Solana (up to 65,000 TPS) and Avalanche (4,500 TPS) have entered the scene, promising faster speeds and lower costs. While ETH 2.0 is designed to address these issues by transitioning to Proof of Stake and implementing sharding, its rollout is ongoing. For now, the scalability gap leaves space for projects like Skyren DAO to innovate. Skyren DAO‚Äôs Dual Strategy Skyren DAO‚Äôs approach combines scalability, innovation, and collaboration with Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. Here‚Äôs how it stands out: 1.

Introducing Airdrop Collection Tokens Skyren DAO innovates with airdrop collection tokens , offering users new opportunities in DeFi. These tokens provide: Exclusive access to decentralized finance strategies. Rewards for active participation. Greater utility beyond basic staking. This feature helps Skyren carve its niche in the blockchain world while complementing Ethereum‚Äôs DeFi capabilities.

Skyren DAO doesn‚Äôt aim to replace Ethereum ‚Äî it works alongside it. The promising platform leverages Polygon‚Äôs efficiency to tackle Ethereum‚Äôs scalability challenges, creating a bridge between current limitations and the future needs of decentralized finance. While other blockchains compete to become ‚ÄúEthereum killers,‚Äù Skyren DAO positions itself as a strategic partner to Ethereum, supporting its ecosystem while delivering value through innovative features.

This prolonged dip below a key psychological level has left analysts and investors divided as uncertainty continues to dominate the broader crypto market. While some see signs of potential recovery, others remain cautious about the short-term outlook. Related Reading: XRP Forms A Bullish Pattern In 4-Hour Chart ‚Äì Analyst Expects $4.20 After Breakout Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided some clarity by sharing a detailed technical analysis. According to Martinez, Cardano is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, a structure often associated with impending volatility and significant price movements. The outcome of this pattern could determine Cardano‚Äôs next major trend, whether bullish or bearish. As the market sentiment remains fragile, ADA‚Äôs ability to break out of this consolidation phase will likely set the tone for its performance in the coming days. A decisive move could either spark renewed optimism among investors or reinforce concerns about further downside. Cardano approaches a critical juncture, with traders and investors eagerly awaiting confirmation of its next move. The resolution of this symmetrical triangle could prove pivotal for ADA‚Äôs trajectory in the volatile crypto landscape. Cardano Prepares For A Big Move Cardano (ADA) has been heavily influenced by market volatility as the broader crypto market remains in a consolidation phase since late December. This prolonged period of sideways movement has kept traders and investors on edge, with many anticipating a significant breakout. However, the question remains: will Cardano‚Äôs next move be bullish or bearish? Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided insights into Cardano‚Äôs current setup, sharing a detailed technical analysis on X. According to Martinez, ADA is currently forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic chart structure that often precedes a major price move. The setup suggests that once the pattern resolves, Cardano could experience a 40% price swing in either direction. If ADA breaks out to the upside and confirms the move with strong volume, it could trigger a massive rally, potentially taking the price toward new short-term highs. Such a move would likely reinvigorate market sentiment and attract fresh buying interest. On the other hand, if Cardano fails to hold critical demand levels, a breakdown could result in a significant decline, leading to extended bearish pressure. Related Reading: Hedera Successfully Retests Key Demand Level ‚Äì Expert Says The Next Stop Could Be $0.52 The coming days will be crucial for Cardano as it tests these critical levels. Traders are closely watching for confirmation of the breakout direction, as the outcome could set the stage for ADA‚Äôs trajectory in the weeks ahead. Whether the symmetrical triangle leads to a bullish rally or a bearish correction, the resolution of this consolidation phase will undoubtedly have a major impact on Cardano‚Äôs future performance in the crypto market. Price Struggles Below $1 Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.98, struggling to regain momentum after several days of being unable to break back above the crucial $1 mark. This psychological level has proven to be a significant barrier, and reclaiming it as support is essential for bulls to regain control of the price action. For ADA to shift into a more bullish trajectory, it needs to break above $1 and hold it firmly as support. Such a move would signal renewed buying interest and could set the stage for further upward momentum. In the short term, the next target for ADA would be the $1.05 level. A breakout above this resistance could trigger a significant rally, potentially reigniting optimism among investors. However, the downside risks remain. If ADA loses the $0.95 support level, it could face a deeper correction phase, as this would signal increased selling pressure. Such a move might lead to further bearish sentiment, challenging the broader market‚Äôs stability.

This happened as Donald Trump became the 47th US President, launched a digital asset stockpile, and reaffirmed his promise of turning the US into the capital of cryptocurrency. With these, the experts believe that the market may go through significant positive changes, addressing the investors to build their portfolios. In this blog, let‚Äôs discuss the top 5 crypto to buy this weekend before they gain bullish momentum. Top 5 Crypto To Buy & Why The cryptocurrency market offers millions of cryptocurrencies with different features, functions, and hype. However, only a few shares of cryptos could gain investors‚Äô attention, and they offer significant returns amid market volatility and dynamic conditions. As a result, investors can consider these five top altcoins mentioned in this blog to buy and plan their profits strategically. This became more significant as Donald Trump reaffirmed his crypto commitments. 1. Solana Solana has dominated the market for years, and its meme coins, stablecoins, etc., have reached their prime with increased demand. The altcoin has recently created an ATH at $294.33 and is aiming for higher, with ETF approval in the picture. The Grayscale filed for Solana ETF , which could fuel the SOL price rally to $4,700 per some analysts. 2. Cardano Cardano awaits a bullish rally after its position in the consolidation zone within a symmetrical triangle pattern. Though the price struggles in the past scenario, this technical setup hints at a bullish breakout, where the ADA price could surge 40% in the optimistic situation. The present scenario makes it the perfect crypto for long-term holdings. 3. Ethereum Ether‚Äôs demand has persistently increased, which involves the spot Ethereum ETF launch and its success among investors. Now, Donald Trump‚Äôs project WLFI loading on ETH indirectly hints at future milestones. Regardless, its constant growth has made it among the trending crypto to buy and the perfect digital asset for long-term holdings. 4. Dogecoin With Donald Trump‚Äôs win, Dogecoin has performed well. Experts have anticipated higher rallies with Trump‚Äôs presidency and Elon Musk‚Äôs support, especially as they have launched the Department of Government Efficiency, or D.O.G.E. Being a popular meme coin, it has high potential, but its volatility should be considered. 5. Pepe Coin This frog-themed meme coin has had multiple all-time rallies, offering increasing gains. Due to its hype, it has gained the status of the most bullish altcoin in 2024, which is also anticipated for 2025. It is in its consolidating phase, which could turn into an uptrend with significant bullish momentum with time. Is Altcoin Season Next In Line? The altcoin season has been discussed ever since the Bitcoin halving in 2024, often leading to the bull run and alt dominance. The historical trends and analysts‚Äô analysis hint at its occurrence in 2025. However, the Glassnode co-founder Jan Happel claims that Bitcoin dominance (BTCD) must decline for altcoin season while maintaining the BTC price above $100K. The current market conditions contradict this situation. Additionally, cryptocurrency analyst Ali has presented the biggest challenge in the alt season: the high number of altcoins, which is changing the market dynamics. Despite this, a few analysts have predicted that the altcoin season will form this year based on other significant factors. According to these, alt dominance will hit the market in mid-2025, but before that, the Bitcoin price could rally to $120k or higher. What‚Äôs in There For You? Whether the altcoin season hits or not, the 2024 semi-season offered quite bullish conditions for investors. The same outlook can happen with Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency due to his stake in the cryptocurrency industry and its development. Moreover, reserves and ETFs are in discussion. If this happened, it could fuel the industry‚Äôs demand to a new high. Before this happens, experienced investors recommend setting up a smart portfolio with diverse token holdings, risk management, and other important trading skills.

Notably, the DEX platform has marked monumental strides, acquiring a majority stake in the crypto trading platform Moonshot, among other advancements. As an upshot, the native token‚Äôs price soared remarkably intraday, with market watchers anticipating further gains amid recent developments. JUP Price Bullish Amid Jupiter‚Äôs Moonshot & Sonarwatch Acquisition Plans Jupiter co-founder, going by the pseudo-name Meow, posted on X as of January 25, revealing that the Solana DEX has acquired a majority stake in Moonshot. Intriguingly, Moonshot is a crypto trading platform that focuses on meme coin transactions, and it has recently gained a large number of new users in the wake of the Trump token event and soaring focus toward the top meme coins . Primarily, the stake acquisition sparked significant market discussions, paving the way for collaboration between the entities for the ‚Äúfuture of memes,‚Äù as indicated by the co-founder on X. Further, it‚Äôs also worth pointing out that DEX acquired Sonarwatch, a Solana on-chain portfolio tracker. Notably, with this acquisition, the DEX aims to launch a page where users can track Solana‚Äôs on-chain activity. Overall, these movers appear to have cemented a bullish market sentiment for the DEX‚Äôs native coin, as seen by the recent upswing in JUP price. Jupiter Goes Back Into Beta: What‚Äôs Happening? Meanwhile, another X post by the DEX‚Äôs community today revealed that the platform is going into the beta phase as its reinvented platform is now live. The Jupiter Spot V2 has been introduced, with key features likely to be rolled out over the next few weeks. Notably, the new reinvented platform is set to offer features such as ultra Mode, RTSE, organic scoring, smart trigger orders, Jupiter Shield, magical mobile updates, and major changes to perps and JLP, a liquidity token for the DEX‚Äôs perpetual platform. Altogether, this monumental feat has further uplifted the market sentiment for JUP price. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the Solana DEX today revealed a revolutionary idea, allowing users to deposit JLP and borrow USDC. This maneuver further supports the stablecoin by offering higher utilization rates whilst also enhancing APY for JLP holders. In turn, broader ecosystem perspectives for Jupiter and its native token remain optimistic amid the abovementioned advancements. JUP Price Soars 10% At the time of reporting, JUP price witnessed a staggering 10% pump and is sitting at $0.9425. The coin‚Äôs 24-hour low and high were $0.8208 and $0.968, respectively. As mentioned above, the latest ecosystem developments appear to have sparked a bullish sentiment for the native token as it defies the broader crypto market trend. Traders also reacted positively to the announcements, as flagged by a 13% rise in the intraday trading volume to $441.88 million. Coinglass data showcased an 18% surge in the coin‚Äôs futures OI to $263.87 million. Further, even the derivatives volume shot up by 30% to $1.08 billion. This indicated that the asset enjoys a bullish trend amid rising market interest, primarily driven by the latest ecosystem developments.

Meanwhile, the deployment of XRP Ledger for automated smart contracts is bound to run through a very attractive upside that analysts expect from the underlying asset in the new year. The advance of Ripple on the regulatory front is especially important to its market price going forward. Right up until the US court chopped the SEC‚Äôs requested fine from $2 billion to $125 million last August, the lawsuit crippled XRP price growth. . @Ripple Takes Over Washington DC pic.twitter.com/S1RGlueVED ‚Äî XRP (@BankXRP) January 20, 2025 That dramatic swing from a $2 billion hit to a slap-on-the-wrist fine signaled the utter lack of merit to the SEC‚Äôs arguments in the government‚Äôs view. After that, when crypto markets rallied again on the victory of President Donald Trump in the November US elections, XRP took a moonshot ride up the chart. As a result, its gains for the trailing 12-month period significantly outsize those of its Top 4 non-stablecoin competitors by market cap. For the 12 months ending Jan. 25, Ethereum moved slowly with 40% gains. Meanwhile, Bitcoin gained a decent 160% by cryptocurrency ROI standards. Solana jumped by 201%. But, Ripple‚Äôs XRP tokens grew by approximately 500%. Most of that was after the August US District Court decision and the November election. Ripple Labs winning at the forefront of the regulatory battle with the US government cements its place as a leader in the blockchain sector. That creates more long-term support for XRP‚Äôs price. Here are four signals that XRP has more growth left in it in 2025: 1. Trump Bump Pushes XRP Price Forward The reelection of President Donald Trump to the White House is a deliciously bullish portent for XRP prices in the coming years. Not only has Ripple Labs prevailed through the grueling years of a hot SEC lawsuit, but Mr. Trump himself sat down with Ripple‚Äôs leadership team on Jan. 7 to discuss crypto‚Äôs future. BREAKING: RIPPLE CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE & RIPPLE LAWYER STUART ALDEROTY JUST MET WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP! 2025 WILL BE INSANELY BIG FOR #XRP pic.twitter.com/gNLD2Vf9KO ‚Äî (@_Crypto_Barbie) January 8, 2025 Since Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in November, XRP token prices rallied 500% . The nice-making with President Trump and other government officials is no mere window dressing. It has substance to it. ‚ÄúGreat dinner last night with Donald Trump and Stuart Alderoty,‚Äù said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on a photo of him and Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty meeting with the then president-elect. In another post, Alderoty piped in to say, ‚ÄúThe beef bourguignon was really good.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just in the US where Ripple is making great strides forward with governments. It‚Äôs primarily a cross-border payment platform for large institutions moving vast amounts of cash. Foreign central banks are working on using Ripple technology and platforms to issue central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). 2. Investor Touts XRP Chart Strength Meanwhile, more cryptocurrency investors may be taking another look at XRP after its class-leading gains over the past three months. One former XRP skeptic, Practical Crypto Capital, was once bearish on the asset but recently flipped to bullish. The analyst once stated that there is ‚Äúno reason to hold XRP for the long term.‚Äù But they recently changed their tune, saying that Ripple‚Äôs settlement tokens could easily double over their January levels: ‚ÄúWith all the momentum building for XRP, I believe it could easily provide another price doubling, and possibly much more.‚Äù The analyst pointed to ‚Äúchart strength, upcoming positive events, and an over-enthusiastic community behind XRP.‚Äù PCC is a research analyst on Seeking Alpha who says they manage a 7-figure portfolio ‚Äúcurrently 100% in cryptocurrencies and/or related businesses.‚Äù Practical Crypto Capital isn‚Äôt so into the cross-border payments narrative or CBDCs long term, but depending on what altcoins they‚Äôve been minding, XRP Ledger may give them some other reasons to be bullish. On January 28th, for XRP Community Day, Ripple President Monica Long will discuss Ripple Labs‚Äô main priorities for 2025 with a big focus on XRP Ledger. Join @MonicaLongSF , Ripple‚Äôs President, as she discusses Ripple‚Äôs key priorities for 2025, including how the company is utilizing the XRPL to drive innovation and ecosystem growth.

Big XRP Whale Splashes Crypto economies are vast and rapidly expanding but still small enough that whale-sized moves by major participants can build and sustain lasting price support and growth momentum. Whale support for XRP is strong in January. On Jan. 10, such large market participants bought over 1 billion XRP tokens in under 48 hours, worth some $2.3 billion at the time of purchase. After that, on Saturday, Jan. 18, an XRP whale moved 30,000,000 XRP valued at $95,519,899 at the time from an Upbit to an unknown wallet. While there is no guarantee that this whale won‚Äôt sell those tokens later, it lowers the liquidity supply on crypto exchanges, which supports XRP prices. 30,000,000 #XRP (95,519,899 USD) transferred from #Upbit to unknown wallet https://t.co/FwwJoMhxET ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 19, 2025 4. New SEC Chair to End ‚ÄòWar on Crypto‚Äô A big part of the Trump bump is the moral support from the White House administration for an industry that was even legally questionable in the United States until recently. In China, cryptocurrencies have been banned altogether. In addition to the president‚Äôs broad support for cryptocurrency adoption, he‚Äôs pledged to appoint an SEC chair who is legally fair to the sector. The new SEC chair, Mark Uyeda, told Fox Business in November that ‚ÄúThe Commission‚Äôs war on crypto must end, including crypto enforcement actions solely based on a failure to register with no allegation of fraud or harm.‚Äù ‚ÄúPresident Trump and the American electorate have sent a clear message. Starting in 2025, the SEC‚Äôs role is to carry out that mandate,‚Äù Uyeda added.

ADA has declined by 10% recently, leaving 204 million ADA holders in loss. This trend raises questions about the possibility of a deeper price crash for the cryptocurrency. 204M ADA Holders in Loss, Is Cardano Price Crash Next? Cardano price is facing downward pressure as over 204 M ADA tokens are currently in a loss In Between the price of $0.98 to $1.27. This signals growing investor concern amid a recent pullback from its recent highs. The price has struggled to maintain momentum after a strong rally, raising questions about whether a correction is on the horizon. ADA‚Äôs loss refers to the number of tokens bought at a higher price than their current market value. When a large portion of tokens are lost, it often leads to panic selling or reduced buying pressure, increasing the risk of a price drop. Investors closely monitor key support levels to determine whether a top altcoin can sustain its gains or if further declines are imminent. Source: Santiment Whales Dump 180M ADA Tokens Santiment data reveals Cardano whales offloaded over 180 million ADA tokens this past week. Analyst Ali highlights the correlation between ADA price fluctuations and declining whale holdings. This large-scale sell-off has raised concerns about Cardano‚Äôs short-term performance, reflecting potential pressure on ADA‚Äôs market value amidst increased whale activity in the ecosystem. Source- X Cardano Price Analysis The latest ADA price is $0.9762, reflecting a 3% decline over the past 24 hours. The price is struggling to reclaim the $1.00 resistance level, showing signs of weakening bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44, indicating a neutral-to-bearish sentiment. The MACD indicator also signals a lack of strong momentum. The MACD line is below the signal line, showing a slightly bearish crossover. For Cardano price prediction to regain bullish momentum, it must break the $1.00 psychological resistance and establish a higher trading range. If it succeeds, the next resistance to watch is $1.10. However, failure to hold current levels could lead to a drop toward $0.90, with $0.85 as the next key support. Cardano Price Chart: TradingView Can Bulls Catalyze 40% Move for ADA? Crypto analyst Ali has highlighted a potential breakout for Cardano price, noting that the asset is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern. According to his analysis, this technical formation suggests a decisive move up to 40% is imminent. The analyst illustrates the narrowing price range of ADA, with both lower highs and higher lows forming a converging triangle. Typically, symmetrical triangles indicate a period of consolidation before a significant breakout in either direction. Tweet Cardano‚Äôs price faces a critical juncture, with significant risks and opportunities ahead. Market participants are eyeing key resistance and support levels, while technical indicators remain mixed. Whale activity and symmetrical triangle patterns add further intrigue, setting the stage for a decisive move.

Table of Contents Pepe Coin‚Äôs path to $1 Yeti Ouro: Combining fun with utility Yeti Ouro‚Äôs presale Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with speculative discussions about potential price movements, with Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) being at the center of such debates. Pepe Coin‚Äôs price faces a real challenge to reach $1, but Yeti Ouro makes waves as experts predict it might pass this milestone soon. A closer look at both tokens reveals fresh developments, market trends, and Yeti Ouro‚Äôs attractive features, especially its Play-to-Earn game, Yeti Go. Pepe Coin‚Äôs path to $1 Pepe Coin takes its roots from the Pepe the Frog meme and has gained a notable position in the meme coin sector. The token‚Äôs market value shows fast upward moves along with active backing from its dedicated followers, next to viral promotion tactics. However, a rise to $1 for Pepe Coin from its present price of about $0.000015 needs an immense jump in value ‚Äì which calls for more than just ongoing community excitement. A coin must offer real life uses as well as solid business deals to reach such targets, features PEPE hasn‚Äôt developed yet. Although Pepe Coin reached notable peaks in the past due to market excitement, a rise to $1 would need an almost unreal increase in total value, putting it next to major financial assets. The fast changing crypto market makes many things possible but PEPE‚Äôs path points to modest gains that stem from the lasting popularity of memes rather than such a high price target. You might also like: XRP could reach $30 by end of 2025, meanwhile Yeti Ouro thrives Yeti Ouro: Combining fun with utility The Yeti Ouro project blends meme coin fun along with practical value via Yeti Go ‚Äì a Play-to-Earn racing game built on Unreal Engine 5. This game excels as an action-filled plus strategic experience where players battle in PvP races, using power-ups and hazards for victory. A team of skilled partners has produced exceptional graphics as well as smooth gameplay. Yeti Go draws players in with its wild fun plus offers YETIO token rewards for victories, completed challenges, and special competitions. Here is a glimpse into level one of the game map. YETIO‚Äôs tokenomics are built for growth, with a total supply capped at 1 billion tokens. A key feature is the 5% burn mechanism, which could drive up the token‚Äôs value by reducing supply over time. This model, combined with the excitement around P2E gaming, positions YETIO as more than a meme token, potentially leading to significant price appreciation, with predictions suggesting it could surpass $1 in the coming months. Having been audited by SolidProof, a reputable company in security, has further strengthened investors confidence. Yeti Ouro‚Äôs presale Yeti Ouro is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.017 with a 10% bonus for new investors. This follows an impressive Stage 1 which completed early, showcasing substantial early interest. With Stage 2 already raising over 32% of its target, the presale‚Äôs success indicates strong market confidence. This level of interest, coupled with the utility offered by Yeti Go, underlines why YETIO is viewed as a promising project. Conclusion While Pepe Coin‚Äôs road to $1 by 2025 faces real hurdles, Yeti Ouro tells a fresh story. The token‚Äôs connection to an exciting P2E game plus smart token economics makes it an interesting bet to hit or pass $1. The token mixes fun with profit potential.

With cutting-edge features such as self-improving trading bots, dual-chain capabilities for Solana and Ethereum, and enhanced quantum-resistant security, IntelMarkets is emerging as a disruptor in the crypto industry. Priced at $0.082 during its current presale, analysts suggest INTL could hit $10, which excites investors on the lookout for the next significant opportunity in the crypto arena. Can Dogecoin (DOGE) See a Surge Due to Whale Accumulation? While a lot of meme coin enthusiasts concentrated on $TRUMP, which skyrocketed by more than 250%, Dogecoin whales discreetly acquired 1.83 billion DOGE over a two-day span. As noted by blockchain expert Ali Martinez, there was an increase in holdings among addresses with 100 million to 1 billion DOGE, indicating a bullish outlook. Whales often play a crucial role in the meme coin market, triggering quick price hikes or drops. This trend could potentially lead to more Dogecoin price surges, especially if it maintains its presence on social media. Source: CoinMarketCap Dogecoin has been hovering around $0.3629, experiencing a 4% rise over the past day. Experts think that whales took advantage of the calmer market conditions‚Äîwhen $TRUMP was the main focus‚Äîto buy DOGE at cheaper rates. This quiet setting minimized volatility, presenting an ideal chance for large investors. Should Dogecoin garner new attention, whales might trigger a substantial rally in the near future. IntelMarkets (INTL) Poised for a $10 Surge with Binance & Uniswap Listings IntelMarkets (INTL) sets itself apart as the pioneering AI-driven trading platform, offering distinctive trading bots and features that elevate it above its peers. This breakthrough is attracting both seasoned traders and newcomers, making it a prominent choice in the trading landscape. At the heart of its innovation are IntelMarkets‚Äô Intelli-M‚Ñ¢ trading robots. These bots continuously learn and feature AI-enhanced autopilot trading capabilities. Users can define their objectives and automate trades on IntelMarkets, streamlining the process for traders of all levels. This automated approach holds the potential to transform trading. The platform's dual-chain support for Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) offers traders versatility and ease of use. This functionality has fueled enthusiasm for its ongoing ICO, attracting numerous investors eager to participate. Security remains a primary concern for IntelMarkets. The QuantumX Wallet safeguards assets against quantum computing threats. The $1 million Route X21 initiative further demonstrates the project's dedication to mitigating quantum-related risks. The INTL token is the backbone of the IntelMarkets ecosystem. Token holders enjoy governance voting rights and can receive up to 30% discounts on trading fees. The project's presale has shown remarkable performance. Early backers from the initial presale phase have already seen gains of 811%. IntelMarkets has raised over $7 million to date, with expectations to reach $10 million by month's end. Currently valued at $0.082, INTL is set for growth and will increase to $0.091 in the next phase. Potential listings on major platforms like Binance and Uniswap could propel the token's value to $10.

As 2025 unfolds, Stellar‚Äôs ecosystem is thriving with an impressive 28 million users and over 30 billion tokens in circulation. Meanwhile, Ethereum is navigating regulatory challenges and market volatility, all while maintaining its position as a cornerstone of decentralized finance (DeFi). Both projects demonstrate resilience and innovation, but there‚Äôs a new player shaking things up. Enter Qubetics. With a presale success that‚Äôs turned heads, Qubetics is the talk of the town. More than 436 million tokens have been sold, raising over $10.5 million, and with its innovative Cross-Border Transactions feature, it‚Äôs poised to solve problems its predecessors couldn‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre searching for the highest ROI crypto this year, Qubetics might just be your answer. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into what makes these three projects worth your attention. Qubetics: The Future of Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another crypto project; it‚Äôs a revolution in the making. Currently in its 18th presale stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0551, attracting over 15,900 holders. What‚Äôs driving this buzz? A key feature that stands out is Cross-Border Transactions . Picture this: a small business owner in Miami wants to pay a supplier in Singapore. Traditional methods involve high fees, slow processing times, and currency conversion headaches. Qubetics eliminates all that. Its blockchain-based system ensures near-instant transactions with minimal costs. Whether you‚Äôre a freelancer in Toronto receiving payment from Europe or a global company managing supply chain payments, Qubetics makes it seamless. The platform‚Äôs transparency and speed also benefit individuals. Imagine sending money to family abroad without dealing with expensive remittance services. Qubetics simplifies the process, ensuring your loved ones receive funds quickly and securely. Analysts are raving about the potential of $TICS tokens. With predictions of significant ROI post-presale and at mainnet launch, Qubetics stands out as the highest ROI crypto in today‚Äôs market. Its ability to address real-world challenges makes it a must-watch. Stellar: Scaling Adoption Through Network Growth Stellar has come a long way, and 2025 looks like a defining year for this blockchain giant. After a remarkable 600% price surge in late 2024, XLM is holding steady at $0.47, showcasing stability amid market volatility. Stellar‚Äôs network boasts almost 28 million users and a burn of over 55 billion tokens, increasing scarcity and boosting value. What makes Stellar unique is its focus on financial inclusion. Take, for example, a community bank in rural Mexico. Using Stellar‚Äôs blockchain, they can provide banking services to individuals who previously had no access to financial tools. From remittances to microloans, Stellar is making a difference where it matters most. Technical analysis points to key resistance levels at $0.50 and $0.55. If XLM breaks through these, experts believe the price could climb to $1.05. This growth potential, combined with a rapidly expanding user base, positions Stellar as a top contender for the highest ROI crypto. As trust in the Stellar network grows, so does its adoption. Developers are leveraging its infrastructure to build innovative solutions, from DeFi platforms to cross-border payment systems. With such momentum, Stellar is proving that scalability and real-world impact go hand in hand. Ethereum: Navigating Challenges and Leading DeFi Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is no stranger to the spotlight. But 2025 presents unique challenges for this blockchain pioneer. Regulatory scrutiny and market volatility are testing Ethereum‚Äôs resilience, drawing parallels to XRP‚Äôs previous hurdles. Despite this, Ethereum‚Äôs foundation remains strong, processing thousands of smart contracts daily. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum has sparked concerns, but it‚Äôs also driving innovation. The platform‚Äôs transition to proof-of-stake has reduced energy consumption by 99%, addressing one of the most significant criticisms of blockchain technology. This shift not only improves Ethereum‚Äôs environmental footprint but also enhances its scalability. Imagine a decentralized app developer in Silicon Valley. Ethereum‚Äôs robust infrastructure allows them to build and deploy applications that revolutionize industries, from finance to gaming. Despite regulatory headwinds, Ethereum continues to attract institutional investors, thanks to nearly 30 major technical upgrades that have solidified its position in the market. Trading patterns suggest Ethereum is in a period of consolidation, a precursor to dramatic price movements. With strong trading volumes and institutional interest, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. While it faces challenges, its role in DeFi and smart contract innovation ensures it remains a top contender for the highest ROI crypto. How Cross-Border Transactions Work and Their Importance Cross-border transactions are at the heart of Qubetics‚Äô innovation. By leveraging blockchain technology, these transactions eliminate intermediaries, reducing costs and speeding up processes. Imagine a tech startup in New York paying a vendor in Berlin. With Qubetics, the payment is processed in seconds, with transparency and minimal fees. Traditional systems rely on a web of banks and payment processors, each taking a cut and adding delays. Blockchain simplifies this by creating a decentralized ledger where transactions are recorded in real time. Qubetics takes it a step further with TICSScan, allowing users to monitor and verify transactions, ensuring trust and efficiency. The impact of this technology is immense. For businesses, it streamlines international trade and reduces overheads. For individuals, it means sending money abroad without hidden charges. Qubetics‚Äô focus on cross-border transactions is a testament to its commitment to solving real-world problems and solidifying its position as the highest ROI crypto. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity The cryptocurrency landscape is evolving, and projects like Qubetics, Stellar, and Ethereum are leading the charge. Qubetics stands out with its innovative Cross-Border Transactions feature and impressive presale success. Stellar‚Äôs focus on scalability and financial inclusion continues to drive adoption, while Ethereum‚Äôs resilience and role in DeFi keep it at the forefront of blockchain innovation. If you‚Äôre looking for the highest ROI crypto , these three projects offer unique opportunities. Whether you‚Äôre an investor, a developer, or someone curious about blockchain‚Äôs potential, now is the time to dive in. The future is being built today‚Äîdon‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of it.

He earlier said that crypto is the currency for AI. Crypto has also been backed for broader utility when it comes to transactions. Binance Founder Changpeng CZ Zhao on Crypto and AI Binance Founder Changpeng CZ Zhao published a post on X saying that crypto is a preferred currency for AI. This was soon followed by another post wherein he highlighted that AI transactions would side with cryptocurrencies as AI chooses efficiency over emotions. CZ emphasized that AI transactions will side with cryptocurrencies because they are low-cost, offer fast confirmation, and are decentralized. Source: CZ, X That statement was published in response to a query by an X user, Crypto King. He had asked what AI prefers to transact with. Meanwhile, Binance Founder Changpeng CZ Zhao remains confident that the future of crypto is bright under the Trump Administration. He applauded when Donald Trump signed a key executive order to develop a new digital stockpile in the US. Broader Role of AI in Crypto Transactions There are underlined roles that Artificial Intelligence is already playing in facilitating crypto transactions. These pertain to supporting automated transactions, analyzing market sentiments for traders, and helping them to understand prevailing trends in the market. Thereby, helping not only professional traders minimize their losses but also helping beginners in getting started on a good note. Needless to say, it is still recommended to do research and risk assessment before any crypto trade is executed. So, while crypto transactions are already backed by AI, Binance Founder Changpeng CZ Zhao believes that when AI transactions get mainstream then it will help boost cryptocurrencies due to the set of benefits they have. More Support for Crypto Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is another notable figure to have come out in support of cryptocurrencies. He specifically talked about Bitcoin during a Gold Vs. Bitcoin discussion at Davos, saying that it has broader utility and hence, has an advantage over Gold. Brian Armstrong later took to X to highlight that Bitcoin also had the advantages of being fungible, censorship-resistant, and decentralized. All those advantages align with what Binance Founder Changpeng CZ Zhao said in an X post in response to Crypto King. Overall, it is expected that the future of cryptocurrencies and AI, combined, is bright now that Donald Trump has reaffirmed his commitment to making the US the crypto capital , and is determined to strengthen companies that are working to advance Artificial intelligence.

However, the ever-evolving crypto landscape constantly seeks new prospects, as Solana's price continues to fluctuate. One such promising opportunity is DTX Exchange , which has already experienced a remarkable 35,200% increase. Boasting cutting-edge features and a community that's expanding swiftly, this altcoin is positioning itself to offer early investors a chance at 100x returns. But is the project equipped to deliver on this promise? Let's delve deeper. DTX Exchange Surges 35,200% with Potential for Even More Growth DTX Exchange has captured the crypto community's attention with a staggering 35,200% rise during its presale stages. Currently, the DTX token is valued at $0.16, with forecasts indicating additional growth as the project gears up for its official debut. This dramatic rise reflects growing faith in DTX's innovative capabilities and its potential to transform trading. Driving this momentum is the anticipated launch of DTX Exchange's unique Layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX. This blockchain allows users to seamlessly trade over 120,000 traditional financial assets, including stocks, ETFs, crypto, bonds, and more. The blockchain also boasts an impressive trade execution speed of 200,000 transactions per second, as demonstrated in recent testnet trials. With a community of over 500,000 holders and a robust ecosystem, DTX Exchange is poised to rival major players like SOL. Its appeal extends beyond AI innovations, as the gradual price increase during presale has significantly contributed to the project's excitement and potential. Can Solana (SOL) Keep Its Edge Amidst Growing Competition? As of January 23, Solana's price hovers around $250, experiencing a slight dip. However, recent days have been noteworthy for Solana, as it reached an all-time high of $294.33. This peak was driven by the launch of the $TRUMP token on the SOL blockchain, which achieved a $13.5 billion market cap shortly before Donald Trump's inauguration. Source: CoinMarketCap Technical analysis indicates a bullish trend for Solana, with 60% of signals from moving averages supporting this outlook. However, short-term indicators suggest a strong bearish trend, warranting caution. Expert opinions on Solana's future price vary. Some analysts predict that Solana could achieve new all-time highs by 2025, driven by factors such as the Bitcoin Halving and increased Solana ecosystem adoption, largely due to the memecoin buzz. Despite SOL's pioneering status and bullish trend, investors are increasingly looking towards DTX Exchange as the next significant development in the crypto market. DTX Exchange Poised for Market Entry with 100x Growth Potential DTX's innovative offerings have led analysts to foresee a 100x growth potential, making it a formidable player in the trading ecosystem. The project focuses on real-world utility and advanced trading features. The platform offers traders up to 1000x leverage, enabling them to amplify their positions across diverse assets for substantial gains. For security, DTX Exchange employs Phoenix Wallet to safeguard users' assets. This wallet grants users complete control over their private keys, enhancing security. DTX also leverages the strengths of both Ethereum and SOL blockchains with a dual-chain approach, providing users with unmatched speed and resources. During its presale, DTX has raised over $12.5 million across eight stages. Currently, it's in the final round with an anticipated listing price of $0.20. This sets a strong foundation for DTX Exchange to expand and offer more valuable features to its users. Conclusion Solana has shown resilience even as the market trends downward. However, emerging platforms like DTX Exchange are redefining the trading space by meeting trading needs with automated AI tools. The platform is also bridging the divide between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), potentially swaying investor preferences.

But here‚Äôs the secret: low-priced tokens often hold the most explosive potential. Why? Because they‚Äôre accessible, you can accumulate thousands (or even millions) of tokens, and it doesn‚Äôt take much for them to skyrocket in value. This week, three cryptos under $1 are standing out: Doge Uprising , Tron, and Arbitrum. These tokens offer incredible opportunities for early adopters, but one of them‚ÄîDoge Uprising‚Äîmight just be the best meme coin to buy in 2025. Doge Uprising: A Meme Coin with a Purpose and a Presale to Match Imagine this: you invest in a token so early that the price is still a fraction of a cent. You buy thousands, maybe millions, of tokens, and when it explodes in value, you‚Äôre sitting on a fortune. That‚Äôs the opportunity Doge Uprising (DUP) offers right now. Currently in Stage 3 of its presale, $DUP is priced so low that even a modest investment could yield massive returns. Early investors are already grabbing tokens, rapidly raising over $200,000 during the presale. Unlike most meme coins that rely purely on hype, Doge Uprising is set to introduce staking, allowing you to lock up your tokens and earn passive income. Imagine making money just by holding onto your investment. Tron: The Blockchain That Keeps on Growing Tron is no stranger to the crypto world, but its low price makes it a compelling choice for investors looking to accumulate large amounts of a highly reliable token. Known for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, Tron is a favorite for decentralized applications (dApps) and content creators. While Tron isn‚Äôt a meme coin, its robust ecosystem and consistent growth make it a safe bet for those looking for steady returns. If you‚Äôre looking for a long-term hold with proven staying power, Tron should be on your list. Arbitrum: The Layer 2 Solution Taking Ethereum to the Next Level If you‚Äôre into Ethereum but want something faster and cheaper, Arbitrum is your go-to. As a Layer 2 scaling solution, Arbitrum enhances Ethereum‚Äôs capabilities by making transactions faster and more affordable. Developers who want to create decentralized apps without incurring excessive gas fees favor Arbitrum. Arbitrum‚Äôs low entry price and strong fundamentals make it a solid investment for 2025. While it may not offer the explosive gains of a meme coin, its utility in the Ethereum ecosystem ensures it remains a reliable choice. Why Doge Uprising Outshines the Rest While Tron and Arbitrum are strong contenders, Doge Uprising steals the spotlight. With its presale pricing, you have the opportunity to invest at the earliest stage and potentially earn 100x or even 1000x returns. When you combine the staking utility, NFT ecosystem, and viral meme appeal, the token has the potential to dominate the market by 2025. Don‚Äôt Miss Out on Doge Uprising If you‚Äôre looking for the best cryptos under $1, Doge Uprising, Tron, and Arbitrum all offer unique opportunities. However, Doge Uprising truly stands out. Its low price, high ROI potential, and innovative roadmap make it the best meme coin to buy this week. Join The Presale & Reap The Rewards Today!

Solana (SOL), a Layer 1 blockchain, has been touted as a future frontrunner due to its impressive transaction speeds and expanding ecosystem. However, the DTX Exchange is starting to capture the attention of investors globally. DTX offers an extraordinary 32,060% growth potential, possibly reshaping the future of the crypto sector. DTX Exchange: The Utility Token Boasting 200,000 TPS DTX Exchange is more than just another cryptocurrency initiative; it's the dawn of a new era in trading. DTX is crafted as a hybrid exchange platform, merging the best of traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi). This allows users to trade various assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities, all within a single platform. What sets DTX apart from Solana is its testnet achievement of 200,000 TPS, which is more than three times faster than SOL‚Äôs 65,000 TPS. The foundation of DTX Exchange is the VulcanX blockchain, engineered for exceptional speed, security, and scalability. This cutting-edge infrastructure enables transactions with minimal or no delays, appealing to both novices and experienced users. VulcanX also facilitates the smooth integration of conventional financial tools with blockchain technology, paving the way for widespread adoption in both traditional and institutional markets. Currently, DTX tokens are available in a presale for only $0.16. Predictions suggest that the token will experience significant growth following its official listing, potentially reaching a value of $50. This represents a staggering 32,060% return on investment. With such promising potential, DTX is expected to not only rival Solana's prices but potentially surpass SOL‚Äôs market achievements. Investors and analysts are keenly observing this exciting project. Solana Price Outlook: Is the SOL Dominance Waning? Solana (SOL) has emerged as a pivotal force in the blockchain space, recognized for its ability to process transactions swiftly and with low fees, attracting developers and users alike. As of January 25, 2025, Solana‚Äôs price stands at roughly $267.28, marking a 10% rise in the past 24 hours. This upward trend in Solana's price stems from the substantial adoption of its ecosystem. Solana‚Äôs decentralized exchanges (DEXs) recently hit a $200B monthly trading volume, solidifying SOL's status as a formidable ecosystem. The extensive support for decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) underlines this impressive valuation and the recent price surge. Additionally, the SOL ecosystem has been bolstered by effective USDC protocols and low transaction fees. Solana's price continues to climb, particularly with the potential introduction of a SOL ETF. Analysts predict that Solana prices might surpass a new all-time high of over $350 during the next bull market. Final Opportunity to Invest in the Next Solana While Solana has already carved out its place in the blockchain ecosystem, DTX Exchange presents a potential new era in trading. DTX distinguishes itself with its innovative approach to hybrid trading and substantial projected returns for early investors.

By merging blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI is transforming decentralized applications and positioning itself as a pivotal force in the crypto sphere. Presently in its presale stage priced at $0.005625 per token, Lightchain AI has already secured $12.9 million, reflecting strong investor trust. With its innovative strategy and clear development plan, Lightchain AI is becoming a formidable contender for Solana's leadership. Solana's Efforts to Sustain Its Market Position in 2025 In 2025, Solana is striving to sustain its position in the competitive financial landscape. The recent launch of the $TRUMP token on the Solana blockchain significantly boosted its visibility, with Solana's price climbing to $294. Analysts predict that Solana's price could reach $500 or even higher, citing its user-friendliness and extensive infrastructure. However, challenges persist, such as network disruptions and competition from emerging blockchains. To remain at the forefront, Solana is enhancing network stability, expanding its decentralized applications (dApps), and exploring new use cases. The anticipated approval of Solana-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could further solidify its market position. As the crypto industry evolves, Solana's ability to innovate and tackle these challenges will be crucial in maintaining its standing. Could Lightchain AI Eclipse Solana in the Coming Year? Lightchain AI is poised to potentially surpass Solana next year with its impressive presale, clear development path, and rapid-response infrastructure. Currently priced at $0.005625 per token, the presale has generated $12.9 million, drawing significant investor interest due to its advanced technology and early growth prospects. The development plan kicks off with prototype creation in November 2024, focusing on testing PoI and AIVM in controlled settings. The testnet release in January 2025 marks the beginning of real-world testing for node operators and developers. By March 2025, the mainnet launch will enable full features, including validator and contributor nodes. Growth of the ecosystem and worldwide adoption are aimed for mid-2025, ensuring scalability and integration. Its low-latency infrastructure is designed to support real-time AI computations, making Lightchain AI a competitive and scalable blockchain solution.

Key Levels and 2025 Forecasts",https://coingape.com/markets/can-ethereum-price-hit-4000-amid-bullish-signals-key-levels-and-2025-forecasts/,"Ethereum price trades around $3,300 and continues to move sideways, following Bitcoin‚Äôs lead. However, the outlook is optimistic due to a few bullish signals that forecast an uptrend for ETH in 2025. Let‚Äôs explore key levels to watch based on technical and on-chain analysis. Ethereum Price Today As of January 25, 2025, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $3,300, marking a 0.50% surge in the past 24 hours. Despite the stagnation, the outlook remains bullish due to a few technical signals, including a golden cross (50-period SMA crossing above the 200-period EMA). Additionally, the bullish declining histograms below the zero line continue to recede, suggesting a decline in bearish momentum and a hint that bulls are ready to take over. Lastly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also attempting to overcome the mean level of 50, indicating a resurgence of buying momentum. Key Levels to Watch While the chart forecast a bullish outlook due to technical indicators, here are some key levels investors need to keep an eye on. Resistance: $3,592, $3,975, $4,000, $4,069, $4,877, $5,863, $6,947. Support: $3,132, $3,057, $2,657, $2,341. ETH/USDT 1-day chart Technical Patterns Fuel Optimism While the technical and key levels are noted, let‚Äôs take a look at the daily Ethereum price chart to identify the formation of key patterns. Falling Wedge Connecting trend lines to the three lower highs and two lower lows reveals this setup, which forecasts a 17% move to $4,000. The contingency of this $4,000 target is that Ethereum price produces a daily candlestick close above the wedge‚Äôs upper trend line.

The resulting recovery rally could propel Ethereum price to a new all-time high of $7,000. Read more On-Chain Metrics & Whale Activity Although technical patterns, indicators and key levels provide a bias, it is better to confirm this initial bias with on-chain data. Whale Accumulation According to Santiment data , Ethereum‚Äôs Network added 180,000 new addresses this week, indicating renewed retail and institutional interest. Furthermore, futures data shows that open interest hit $65B, confirming the renewed interest.

DTX Exchange‚Äôs (DTX) uniqueness is its main appeal, merging the finest aspects of CEX and DEX. It strives to close the gap between traditional and decentralized finance, capturing attention in the $10 billion global trading sphere. Utilizing a unified Layer-1 blockchain, it aims to blend DeFi and TradFi, setting the stage to revolutionize the trading world. As it gears up for its launch in Q1, it's one of the emerging DeFi ventures to keep an eye on. DTX Exchange (DTX): Uniting Traditional and Decentralized Finance DTX Exchange (DTX) stands out due to its pioneering trading approach. By implementing a hybrid model, it differentiates itself and outshines competitors. Offering a comprehensive platform with access to both cryptocurrencies and traditional assets like stocks, ETFs, and forex, DTX aims to transform the trading arena. Central to its operation is VulcanX, a unified blockchain crafted to engage with traditional financial tools such as stocks and ETFs. Essentially, it seeks to blend conventional finance with Web3 innovations, enabling traders to maximize the financial landscape. Moreover, the platform amalgamates essential features of CEX and DEX. Acknowledging each one's limitations, this strategy is celebrated by industry specialists as revolutionary. DTX Exchange will be intuitive and easy to navigate‚Äîa claim not often made for most DEXs‚Äîand will incorporate features like wallet-based trading, non-custodial storage, asset tokenization, and distributed liquidity pools. This unique proposition explains the rising interest and growing demand for both the platform and its utility token. Besides applications like staking and governance, the DTX token is anticipated to be a valuable store of worth, prompting optimistic predictions and claims of being a prime crypto investment. Essential Features of the Exchange Previously, we highlighted the hybrid model as DTX's standout feature. However, there are additional aspects that will be detailed below. Wallet-Based Trading: Imagine accessing the entire financial market with just a crypto wallet. With its wallet-based trading system, users won't need conventional bank accounts to engage in global financial markets. The Phoenix Wallet will facilitate the storage of both cryptocurrencies and tokenized traditional assets. Distributed Liquidity Pools: These will be utilized to enhance liquidity and minimize slippage. By aggregating liquidity from diverse sources, a more streamlined trading environment is created. On-Chain Order Book: The DTX protocol will feature an on-chain order book that keeps a transparent record of all trading orders, ensuring open and verifiable trading operations. Smart Contracts: These will be instrumental in guaranteeing that transactions are both secure and automated, as per user intentions. The DTX Token: Growing Interest Among Investors Currently, the DTX token is one of the most highly sought after and could be this cycle's top crypto investment. Its potential as a leading ICO is remarkable, surpassing prominent crypto coins with larger market caps and limited growth potential. Early funding has already raised over $12.8 million amid high demand, with the presale entering its final phase. During round 8, the token is priced at just $0.16 and is predicted to appreciate up to 100x following Tier-1 exchange listings.

HYPE is trading for $23.20 at time of writing, up 4.9% in the last 24 hours.

Ripple‚Äôs XRP is once again in the limelight, setting its sights on the $5 threshold. This surge is fueled by renewed optimism in its ongoing legal clash with the SEC and its growing use in international payments. At the same time, Lightchain AI , an innovative blockchain initiative merging artificial intelligence, is quickly becoming a favorite among major investors. Its presale has already amassed $12.9 million, with tokens valued at $0.005625 each. These projects are at the forefront in 2025, but what exactly is drawing investors to Lightchain AI in such large numbers? XRP's Journey to Reach $5 As of January 25, 2025, XRP is trading at $3.14, marking a notable rise from its below-$2 valuation in late 2024. Analysts point to increased investor trust and favorable market dynamics as key reasons for this climb. Predictions for XRP's price by the close of 2025 vary. Some analysts believe it might hit or surpass $5, depending on factors like greater institutional adoption and general market trends. Notably, analyst Egrag has suggested a much more bullish outcome, with XRP potentially soaring to $50 in 2025, although this remains speculative. The upward trend of XRP is bolstered by its expanding role in international payments and strategic partnerships across the globe. What Draws Whales to Lightchain AI Lightchain AI (LCAI) is an inventive platform that merges artificial intelligence with blockchain, delivering innovative solutions across multiple sectors. Its tokenomics are crafted to be equitable and sustainable, with a total supply capped at 10 billion tokens allocated for presale, staking rewards, liquidity, marketing, the team, and treasury. What sets Lightchain AI ($LCAI) apart is its deflationary tokenomics model. Each transaction or AI task payment results in a portion of tokens being burned, effectively removing them from circulation. This gradual reduction in supply creates scarcity, which may increase the value of the remaining tokens over time. By combining state-of-the-art AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI is establishing itself as a transformative force in the digital landscape. Lightchain AI's Advantage Over Established Tokens Lightchain AI sets itself apart from XRP and other longstanding tokens by focusing on innovation and usefulness across various fields. While XRP excels in international payments, Lightchain AI provides advanced tools designed to aid developers and businesses in modernizing their operations with security and efficiency. Built on a scalable framework, Lightchain AI employs sophisticated sharding techniques to handle large transaction volumes, ensuring both speed and reliability. The platform emphasizes privacy, incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and homomorphic encryption to protect sensitive data during processing. Additionally, Lightchain AI fosters collaboration through its open-source development hub, offering APIs, SDKs, and sandbox environments to inspire innovation. More than just a cryptocurrency, Lightchain AI is a comprehensive technology platform poised to revolutionize traditional industries with its advanced solutions. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

However, the altcoin has seemingly encountered a setback, with its value falling by nearly 15% in the past week. While this downturn could be attributed to the uncertainty and drama surrounding Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, it could also be linked to the movement of large investors over the past week. Here‚Äôs how the Cardano whales sold in the last seven days. Whales Sold $180 Million Worth Of ADA Tokens Last Week In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez shared the amount of Cardano tokens offloaded by whales in the past week. This is based on the change in the wallet holdings of those who own between 100 million and 1 billion coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shark Wallets Set New Record: Bullish Foreshadowing For 2025? It is worth mentioning that addresses holding tokens of such magnitude are called whales. These entities are deemed significant as other market participants often watch their movements. Due to their substantial holdings, crypto whales often wield significant influence over the market and prices. Historically, prices of assets tend to move in the direction of these large investors (prices rise during whale accumulation and dip during whale sell-offs.) According to Martinez, the Cardano whales trimmed their holdings in the past week, offloading more than 180 million ADA tokens in the process. This sell-off is equivalent to around $185 million at the current market price. While determining the exact rationale behind the latest whale movement is difficult, it is not unusual for whales to lock in profits, especially after a price surge. For context, the Cardano price jumped nearly 30% from $0.9 to as high as $1.15 between January 13 and January 17. Furthermore, large-scale sell-offs by whales could indicate a shift in investor sentiment, especially if they expect a future price decline. They might try to cash in early to minimize or avoid losses. Ultimately, whales shaving their holdings doesn‚Äôt often bode well for an asset (Cardano, in this case), as it increases supply in the open market. Increased supply without sufficient demand to absorb the selling could exert bearish pressure on ADA‚Äôs price. Cardano Price At A Glance As of this writing, the ADA token is valued at around $0.97, reflecting a decline of over 1% in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin is down by about 15% in the last seven days.

A new ICO, however, is stealing the spotlight. Table of Contents Ripple whale transfer sparks frenzy as investors migrate to new meme coin Everything to know about Panshibi, the crypto jungle‚Äôs rising star Jump into the SHIBI presale for a chance at 1,200% returns The XRP price is making headlines, but not every story is positive. While some Ripple fans see the $3 mark as a milestone, others are worried about what comes next. From concerns about network efficiency to potential regulatory troubles to market behavior, the XRP price could crash. Meanwhile, a new crypto ICO is gaining attention due to the projected gains during and after its presale. Let‚Äôs see more in the rest of this article. Ripple whale transfer sparks frenzy as investors migrate to new meme coin A large XRP transfer is catching the attention of Ripple enthusiasts. Whale Alert, a platform that tracks big transactions, reported that 40 million Ripple tokens, worth about $124.8 million, were sent to Binance. This move has raised eyebrows in the crypto world. Such big moves often spark speculation, and this could signal a market shift. CoinMarketCap data shows that Ripple‚Äôs XRP‚Äôs value has increased significantly in the past week. The Ripple token is trading at $3.19, a 12.23% surge in its price from last week. Nonetheless, XRP‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 66, which means that while it is bullish, it is drawing close to the overbought levels. As such, Ripple investors need to be careful before committing their funds. However, amid the uncertainty concerning the Ripple token, a meme coin has emerged and promises big gains during its new crypto ICO. You might also like: Spokesperson clarifies no official plans for SOL and XRP futures after CME leak Everything to know about Panshibi, the crypto jungle‚Äôs rising star Panshibi (SHIBI) is not just another meme coin. It‚Äôs a project aimed at changing the way people see the crypto world. Unlike some projects that drag their presales for months, Panshibi has a clear 60-day timeline. This setup makes it fair for everyone to join and adds excitement with a set launch price and date. Whether someone is interested in fun, the best crypto to buy, or being part of something new, Panshibi offers a way in. The story behind Panshibi is unique. It‚Äôs about a special place called ‚ÄúBamboo Valley,‚Äù a peaceful zone in the larger blockchain world known as the ‚ÄúCrypto Jungle.‚Äù In this valley, the Panshibi Pandas protect their community. The project focuses on things like trust, decentralization, and keeping things sustainable. These ideas match the values of the Bamboo Valley. Panshibi‚Äôs roadmap is clear and simple. The 60-day presale has a pricing system where the SHIBI token gets more expensive as each stage sells out. This setup rewards early buyers and gives long-term holders a reason to stay. The SHIBI tokens are split smartly: most (60%) go to the presale, while the rest is for rewards, listings, marketing, and the team. The project has four main steps. First comes the presale. Then, it builds its ecosystem with features like staking and special NFTs. After that, SHIBI will appear on big decentralized exchanges like Uniswap . Plans include listings on major platforms like Binance too. Finally, the team will focus on growing its global reach with top-tier partnerships and new features. Panshibi currently stands out. The team‚Äôs vision includes making crypto accessible while creating a strong community. Whether for fun or serious investing, SHIBI might be worth a closer look. Jump into the SHIBI presale for a chance at 1,200% returns The SHIBI presale is growing stronger. Each SHIBI token is worth $0.002 in Stage 1, and that is a big steal. By Stage 2, SHIBI price will increase to $0.003, a 50% rise. Not motivated by this? There‚Äôs more. By the end of the SHIBI presale, investors would have made up to a 1,200% profit.

Picture a trader in the early days of financial markets, somewhere between the 18th and 19th centuries. During this time, traders were engaging in speculative agreements hinging on predictions. Whether it was oils, wheat, or other key commodities, the trader had to anticipate where prices would go in the coming weeks, months, or even years. These deals, known as futures contracts , are agreements to exchange goods at a predetermined price on a future, predetermined date. You might also like: Crypto fails as money and what needs to change | Opinion The essence of trading during this period was not just understanding current market activity but forecasting potential shifts over time. Futures contracts created a system that allowed forward-looking speculation and provided a mechanism for hedging against price fluctuations. Today, traders still rely on their intuition and experience to predict price movements but now have access to algorithms, machine learning models, and 24/7, real-time data analytics at the palm of their hands. Despite these significant technical advancements, the tension between risk and reward and the need for timely decision-making remains central to futures trading. Traditionally, traders have dealt with contract expiration dates and complex rollovers. Now, traders have the option to hold their positions indefinitely, which is where perpetual futures , or ‚Äúperps,‚Äù come into play. In crypto, perpetual futures are a new breed of future contracts, as the absence of a formal end date removes a significant amount of the time-based complexity. For crypto traders, perpetual futures offer more flexibility, as they can now enter and exit positions as they see fit, holding them to a self-determined timeline. However, this newfound flexibility doesn‚Äôt come without challenges that hinder its use. Despite the sophistication of available crypto trading tools, navigating the market successfully often requires a deep technical and strategic understanding, presenting a steep learning curve for even experienced traders. For this reason, many investors are still choosing to stick to traditional investment strategies that have served them for decades. However, even though institutional and government interest in crypto is at its peak, many remain cautious about fully embracing the new opportunities that come with it. This is especially true for institutions, as concerns over proper risk management tools and long-term trading tactics complicate the decision to take an active part in the crypto market. So what has changed? As the market shifts, investment managers now have access to more sophisticated platforms with a simplified interface. These platforms, powered by artificial intelligence, leverage advanced technologies that help traders create greater opportunities for return in an easier way. For instance, recent platform integrations like 3Commas with Coinbase Advanced allow traders to execute both perpetual and spot futures using algorithmic approaches. By providing more flexible trading capabilities, these tools help institutions navigate complex market dynamics with greater precision and confidence. The integration includes Coinbase Advanced perpetual futures trading, providing asset managers with the ability to explore the potential of perpetual futures and test predictive skills. Additionally, by leveraging artificial intelligence, traders can continuously refine their strategies to achieve desired outcomes. The financial landscape is growing beyond traditional approaches. To stay competitive in this transformation, institutions must explore alternative investment strategies and adopt tools to deliver greater desired outcomes for their clients. While this shift won‚Äôt happen overnight, those who start integrating these changes now will be ahead of the curve. While it might seem foreign at first, adopting this gradual adaptation and embracing new forms of investment opportunities is critical for long-term success.

This next-gen utility altcoin is designed for scalability and real-world use, supported by an ex-Solana developer. With advanced blockchain capabilities, DTX impressively achieves 200,000 TPS on its testnet, making it a noteworthy competitor in the crypto world. As the competitive landscape intensifies, Dogecoin's market dominance is being challenged by projects that offer real utility. Will DOGE retain its significance, or will investors shift to high-performance options like DTX? Dogecoin Price Undergoes Consolidation Amid Profit-Taking Surge Dogecoin's value recently dropped by 5%, settling at $0.35 following a series of bullish events, such as Trump's endorsement of Dogecoin and Bitwise's application for a spot DOGE ETF. Despite these positive developments, profit-taking by long-term holders led to a sell-the-news reaction, causing the price to decline. Source: Tradingview Experts in the market highlight that Dogecoin's fundamentals remain robust, with the $0.33 support level being crucial for traders. Bullish investors are actively working to defend this point, investing $55 million in leveraged positions to avert further declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) standing at 47.68 suggests oversold conditions, indicating a potential recovery if buying pressure returns. For DOGE to regain its upward momentum, it needs to surpass $0.362, which could initiate a rally towards $0.41. However, failing to maintain the $0.33 support might lead to further risks, potentially driving the price down to targets near $0.31 and $0.28. Solana's Rally Driven by Memecoins and Trump Token Introduction Solana (SOL) has experienced a 24% increase this week, reaching $261, primarily fueled by the memecoin craze. The launch of the Trump token on January 18 renewed focus on the Solana blockchain, enhancing activity and drawing new users. Source: Tradingview Nonetheless, analysts warn that Solana's current momentum, driven by speculative memecoin trading, might not last. On-chain activity has begun to slow, with daily active addresses falling from 16.5 million to 13 million and network fees decreasing by 67% to $11.7 million. Despite these issues, Solana continues to be a dominant force in DeFi and NFTs, with its price potentially challenging the $295 all-time high if bullish trends continue. However, surpassing $280 could take more time than expected due to declining network metrics and trading volumes on key DEXs like Raydium and Orca. DTX: The Utility Altcoin at the Forefront of Market Change As Dogecoin and Solana navigate market trends, DTX Exchange is rapidly establishing itself as a game-changer in the crypto sector. The DTX Token, now in its final presale phase and priced at $0.16, has already secured nearly $13 million, signaling strong investor trust. DTX distinguishes itself with its VulcanX blockchain, capable of handling 200,000 transactions per second (TPS)‚Äîan achievement even Solana hasn't matched. Built to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), the platform accommodates a diverse array of assets, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex, and tokenized real-world assets. The Phoenix Wallet, boasting over 330,000 downloads, further strengthens DTX's ecosystem by providing a secure and efficient multi-asset trading experience. Analysts predict a 440% gain upon listing, making it an attractive choice for those looking for a utility-focused asset with significant growth potential. Market Outlook As the crypto market intensifies, DTX Exchange is swiftly emerging as a leader in blockchain innovation. With its final presale round ongoing, this presents a rare chance for early investors. While Dogecoin and Solana continue to make waves, their dependence on speculative trends underscores the increasing significance of utility-centric projects like DTX. Supported by strong technology, real-world applications, and a possible 440% return on investment, DTX Token is set to disrupt the market and reshape investor expectations.

Bitcoin has surged past $100,000 again, and Pepe Coin appears to be stabilizing at last. Solana is leading the charge in DEX transactions over the last three months, with SOL still showing promising profit potential this year. Additionally, a new contender has entered the scene for the top crypto investment. Rollblock is introducing a novel approach to Defi and gambling. Bitcoin Price Outlook: How High Can BTC Climb? November saw Bitcoin's meteoric rise to the coveted $100,000 mark, and since then, the BTC price has largely maintained this level. Despite occasional dips due to market volatility, Bitcoin seems poised for further gains. Experts anticipate more upward trends for Bitcoin. James Check, a chief analyst at Glassnode, predicts that Bitcoin's price might soar to $150,000 within what he calls the 'topping cloud.' He believes any price above this point won't last long. Currently valued at about $104,664, is another BTC rally on the horizon? Solana Dominates DEX Volume Charts Launched in 2018, the SOL token aimed to enhance scalability in the fast-growing crypto sphere. Initially dubbed the 'Ethereum killer,' Solana seems to be finally closing the gap. Recent DEX transaction volumes have seen Solana blockchain taking the lead. Over 5 billion transactions were recorded in the past three months, translating to around $1.9 trillion, surpassing Ethereum's 1.13 billion transactions. While Ethereum still holds the top spot for TVL, Solana's surge in activity and development suggests this lead might not last. Solana is currently priced at $265.78, showing nearly a 20% increase this week. Pepe Coin Price: Has PEPE Hit a Bottom? Unlike many top altcoins, meme coins have faced significant corrections this year. PEPE, in particular, was affected by a token sell-off in the second week of January, pushing it below the $0.00002 support level. The launch of the Official Trump Coin last week delivered another hit to Pepe Coin's price. The buzz around TRUMP drew investors away from many meme projects, including PEPE. However, Pepe Coin seems determined to end the week positively, with a 5.59% increase in the last 24 hours. The coin is currently valued at approximately $0.000015. More bullish opportunities await on the Rollblock blockchain. Rollblock: Endless Profit Prospects! The Rollblock (RLBK) token is touted as the 'Future of Online Gambling,' and for good reason.

Polkadot is rebuilding momentum with its innovative parachain model, while Lightchain AI is revolutionizing blockchain with its seamless AI integration. With Lightchain AI raising $12.9 million in its presale at a token price of $0.005625, investors are debating which project holds the edge in delivering long-term value and growth potential. Polkadot‚Äôs Resurgence: Harnessing the Power of Parachains Polkadot has revitalized its blockchain framework by employing parachains, specialized blockchains that facilitate expansion and interoperability. These parachains operate alongside Polkadot's primary relay chain, benefiting from its security while retaining their distinct characteristics. This setup enables concurrent transaction processing, significantly enhancing network speed. Recent improvements include the introduction of Agile Coretime, optimizing resource allocation by allowing parachains to access core time as needed, fostering a more application-centric approach. Additionally, the implementation of backlogging has improved transaction verification, reducing finality times and enhancing throughput. These advancements position Polkadot as a premier platform for decentralized applications, providing developers with a robust and flexible environment for innovation. Lightchain AI‚Äôs Relentless Growth: The Intersection of AI and Blockchain Lightchain AI has rapidly become a transformative force by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. A key feature is its data integrity framework , ensuring that businesses can safely implement AI-driven solutions without risking sensitive data. This capability has made it a preferred option for sectors such as logistics and energy, where transparency and efficiency are essential. The platform‚Äôs multi-chain compatibility further boosts its attractiveness, allowing seamless integration with other blockchain networks. This ensures businesses and developers can adopt Lightchain AI‚Äôs solutions without disrupting their existing operations. With $12.9 million secured in its presale, Lightchain AI demonstrates strong investor trust, positioning itself as a leader in blockchain innovation. Evaluating Potential for Growth: Polkadot vs. Lightchain AI Polkadot‚Äôs strength lies in its capacity to enhance interoperability and scalability through its parachain model. Its long-term growth is backed by an expanding ecosystem and alliances with projects that utilize its unique framework. However, Polkadot encounters growing competition as more blockchains with similar ambitions emerge. Conversely, Lightchain AI‚Äôs emphasis on AI-enhanced blockchain solutions gives it a competitive edge in tackling real-world issues. Its capacity to serve multiple industries with scalable and efficient solutions has drawn institutional attention and positioned it as a high-growth project. While Polkadot benefits from its established presence, Lightchain AI‚Äôs innovation and presale achievements indicate strong momentum for future adoption and expansion. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. On-chain trends show investors moving from Ripple, Toncoin, and Solana to Rollblock, aiming for 50x returns and staking gains. Table of Contents Rollblock set for incredible 2025 as community rallies round Ripple coming to a U.S. strategic stockpile? Toncoin exclusively integrates with Telegram Solana gets the presidential nod Time is short to invest in Rollblock‚Äôs early presale stages A clear on-chain rotation has begun from legacy tokens such as Ripple, Toncoin, and Solana into the highly promising Rollblock (RBLK) presale. This represents one of the greatest opportunities in crypto right now as analysts predict astonishing 50x returns this year, and RBLK holders can enjoy a risk-free passive income simply by staking their bags and watching them grow. Rollblock set for incredible 2025 as community rallies round Rollblock stands at a hugely exciting moment in its development, as it stands to disrupt the enormous $500 billion online gaming industry over the coming months. Rollblock recently recorded a phenomenal December, seeing new user registrations surge by more than 600% and a whopping $1.75 million of bids placed across its platform. Rollblock gives its users huge peace of mind as all transactions are immortalized on the Ethereum blockchain. This will stamp out decades of shady bet manipulation now that everything can be verified with a few clicks. Rollblock features 7000 classic games and a recently launched sports prediction league that has opened up a vast new revenue stream. RBLK is destined for crypto gaming dominance thanks to its massive utility and potential to offer its holders an attractive passive income of up to 30%. Instead of selling, Rollblock gamers will likely hold their winnings and watch their portfolios grow week by week. Up to 30% of the platform‚Äôs profits are reinvested in buying up RBLK tokens, of which 60% are sent to a burner address to bring down the supply. The remaining tokens fund the staking APY. Rollblock‚Äôs scarcity will only become greater as the platform scales in 2025.

However, in the last month, Ripple holders have gained 38% as Ripple has rallied from $2.29 in the last 30 days. Ripple recently launched its RLUSD stablecoin with great success, with listings on Bitso, Bullish, and MoonPay. This is a major focus for the Ripple ecosystem this year and will drive massive growth of the Ripple chain. There are also hints that Donald Trump will add Ripple to a US strategic crypto reserve after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse met with Trump just before his inauguration. This would be enormous for Ripple and could see it dethrone Ethereum as the largest altcoin. Toncoin exclusively integrates with Telegram Toncoin recently became the Telegram messaging app‚Äôs exclusive blockchain provider. This will see Toncoin support many more dApps and Web3 features for the hugely popular communications provider. To onboard the next generation of crypto users, the Toncoin Foundation has recently been integrating TON Connect to enable rapid authentication without any need for passwords. Toncoin has lost 8% this week, falling to $5.15. Toncoin bounced from support at $4.75 but needs to see buyers stepping in here to push it back above $5.50. Solana gets the presidential nod Solana has been especially strong lately, having the biggest gains of any top 10 token this week. Solana has gained 21% in the last seven days, rallying to $264 at the current time. Solana was responsible for an astonishing 68% of all crypto transactions recently across all chains. The majority of this was down to the launch of President Trump‚Äôs meme coin, which stress-tested the entire Solana ecosystem. Despite some congestion, Solana handled this spike in volume impressively well and has led many to predict a run to $1,000 this year. Time is short to invest in Rollblock‚Äôs early presale stages Rollblock represents a great opportunity for early-stage investors and is likely to outperform the likes of Ripple, Toncoin, and Solana this cycle. Its recent rapid growth is expected to continue into 2025. Its presale will no doubt accelerate from here as stage nine tokens are already over 90% sold at $0.047.

The Dogecoin price has risen 8% over the previous month to close to $0.3668 after whales grabbed an incredible 1.83 billion DOGE tokens in the last 48 hours. A cryptocurrency expert suggests that DOGE might be on the verge of a significant upswing in the first quarter (Q1) of 2025 as it navigates the tumultuous market. This analyst believes that Dogecoin could surpass the $1 mark, achieving a new peak for the meme coin. Furthermore, DTX Exchange (DTX) , a newcomer in the crypto scene, is gaining remarkable attention during its presale phase. Compared to Dogecoin, analysts are much more bullish on it, projecting that DTX could soon soar to $5. Dogecoin Experiences Sell-Off Despite Positive News, Investors Cash In After 200% Gains Despite several promising updates, Dogecoin's price took a hit on Thursday as a sell-the-news wave swept through the market. The ""Department of Government Efficiency"" legislation, which features the Dogecoin logo prominently on its official site, was signed into law by US President Trump on Tuesday. Elon Musk's enduring support for Dogecoin positively influenced the market's reaction. Meanwhile, Bitwise, an asset management firm, filed for a spot DOGE ETF with the US SEC on Wednesday. However, it seems that Dogecoin holders have started taking profits as a result of these optimistic events. Many investors who began purchasing DOGE in September 2024, when Musk publicly aligned himself with Trump's campaigns, are already sitting on unrealized returns of more than 200%. These holders decided to lock in profits when DOGE reached significant milestones. Dogecoin Price Set for New Record in Q1 2025, Experts See Bullish Path Ahead Cryptocurrency analyst TradingShot forecasts that Dogecoin will reach a new all-time high in Q1 2025. The expert highlights the 1-Day 50 Moving Average as a crucial support level for DOGE. A similar pattern was observed in 2024 when Dogecoin broke above the MA50, leading to a notable price surge. It is anticipated that the Dogecoin price will have a similar trajectory, possibly reproducing the bull movement of 2024. A bull flag formation on the DOGE 2-day price chart indicates a substantial gain, according to another expert, Trader Tardigrade, who predicts a greater climb for the Dogecoin price. Investors are keeping a careful eye on the market for indications of a possible breakout as the Dogecoin price continues to fluctuate. DTX Exchange Integrates DeFi and TradFi Seamlessly with Innovative Features and Exceptional Perks In the realms of DeFi and TradFi, DTX Exchange stands as a trailblazer. By creating a bridge, it aims to rejuvenate the $3.2 billion trade sector, ensuring centralized and decentralized finance don't remain separate. DTX enables traders to access over 120,000 asset pairs without the need to navigate multiple platforms. Powered by the VulcanX layer 1 blockchain, DTX is hailed as a groundbreaking technological innovation. With a testnet transaction speed of over 200,000 TPS and robust community backing, it guarantees faster transactions, transparent fees, and an unwavering commitment to security and decentralization. For those inclined towards automated trading, DTX offers trading bots as a bonus feature. These AI-driven bots can identify market opportunities and perform the necessary technical analysis to secure profitable trades. The current value of the DTX Exchange (DTX) token is $0.16, a 700% gain from the token's launch price of $0.02. Following the opening of the DTX Exchange and the token's listing on tier-1 exchanges, investors are positioning themselves for further profits.

Bank of America closed nine branches while Flagstar, a bank with over $114 billion in assets, closed 15. US Bank and JPMorgan Chase each closed six branches in the same timeframe. Bank of America closed 132 branches in 2024, while US Bank shut down 101, Wells Fargo 92, and Chase 90. More physical branches were shut down in California than in any other state. Using data sourced from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), credit-building firm Self Financial recently reported that the number of bank branches in the US peaked in 2012 after steadily rising since at least 1935. And within about 16 years, Self Financial says bank branches will become completely extinct. ‚ÄúBased on the data from 2012 to 2022, using a polynomial regression model, the data predicts that if bank branches continued to decline at the accelerated rate they have been in the last decade, there could be no bank branches left by 2041.‚Äù Based on current trends, the data suggests that some states will go branchless before others, with New England, Connecticut, Maine and Vermont predicted to have zero physical bank branches by 2031.

Despite Solana's established reputation, Remittix ‚Äôs distinctive features, such as effortless crypto-to-fiat conversions, have drawn significant interest. With the presale token price on the rise, many consider RTX the top cryptocurrency investment for substantial returns. Solana Experiences Price Dip Due to Whale Activity Since reaching its all-time high on January 19, 2025, Solana (SOL) has dropped by 14.5%. Although it has gained 16.7% over the past week, analysts note a slowdown in its momentum. The Average Directional Index (ADX), a key measure, has fallen from 66.2 to 27.2, indicating a potential downtrend. A fascinating factor is the rise in ""whale activity."" Whales are solana investors who hold large amounts of the currency. The number of whale addresses in Solana peaked at 5,137 before slightly dipping to 5,128. This suggests that major investors maintain confidence in Solana despite its price volatility. Whales can significantly affect prices. If they start selling, further price drops could ensue. Currently, key support levels for Solana are $223, $211, and $191.85, where it might stabilize before making another move. Solana is currently priced at $250.38. Investors are closely watching these fluctuations to determine if Solana will rebound or continue to decline. Despite recent setbacks, Solana remains a significant player in the crypto market for now. Why Investors Favor Remittix (RTX) Over Solana (SOL) for Larger Gains in 2025 More and more investors are turning to Remittix (RTX), as the project gains traction with cutting-edge technology and promising presale performance, as 2025 progresses. Unlike many other crypto projects, Remittix is designed to bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies. Remittix facilitates seamless crypto-to-fiat transfers without intermediaries, unlike traditional payment processors like Stripe or Wise. Remittix allows users to quickly turn crypto into cash, avoiding hidden fees and unfavorable exchange rates, whether for settling payments or sending money globally. Remittix is a game-changer in the $190 trillion global payment market due to its simple and efficient method. For example, Remittix Pay enables businesses to accept crypto payments directly converted into fiat, benefiting them and attracting everyday users. With the presale token price now at $0.0311 in the current presale stage, the presale has already garnered over $6.2 million, and with only 750 million tokens available, it‚Äôs evident that demand is rising. RTX has emerged as one of the top coins to buy now, with forecasts of significant growth after its public debut. Many crypto experts believe it‚Äôs the ideal entry point for investors seeking substantial returns. RTX has the potential for even greater returns; some analysts predict around 50x. This is due to¬†Remittix's innovative approach to crypto-to-fiat transactions and its ability to cater to a wide range of industries, offering a versatile platform with immense growth prospects. Investors who enter early could reap substantial benefits once Remittix launches, as the presale progresses. Remittix is set to be a key player in the cryptocurrency sphere with features designed to streamline crypto payments and eliminate costs.

Now, Solana is trading up, but the meme coins have lost their lure. Attention is back on Kaspa for mining, and the new crypto Rollblock for GambleFi. Rollblock is expanding the crypto gaming space with its gambling use cases. It could be the next crypto to 100x this year, but there‚Äôs more than enough for everyone to benefit from. Don‚Äôt miss out on the RLBK presale today! Solana Price Gets Boost Amid Meme Coin Dip The meme coins on the Solana ecosystem got a direct competitor in the TRUMP coin, as the market hype tipped rather heavily in the direction of the new coin from Friday to Tuesday. Trending altcoins Official Trump and MELANIA flipped major meme projects to land in top spots on the market capitalization rankings. It was bad news for the memes, especially Dogwifhat and BONK, but a splendid one for the Solana price. The whole meme coin drama occurred on the one blockchain, and with the increased activity, Solana is leading the market in terms of DEX volume. Also, the Solana price is pegged at $265.78 on CoinMarketCap, with about 21.52% gains. Kaspa Gets A Mining Boost To Start The Year The Kaspa project has been one of the most popular PoW projects in the crypto-verse for the past year. Its popularity spiked when the Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital added KAS mining to its functions. Kaspa joined the trending altcoins at the start of 2025 too, as the KAS tokens are now the seventh-placed largest mineable coins. The tokens are right behind Monero and Ethereum Classic, and its simultaneous block production makes Kaspa a desired mining option compared with most of the others. Kaspa currently sells at $0.13 on CoinMarketCap, and it is in recovery mode from the TRUMP coin offset in the past week. The intraday time frame shows a 3.09% increase; maybe KAS coins are coming back up? Rollblock: Join The Biggest Community Of Gamblers!

The project has raised over $350,000, amounting to 81% of its $1 million funding goal, reflecting strong investor confidence in its innovative approach. The $OZ token is currently priced at $0.002 during the second presale phase and is expected to list at $0.05, offering early investors a fivefold potential return. Leveraging advanced technology, Ozak AI‚Äôs ecosystem is powered by the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). These enable real-time market analysis and predictive modeling, providing users with actionable insights for navigating the financial landscape. Trump Presidency Sparks Momentum The cryptocurrency market has experienced renewed momentum amidst the possibility of pro-crypto policies under former President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Recent reports suggest the Trump administration could support a national reserve backed by digital assets, prioritizing U.S.-founded tokens like XRP, USD Coin, and Solana. This policy shift, though unconfirmed, has already created a ripple effect across the market, driving interest in projects that align with innovation and adaptability. Ozak AI, with its integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence, is well-positioned to capitalize on this emerging trend. The potential regulatory clarity and support for U.S.-based crypto initiatives are expected to further boost investor confidence in forward-thinking projects like Ozak AI. DOGE‚Äôs Influence Shifts Attention to AI-Driven Solutions Dogecoin ($DOGE), a longstanding favorite in the cryptocurrency market, achieved a 320% gain in 2024 due to strong community support and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. However, concerns about its limited utility and market volatility have driven investors to explore other options. Ozak AI has emerged as a promising alternative by offering tangible use cases through its AI-driven analytics and blockchain technology. By addressing inefficiencies in the market and providing real-time data for decision-making, Ozak AI is capturing the interest of investors seeking sustainable growth opportunities. XRP‚Äôs New High Drives Optimism XRP recently surged past $3, reaching its highest price in seven years with a 10% rally within 24 hours. The price increase is attributed to speculation about an XRP-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) and optimism surrounding regulatory clarity under the Trump administration. Ripple‚Äôs CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has sought a meeting with the regulators to ensure that XRP is well-placed for growth. Ripple may be added to the list of assets in a national reserve backed by the United States, increasing XRP‚Äôs utility. These developments, however, together with the growing institutional interest, are still exemplifying the strength of the XRP market. Ozak AI Ready for Long-Term Expansion As the world of cryptocurrencies continues to develop in the context of new and rapidly changing regulations, the strategy on which Ozak AI is based makes it stand out. The project harnesses artificial intelligence and analytics enriched with blockchain to provide groundbreaking products for decentralized finance.

However, it lost some momentum, and the question is what will happen next. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, the asset rebounded from the $92K support level a couple of weeks ago. The $100K level has been broken to the upside recently, leading to a gradual rise toward the $110K level and potentially higher. With the RSI indicating that the momentum is still bullish, it is very likely that the market will rally toward the $120K level soon. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour chart, the recent choppy price action can be clearly witnessed. The asset has been trapped between the $100K and $108K levels over the last ten days or so. This has led to a lot of uncertainty surrounding the market trend in the near future. Yet, the overall market structure still remains bullish, and a breakout above the $108K resistance level is more probable than a bearish reversal. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio As Bitcoin‚Äôs price has been consolidating recently after a significant rally in the past few months, investors are wondering whether the bull market is over. Analyzing on-chain metrics can offer useful clues to reach a conclusion about the current state of the market. This chart presents the exchange whale ratio, which measures the ratio of exchange deposits by whales to total deposits. Therefore, it can be seen as a proxy of selling pressure by large investors. As the chart demonstrates, the whale ratio metric has been rising recently, but it is still showing values far less than those witnessed earlier when BTC was trading around $70K. Therefore, more upside can still be expected if sufficient demand is present.

Choosing the correct token under $1 could be a game-changer for those with a $450 investment budget; by the end of January 2025, this little investment will have become an amazing $5,400. Three outstanding tokens‚Äî Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Pepe (PEPE)‚Äîand their reasons for great potential for investors are discussed in this paper. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Revolutionary Token Under $1 Tokenized asset management is changing investor perspectives, thanks partly to Rexas Finance (RXS). RXS enables users to seamlessly tokenize, trade, and own real-world assets‚Äîas an RWA (Real-World Asset) token‚Äîfrom real estate to commodities. Investors are interested in this invention since its presale has already generated over $37.92 million. Pricing at $0.175, RXS is currently in its 11th presale stage and reflects an amazing 6x increase from its starting presale price. Analyst forecasts show an incredible 12x price rise, which would force RXS above $2 in the next few months. Under such a trajectory, a $450 investment at the present presale price may explode into $5,400. The fact that RXS intends to be listed on three tier-1 exchanges, enabling extensive adoption and liquidity, adds even more to the increasing investor trust in it. Rexas Finance‚Äôs creative asset management features, strategic alliances, and strong community support also help. For people looking for a dependable and transformative investment under $1, its Certik audit strengthens confidence and makes it the best option. Rexas Finance leads our list of interesting tokens with its original method of tokenized asset ownership and promise of large profits. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Memecoin with Serious Momentum One of the most identifiable cryptocurrencies currently is Dogecoin (DOGE). At $0.3262, Dogecoin has increased by an amazing 200% over the previous three months, thanks to fresh market excitement and a positive attitude. With 82.14% of moving average signals pointing to additional upward momentum, the technical study shows that Dogecoin‚Äôs trend stays substantially positive. DOGE violated the bottom of its ascending trend channel lately, suggesting a possible slowing down of its early increase. Investors should expect notable price activity with support at $0.17 and resistance at $0.47. Strong support levels combined with bullish RSI (Relative Strength Index) readings point to Dogecoin‚Äôs position for another surge being favorable. By the end of the month, a $450 DOGE investment might profit from its upward trend and pay handsome profits. Dogecoin distinguishes itself mostly from its great acceptability and popularity, which have helped to confirm its place on the market. Supported by a devoted community and well-known sponsorships, DOGE keeps drawing retail and institutional players. Dogecoin is still a great option for individuals looking for an easily available and highly prospective token. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Rising Star Among Memecoins Lately, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has become popular. Driven by rising investor optimism and strong technical signals, PEPE, priced at $0.000017, has registered a 100% rise over the past three months. 67.86% of moving averages support the positive trend of the token; short-term indicators indicate even further gains. PEPE‚Äôs position in a rising trend channel suggests a continuous price climb in January 2025 by reflecting growing investor confidence. Currently testing support at $0.0000164, the token could offer a powerful launchpad for its next upward movement should it be maintained. The RSI curve also shows a positive trend, supporting its optimistic view. For all its modest cost, PEPE has demonstrated tenacity and strong community support that appeals to investors with minimal means. As the cryptocurrency keeps rising, a $450 PEPE investment might profit on its momentum and yield excellent returns. Conclusion By concentrating on low-cost tokens with great development potential, January 2025 offers investors a special chance to turn modest investments into significant rewards. Thanks to its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization, outstanding presale performance, and expected exchange listings, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out among the best options under $1 token. A preferred choice for investors since a $450 investment in RXS today may produce an impressive $5,400. With their separate optimistic tendencies and great community support, Dogecoin and Pepe both present interesting prospects. While Pepe‚Äôs growing trend and increasing investor trust emphasize its potential for notable expansion, Dogecoin‚Äôs broad acceptance and momentum make it a dependable option.

Solana (SOL) had a great start to the year, posting major gains across a 72-hour window, though it has dipped since. Conversely, Avalanche (AVAX) has suffered losses on the monthly, weekly, and daily timeframes. While these established players grasp on amid volatility, an up-and-comer has been stealing away the spotlight: Remittix. This advanced PayFi solution tackles problems head-on, solving inefficiencies in the cross-border payments market. With this market being valued at $190 trillion, Remittix (RTX) stands to win big in 2025. So how will things pan out for Solana, Avalanche, and Remittix in Q1 of 2025? Solana (SOL): Navigating the Crypto Waves Solana (SOL) is currently trading at approximately $251.28, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours. Solana‚Äôs mad spree seems to have come to an end, and after hitting a new ATH, Solana (SOL) has entered a correction phase and things are looking uneventful for the moment. Though Solana had a good run last week, some are pessimistic about its outlook now, partly due to the slow year Solana (SOL) had in 2024, believing this year may end up being a rerun. Avalanche (AVAX) Enters 2025 On Thin Ice There‚Äôs no other way of saying it; Avalanche is having a bad time. The asset has dropped by 14.86% in the last 30 days, 13.68% in the last week, and 3% in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume is up 45%, which could suggest one of two things. Either people are buying the dip, or Avalanche holders are abandoning ship and selling up for good. Avalanche (AVAX) is currently sitting at around $35.99 and the token recently dipped below a critical resistance mark, signalling a bearish trend. Despite its losses, Avalanche (AVAX) still has the respect of many blockchain enthusiasts for its transaction processing capabilities and solid security foundation. Remittix Redefines Cross-Border Payments for 2025 Remittix (RTX) is quickly emerging as a revolutionary platform addressing inefficiencies in the $190 trillion cross-border payments market. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, Remittix prioritizes transparency, trust, and accessibility, providing a modern alternative to traditional systems‚Äã. Remittix lets users convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and transfer funds to bank accounts all across the globe. With a flat-rate pricing model, Remittix eliminates hidden fees and ensures a cost-effective solution for individuals and businesses alike‚Äã. Businesses are finding appeal in Remittix‚Äôs advanced tools, including the Remittix Pay API. This feature enables companies to accept cryptocurrency payments and settle them directly in fiat currencies. Supporting over 30 FIAT currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs, the API simplifies cross-border transactions and empowers businesses to scale efficiently‚Äã. A standout feature of Remittix (RTX) is its focus on user accessibility and security. Transactions appear as standard bank transfers, ensuring that recipients benefit from blockchain technology without requiring prior knowledge of cryptocurrency. This design bridges the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, making Remittix a go-to solution for both seasoned and novice users‚Äã. Remittix‚Äôs unwavering commitment to financial inclusion sets it apart in the industry. By operating 24/7 and bypassing reliance on traditional banking infrastructure, the platform provides underserved populations with access to efficient cross-border payment solutions. This mission aligns with its goal of democratizing global financial systems‚Äã. Early Investors Grab Their RTX Tokens Remittix‚Äôs presale is in full swing, having already raised over $6.2 million, with tokens now available to proactive investors for just $0.0311. The project‚Äôs immense value proposition and unprecedented presale growth has prompted analysts to forecast an 800% price rise during the presale alone. As it gears up for a big year in 2025, Remittix is poised to disrupt the PayFi market.

Analyst Says It‚Äôs The ‚ÄòMath‚Äô",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-321000-this-cycle/,"Crypto analyst Tony Severino has provided an ultra-bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price, predicting that the flagship crypto could rally to as high as $321,000. The analyst admitted that this target was too high for BTC but added that it was simply the ‚Äúmath. Bitcoin Price To Reach $321,000 In This Market Cycle In a substack post, Tony Severino predicted that the Bitcoin price could rally to as high as $321,000 in this bull run. This came as the analyst highlighted a potential head and shoulders pattern that had formed on Bitcoin‚Äôs chart. The analyst claimed that if this bullish pattern was valid, then it projects a maximum target of $321,000 per BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims For $150,000-$170,000 With Wave Formation, Here Are The Details Severino admitted that this price target for the Bitcoin price is too high but remarked that it‚Äôs the ‚Äúmath.‚Äù Interestingly, the crypto analyst went on to give a higher price prediction for the flagship crypto based on another bullish pattern. According to him, BTC could reach $345,000 if it touches the upper boundary of the primary uptrend channel over the last 8 years or thereabouts. Meanwhile, Severino also provided more conservative targets for the Bitcoin price. The analyst predicted that BTC could at least touch $158,000. This came as he noted that the 2021 cycle peak inverse Fibonacci extension could project the 2025 cycle peak. If so, he stated that this peak inverse Fib extension is located among the lowest estimates for BTC at $158,000. The crypto analyst further remarked that another method of using the 1.618 Fib extension involves projecting the target from the peak of wave 3 from the bottom of wave 1. Based on this, he added that this calls for a potential target of $194,000. Severino provided another version that projects the 1.618 Fib extension from the top of subwave iii of 5 to the bottom of subwave i of 5. If this plays out, BTC could reach a slightly lower target of $186,000. Lastly, the crypto analyst also raised the possibility of the Bitcoin price peaking at $191,000. He highlighted a bull pattern, which, if valid, could send BTC to this target. BTC‚Äôs Price Action In The Short Term Crypto analyst Ali Martinez provided insights into the Bitcoin price action in the short term. In an X post, he stated that the key support level for Bitcoin is at $97,877, where more than 101,000 BTC were accumulated. The analyst further remarked that holding above this level is crucial to sustaining the bullish momentum for the flagship crypto. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash To $99,000, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs Supposed To Happen Next In another X post, the crypto analyst provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price.

At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $104,300, down almost 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Tron (TRX) Avalanche Or Remittix?,https://timestabloid.com/which-one-of-these-will-make-you-rich-in-2025-tron-trx/,"Donald Trump‚Äôs US presidential triumph triggered a price surge in the crypto market last year. Now that he has officially taken office, analysts expect the bull run to begin shortly. As such, speculation over which cryptos will be the top performers in this cycle has begun. Cryptos like Tron (TRX) , Avalanche and Remittix are among the top names floating around analysts‚Äô circles, but the question remains: which of them is the best crypto coin to buy ? Tron‚Äôs Price Dips Amid Stablecoin Update Tron (TRX) has experienced a slight price dip in the crypto market, falling by 5% in the last 24 hours. However, analysts predict it will have a phenomenal year and be among the best crypto coins to buy . One factor that could drive Tron‚Äôs growth this year is its renewed focus on stablecoins. Last year, Tron lost its majority market share on stablecoins to Ethereum due to a lack of crypto investment products, such as ETFs. Although it is still the second-largest stablecoin chain by market cap, it is implementing new strategies to ensure it reclaims market dominance. One such strategy is gasless stablecoin transactions. If Tron implements gasless stablecoin transactions, it could attract more stablecoin supply to the network. Beyond that, Tron has been one of the best performers in every crypto bull run and has also had one of the best crypto ICO s in the past. Investor Sentiment Around Avalanche Surges With the memecoin supercycle nearing its end, investors are moving towards L1 tokens with strong fundamentals exhibiting price stability. Since Avalanche is among the top L1 tokens in the industry based on price, technical indicators and historical performance, it is automatically one of the best crypto coins to buy . Historically, one crypto category has always led the bull market. If L1 tokens lead this cycle, Avalanche may be an ideal option to invest as it also had one of the best crypto ico in the past. Can Remittix Become The Next PayFi Giant? Remittix has become the subject of interest in the crypto industry thanks to its offering to the PayFi industry. Analysts are now speculating that it could become a category leader in PayFi, a new branch of crypto that combines traditional payment services with decentralized ones to provide the best payment experience. PayFi‚Äôs appeal comes from its elimination of troublesome decentralized payment experiences like offramping. It allows users to pay with crypto and sellers to receive in fiat, providing a seamless experience unavailable elsewhere. It also supports around 40 cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, providing unlimited flexibility for both users and sellers. With annual transfer volumes for top payment platforms estimated at $1.3 quadrillion, Remittix stands to accumulate a large share if it captures market share in both traditional and decentralized payment industries. Remittix‚Äôs presale token is now available and the team estimates that it will raise over $6 million from sales over a few weeks. Whether the presale continues after Remittix reaches its target is unknown, meaning potential investors must make haste to purchase the presale token before it is too late. Conclusion While Tron and Avalanche are high-potential investments, their risk exposure is higher than Remittix‚Äôs. Their entry level is also much higher as Remittix is more modestly priced and is positioned in a quadrillion-dollar industry. Join the presale and community now!

Their worries involve market manipulation concerns and the fact that foreign actors may buy the tokens and influence the U.S. president.

The token‚Äôs price dropped by over 6% in the last 24 hours alone, making it trade at $248, with a market capitalization of over $120 billion, making it the 5th largest crypto by market capitalization. These 3 Altcoins can be game changers! While SOL price didn‚Äôt perform as expected by many, a few of the other altcoins can steal the show by registering remarkable performance in the future. Ergo, let‚Äôs take a look at a few promising altcoins, which can come in the limelight soon! 1. Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin (LTC) is one of the altcoins that performed well in the last 24 hours. It clearly outshone Solana as the Litecoin price surged by over 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the coin was trading at $124.12 with a market cap of over $9.36 billion. The good news is that its trading volumed increased by 66% during the same time frame, which legitimized this price uptick. At the time of writing, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is moving northwards. This is a sign of an inflow of new money, which often results in continued price hike. Ergo, if this trend sustains, Litecoin might first target $136, before eyeing $150. Source: TradingView 2.

Bitget Token (BGB) While Solana dropped, Bitget Token (BGT) followed a similar track to that of Litecoin and registered over 5% price hike in the last 24 hours. Thanks to that, the altcoin‚Äôs social volume increased sharply‚Äîa sign of rising popularity of the token.

They are seemingly unhappy with XRP‚Äôs name being floated around President Donald Trump‚Äôs proposed US federal crypto stockpile, as some believe Ripple‚Äôs native token is ‚Äúnot a crypto.‚Äù A series of recent posts by prominent industry figures have reignited debates about XRP‚Äôs place in the blockchain ecosystem. In a January 24 post on X, Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at Bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms, shared a screenshot of a thread originally posted in 2020 by crypto commentator Nic Carter, who made scathing remarks about Ripple‚Äôs digital asset. Carter‚Äôs posts labeled XRP as ‚Äúneither a cryptocurrency nor a viable competitor to Bitcoin,‚Äù arguing it lacks meaningful decentralization or utility. ‚Äú There‚Äôs absolutely no comparing XRP with Bitcoin, ‚Äù Carter wrote. ‚Äú It‚Äôs not ‚Äòcheaper‚Äô than Bitcoin or more energy-efficient because it‚Äôs not remotely in the same category. The same way you can‚Äôt compare an Excel doc on my laptop with Bitcoin. ‚Äù XRP use cases under question In his December 2020 thread, Carter criticized XRP‚Äôs purported ‚Äúcentralized nature,‚Äù describing it as ‚Äúliterally a token on a database maintained by a single entity,‚Äù which, in the context, represented Ripple Labs. He went so far as to liken XRP to ‚Äúan IOU on the Starbucks app,‚Äù arguing that the token is not fully built on a decentralization principle, which undermines its legitimacy as a crypto. Carter also targeted XRP‚Äôs primary use case as a bridge currency for cross-border remittances. He claimed this purpose has been rendered obsolete by the adoption of stablecoins, which are less volatile and more practical for such transactions. ‚Äú No one wants to use a volatile, illiquid, thinly traded asset as a bridge currency, ‚Äù Carter stated. ‚Äú The only use case is lowering the cost of capital for Ripple Labs. ‚Äù The crypto critic, who is also against the idea of creating a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, accused Ripple of using XRP to inflate its value artificially, alleging that the company engaged in partnerships designed to excite retail investors and drive up the token‚Äôs price. ‚Äú The SEC should see through the smokescreen and perceive XRP for what it is‚Äîa shallow fraud. ‚Äù Bitcoin advocates double down on XRP criticism Several users on X agreed with Rochard‚Äôs sentiments, with some echoing Carter‚Äôs claims of XRP being a ‚Äúfraudulent‚Äù asset meant to fatten Ripple Labs‚Äô pockets. One user shared a screenshot of an explainer that showed the tokenomics of XRP. The screenshot alleges that Ripple Labs withheld 80% of XRP‚Äôs total supply when it launched in 2013. Retailers could only access the withheld supply through the Bitstamp crypto exchange from January 2017. They apparently employ over 1k people‚Ä¶?! sus I 'member this‚Ä¶ The initial distribution was 80/20 in June 2012 and it was impossible to get any as a 'retailer' until 5 years later (Bitstamp, January 2017). The very fact that any of these events happened = DQ. pic.twitter.com/W9npWWcmj7 ‚Äî mikethespacecat (@2salt2furious) January 23, 2025 In a quoted response to Rochard‚Äôs post, another Bitcoin advocate disclosed some pointers from Saifedean Ammous‚Äôs The Bitcoin Standard book. The post explained how the author discussed the fundamental differences between Bitcoin and XRP in chapters, 7, 8, and 9. In Chapter 7, Ammous explained how Bitcoin‚Äôs model makes the network independent, decentralized, and immutable. Analysts pointed out that XRP fails to achieve this due to Ripple Labs‚Äô control over its supply. The next chapter further critiques fiat systems and centralized financial models. Critics assert the system is similar to XRP‚Äôs model and claim the token is an extension of the very structures BTC was designed to disrupt. Finally, chapter 9 focuses on Bitcoin‚Äôs proof-of-work mechanism, which ensures decentralization and censorship resistance. XRP critics insist XRP relies on centralized validators, which Ripple Labs could allegedly take advantage of to manipulate price.

Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is under pressure as it faces competition from a new exchange trying to grab attention. 1Fuel (OFT) is making its mark with a promising presale, offering tokens at $0.017 and giving early investors a 70% return. As Solana grows, Cardano fights to stay in the game, and 1Fuel attracts more interest, the crypto world is full of news. Read on to find more! Why is Solana's Trump meme spike attracting new users? The launch of the Trump meme coin brought a wave of activity to Solana (SOL) , with nearly 9 million new addresses added daily during the hype. Solana‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) crossed $12 billion, while DEX trading volumes reached over $120 billion. Solana‚Äôs DeFi performance surged, outpacing Tron and closing in on Ethereum. Daily transaction fees hit over $30 million, reflecting strong network demand. Despite the excitement, concerns about token centralization and market instability remain as the meme-driven growth raises sustainability questions. While Solana rides the meme craze, 1Fuel (OFT) offers a steadier path with practical blockchain innovation, positioning itself as a secure alternative in the crypto space. Cardano (ADA) tests $1.10 resistance as bulls watch closely Cardano (ADA) is moving toward the $1.10 resistance, a key level that could push its price closer to $1.50 if buyers step in. Without enough volume, though, there‚Äôs a chance of a price dip below $0.95, making these price levels critical for traders to watch. The network‚Äôs growth, powered by Hydra scaling and rising DeFi adoption, has kept investor interest alive. Still, market swings and external factors could challenge Cardano‚Äôs push beyond this resistance, leaving traders cautious but hopeful. While Cardano targets scalability, 1Fuel (OFT) takes a different path by focusing on innovating crypto wallets' approach, showing how new innovations can shape the crypto space. 1Fuel‚Äôs (OFT) practical blockchain features are turning heads While the Solana network enjoys meme-driven growth, Cardano nears some important price levels to watch. In the same market, 1Fuel (OFT) is gaining attention, raising over $1.4 million in its presale with tokens priced around $0.017, offering early investors a 70% return. 1Fuel (OFT) stands out with its advanced one-click cross-chain transaction system, allowing users to transfer assets seamlessly across networks without extra fees or complexities. Its decentralized peer-to-peer exchange has also gained attention for offering secure and private trading without any middlemen, addressing a common pain point for many crypto traders. Combined with AI-powered tools for portfolio management and tax optimization, 1Fuel delivers a modern yet user-friendly platform for newbies and expert traders and investors. Security remains a core focus, with a military-grade cold storage solution, the wallet safeguards digital assets from online threats. This feature, along with its privacy mixer, appeals to investors prioritizing safety. The introduction of staking rewards, offering up to 30% APR, adds another layer of appeal for those looking to earn passive income. In comparison to Solana‚Äôs rapid user growth and Cardano‚Äôs scalability goals, 1Fuel (OFT) is carving out its niche by prioritizing practical tools and real-world utility. Final thoughts While Solana grows its user base and Cardano works on scaling, 1Fuel (OFT) focuses on solving real challenges for crypto users, making it a promising option in the market.

This was unexpected, but the series‚Äô followers seemed excited about the launch. In this blog, we will discuss everything about the token. DEAN Meme Coin Launched & It‚Äôs Not A Scam Hollywood actor Dean Norris, who plays Hank Schrader in Breaking Bad, launched a token. He revealed this on X, posting, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided to launch my own crypto coin named $Dean,‚Äù which surprised many. However, many popular celebrities have launched their meme-themed cryptocurrencies, including the Hawk Tuan Girl. More prominently, US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump launched the TRUMP and MELANI meme coin , which quickly gained traction in the market. Now, the DEAN token‚Äôs launch explains the rising popularity of these meme-themed cryptos in the entertainment industry. However, considering the rising celebrity account hacks for crypto promotions, the crypto community first became suspicious of this launch. Norris soon retweeted with a new selfie and a notepad, writing DEAN meme coin ticker and today‚Äôs date. With a few more cross-checks, the community finally believed the launch, pumping the token‚Äôs price. DEAN Price Surged 600%, What‚Äôs Next? Norris has claimed that he would not launch a cryptocurrency without a strong utility, and the people backing it before mentioning that the one who misses it will regret it later. This booster investor confirmed, resulting in a more than 600% surge since its launch. The DEAN meme coin is now part of the Solana network, and the cryptocurrency platform Coingecko has included the token in its crypto list, gaining it greater visibility. According to Coingecko data , DEAN trades at $0.004362 after achieving an ATH of $0.006799 a few hours ago. Additionally, its market capitalization and trading volumes are $4,362,941 and $38,704,470, respectively, which shows decent investor demand. Although the token has moved down from its ATH, the hype will likely continue due to its attributes of Breaking Bad star and being a Solana meme coin. However, due to its recent launch, it can be vulnerable to the market‚Äôs volatility. Investors should only associate with tokens after proper research and analysis. Bottom Line The DEAN meme coin is bullish, as the token surged over 600% after the launch. However, the token has consolidated significantly away from that, trading at $0.004362 with investors‚Äô optimism. The famous Hollywood actor and Breaking Bad star Dean Norris bets on the token‚Äôs superior utility and strong backing. However, there are concerns around its new launch, as many meme coins fail in the market. Though it may not happen with this token, investors should carefully consider their strategies around it and the rest of the tokens due to the market‚Äôs unpredictability.

Crypto Enthusiasts Worldwide Eager to Join Remittix Early,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/could-remittix-surpass-cardano-next-year-crypto-enthusiasts-worldwide-eager-to-join-remittix-early,"The crypto community is abuzz with speculation that Cardano (ADA) might be outpaced by an emerging contender named Remittix (RTX). It's not common for a newcomer to challenge a well-established leader, but some analysts believe Remittix (RTX) might just do that. With more than $5,944,914.48 raised and 313,365,387.94 tokens sold, Remittix (RTX) has grabbed significant attention. One reason for this is the rush of crypto enthusiasts to join the Remittix presale, aiming to purchase tokens at $0.0311 before the price increases to $0.0324. Let‚Äôs explore why this up-and-coming project might give Cardano (ADA) some serious competition in the upcoming year. Cardano(ADA): A Dedicated Community but Slower Developments Cardano (ADA) remains popular among long-term investors due to its meticulous scientific approach to developing secure blockchains. The project's peer-reviewed research and layered design earn the admiration of ADA supporters by tackling issues like scalability. Yet, critics mention that this deliberate pace creates opportunities for other tokens to advance with quicker innovations. Although Cardano (ADA) boasts a significant and faithful community, the market is eager for results and new partnerships sooner rather than later. If new features or dApps do not arrive more swiftly, Cardano (ADA) may witness newer players like Remittix (RTX) gaining traction. Remittix(RTX): The Emerging Competitor Emerging on the scene is Remittix (RTX), a token designed for cross-border payments. By enabling users to convert crypto to fiat, Remittix (RTX) addresses one of the cryptocurrency's most challenging aspects: effortlessly sending money overseas. The project has already secured over $6,234,914.48 during its presale, indicating a massive interest from the crypto community. With 305,365,387.94 tokens sold at $0.0297 each, it‚Äôs clear that many believe in its potential to solve real-world problems, possibly elevating the token above more established networks like Cardano (ADA) if it continues to fulfill its promises. 1. Practical Vision: Remittix (RTX) aims to assist individuals and businesses in need of quick, low-cost remittances.2. Success in Fundraising: Early investors are eager to grab tokens before the price climbs to $0.0311, anticipating substantial future returns.3. Addressing a Market Gap: While Cardano (ADA) strives for DeFi adoption, Remittix (RTX) concentrates on cross-border transactions, a straightforward appeal that could win over mainstream users. Why Some Forecast a Remittix Triumph Over Cardano Despite Cardano (ADA)'s strong position with a vast user base and ongoing projects, some observers suggest that Remittix (RTX) might surpass it due to its sharper focus on practical everyday use. In a crypto world filled with complex dApps, sometimes the most straightforward solution‚Äîsending money quickly‚Äîwins out. If Remittix (RTX) seamlessly integrates with financial networks or partners with major payment platforms, its user base could skyrocket. Meanwhile, if Cardano (ADA) doesn't accelerate its development or offer new ways for ADA use in daily life, it might fall behind. Conclusion: The Anticipated Clash Could Remittix (RTX) truly outshine Cardano (ADA) next year? Some believe it might, pointing to Remittix (RTX)‚Äôs focus on real-world payments and the impressive $6,234,914.48 raised. However, Cardano (ADA) remains formidable, with a committed community and ongoing research. Ultimately, this isn't an either-or situation; both coins can succeed by playing to their strengths. Yet, for crypto traders seeking the next big breakout, Remittix (RTX) might be the one to watch, especially given its rapid presale fundraising. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, expect more surprises as both altcoins vie for top positions in 2024.

It‚Äôs not every day a newer project challenges a well-established giant but some analysts think Remittix (RTX) could do exactly that. With over $5,944,914.48 raised and 313,365,387.94 tokens sold, Remittix (RTX) has earned serious attention. Part of the reason is that crypto fanatics flock to Remittix presale, hoping to secure tokens at the current price of $0.0311 (before it jumps to $0.0324). Let‚Äôs find out why this newcomer could give Cardano (ADA) a run for its money in the coming year. Cardano(ADA): A Strong Community but Slower Pace Cardano (ADA) continues to be favoured by long-term investors because of its extensive scientific approach to building secure blockchains. The project's peer-reviewed research and layered design structure win support from ADA supporters because they address challenges like scalability. However, critics argue this slow pace leaves room for other tokens to swoop in with faster innovation. Even though Cardano (ADA) has a big and loyal community, the market demands results and fresh partnerships sooner rather than later. If new features or dApps don‚Äôt arrive at a faster clip, Cardano (ADA) might watch as fresh players, like Remittix (RTX), gain momentum. Remittix(RTX): The Rising Challenger Stepping onto the stage is Remittix (RTX), a cross-border payment token. By allowing users to convert crypto into fiat, Remittix (RTX) tackles one of the most confusing parts of cryptocurrency: sending money abroad seamlessly. The project has already raised over $6,234,914.48 in its presale, a clear sign that crypto fanatics flock to Remittix presale in big numbers. With 305,365,387.94 tokens sold at $0.0297 each, it‚Äôs evident that many see potential in solving real-world issues, something that might propel the token above more established chains like Cardano (ADA) if it keeps delivering on its promises. 1. Practical Focus: Remittix (RTX) aims to serve regular people and businesses needing quick, low-fee remittances.2. Fundraising Success: Early buyers love the idea of snagging tokens before the price rises to $0.0311, hoping for even bigger gains in the future.3. Market Gap: While Cardano (ADA) fights for DeFi adoption, Remittix (RTX) simply focuses on cross-border transfers, a simpler pitch that might attract mainstream users. Why Some Predict a Remittix Win Over Cardano While Cardano (ADA) remains powerful, boasting a large user base and numerous ongoing developments, some watchers say Remittix (RTX) might overtake it due to a sharper focus on everyday utility. Crypto is full of complex dApps, but sometimes the simplest use case sending money quickly wins big. If Remittix (RTX) integrates easily with financial networks or inks partnerships with major payment platforms, the project‚Äôs user base could explode. Meanwhile, if Cardano (ADA) doesn‚Äôt speed up development or offer new ways for people to use ADA in daily life, it could lose ground. Conclusion: The Showdown Ahead Could Remittix (RTX) truly outshine Cardano (ADA) next year? Some think so, pointing to Remittix (RTX)‚Äôs real-world payment angle and the impressive $6,234,914.48 raised. On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) is far from finished, boasting a dedicated community and ongoing research. Ultimately, this isn‚Äôt a zero-sum game. Both coins can thrive if they stick to what they do best. Yet for crypto traders on the hunt for the next breakout star, Remittix (RTX) might be the one to watch especially given how quickly it‚Äôs racking up presale funds.

The Bridge Project will offer unconditional direct cash disbursements to mothers in Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia over the next three years, reports the Charleston Gazette-Mail. The goal of the program, which initially launched four years ago, is to eliminate child poverty by offering cash to mothers living below a certain income level before and after giving birth. Five-hundred mothers in the three states will benefit from a total of $10.125 million that‚Äôs set to be disbursed over three years. Each participant in the guaranteed income program will get a one-time stipend of $1,125 which will be handed out during the prenatal stage. Thereafter participants will each receive a monthly payment of $750 for the first 15 months of the program. During the remaining 21 months of the guaranteed income program, participants will receive $375 per month. Another 750 people will also be compensated for taking part in interviews and participating in research surveys. To participate, applicants must at the time of the application be pregnant with the age of the pregnancy being 14 weeks or less. Applicants must be at least 18 years of age and must reside in West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. Applicants must also have an annual household income of below $44,000. The Bridge Project started in all five New York City boroughs and two other major cities in the state of New York ‚Äì Buffalo and Rochester. Later, The Bridge Project expanded to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Connecticut and is now headed to three more states.

Litecoin Spot ETF: Crypto Community Weighs In On January 24, Coinshares filed an S-1 registration form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the COINSHARES LITECOIN ETF (the ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù), a spot exchange-traded fund that offers investors exposure to cryptocurrency LTC. Meanwhile, Grayscale also filed a 19b-4 form with the securities regulator to list and trade its Grayscale Litecoin Trust, suggesting potential conversion to a Spot ETF. In doing so, both asset managers join Canary Capital in a bid to launch the first Litecoin Spot ETF. This development has spurred much euphoria in the crypto community as a spot ETF generally promises direct institutional adoption which can translate into significant price growth as seen in the Bitcoin market. However, certain market analysts have attacked the idea of Litecoin Spot ETF which they believe shows little potential for success. According to renowned crypto expert, Ali Martinez, the Litecoin market appears largely unready for a spot ETF considering the asset has maintained the same price range over the past eight years.¬†Martinez nudges asset managers to rather launch a USDT ETF which would allow investors to earn a staking yield at worst. In another X post, crypto analyst with username djThistle01 also questions the idea of a LTC ETF especially as the asset has consistently declined against Bitcoin over the past 10 years. However, other analysts argue that Litecoin‚Äôs network activity makes up for its lack of extensive price action. According to entrepreneur Tarun Tejpal, the LTC transaction count has been on the rise since November 28. Notably, between 13-20 January 2025, Litecoin has processed over $69 billion in transactions translating into an average of $10 billion per day. Another LTC enthusiast named Aristotle‚Äôs Money also highlighted the asset‚Äôs achievement as the most used cryptocurrency for payment in 2024 according to data from BitPay, demonstrating significant market interest. Will A Litecoin Spot ETF Be Successful? In a rather uncanny fashion, the idea of Litecoin Spot ETF has drawn a division among crypto enthusiasts and analysts. Interestingly, this debate is likely to soon be settled as LTC is potentially the next crypto asset to secure a spot ETF ahead of other altcoins including Solana and XRP . This assumption is based on developments such as the recent submission of an S1-amendment by Canary Capital indicating an ongoing dialogue between the asset manager and the SEC. At the time of writing, Litecoin trades at $123.91 following a 0.72% gain in the past day.",Litecoin|Canary Capital|CoinShares|Grayscale|litecoin|Litecoin spot etf,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-25 15:30:48

This notable breakdown of support comes as the overall market begins to experience a price decline. Investors Move $5 Million Worth UNI to Exchanges However, given the current market sentiment and the recent support breakdown, investors and long-term holders have been offloading their UNI holdings, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data shows that exchanges have recorded an inflow of $5 million worth of UNI in the past 24 hours. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency landscape, inflow refers to the movement of assets from wallets to exchanges, potentially indicating dumping. Such inflows to exchanges can lead to price declines and increased selling pressure. Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction and Technical Analysis According to expert technical analysis, UNI has broken below its crucial support level of $12.5, which has been tested more than four times in the past three months. However, on previous occasions when the price reached this support level, UNI experienced buying pressure and upward momentum. Source: Trading View Since breaking the support level, the sentiment has shifted toward a downtrend. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, there is a strong possibility that UNI could drop by 22% to reach its next support level at $9.55. However, the asset is still trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, suggesting that it remains in an uptrend. When combining all these on-chain metrics with technical analysis, it appears that the bears have begun to dominate, and the price could soon drop to its next support level. Current Price Momentum UNI is currently trading near $12.15 and has experienced a price drop of over 7.90% in the past 24 hours.

With proposals ranging from halting ETH sales to creating a deflationary model, Sun‚Äôs vision can reshape Ethereum‚Äôs trajectory. But while ETH eyes new heights, another project, 1Fuel (OFT) is stealing the spotlight as the next big investment opportunity. With innovative features like one-click cross-chain transactions and presale success of over $1.4 million in funding, the race for dominance is getting tough. Let‚Äôs take a closer look. Justin Sun‚Äôs master plan: Can Ethereum hit $10K? Tron founder Justin Sun disclosed a daring plan to drive Ethereum (ETH) to a $10,000 price by halting sales of the cryptocurrency strategically. This well-known trend by Justin Sun was previously noted, when he sold $143 million worth of Ethereum , causing the price to drop by 17%. The Ethereum Foundation's planned three-year halt to ETH sales is a key component of his plan. Sun thinks that by limiting the token's supply, a deflationary environment might be created, pushing Ethereum's price upward and enhancing investor faith in its long-term worth. Sun's plan also includes a tax on Layer 2 solutions, which is a crucial component of his strategy. According to Sun, this might bring in as much as $5 billion a year. The money would be used to repurchase and burn ETH, strengthening its standing in the market and promoting a deflationary model.

39488607,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=663117,1737819306,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39488607.jpeg,Sir Paul McCartney warns AI proposed copyright laws overhaul could rip off artists,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/paul-mccartney-says-ai-could-rip-off-artists/,"Musician Sir Paul McCartney has advised that AI could ‚Äúrip off‚Äù artists if a proposed revamp of the copyright regulations by the UK government goes ahead. This comes as the use of copyrighted material to train AI models has become the subject of a recently launched government consultation. The UK government is considering an overhaul of a law that will enable AI developers to use content by creators to train their models unless the rights holders choose to opt-out, according to the BBC . The matter is of concern not only to musicians but writers too who have taken AI companies to task over using their copyrighted materials to train AI models. AI rewards the wrong people According to the musician, the proposed overhaul of the regulations could take away incentives for writers and artists, which will subsequently result in ‚Äúloss of creativity.‚Äù McCartney, who is one of the two surviving members of the Beatles told the BBC that young artists and writers will be at the losing end if other people use their original work and benefit from it. ‚ÄúYou get young guys, girls, coming up, and they write a beautiful song, and they don‚Äôt own it, and they don‚Äôt have anything to do with it. And anyone who wants can just rip it off,‚Äù said McCartney. ‚ÄúThe truth is, the money‚Äôs going somewhere‚Ä¶ Somebody‚Äôs getting paid, so why shouldn‚Äôt it be the guy who sat down and wrote Yesterday?‚Äù ~ McCartney. This also comes as there hasn‚Äôt been any clarity on whether it is fair or right to use copyrighted material to train the models that are powering generative AI. This subject has sparked debate across the world with some individuals and firms suing AI companies over what they have called unlicensed use of their material. In 2023, a group of authors took Meta to court on allegations that the social media firm was misusing their books to train AI models, specifically Llama, the large language model that powers its chatbots. The case took a twist recently with new court papers showing the authors alleged that the social media giant knew they were using pirated versions of copyrighted books to train their AI systems. They further alleged Meta CEO knew about the matter and approved it, according to an article by The Guardian . On the other hand, some publishers and media outlets have entered into agreements with AI firms to enable them to use their material to train the AI models. Sir Paul McCartney appealed to the UK government for artists‚Äô protection In the UK, the government has indicated it will use ongoing consultations that will run until February 25, to explore the key points of the debate. This includes how to enhance trust between the creative and AI sectors. The consultations will also explore ways how creators can license and be remunerated for the use of their material. The 82-year-old McCartney appealed for protection from the government, asking it to rethink the idea. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the people, you‚Äôre the government. You‚Äôre supposed to protect us. That‚Äôs your job,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo, you know, if you‚Äôre putting through a bill, make sure you protect the creative thinkers, the creative artists, or you‚Äôre not going to have them.‚Äù ~ McCartney In November 2023, McCartney and Ringo Starr, the other surviving members of the Beatles created a song called Now and Then using AI technology to extract John Lennon‚Äôs vocals from a home demo which was recorded in 1977. The song was billed as the Beatles‚Äô final release, and it drew widespread praise and was nominated for two Grammys and a Brit award. UK government proposal thinks the decision will empower artists While the proposals, if passed, are expected to give creators and artists ‚Äúrights reservations‚Äù through the ability to opt out, critics believe it will be difficult for artists to inform all AI developers not to use their material to train their models. According to the BBC, an alternative proposal for artists to opt in and give permission for their content to be used by AI developers will be put forward in the House of Lords by cross-bench peer Baroness Kidron. Music industry body UK Music CEO Tom Kiehl said the government‚Äôs plans will be counterproductive and endanger the music industry, which is already contributing over ¬£120 billion to the economy. ‚ÄúGovernment plans to change copyright law to make it easier for AI firms to use the music of artists, composers, and music companies without their permission put the music industry at a huge risk,‚Äù said Kiehl. ‚ÄúThere is no evidence that creatives can effectively ‚Äòopt-out‚Äô of their work from being trained by AI systems and so this apparent concession does not provide any reassurance to those that work in music.‚Äù ~ Kiehl A government spokesperson defended the position, saying they are keen on hearing industry views and will act accordingly. ‚ÄúThat is why we have launched a consultation to ensure the UK copyright framework offers strong protections for artists with regards to AI,‚Äù they said. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy last year said:¬†‚ÄúThis Government firmly believes that our musicians, writers, artists and other creatives should have the ability to know and control how their content is used by AI firms and be able to seek licensing deals and fair payment.‚Äù ‚ÄúAchieving this, and ensuring legal certainty, will help our creative and AI sectors grow and innovate together in partnership,‚Äù Nandy added.

Much of that slump correlates with the TRUMP coin overshadowing older dog-themed tokens. Below, we‚Äôll explore why large SHIB holders are leaving for a project that promises real-world finance solutions, and how Remittix (RTX) could reshape the crypto industry for 2025. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Struggle in the Meme Arena Shiba Inu once thrived on social media hype and towering token burns, cementing itself as a formidable dog coin. Yet that early surge has fizzled, the Shiba Inu price is now near $0.00002043, marking a 15% drop in just a week and 11% in a month. Observers point to the meme mania triggered by fresh tokens like TRUMP, which soared with unstoppable hype before overshadowing older memes. As attention moves to trendier projects, Shiba Inu (SHIB) sees a draining of volume that intensifies its price drop. Fans recall how Shiba Inu soared millions of percent from its earliest days, catapulting many small buyers into millionaires. But every meme coin rides waves of attention that can vanish swiftly once new gimmicks appear. The recent overshadowing by TRUMP highlights how unstable this market can be. If tokens can skyrocket overnight, they can also lose ground as soon as the next big thing arrives. For large SHIB holders, it‚Äôs clear that resting hopes on memes alone might be a gamble too big to stomach. The Rise of Remittix as ‚ÄúXRP 2.0‚Äù So, why jump to Remittix? Touted as ‚ÄúXRP 2.0,‚Äù Remittix (RTX) focuses on cross-border payments, a direct nod to Ripple‚Äôs early mission with XRP. However, Remittix aims to sidestep legal challenges or heavy banking alliances by targeting consumer-friendly solutions. Instead of requiring big partnerships, Remittix offers a PayFi model for near-instant crypto-to-fiat exchanges. By removing hidden fees and multi-step conversions, the token has already raised over $6 million in its presale, proving significant interest from those fleeing pure meme-based tokens. Many Shiba Inu whales see Remittix (RTX) as more stable than typical meme mania. While SHIB soared on hype, it never fully tackled day-to-day finance. Remittix, however, addresses everyday remittances and transactions, allowing global users to move funds cheaply and within 24 hours. That tangible use case appeals to large holders wanting safer long-term gains. Some watchers say Remittix might do what Shiba Inu can‚Äôt transcend memes by offering mainstream appeal in the crypto industry. Why SHIB Whales Seek Utility Over Memes 1. Market FatigueAfter months of hype, the meme mania that fueled Shiba Inu has eased. Tokens like TRUMP overshadow older dog-themed coins, making SHIB whales anxious about stagnation or further price dips.2. Practical SolutionsWhile memes entertain, big investors often hunt projects with real growth potential. Remittix fits that bill, aiming to solve cross-border payment inefficiencies. In a crowded market, a coin with everyday utility can outlast meme cycles.3. PayFi ApproachSome whales see the PayFi model from Remittix (RTX) as the next evolutionary step for crypto beyond dog memes and heavy DeFi complexities. If mainstream users adopt this straightforward approach, Remittix could surge.4. Fading Meme FervorAs new memes appear every week, even established dog coins are at risk of losing attention. The Shiba Inu price slump underscores how quickly volume can shift, driving whales to tokens they believe won‚Äôt crumble when memes lose momentum. Conclusion: A Future Centered on Utility? Although Shiba Inu remains a significant meme asset, the ongoing slump down 15% in a week, 11% in a month prompts whales to reconsider. The invasion of other memes like TRUMP only intensifies pressure on SHIB‚Äôs price and market cap. Meanwhile, Remittix beckons as a coin not tied to fleeting social media surges, but to practical financial problems like cross-border transfers. That might be why large SHIB holders now see Remittix (RTX) as ‚ÄúXRP 2.0,‚Äù a coin set to capture the crypto industry‚Äôs attention well beyond 2025.

This decline largely coincides with the TRUMP coin, which has managed to eclipse older dog-themed tokens. We'll delve into why significant SHIB stakeholders are opting for a project that proposes tangible financial solutions and how Remittix (RTX) might redefine the crypto landscape by 2025. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Battle in the Meme Sector Once thriving on social media buzz and significant token burns, Shiba Inu established itself as a powerful dog coin. However, that initial momentum has dwindled, with the Shiba Inu price hovering around $0.00002043, reflecting a 15% decline over a week and an 11% decrease over a month. Analysts attribute this to the meme frenzy sparked by newer tokens like TRUMP, which climbed rapidly on a wave of hype, eventually surpassing older memes. As the spotlight shifts to more fashionable projects, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is witnessing a reduction in trading volume, exacerbating its price decline. Enthusiasts remember Shiba Inu's meteoric rise, which turned modest investors into millionaires. Nonetheless, every meme coin thrives on fleeting attention that can disappear as quickly as it arrives with new gimmicks. The recent eclipse by TRUMP showcases how volatile this market can be. Just as tokens can surge overnight, they can also plummet when the next big thing emerges. For substantial SHIB holders, relying solely on memes is a risk that may be too great to endure. Emergence of Remittix as ‚ÄúXRP 2.0‚Äù So, why switch to Remittix? Marketed as ‚ÄúXRP 2.0,‚Äù Remittix (RTX) is concentrated on cross-border payments, echoing Ripple‚Äôs original goals with XRP. Yet, Remittix is designed to avoid legal hurdles or extensive banking collaborations by focusing on consumer-accessible solutions. Instead of needing large partnerships, Remittix offers a PayFi model for nearly instant crypto-to-fiat conversions. By eliminating hidden fees and complex conversion steps, the token has already secured over $6 million in its presale, highlighting substantial interest from those moving away from purely meme-driven tokens. Many Shiba Inu whales perceive Remittix (RTX) as more reliable than typical meme hype. While SHIB thrived on excitement, it never truly addressed everyday financial uses. Remittix, however, tackles practical remittances and transactions, enabling global users to transfer funds affordably and within a day. This concrete application is attractive to large holders seeking safer long-term returns. Some analysts believe Remittix might achieve what Shiba Inu cannot, breaking free from memes by offering broader appeal in the crypto market. Why SHIB Whales Favor Utility Over Memes 1. Market ExhaustionAfter months of excitement, the meme frenzy that once propelled Shiba Inu has diminished. Tokens like TRUMP have outshone older dog-themed coins, causing anxiety among SHIB whales about stagnation or further drops in value.2. Real-World SolutionsThough memes provide entertainment, major investors often seek projects with genuine growth prospects. Remittix fits this description, striving to address inefficiencies in cross-border payments. In a saturated market, coins with practical uses can endure beyond the meme cycle.3. Embracing PayFiCertain whales view the PayFi strategy from Remittix (RTX) as the next evolutionary step for cryptocurrencies, moving beyond dog memes and complex DeFi systems. Should mainstream users adopt this straightforward model, Remittix could experience substantial growth.4. Declining Meme CrazeWith new memes surfacing weekly, even established dog coins risk losing focus. The Shiba Inu price drop highlights how quickly trading volume can shift, prompting whales to invest in tokens they believe will remain stable when the meme craze subsides. Conclusion: A Shift Towards Utility? Although Shiba Inu continues to be a key meme asset, the current slump of 15% in a week and 11% over a month is prompting whales to reconsider. The influx of other memes like TRUMP further increases the downward pressure on SHIB‚Äôs value and market position. In contrast, Remittix presents itself as a token not reliant on volatile social media trends, but one focused on solving real financial issues such as cross-border payments. This might explain why notable SHIB holders are now viewing Remittix (RTX) as ‚ÄúXRP 2.0,‚Äù a token poised to capture attention well into 2025 and beyond.

This jump in volume ranges from macro factors to mounting investors‚Äô appetite for Ripple-related crypto assets like XRP. Furthermore, Donald Trump‚Äôs road to the White House garnered positive sentiments for the wider crypto market. Whales Turn to RLUSD A new CryptoQuant report shows growing RLSUD volume, marking a significant shift in the stablecoin market. Last year, the asset saw smaller transactions on the Ethereum network, typically below $1,000. In the same period, whale activity soared in the crypto market but was largely recorded in other stablecoins like USDT and USDC. However, a shift was flagged by on-chain crypto firms between Jan 7- and Jan 15, while smaller players dropped the pace. Transactions ranging from $100,000- $1,000,000 and beyond spiked in the Ethereum network, with RLUSD notching a fair share. Notably, this shows whales‚Äô participation in the crypto market and with the asset. Stablecoins are seen as gateway assets for institutional investors to gain exposure to the market and decentralized finance. Aside from Bitcoin (BTC), most large-scale clients test the waters with stablecoins and usually purchase other assets. As a result, traders gauge participation based on stablecoin volumes on several networks and crypto exchanges. ‚Äú This shift indicates increased participation from larger players, such as institutions or high-net-worth individuals. This trend shows that the RLUSD market is growing, with more big players and medium-sized traders joining in, which could make it more stable and easier to trade,‚Äù CryptoQuant added. Most commentators opine that the volume growth comes from USDT facing regulatory uncertainty in Europe some weeks back. The added boost also comes from XRP‚Äôs blistering uptick in the last 30 days. The Trump Effect Stablecoin and other crypto assets witnessed surging inflows after the U.S. elections in November 2024. Donald Trump‚Äôs win inspired a new spike in institutional and retail movements. Top of the list is the need to usher in pro-market regulations, especially on stablecoins. A move to similar rules, such as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, will spur innovation in the industry. Furthermore, Trump‚Äôs decentralized crypto platform, non-fungible tokens, and meme coin launch have propelled investors to view the space with improved confidence.

In a tweet on Tuesday, DOGE ‚Äî an agency formed by the Trump administration ‚Äî pointed out how it costs the U.S. Mint about 3 cents to make each penny‚Äîyet it‚Äôs only worth 1 cent. Taxpayers shoulder most of the costs, roughly $179 million in FY2023, to mint 4.5 billion pennies, the agency claimed. The penny costs over 3 cents to make and cost US taxpayers over $179 million in FY2023. The Mint produced over 4.5 billion pennies in FY2023, around 40% of the 11.4 billion coins for circulation produced. Penny (or 3 cents!) for your thoughts.

But the penny isn‚Äôt alone in its expensive ways‚Äîminting a nickel costs 14 cents, and with zinc prices soaring, the penny‚Äôs production costs have only risen, now topping 3.7 cents per coin, CBS News reported , citing the U.S. Mint‚Äôs 2024 data . The U.S. wouldn‚Äôt be breaking new ground if it were to halt penny production. Canada stopped minting its one-cent coin in 2012. The decision was made due to the high cost of producing pennies. At the time, it cost about 1.6 cents to produce each penny, while the coin‚Äôs face value was just one cent. To replace pennies in cash transactions, prices were rounded to the nearest five cents. This rounding practice applied to cash payments, but electronic payments were not affected. Meanwhile, Musk is reportedly planning to reduce government expenses by integrating Dogecoin ( DOGE ) ‚Äî the joke token that inspired the name of his cost-cutting agency ‚Äî into federal operations. You might also like: Elon Musk wants to bring Dogecoin back to Tesla merch page But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ The cost to mine Dogecoin can exceed its market value, too. Various factors, like electricity costs and mining hardware efficiency, can make mining a meme coin pricier than the token could be worth. Like Bitcoin, mining Dogecoin is energy-intensive, even though some miners use less resource-heavy tech compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs SHA-256. That said, in regions with expensive electricity, the cost to mine a Dogecoin may be higher than its current value. Older or less efficient hardware could also make DOGE mining cost more than it‚Äôs worth at current prices. Plus, unlike pennies and nickels, Dogecoin has little to no utility and its market value is often volatile. When the price is low, the cost of mining may exceed the revenue generated from mining. This cause some miners to halt operations. Conversely, during periods of price surges, mining becomes more profitable. Ultimately, the economics of mining any cryptocurrency is highly variable, influenced by local conditions and market trends.

That huge rally made people wonder which coin might be next. Observers are now pointing to a PayFi project named Remittix as the likeliest candidate for a similar 500% surge. Below, we‚Äôll explore XRP‚Äôs rise, how its achievement impacted the crypto space, and why experts see Remittix following or even outpacing XRP‚Äôs trajectory in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. XRP‚Äôs Swift Climb and Lasting Impact Toward the close of last year, XRP shot up far beyond market expectations, sending holders into a frenzy. Some labeled it XRP mania as institutional money mingled with retail excitement. The token‚Äôs cross-border payment focus drew attention from major players, reinforcing XRP‚Äôs real-world connections. By the time the dust settled, early adopters saw their positions grow exponentially, thanks to Ripple‚Äôs payment technology and ongoing adoption trials. Though regulatory and legal uncertainties often plague XRP, the coin‚Äôs ability to spark major rallies remains clear. Many watchers took note, searching for new altcoins that could deliver similarly big returns. That quest led them to zero in on tokens tackling everyday financial hurdles, like Remittix. With PayFi solutions taking center stage, some insiders say Remittixcould enjoy an equally dramatic climb if mainstream acceptance kicks in. Why Remittix Is Drawing Parallels to XRP So, how does a fresh altcoin resemble a long-standing coin like XRP? The key lies in cross-border utility. Remittix (RTX) addresses crypto-to-fiat payments, but it does so without heavily relying on big banking alliances. Instead, it provides a PayFi model that simplifies sending money worldwide in minimal time, slashing fees and removing hidden costs. Early backers see parallels to XRP‚Äôs initial promise of quick, cheap global transfers but believe Remittix‚Äôsinnovative payment system that allows funds to reach people directly and bypass complicated corporate deals makes it a real world solution for crypto. With its ICO in full swing Remittix continues to attract substantial attention from shrewd investors with over $6.1 million being deposited in less than four weeks! Some call Remittix a prime example of how the cryptocurrency landscape is shifting toward coins with solid use cases, beyond memes or hype. If Remittix taps a fraction of the global remittance market, experts predict a surge reminiscent of XRP‚Äôs big leap last year. A Bigger Trend in the Cryptocurrency Landscape While XRP soared on institutional interest and speculation, the broader market has shown growing hunger for altcoins solving real pains. Meme tokens might flare up occasionally, but the longer-lasting winners often serve a practical function. PayFi solutions, especially those letting people move cash across borders easily, could be next in line for major growth. Remittix (RTX) taps into that demand, sparing users from hidden fees and multi-step conversions. It‚Äôs an approach that resonates with merchants, freelancers, and regular folks alike. In many ways, this new wave of utility projects signals a move away from simple speculation toward genuine adoption. Large crypto holders who once cycled through meme after meme now seek altcoins that might deliver slow but stable expansions. The success of XRP last year proved that tokens addressing financial transactions can skyrocket when the timing and user base align. If Remittix can capture similar momentum, a 500% price surge may even be conservative. Why 2025 Could Be the Turning Point Observers note that major shifts in the cryptocurrency landscape often lineup with user adoption cycles. With more merchants and individuals seeking simpler payment methods, Remittixpositions itself as a leading PayFi solution. If global interest in frictionless money transfers grows, the altcoin could blow up in the same manner XRP did. High presale demand suggests big investors already anticipate this possibility. Of course no crypto is guaranteed to follow XRP‚Äôs exact path, surging 500% or more often depends on market conditions, timing and user acceptance. Still, many see Remittix‚Äôs real-world focus as an edge over purely speculative coins, giving it a solid shot at delivering the next major run-up. Conclusion: A New XRP-Style Rally on the Horizon? While XRP remains a notable token, especially after last year‚Äôs dramatic run, experts believe a new PayFi altcoin like Remittix could be next to shake up the market with a 500% leap. By fixing cross-border payment hassles, Remittix (RTX) aligns with the growing preference for coins that do more than spark short-lived hype. If you‚Äôre looking for a token that parallels XRP‚Äôs price explosions but focuses on user-friendly solutions, Remittix might be your next big bet.

This remarkable surge has left many speculating about which cryptocurrency might follow in its footsteps. Many now believe that a PayFi initiative known as Remittix is the most promising candidate for a comparable 500% increase. Below, we‚Äôll delve into XRP‚Äôs rapid ascent, its influence on the crypto market, and why experts think Remittix might either match or surpass XRP‚Äôs success as the cryptocurrency landscape develops. XRP‚Äôs Quick Rise and Its Enduring Influence As last year drew to a close, XRP's price soared beyond what many anticipated, causing a frenzy among investors. Some dubbed it XRP mania, fueled by a mix of institutional and retail enthusiasm. The token‚Äôs emphasis on cross-border payments attracted significant interest, strengthening XRP‚Äôs practical applications. When the excitement settled, early investors reaped substantial gains, thanks to Ripple‚Äôs innovative payment solutions and ongoing trials. Despite facing regulatory and legal challenges, XRP‚Äôs potential to ignite major rallies remains evident. This hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed, as many are now on the lookout for new altcoins that might offer similar lucrative returns. Their search led them to focus on tokens addressing everyday financial issues, including Remittix. With PayFi solutions becoming increasingly important, insiders suggest that Remittix could experience a similarly dramatic rise if it gains mainstream acceptance. What Makes Remittix Comparable to XRP? So, what makes a new altcoin resemble a well-established one like XRP? The secret lies in its cross-border capabilities. Remittix (RTX) focuses on crypto-to-fiat transactions without relying heavily on major banking partnerships. Instead, it offers a PayFi framework that facilitates rapid, low-cost global transfers, eliminating hidden charges. Early supporters draw parallels to XRP‚Äôs original promise of fast, affordable international transactions but view Remittix‚Äôsinnovative system, which allows funds to be transferred directly while bypassing complex corporate deals, as a real-world solution within crypto. With its ICO currently underway, Remittix is drawing significant interest from savvy investors, accumulating over $6.1 million in just under four weeks! Some tout Remittix as a prime example of how the crypto world is shifting towards coins with tangible applications, beyond mere memes or hype. Should Remittix capture even a small portion of the global remittance market, experts foresee a surge akin to XRP‚Äôs impressive leap last year. A Broader Trend in the World of Cryptocurrency While XRP gained momentum from institutional interest and speculation, the wider market has shown an increasing appetite for altcoins that address genuine problems. Meme coins may have their moments, but the true winners over the long run often fulfill practical needs. PayFi solutions, especially those enabling easy cross-border cash transfers, could be poised for significant growth. Remittix (RTX) taps into this demand by eliminating hidden fees and complex conversion processes. This approach appeals to businesses, freelancers, and everyday users alike. In many respects, this new wave of utility-driven projects marks a shift from mere speculation to true adoption. Large crypto investors who previously cycled through memes are now seeking altcoins promising steady, sustainable growth. Last year‚Äôs success of XRP demonstrated that tokens focused on financial transactions can achieve rapid growth when market timing and user interest align perfectly. If Remittix manages to build similar momentum, a 500% price increase might even be seen as a modest projection. Why 2025 Could Be a Pivotal Year Experts note that significant changes in the cryptocurrency arena often coincide with adoption cycles. As more merchants and individuals seek streamlined payment methods, Remittix positions itself as a prominent PayFi solution. Should global interest in seamless money transfers rise, the altcoin might surge similarly to how XRP did. Strong presale interest indicates that major investors are already predicting this outcome. Of course, no cryptocurrency is guaranteed to mirror XRP‚Äôs exact trajectory, with a 500% surge depending heavily on market circumstances, timing, and user acceptance. Nevertheless, many regard Remittix‚Äôs practical emphasis as an advantage over purely speculative tokens, providing it a strong chance to ignite the next significant rally. Conclusion: Is Another XRP-Like Rally Looming? Although XRP remains a significant player, especially following last year‚Äôs impressive run, experts think that a new PayFi altcoin like Remittix might be next to stir the market with a 500% jump. By addressing cross-border payment challenges, Remittix (RTX) aligns with the increasing demand for coins that offer more than just fleeting excitement. If you‚Äôre searching for a token reminiscent of XRP‚Äôs explosive growth but focused on practical solutions, Remittix might be the promising opportunity you‚Äôre looking for.

Post its initial two-day frenzy, however, $TRUMP cooled down and is now 50% down from the all-time highs of $75. Still, it‚Äôs currently among the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap, which is no small feat. As per Chainalysis , 80% of $TRUMP holders hold less than $1K worth of the token. Plus, nearly 50% of the buyers had never bought a coin on the Solana blockchain, and half of them created a wallet on the day they purchased the token. Even crypto apps like Crypto.com, Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance saw a significant increase in downloads during the two days before the token launch. All this data indicates that $TRUMP has drawn a lot of new people towards the crypto market. However, 77% of wallets with $TRUMP have made less than $100 as of Jan 21. In contrast, 60 whales have earned upwards of $10M. This goes to show that new investors with penny holdings haven‚Äôt made much in the $TRUMP frenzy. If you‚Äôre one of them, there‚Äôs no reason to lose heart, as you can still make a lot of money by investing in other popular (and fundamentally strong) crypto. Here are the 5 best meme coins that can make you a millionaire in 2025 . 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) ‚Äì The Frog-Inspired Meme Coin That Looks to Empower Small Investors Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is the newest member of the OG frog meme gang, but if its presale numbers are anything to go by, it could be the most successful Pepe iteration yet. The project has already raised over $59M in presale funding. $WEPE looks to establish a strong community of small investors by providing key insider news, alpha calls, and trading strategies ‚Äì the kind of intel that was earlier reserved only for whales. However, by making this information accessible to all, $WEPE looks to empower a new generation of crypto millionaires. Currently available at $0.0003665, this may be the lowest you can get $WEPE for before the presale ends in less 22 days. Here‚Äôs how to buy $WEPE . Wall Street Pepe‚Äôs predecessor, $PEPE, already churned out 1,200% gains for early investors, which is why whales have also jumped in to get a piece of the $WEPE frenzy. It‚Äôs also worth noting that analysts believe $WEPE can be the next 100x meme coin . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Solana‚Äôs Frist-Ever Layer 2 Solution Solving Scalability Issues Solaxy ($SOLX) is the first-ever Solana Layer 2 solution, which aims to solve the scalability issues that plagued Layer-1 chains. With time, the Solana ecosystem has seen increased traffic, which has slowed throughput and increased the instances of failed transactions. The latest Layer 2 solution, Solaxy, employs batch processing to solve these issues. This translates into faster transaction times and lower fees. Solaxy is also a multi-chain token, which means it operates on both Solana and Ethereum blockchains. This combines the benefits of Solana‚Äôs speed and Ethereum‚Äôs liquidity, creating an efficient gateway to multichain DeFi. This, combined with Solana‚Äôs potential, is one of the biggest reasons Solaxy can be the next crypto presale to explode . The $SOLX presale has raised $14.5M so far and is currently available at $0.001614. With a total token supply of 138B, the next price increase will happen in around 24 hours from now, so interested investors should hurry up. Check out our guide on how to buy $SOLX for more info. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) ‚Äì Autonomous AI Agent Tackling Information Load $MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a self-evolving AI agent with the objective of tackling issues of market fragmentation, informational overload, and identifying early-stage opportunities. This autonomous AI agent interacts with influencers and crypto experts on various platforms, such as X, and employs real-time hive-mind analysis to consolidate insights from various sources. It then provides token holders clear-cut data on emerging trends and exclusive opportunities, including access to the best crypto presales before anyone else. Currently in presale, this unique AI-powered token has already raised over $3.6M. You can buy 1 $MIND token for just $0.0031889 ‚Äì here‚Äôs how to buy $MIND , but prices are set to increase in the next 11 hours as the $MIND presale enters its next stage. 4. YourTrump ($YTP) ‚Äì Political Meme Coin Inspired by Trump‚Äôs X Followers YourTrump ($YTP) is inspired by the popularity of Donald Trump, deriving its value from the number of followers Trump has on X (Twitter), which is close to surging past the $100M mark at the time of writing. With $TRUMP already having taken the crypto meme industry by storm, $YTP, which is based on the same concept, can be expected to yield similar returns. You can, at all times, see $YTP‚Äôs expected listing price on its official website. Currently, it‚Äôs $3.5829, which is comfortably over 100x the present buying price of the token. The presale ends in 6 days, after which the token will be listed on exchanges, so this can be your last chance to directly benefit from Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto personality. 5. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) ‚Äì Another AI Meme Coin Working on Establishing Secure Blockchains Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is a unique token that looks to combine blockchain technologies with artificial intelligence (AI). $LCAI will leverage technologies like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) to build more secure blockchains. PoI is a consensus mechanism that rewards nodes if they perform AI tasks that lead to meaningful contributions to AI whilst maintaining network security. Furthermore, AIVM is a computational layer that will execute AI tasks on the blockchain. Together, these mechanisms look to provide an efficient and privacy-preserving ecosystem for participants and developers. $LCAI is currently in the 13th stage of its presale, having raised over $13M so far. Interested investors can get it for just $0.005625 per token if they act now. Conclusion These are the 5 best meme coins you can invest in right now if you missed out on $TRUMP. All of them are currently in presale, and given their strong fundamentals and positive market sentiments, they have the potential to generate anywhere from 10x to 100x returns, and maybe even more. However, investments in the crypto market are a risky affair, given its volatility. This makes it crucial to do your own research before jumping in on purchases.

Based on historical price movements during past bull cycles , the analysis suggests that DOGE could target a minimum valuation of about $8, according to pseudonymous analyst Trader Tardigrade in an X post on January 24. Specifically, in prior bull cycles during 2017 and 2021, Dogecoin recorded gains of over 3,000% and 8,000%, respectively, after breaking above the previous candle body highs. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: Trader Tardigrade For instance, after breaking a key resistance , Dogecoin surged 3,284%, taking its price from $0.00001838 to $0.01838 within months. History repeated itself when Dogecoin skyrocketed 8,025% to $0.72995 in 2021, fueled by retail interest and celebrity backing. Currently, Dogecoin‚Äôs formation hints at the possibility of another significant rally. If DOGE mirrors its past performance, the expert suggested it could soar to $8.32 and $20.68 in the next cycle. A break above critical resistance, near $0.41, could trigger a parabolic rally, mirroring previous bull runs. Looking at the near-term target, prominent trading analyst Ali Martinez predicted that Dogecoin could soon target $0.39 and possibly $15 , given its bullish multi-year ascending channel. However, breaking the $1 resistance remains crucial for any possibility of Dogecoin recording a sustained rally. Nevertheless, if DOGE hits $8, its market cap would soar to about $1.18 trillion, ranking second to Bitcoin ( BTC ). What next for Dogecoin? On the same note, an analysis by prominent online trading expert Trading Shot highlighted the significance of Dogecoin breaching the $0.40 resistance. In a TradingView p ost on January 25, the expert observed that Dogecoin has been trading within a consistent channel-up pattern since bottoming out on December 20, 2024. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/TradingShot A reliable buy signal has emerged each time the price forms a double bottom near the pattern‚Äôs higher-low trendline, accompanied by two consecutive bullish crosses on the four-hour Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) indicator. This signal has occurred twice previously, resulting in price rallies that reached the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level, creating higher highs within the channel. Currently, the same pattern is repeated for a third time. Given this technical setup, the expert turned bullish on Dogecoin‚Äôs short-term potential, setting a target of $0.43250, aligning with the 2.618 Fibonacci extension. For DOGE to embark on a parabolic rally, the cryptocurrency needs significant buying momentum‚Äîan aspect that appears plausible given ongoing developments around the coin. For instance, the eighth-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap could potentially attract more institutional capital if a related exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) is launched. In this case, cryptocurrency investment firm Bitwise has reportedly filed to establish a Delaware statutory trust for a Dogecoin ETF. This application is part of broader market optimism for diverse crypto ETFs following the election of President Donald Trump , who has nominated crypto-friendly Paul Atkins as the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) chair. At the same time, Rex Shares and its affiliate Osprey Funds have filed for seven crypto ETFs, including those tied to Dogecoin, Bonk (BONK), and the official Trump (TRUMP) coin. DOGE price analysis chart By press time, DOGE was trading at $0.35, a drop of over 3% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the meme coin is down 11%. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current price, Dogecoin is slightly below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $0.366687, indicating short-term bearish momentum. However, it remains above the 200-day SMA of $0.213973, suggesting a bullish long-term trend. The Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is neutral at 49.94, reflecting consolidation, while the Fear & Greed Index at 75 signals market greed.

Boasting an anticipated 500% increase in value, Rollblock presents a compelling opportunity for savvy investors, thanks to its unique combination of cutting-edge technology, a thriving casino platform, and advantageous tokenomics. The Rollblock Transformation While DOGE banks on community-driven hype and XRP focuses on streamlining cross-border payments, Rollblock is breaking new ground by merging blockchain with the expanding online gaming industry. The project's casino, operational for over eight months, offers more than 7,000 games and sports betting options for major events. With backing from an Anjouan Gaming license, Rollblock promises a transparent, secure, and fair gaming experience that surpasses the limits of traditional platforms. A standout feature of the Rollblock casino is its provably fair random number generator (RNG). This technology tackles one of the significant challenges in the gaming world‚Äîtransparency‚Äîby ensuring every spin, roll, and bet is fair. Unlike conventional platforms plagued by hidden fees and obscure business practices, Rollblock's RNG enhances user trust and contributes to a consistent income for the ecosystem. Tokenomics Surpassing XRP and DOGE Rollblock's pioneering tokenomics set it apart from XRP and DOGE. It employs a dual-purpose buyback system that allocates up to 30% of its weekly profits to repurchase RBLK tokens. Remarkably, 60% of these tokens are burned, significantly reducing supply and increasing the token's value through deflation. The other 40% is distributed to holders as staking rewards, potentially offering annual yields exceeding 30% APY. In contrast to DOGE, which lacks substantial utility beyond its meme status, and XRP, which largely depends on regulatory clarity for its advancement, RBLK holders directly benefit from the platform's success. This dynamic ensures steady returns for regular users and long-term investors alike. With Rollblock's presale already amassing over $9 million and tokens priced at just $0.047, early adopters can position themselves for the projected 500% rally. Why Rollblock Stands Out Rollblock‚Äôs ability to tackle real-world challenges in the gambling industry and offer tangible benefits to investors distinguishes it from currencies like XRP and DOGE. Traditional online casinos often suffer from high fees, lack of transparency, and minimal customer incentives. Rollblock addresses these issues by creating a decentralized environment using blockchain technology, where security, profitability, and fairness are paramount. On the other hand, XRP is focused solely on facilitating fast and low-cost international transactions, which, while important, do not directly reward token holders financially. Similarly, despite its widespread popularity and strong community support, DOGE struggles to demonstrate utility beyond its meme-driven nature. Rollblock, however, combines the entertainment appeal of a fully operational casino with a robust revenue-sharing model, making it a more versatile and rewarding investment option. The Thriving Casino Powering Rollblock Rollblock's casino is more than just a source of entertainment; it is the cornerstone of the entire ecosystem. With thousands of games and a rapidly growing user base, the casino generates significant weekly revenues, directly benefiting RBLK holders. Its profitability sustains the platform's tokenomics and enhances its long-term value through consistent revenue streams. By integrating blockchain technology, Rollblock ensures transparency in every transaction and eliminates intermediaries. The use of a licensed random number generator further boosts trust by guaranteeing that each game outcome is unbiased and fair. Rollblock‚Äôs focus on security and fairness not only distinguishes it in the competitive crypto market but also attracts players and strengthens investor confidence. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market gears up for its next wave, Rollblock is emerging as a formidable contender ready to surpass renowned tokens like XRP and Dogecoin. With its innovative approach to gaming, strong tokenomics, and a flourishing casino platform, Rollblock offers a unique blend of utility and profitability. Investors seeking long-term value and tangible returns should consider taking a closer look at the RBLK presale as the project continues to gain traction.

With a predicted 500% price increase imminent, Rollblock is a desirable choice for astute investors because of its distinctive blend of state-of-the-art technology, a flourishing casino platform, and profitable tokenomics. The Rollblock revolution Rollblock is forging ahead by fusing blockchain technology with the booming online gaming sector, while DOGE relies on community-driven buzz and XRP keeps concentrating on simplifying international payments. With more than 7,000 games and sports betting possibilities for all significant events, the project's casino has been operational for over eight months. Supported by a license from Anjouan Gaming, Rollblock guarantees an open, safe, and fair gaming environment beyond conventional platforms' constraints. The Rollblock casino's provably fair random number generator (RNG) is one of its most notable features. By ensuring the fairness of each spin, roll, and wager, this technology solves transparency, one of the most significant issues facing the gaming industry. Unlike traditional platforms rife with hidden costs and opaque business practices, Rollblock's RNG builds user confidence while generating a steady income for the ecosystem. Tokenomics that eclipse XRP and DOGE Rollblock's innovative tokenomics really distinguishes it from XRP and DOGE. Rollblock has a dual-purpose buyback mechanism that uses up to 30% of its weekly profits to buy back RBLK tokens. A startling 60% of these repurchased tokens are burned, drastically lowering supply and raising the token's value through deflation. The remaining 40% is given to holders as staking rewards, which might result in yearly yields higher than 30% APY. The platform‚Äôs success immediately benefits RBLK holders, in contrast to DOGE, which has little actual use beyond being a meme token or XRP, which is mostly dependent on legal clarity for its next move. Both frequent consumers and long-term investors benefit from steady returns due to this dynamic. Early adopters can set themselves up for the anticipated 500% rally since Rollblock's presale has already generated over $9 million, and tokens are only $0.047. Why Rollblock outshines the competition The potential of Rollblock to solve actual issues in the gambling sector and provide investors with observable advantages sets it apart from other currencies like XRP and DOGE. Conventional online casinos frequently have exorbitant fees, little transparency, and little customer incentives. By using blockchain technology to build a decentralized environment where security, profitability, and justice are crucial, Rollblock addresses these problems. In contrast, XRP is solely concerned with enabling quick and inexpensive international transactions, which is significant, but does not directly reward token holders with cash. In a similar vein, DOGE has had difficulty proving its usefulness beyond its meme-driven appeal, even with its widespread use and robust community support. However, Rollblock is a more flexible and lucrative investment choice since it combines the entertainment value of a fully functional casino with a strong revenue-sharing model. The booming casino that fuels Rollblock More than merely a venue for amusement, Rollblock's casino serves as the foundation of the whole ecosystem. The casino makes significant weekly revenues from its thousands of games and steadily expanding user base, directly benefiting RBLK holders. Because of its profitability, the platform's tokenomics are maintained, and its long-term worth is increased through steady revenue streams. Rollblock ensures that every transaction is transparent and removes middlemen by incorporating blockchain technology. An additional degree of confidence is added by using a licensed random number generator, which ensures that each game result is impartial and fair. Rollblock stands out in the competitive cryptocurrency market thanks to its emphasis on security and fairness, which also draws players and boosts investor confidence. Conclusion Rollblock is becoming a strong competitor poised to surpass well-known tokens like XRP and Dogecoin as the cryptocurrency market prepares for its next surge. Rollblock provides an exceptional blend of usefulness and profitability with its cutting-edge gambling strategy, robust tokenomics, and thriving casino platform. As the project continues to gain steam, investors looking for long-term value and measurable returns would be good to have a look at the RBLK presale.

Leading the lull has been Bitcoin , which has been hovering between $105,000 and $106,000 for the past five days, facing multiple rejections below the $107,000 threshold. Notably, amid the market‚Äôs pause, some analysts, anticipating a pullback, have been trimming their holdings, with the Cardano community standing out. On Friday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this development, tweeting, ‚ÄúWhales have sold more than 180 million ADA over the past week.‚Äù This wave of selling comes despite strong network activity, with Cardano‚Äôs daily active addresses reaching a new high of 50,828 earlier this week. Interestingly, the shift in whale behavior contrasts sharply with the sentiment just a few days ago. On January 12, Martinez highlighted that whales had accumulated over 90 million ADA within a 96-hour period, suggesting a bullish outlook. Earlier on January 8, he had reported that whales had offloaded more than 70 million ADA in just 48 hours, signaling market indecision. Earlier on Saturday, Martinez further underscored this prevailing indecision, noting that the ongoing consolidation could form a symmetrical triangle pattern. According to him, this technical setup suggests a potential price move of up to 40% in either direction. Despite this uncertainty, the Cardano community remains optimistic about ADA‚Äôs prospects, especially with the upcoming Plomin hard fork upgrade. Expected to be fully implemented by January 29, the upgrade aims to enhance Cardano‚Äôs governance and blockchain capabilities, potentially boosting investor confidence in the network. Earlier this week, President Trump signed an executive order establishing a crypto working group to position the U.S. as a global leader in blockchain technology. This move is a potential boon for cryptocurrencies like ADA, particularly within the U.S. market. Moreover, there have been growing calls to include ADA in the national digital asset reserve, driven by the Cardano community‚Äôs optimism about its long-term potential as a reserve asset. Supporters highlight ADA‚Äôs fixed supply of 45 billion tokens as a critical factor, positioning it as a future store of value comparable to Bitcoin. Earlier this week, billionaire Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, recently voiced optimism about the role of ADA and XRP in U.S. monetary policy. His remarks have prompted Charles Hoskinson, Cardano‚Äôs founder, to meet with Yusko to explore potential collaboration. On Friday, BlackRock‚Äôs CEO Larry Fink expressed interest in securing approval for the tokenization of stocks and bonds, a development that has been welcomed by many in the Cardano community, especially those focused on U.S.-based projects like Cardano. Meanwhile, Cardano‚Äôs blockchain continues to make strides in real-world applications, with over 580 ecosystem projects focused on areas such as security, traceability, and sustainability. More than 70% of these projects target a global audience, further solidifying Cardano‚Äôs position as a leader in addressing large-scale, real-world challenges. ADA traded at $0.98 at press time, reflecting a 0.65% drop in the last 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-25 15:55:19

By monetizing MSTR's volatility to generate income, MSTY is appealing for income-oriented or more prudent investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. MSTY can outperform MSTR in range-bound markets, moderate bullish movements, and even declining BTC markets by offsetting losses with premium income. Even during a BTC surge, MSTY can outperform if MSTR's premium to NAV compresses, leading to lucrative premiums and incredible dividends. Let me start by saying that I‚Äôve recently become a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) believer. I think this is highly relevant because, let‚Äôs face it, any talk about crypto-related securities like the one we are examining today is inevitably shaped by the author‚Äôs stance on the industry. So, let me be clear that I am a Bitcoin bull gradually evolving into a Bitcoin Maximalist. Now, I won't spend time trying to sell Bitcoin as the (potentially) best asset in the world. There are plenty of resources out there for you to study Bitcoin and decide for yourself as to how you feel about it. What I do want to discuss, however, is YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ), which is a fitting vehicle for those seeking to capture the upside of Bitcoin (through Microstrategy ( MSTR )) with reduced risk. This is because one could still generate massive returns regardless of whether BTC surges or bounces up and down in a certain range while still maintaining a wide margin of safety should BTC decline. What might immediately catch your attention once you go over any of MSTY's key financial data is its sky-high 100% dividend yield. You would be right, of course, to assume that such a high yield is likely unsustainable at first glance. MSTY Dividend Yield % (Koyfin) However, there are certainly compelling reasons to support that MSTY‚Äôs unique structure and strategy can maintain such a tremendous payout potential in the foreseeable future. To put it simply, by taking advantage of the extreme volatility of MSTR stock, MSTY can generate substantial short-term option premiums, which, in turn, explains its staggering yield. As you can see, roughly half of MSTY's holdings are a batch of calls expiring next month with a strike price of $315. The current MSTR of the price of $375 implies that MSTY would miss on the additional upside if the option were to expire today. Still, MSTY is able to generate massive yields in the process while capturing the up-to-$315 upside. MSTY Options chain (Seeking Alpha) So, I will attempt to briefly explain how MSTY operates, why its yield is likely to remain high, and the scenarios in which it could even outperform MSTR itself. MSTY: A High-Yield ETF Built on Volatility So, what does MSTY even do? Well, it is certainly no ordinary ETF. It employs a covered call strategy on MSTR stock, which, in turn, is famous for its extreme price swings due to its significant BTC holdings and highly speculative (or not so speculative if you are a BTC bull like me) nature. By selling call options on MSTR, MSTY generates regular income from the premiums it collects. These premiums are then paid out to investors as dividends, creating a consistent stream of income that drives MSTY‚Äôs remarkable yield. Clearly, this strategy makes MSTY particularly appealing (but not limited) to income-oriented investors who want exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs upside potential but with less risk than directly owning MSTR stock (or BTC to that extent). And since MSTY essentially monetizes the volatility of MSTR to generate income, the higher the volatility in MSTR and BTC, the higher the income potential. With both assets likely to remain highly volatile in the foreseeable future (and beyond), MSTY is likely to be able to maintain its current triple-digit yield. Let me explain more thoroughly... Why MSTY‚Äôs 100% Yield Could Be Sustained The main reason I believe that MSTY's yield could be sustained is due to BTC sustaining its high volatility, which, in turn, should sustain MSTR‚Äôs wild price swings and own volatility. Following the convertible bonds strategy MSTR has employed, its stock essentially is a leveraged proxy for BTC's performance. This volatility translates directly into high implied volatility for MSTR options, which in turn leads to massive premiums when MSTY sells covered calls. Take a look at MSTR's Feb 28 options chain. Assuming MSTY were to execute a covered call with a strike price of $400, that would translate to a monthly yield of just under 10% while capturing all the upside from the difference between $400 and the current stock price (for the opportunity cost, of course, of any potential upside beyond that price point). MSTY Options Chain (Seeking Alpha) Therefore, you can see how MSTY maintains the potential for a 100%+ yield today and additional share price gains. Importantly, this remains the case despite MSTR's volatility having somewhat eased from December's highs (it's still, of course, incredibly high, hence the massive premiums). MSTR/MSTY volatility (Koyfin) Therefore, as long as BTC remains highly volatile‚Äîwhich is likely given the crypto space is hotter than ever, especially following President Trump's recent executive orders on cryptocurrencies that have drawn significant investor attention‚Äîthe case for MSTY sustaining a triple-digit yield with the potential for further upside remains highly compelling. When MSTY Could Outperform MSTR (and other scenarios) Now let's examine when MSTY could even outperform MSTR, as well as what we should expect in other scenarios. i. Sideways or Range-Bound Markets MSTY best thrives when MSTR‚Äôs price remains in a defined range. In this case, it could outperform MSTR. For instance, if MSTR trades between $350 and $400 over the next several months, MSTY should be able to repeatedly sell call options at strike prices near the upper end of this range (like the Feb 28 $400 covered call I mentioned earlier). The options will expire worthless if the stock doesn‚Äôt exceed the strike price, allowing MSTY to keep the premium income while continuing to own the shares, thus outperforming MSTR common holders. ii. Moderate Bullish Movements Even in a moderately bullish BTC market, MSTY can still perform very well. If MSTR‚Äôs stock price rises gradually without notably exceeding the strike prices of the calls, MSTY will benefit from both the high premium income and some price gains. This scenario can result in MSTY outpacing the returns of MSTR, even if you end up losing some of the additional upside of the modest MSTR gains beyond the strike price. iii. Declining BTC Market In a bearish BTC market, you should also outperform MSTR by holding MSTY. Obviously, this is because MSTY‚Äôs income will provide a cushion against losses. While MSTR holders face direct exposure to price declines, MSTY‚Äôs premiums will offset some of the downside risks, reducing overall losses. As I mentioned earlier, this makes MSTY particularly appealing for investors who want to capture some of the tremendous upside BTC/MSTR offer, with much lower risk. Here's a specific example. As you can see, in the 3-month period between June 5th and September 6th, MSTR declined by 32.55%, but MSTY's total returns were at a negative 22.5%, with the dividend income offsetting some of the nominal share price losses. MSTR/MSTY Total Returns (Koyfin) A BTC Surge Can Still Result In MSTY Outperformance Finally, I want to draw your attention to something especially intriguing. That is, MSTY can still outperform MSTR, even in a scenario in which BTC surges. Normally, in this scenario, MSTR should outperform MSTY, as MSTY's gains are likely to be capped at levels that MSTR stock can surpass, assuming a strong BTC rally. This is basically what has happened since the ETF's inception. As you can see, even though the ETF has delivered a tremendous return of 255.6%, it has underperformed MSTR's ridiculous 418.7% over the same period. MSTR/MSTY Total Return (Koyfin) However, assuming MSTR's premium to net asset value (NAV) gets squeezed, we could see any BTC-rally-related gains offset by a ""multiple compression"" that could flatten MSTR stock. In fact, this trend has already started to materialize, with the premium to NAV down from about 3.5X to 2.0X. MSTR NAV Premium (MSTR Tracker) In such a scenario, MSTR's violent movement, yet relatively sideways trading, could lead to MSTY outperforming by a wide margin, with premiums set to be extremely lucrative under this setup. We have already seen this play out with the ongoing P/NAV compression against a strong BTC price leading to MSTY paying out incredible dividends.",MSTR|MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-25 16:00:00

Once seen as the leader of innovation and growth in the crypto space, Ethereum‚Äôs slow movement has left many investors frustrated and questioning its short-term potential. However, signs suggest that this period of underperformance could be coming to an end. Related Reading: XRP Forms A Bullish Pattern In 4-Hour Chart ‚Äì Analyst Expects $4.20 After Breakout Recent data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed a bullish development for Ethereum. According to their insights, whales‚Äîlarge holders of cryptocurrency‚Äîhave accumulated over 1.14 million Ethereum in the last 48 hours. This surge in accumulation signals growing confidence among institutional players and high-net-worth investors, who are positioning themselves for a potential bullish breakout. This significant whale activity often precedes large price movements, as it demonstrates strong interest from those with the resources to influence market trends. With Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals still solid and the adoption of its blockchain ecosystem steadily growing, the recent whale activity could be the catalyst for a reversal in Ethereum‚Äôs fortunes. Ethereum Investors Waiting For A Breakout Ethereum has been under significant selling pressure, facing heightened volatility over the past two weeks and extending through several months. This prolonged downtrend has tested the resolve of many investors, leading some to capitulate as Ethereum continues to underperform relative to Bitcoin and other altcoins. However, a growing number of market participants remain optimistic, convinced that ETH still holds significant potential for a major recovery this year. Among the bullish voices is top analyst Ali Martinez, who recently shared compelling data highlighting a surge in whale activity. According to Martinez, whales have accumulated over 1.14 million Ethereum in the past 48 hours, signaling renewed confidence in ETH‚Äôs long-term prospects. Such large-scale accumulation by high-net-worth investors often indicates a belief in an impending price rebound, as whales are known to position themselves ahead of major market moves. This whale activity aligns with the broader bullish outlook many analysts have set for Ethereum this year. With its robust ecosystem, growing adoption, and significant upgrades like the recent Ethereum Merge enhancing its efficiency, Ethereum continues to solidify its role as a leading blockchain. Related Reading: Hedera Successfully Retests Key Demand Level ‚Äì Expert Says The Next Stop Could Be $0.52 The coming weeks will be critical for ETH as it navigates these volatile conditions. Whether Ethereum can capitalize on the bullish momentum created by whale accumulation remains to be seen. Still, the potential for a significant turnaround is evident, and the current market dynamics suggest that Ethereum is far from being counted out. Investors and analysts alike are keeping a close eye on ETH, anticipating whether it can overcome selling pressure and reignite its upward trajectory in the months ahead. ETH Price Action: Testing Key Levels Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,305, holding above key demand levels despite a modest 4% drop since yesterday. The ability to maintain support around $3,300 is crucial for Ethereum to sustain its momentum and avoid further downside pressure. As the market remains uncertain, this level serves as a pivotal point for both bulls and bears. For ETH to confirm a new bullish trend, the price must push above local highs near $3,525. Breaking this resistance would signal renewed buying interest and could set the stage for further upward momentum, potentially reversing the recent underperformance compared to other assets. A decisive move above $3,525 would strengthen the bullish narrative and attract additional investor confidence. On the downside, losing the $3,200 support level in the coming days would likely signal weakness and could lead to a prolonged consolidation or even a deeper correction. Such a move might test lower demand zones, delaying Ethereum‚Äôs potential recovery. Related Reading: Solana Compresses Near Previous ATH ‚Äì Gearing Up For The Next Leg Higher?

His comments come at an interesting time when talks around cryptocurrencies are amplifying, particularly after President Donald Trump‚Äôs first crypto-related executive order.

Although Bitcoin has often been the center of attention in strategic reserve talks, Dalton‚Äôs championing of XRP spotlights an interesting choice. Ripple‚Äôs XRP Is More Trustworthy He contends that Bitcoin cannot be the official currency of the United States because because of the anonymity of its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. In his view, Nakamoto‚Äôs hidden identity could lead to potential manipulation, especially if connected to countries like China. On the contrary, he believes XRP is a safe and more reliable option for the United States government, given that Ripple, the blockchain enterprise behind the third-largest cryptocurrency, is U.S.-headquartered. Can XRP Solve The US Debt Crisis? The United States is facing a fiscal crisis of historic proportions. Ballooning deficits and runaway debt service costs are pushing the nation toward uncharted territory. Could an unconventional approach, leveraging Ripple‚Äôs XRP, chart a path forward? Dalton entertained the idea that XRP could play a role in addressing the sovereign debt crisis. ‚ÄúSatoshi Nakamoto cannot pay off the national debt while Ripple can,‚Äù he asserted, adding that XRP investors could emerge as millionaires, billionaires, trillionaires, and quadrillionaires, while Bitcoin holders remain ‚Äústuck‚Äù with MicroStrategy Executive chairman Michael Saylor, whose software intelligence firm has continued aggressively accumulating Bitcoin .
