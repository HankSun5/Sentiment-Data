As Bitcoin and Ethereum soar, CATZILLA gains traction, outpacing DOGE and SHIB in investor interest and growth potential. Table of Contents CATZILLA: A new giant roars in the meme coin arena Dogecoin‚Äôs trend hints at potential growth in altcoin season Shiba Inu Price poised for a bullish surge after recent dip Conclusion In the current crypto surge, attention is shifting toward a newcomer as Bitcoin and Ethereum soar. Major investors show increasing interest in CATZILLA, while veteran favorites like DOGE and SHIB face challenges in keeping pace. The question on many minds is whether this emerging digital asset could become the next big sensation with phenomenal growth potential. CATZILLA: A new giant roars in the meme coin arena As Bitcoin and Ethereum push the crypto market upward, all eyes are on CATZILLA, the new contender poised to disrupt the meme coin space. With DOGE and SHIB facing waning momentum, CATZILLA is stepping into the spotlight, blending viral meme culture with massive growth potential. Its playful yet chaotic theme ‚Äî a Godzilla-sized cat wreaking havoc ‚Äî taps into Japanese kaiju-inspired storytelling, captivating both crypto investors and anime fans alike. CATZILLA is more than just a meme; it‚Äôs a movement. With its bold narrative, unique gameplay, and vibrant community, this new meme coin has the potential to redefine the space, offering a fresh perspective on the intersection of entertainment and financial opportunity.

Its 14-stage presale structure ensures early investors benefit from gradual price increases, with a projected 700% ROI already turning heads. The coin operates on three pillars of value: Epic Gameplay: A gamified experience that keeps players and investors engaged. A Unified Mission: Challenging crypto manipulation with a vision for fairness and decentralization. A Thriving Community: A hub for cat lovers, anime enthusiasts, and crypto degens seeking financial freedom.

Intereted investors wouldn‚Äôt want to miss the opportunity to join the feline frenzy! CATZILLA is gaining momentum, and the next 12,000% superstar could be just around the corner. Dogecoin‚Äôs trend hints at potential growth in altcoin season Dogecoin is showing signs of bouncing back. Recently, the price has been between about 30 and 43 cents. While it has dipped by nearly 8% in the past week, it‚Äôs still up over 165% in the last 6 months. The nearest resistance is just below 50 cents, with more significant resistance above 60 cents. If DOGE manages to break these levels, it could ride the bullish wave. The Moving Averages suggest sideways motion, but relative strength and stochastic indicators suggest more room for upward movement. The market may soon favor altcoins like Dogecoin, sparking new interest and possibly leading to notable gains. Shiba Inu Price poised for a bullish surge after recent dip Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a recent price dip. Its current range is $0.00001827 to $0.00002364. This drop marks a 10.64% decline over the past week and 16.27% over the month. Yet, it shows a 15.58% rise over six months. The price is near support at $0.00001625. If it stays strong, SHIB could break past $0.00002699 resistance. The RSI is under 50, suggesting the market may shift upward. Potential growth could lead to breaking the second resistance at $0.00003236, a rise of about 27% from the current range. Keep an eye on these levels for signs of a bullish trend. Conclusion As DOGE and SHIB show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the leading meme coin aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it combines governance rights, loyalty rewards, and staking benefits.

On Friday, Committee Chair James Comer sent letters to prominent crypto executives, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, seeking information about reported banking restrictions. The inquiry aims to assess whether financial institutions acted independently or were influenced by government pressure to deny services to crypto firms. 1/ Today we, along with some of the most important crypto companies and investors, received a letter from @GOPoversight asking for information on the recent debanking of lawful companies and individuals.

In the last cycle, February kicked off altcoin season. Could it happen again? Two key factors must align: 1) Bitcoin dominance must decline. 2) Bitcoin must hold a stable price above $100,000.

We‚Äôll have to wait a bit longer‚Ä¶ but the clues are starting to appear.‚Äù Source: Negentropic/X Earlier this week, Happel and Alleman said that BTC appears ready to break out based on the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI), which evaluates several aspects of the Bitcoin market, including wallet activity and transaction volume. At the time, they predicted that the crypto king was en route to a $110,000 price tag but would first meet resistance around $106,000.

To read full editions, subscribe . SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce ‚Äî two days after being named leader of a new crypto task force ‚Äî revealed SAB 121 would be no more. Bye, bye SAB 121! It's not been fun: https://t.co/cIwUc0isUE | Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 ‚Äî Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) January 23, 2025 Some context: A Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, represents interpretations and policies followed by SEC divisions in administering federal securities laws-related disclosure requirements . The SEC published SAB 121 in March 2022. It notably said that an entity ‚Äúshould present a liability on its balance sheet to reflect its obligation to safeguard the crypto-assets held for its platform users.‚Äù Why does the crypto industry care so much about the agency rescinding this? Cantor Fitzgerald Howard Lutnick explained the issue pretty well in a video he posted to X in September ‚Äî a couple months before Trump nominated him to lead the Commerce department. There‚Äôs a misunderstanding that TradFi players don‚Äôt want to transact in bitcoin, Lutnick claimed . He added that for banks to custody a client‚Äôs bitcoin, ‚Äúthey would have to set aside their own money equal to that amount in sort of like a jail.‚Äù Indeed, financial organizations told SEC Chair Gary Gensler that the bulletin ‚Äúhas curbed the ability of the associations‚Äô members to develop and bring to market at scale certain digital asset products and services.‚Äù The upshot? As VanEck research execs wrote in a December post detailing 2025 crypto predictions, this repeal ‚Äúwill pave the way for banks and brokers to custody spot crypto, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial infrastructure.‚Äù Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer argued in a Friday note that this SAB 121 rescission ‚Äúrepresents an even more meaningful game-changer for bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem‚Äù than a potential strategic bitcoin reserve does. While SAB 121 was published in 2022, it wasn‚Äôt until last year that Congress sent a bill overturning the guidance to Joe Biden‚Äôs desk. He vetoed it . Ava Labs deputy general counsel Wee Ming Choon told me last month that rescinding SAB 121 would be an act of ‚Äúgood will‚Äù that a new agency administration could take quickly.

This upward momentum follows news of a US executive order establishing a national digital asset stockpile, contributing to a positive market environment. Amid this backdrop, CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC has provided a fresh perspective on Ethereum‚Äôs current trajectory. Shayan highlights an interesting divergence between the increasing open interest in Ethereum futures and the price, which has yet to reach previous highs. Related Reading: Ethereum‚Äôs Price Stalls Below $3,500 as Leverage Ratios Climb‚ÄîWhat Next? Growing Futures Market and Divergent Price Action According to Shayan in a post recently uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, Ethereum‚Äôs open interest‚Äîan indicator of active futures contracts‚Äîhas surged to its highest levels in recent weeks, indicating heightened market participation and growing interest among traders. The analyst notes that the rise in ETH‚Äôs open interest and slow price response suggests a disconnect between market sentiment and price performance. While futures traders appear optimistic, this optimism has not yet translated into Ethereum breaking key resistance levels. The analyst wrote: Interestingly, there is a divergence between Ethereum‚Äôs price and futures market activity. Despite the significant increase in open interest, the price has yet to break its previous highs, showcasing a potential imbalance between market expectations and price action. Shayan also notes that elevated open interest could lead to volatility. Historically, large buildups in open interest have been followed by significant price swings as positions are liquidated. Although the direction of the next move remains uncertain, current activity and sentiment lean toward a potential bullish breakout. Shayan suggested that if Ethereum can surpass critical resistance, it could pave the way for a more prolonged rally. Market Concerns And Bearish Indicators In contrast, another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, presents a more cautious outlook. Darkfost points to a range of bearish factors, including increasing Ethereum inflows and reserves on Binance. According to the data shared by Darkfost, since September 2024, Ethereum inflows have consistently outpaced outflows, leading to a rise in exchange reserves. This trend reflects selling pressure, as more Ethereum is moved to exchanges, potentially indicating an intent to sell rather than hold. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Revival: What the Signs Say About Its Next Move Additionally, Binance‚Äôs taker buy-sell ratio has remained bearish for months, showing a consistent dominance of sell orders. Darkfost reveals that the shift in these metrics suggests that some investors may be locking in profits or reallocating capital elsewhere, leading to a more cautious market sentiment.

Table of Contents Ethereum‚Äôs Pectra upgrade set to launch in March Why does Bitcoin‚Äôs price keep rising? Why Remittix is turning heads Conclusion The market is accustomed to abrupt changes and contradictory patterns, with Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) frequently setting the pace. While Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency‚Äôs gold due to its prominence as an economic vault, Ethereum‚Äôs interesting trends are driven by its programmable blockchain technology. Yet, beyond these giants lies a rising contender shaking up the industry: Remittix (R TX) . Let‚Äôs explore these dynamics and uncover why RTX is the talk of the town. Ethereum‚Äôs Pectra upgrade set to launch in March Ethereum ‚Äôs evolution continues with the much-anticipated Pectra upgrade, set for March 2025. Designed to enhance scalability, user experience, and network health, this upgrade promises to redefine how Ethereum operates. Key features like EIP-7702 introduce account abstraction, enabling batch transactions, one-time gas fees, and sponsored payments. Meanwhile, EIP-2537 revolutionizes zero-knowledge cryptography, boosting privacy and security. Validators, too, stand to benefit from EIP-7002, allowing flexible staking withdrawals and an increased staking balance cap. The Pectra Upgrade demonstrates Ethereum‚Äôs unwavering commitment to innovation, which draws in both developers and investors. A breakthrough might push ETH‚Äôs price above $6,000, even though it is now facing resistance at $4,093. Its long-term survival, however, depends on frequent revisions and market adoption. You might also like: SOL holders back Remittix: The altcoin set to change the future of global transfers Why does Bitcoin‚Äôs price keep rising? With Bitcoin‚Äôs price currently at $104,000, the trajectory of the leading coin is influenced by both long-term investor confidence and data-driven forecasts such as the NVT Golden Cross. This metric, which compares Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap to transaction volume, signals an impending price surge when it hits local bottom zones. Analysts suggest that BTC is gearing up for sustained growth. This confidence is evident on exchanges such as Binance, where rising optimistic sentiment and positive buy-sell ratios are prevalent. Despite not being as programmable as Ethereum, Bitcoin‚Äôs price grows because its strength as a decentralized asset keeps it at the top of the cryptocurrency market. Why Remittix is turning heads In a market dominated by giants, Remittix emerges as a game-changing player redefining cross-border payments. Positioned as a bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional fiat systems, RTX leverages blockchain to solve age-old inefficiencies in global transactions. Picture what it would be like to send $1000 to a family member abroad using Solana, and they receive the exact amount in their bank account with no hidden fees, no inflated exchange rates, and no crypto expertise required. That‚Äôs the simplicity and power of Remittix. Beyond its seamless user experience, RTX is disrupting a $190 trillion industry with its transparent fee model and extensive network support for 30+ fiat currencies and over 40 cryptocurrencies. Freelancers, businesses, and individuals alike benefit from its Remittix Pay API, which allows crypto payments with fiat settlements, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. With its current presale price of $0.0297, RTX presents an investment opportunity that is too good to pass up. Early adopters stand to gain significantly, with projections indicating increases of up to 5,000% following launch. Supported by a thorough smart contract examination and a dedication to transparency, the presale has already generated $5.6 million. Remittix is well-positioned to take the lead in the PayFi industry as the need for creative payment solutions increases. Conclusion While Ethereum and Bitcoin carve out their respective paths, the crypto world‚Äôs gaze is increasingly turning to Remittix. With its unique combination of blockchain technology and fiat systems, RTX is a unique way to solve practical financial problems. Remittix‚Äôs promise of faster, cheaper, and more transparent payments puts it in a position to change the game as Ethereum gets ready for its next update and Bitcoin maintains its leadership. With its presale gaining momentum, RTX is more than just a token; it‚Äôs a movement redefining global commerce.

Larsen join in this request,‚Äù Ripple Labs legal team member Michael Kellogg wrote. The SEC recently filed its brief, arguing against the ruling that retail sales of XRP ( XRP ) were not securities. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of the New York District Court ruled that XRP was not a security, marking a notable victory for Ripple and the broader crypto industry. However, the court determined that Ripple violated securities laws in its institutional sales of the XRP token. Read more: Ripple leadership blasts SEC after filing appeal Ripple and the SEC have remained locked in a legal battle since the U.S. securities watchdog filed a lawsuit against the company and its executives in December 2020. Despite this being standard procedure in the U.S. court system, market observers are speculating whether the new SEC leadership might withdraw its appeal before Ripple files its cross-appeal brief. On Jan. 21, acting SEC chair Mark Uyeda announced a crypto task force to look into the agency‚Äôs approach to regulation of the sector amid plans to develop a clear framework. SEC has also been said to be looking at withdrawing certain crypto lawsuits. Two days later, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a crypto executive order establishing a working group to address crypto regulation and legislative proposals. The executive order also referenced a potential digital assets stockpile.

To read full editions, subscribe . Crypto‚Äôs new viral app isn‚Äôt very new at all. Solana-based social project Clout saw its downloads take off after launching an iPhone app that lets users buy tokenized versions of social media profiles. This is very similar to the premise behind the viral 2023 app friend.tech, which was itself a rehashing of BitClout, a Crypto Twitter tokenization app that went viral in 2021. Friend.tech‚Äôs founding team already stepped away from the platform, while BitClout‚Äôs founder was just charged with fraud by the DOJ and the SEC. Clout hasn‚Äôt leaned away from its forefathers. The project posted a meme today riffing on Justin Timberlake‚Äôs famous line as Sean Parker in The Social Network: ‚ÄúDrop the ‚ÄòBit.‚Äô Just ‚ÄòClout.‚Äô It‚Äôs cleaner.‚Äù ‚ÄúIntegrity and healthy tokenomics!‚Äù was Clout founder Ben Pasternak‚Äôs reply when I asked him what sets his app apart. At the time of writing, Clout was #34 on the App Store‚Äôs finance chart. The app is so congested that I haven‚Äôt been able to land a transaction all day. And Clout isn‚Äôt the only so-called SocialFi app grabbing Solana users‚Äô attention. Tribe.run ‚Äî which is still in invite-only mode ‚Äî has also seen some momentum for a tokenized X profile app that creates token-gated group chats called tribes. I managed to snag an invite and have been enjoying the app, which features a nostalgic Windows 98-esque design. Tribe comes with an airdrop feature built in where I was able to send some of my token to my group chat members. This feature is enabled by Solana zero-knowledge compression . When I asked Tribe founder Bill Zheng why he thinks his app can succeed where friend.tech, for instance, failed, he said the former app had a ‚Äúfundamental flaw‚Äù in that creators had no incentive to stay engaged. Tribe employs a subscription model where tribe members must pay a certain amount of SOL to stay in the group chat ‚Äî giving the tribe creators a reason to stick around. Outside of Solana, Kaito AI has seen success with its Yaps platform that doles out points for users who are active ‚Äî or who yap a lot, in internet parlance ‚Äî on Crypto Twitter. SocialFi‚Äôs resilience underscores the resilience of Elon Musk‚Äôs social media platform. X remains the center of the online crypto world, and until that changes, crypto social apps will keep testing out new ways to monetize Crypto Twitter.

Notably, its trading venue, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, filed for the in-kind redemption model with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The BlackRock iShares Trust In-Kind Redemption The proposed rule change from Nasdaq anchors on the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As demanded, it seeks to allow specifically qualified or authorized participants to transfer the trust‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings. If approved, this rule change will allow authorized participants to redeem their proceeds in BTC instead of cash. The in-kind model is ideal for most exchange-traded fund products. However, in the runup to the approval last year, the issuers compromised as the Gary Gensler-led SEC preferred the cash creates model. Detailing what this means for the market, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst James Seyffart noted that it won‚Äôt mean much for retail traders. He said with in-kind redemption, the entire Bitcoin ETF market will trade more efficiently. Wow. Way too many questions and this stuff goes pretty deep in the weeds. So i‚Äôll keep it high level and answer ‚ÄúWhat does this mean?‚Äù Not all that much for individual retail investors. Mostly what it means is that ETFs should trade even more efficiently than they already do‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/LWYsKmo5sH ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 This filing comes after BlackRock recently launched the BTC ETF variant on CBOE Canada. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Outperforming The asset manager is the biggest Bitcoin ETF issuer in the world, with the IBIT holdings topping $60 billion. IBIT crossed the $50 billion milestone for the first time in December 2024, an impressive feat attained after just one year. BlackRock has continued to stun the market; per current data, it has recorded three consecutive days of inflows. Farside Investors data pegs this at $661.9 million on January 21, $344.3 million, and $154.6 million on January 22 and 23, respectively. The positive trading milestone of IBIT also extended into January 24. Per market data, it recorded over $2 billion in trading volumes in the first few hours. Setting the Pace for Competitors Market experts noted that with BlackRock pushing for in-kind redemption, other crypto ETF issuers may follow soon. BlackRock is, however, to file similar in-kind redemption for its Ethereum ETF product. While it is setting a pace in key ETF offerings, it has subtly distanced itself from the alternative crypto ETF filings as it is becoming a trend. Coingape reported multiple ETF filings earlier as asset managers woke up to the pro-crypto US SEC. One of the recent high-profile filings is the Grayscale Bitcoin Adapters ETF . This offering was designed to track the performance of publicly traded firms with a Bitcoin exposure.

This makes them the second and third fund managers to do so after Canary Capital. Grayscale And Coinshares File For Litecoin ETF In an X post , the President of the ETF Store, Nate Geraci, revealed that Grayscale and Coinshares have filed with the US SEC to offer a Litecoin ETF. In Grayscale‚Äôs case, the asset manager filed a 19b-4 form to list and trade its Grayscale Litecoin Trust as an ETF. Meanwhile, Coinshares filed an S-1 form with the Commission to offer an LTC ETF. These are the second and third applications for such ETF following Canary Capital‚Äôs filing last year. This continues the flurry of crypto-related ETFs that have flooded in ever since US President Donald Trump took office and designated Mark Uyeda as the acting US SEC Chair . There is optimism that the new SEC administration would be more open to approving these funds, unlike the previous administration under Gary Gensler. Moreover, Trump has already vowed to make the US the crypto capital . It is worth mentioning that Grayscale has also filed for a Bitcoin Adapters ETF and a Solana ETF. The asset manager refiled to convert its Solana Trust into an ETF. Meanwhile, besides a Litecoin ETF, Coinshares has also filed with the US SEC to offer an XRP ETF. Coinshares becomes the sixth asset manager to file for an XRP ETF after REX Shares filed for one earlier this week. LTC Price Surges The LTC Price surged to as high as $122 on the back of these Litecoin ETF filings. These filings undoubtedly provide a bullish outlook for the crypto, considering that it could drive significant inflow into its ecosystem. Moreover, this development is timely as it comes at a time when the LTC price outlook was looking bearish due to Whales offloading their tokens and a drop in the network‚Äôs hash rate. Interstingly, the Litecoin ETF looks to be the next crypto that the SEC will approve based on predictions by market experts. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had previously noted that Canary Capital filing an amended S-1 form indicates that the SEC was already engaging with them on the application. Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas had also previously explained that Litecoin could get the nod ahead of XRP and Solana because of its non-security status.

It is considered to be more efficient as it allows APs closely monitor the demand for the ETF and to act fast by buying or selling shares of the fund without cash being involved in the process. Retail investors are not eligible to participate. When the SEC first approved spot bitcoin ETFs including IBIT last January, the agency allowed to launch the funds with cash redemption, instead of bitcoin.

However, the token is now testing a key resistance level at $2.10, a level historically associated with selling pressure and price declines. $7.18 Million LDO Inflows into Exchanges As LDO‚Äôs price surged, on-chain data from CoinGlass revealed an inflow of $7.18 million worth of LDO tokens into exchanges, hinting that long-term holders or whales may be preparing to sell. Source: Coinglass The inflows into the exchanges suggest that long-term holders or whales have moved their holdings to the exchanges for a potential sell-off. However, this could lead to selling pressure and further price decline. Looking at such a dump in the past 24 hours indicates that history may repeat itself. Lido DAO (LDO) Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, LDO appears bullish but is currently at a crucial resistance level of $2.10. LDO‚Äôs daily chart shows that its price has reached this level more than twice, and each time, it has witnessed a price drop of over 28%, from $2.08 to $1.47. Source: Trading View However, this time, due to past history, investors have begun dumping their holdings and speculating that LDO could once again drop by 28% to reach the $1.47 level. Conversely, if the current sentiment for LDO continues and the price breaches the resistance level, closing a daily candle above $2.10, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 65% to reach the $3.50 level. However, in the cryptocurrency market, such a rally is easily achievable. LDO is currently trading near $2 and has experienced a price surge of over 15.50% in the past 24 hours.

Your teacher told you to write it as if to an alien, a being who had never encountered a cookie before, which meant touching on each sense ‚Äì sight, sound, smell, touch, taste. You might not have realized it then, but describing something in a way that allows people to get a clear picture is actually quite hard. Let me try to describe Matheus Pagani, founder and CEO of Venture Miner. Matheus is a male with light caramel skin and dark brown hair. Even though his hair is cut close, you can tell it‚Äôs curly. He‚Äôs got a thick dark brown, almost black beard, which connects to a mustache. His eyes are dark brown behind thin wire glasses. His bottom lip sticks out a little further from his top lip, giving him a look of assurance, but not arrogance. Picturing him yet? How confident are you? Oh yeah, and he‚Äôs Brazilian. Got it? Let‚Äôs see what Matheus Pagani actually looks like. Is this what you had come up with in your head from my description? Doubt it. Whenever I told you he was Brazilian, did you accessorize him in bright colors and a feathered headdress? Something like this? If so, check your bias, but also you‚Äôre thinking like an AI. That was what ChatGPT came up with from the prompt ‚Äúsome Brazilians having fun.‚Äù Pagani showed this and other examples spit out by our generative AI (Italians have fun by sitting around long tables with multiple generations eating pizza) during the AI2Web3 Bootcamp in NYC in early December. The bootcamp, run by Pagani and Build City, brought together 59 participants across all skill levels to learn how the two buzziest (and often misunderstood) technologies can be brought together to create useful products and services. Pagani used a version of the middle-school assignment to explain how and why AI made the significant leaps that have kept us all excited and on edge over the past few years. Before there was largely only text data being used to train AIs, and as the exercise highlights, that only goes so far. But mix text information with visual data, and you get a fuller picture. And understanding this, getting hands on with both AI and blockchain technology to understand its core components is what the bootcamp was all about. For Pagani, these skills are going to be relevant for nearly all people ‚Äì engineers, tech users, journalists, artists, doctors ‚Äì real soon. ‚ÄúWe want to join brilliant minds from all backgrounds to come and work with AI and Web3, since the junction of their multiple perspectives can uncover new use cases that we would never envision just with a specialized Web3 or AI mindset alone,‚Äù Pagani said. ‚ÄúNowadays we have tools to easily enable any non-technical enthusiasts to build practically functional applications and systems just with ""plain English,"" so what matters is bringing passionate people interested in solving problems together with the proper education. When you have this combination, you just need to light the match and watch it burn.‚Äù Mind-Boggling Building What makes the intersection of these two technologies so exciting is just how much you can build in such a short amount of time without really any prior technical experience. Not only will AI source whole codebases with the right prompt, but the crypto industry is also building tools to help make developing at the intersection of both more intuitive and accessible. For instance, Coinbase, who sponsored the bootcamp, launched AgentKit in November. The framework allows developers to build AI agents with their own crypto wallets , enabling the agents to interact autonomously with blockchain networks. This could be used to build a squad of agents that can monitor the markets and execute trades automatically based on predefined rules and guardrails. ‚ÄúOne day, we‚Äôll have AI agents own their own cars and operate their own taxi service that gets paid by customers in crypto and then uses that crypto to purchase repairs,‚Äù Lincoln Murr, associate product manager at Coinbase, told the attendees. Coinbase currently has a grants program ongoing for building with AgentKit. ‚ÄúWhat you build doesn‚Äôt have to be useful; we have a bias towards cool stuff,‚Äù Murr told the bootcamp, hoping to inspire projects and applications that no one has yet thought of. Ora Network also has an interesting model for developers looking to build AI-enabled Web3 applications or vice versa. The network allows developers to utilize current large language models, including Meta‚Äôs Llama3 and Stable Diffusion, but it also enables developers to build their own models and offer a so-called initial model offering (IMO) to crowdfund its continued development. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of winner-takes-all right now in AI, but with this model, we‚Äôre allowing the crowdfunding of AI building and training, so people can have a share of the models, which is empowering if we think these models will run society in a decade,‚Äù Alec James, partnerships and growth lead at Ora, said during the bootcamp. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the case, we‚Äôll want that development distributed.‚Äù Near, Fleek and Alora were also among the companies that sponsored the bootcamp and presented their various tools and programs for building at the intersection of these two innovative technologies. Can Devs Do Something? During the final day of the bootcamp, nine teams presented working prototypes for projects that blended Web3 and AI. These projects ranged from AI assistants meant to help you pick gifts, order delivery or diversify your financial portfolio to applications to help crypto operators pump out memecoins with big virality potential. Jackie Joya, a participant who had flown in from San Francisco, said the bootcamp has really inspired her to keep building. With a background in animal science, Joya is still new to engineering, but was amazed how much a novice could build with the tools available. Other participants, across all skill levels, said similar things. Choudhury Imtiaz, a market researcher from Bangladesh, who is in the U.S. on an H-1B1 Visa waiting for a placement, hasn‚Äôt heard of Web3 before the bootcamp, but was able to pitch a team project on the last day. And Isayah Culbertson, who has worked as an engineer for both crypto and AI projects separately, was able to learn skills for building with both, which he thinks has the potential to change the world for the better. ‚ÄúI see the combination accelerating the research and development of so many different fields, while also allowing for a more equitable distribution of wealth generated from that R&D,‚Äù he said.",Opinion,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SPONSORED|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 21:55:52

Table of Contents Chainlink SUI BeerBear Conclusion The crypto world is buzzing with speculation and profit-hunting, but not all coins are equal when it comes to massive gains. Altcoin titans like SUI and LINK may have solid reputations, but they‚Äôre losing steam. Meanwhile, a hidden gem called BeerBear is capturing the attention of speculators with its growth potential. Chainlink Chainlink has long been a favorite among altcoin fans, but its glory days appear to be fading. The Chainlink chart reveals a history of volatility in recent years. Despite occasional recoveries, the asset has failed to maintain higher levels, indicating weak long-term momentum. LINK‚Äôs recent growth appears more like short-term speculation rather than a foundation for future gains. The chart lacks clear signals of stability or the potential for significant growth. It‚Äôs hard to get excited about a coin that keeps teasing gains but fails to deliver. The LINK army is starting to dwindle, and the market sentiment is shifting toward other opportunities. SUI SUI entered the market with promise but its hype is wearing thin. The price has stagnated, and many experts are finding it hard to argue for any substantial upward movement. With trading volume declining and whales exiting the scene, SUI looks more like a fading star than a new powerhouse.

According to its registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the new product will trade on NYSE Arca. It sets a new path for Grayscale as one of the key promoters of alternative crypto ETF products. Grayscale Bitcoin Adapters ETF: a Strategic Move The Grayscale Bitcoin Adapters ETF is new and will seek to track the shares of publicly listed companies with a Bitcoin treasury strategy. If approved, the ETF filing will hold these companies‚Äô shares in weighted proportion. The ETF will represent an indirect exposure to Bitcoin via these companies‚Äô shares. According to the filing, the fund will hold at least 80% of its constituent shares. It confirmed that it may also invest in alternative securities that provide similar exposure to the underlying constituents. The Grayscale Bitcoin Adapters ETF will largely invest in US and non-US companies with a BTC exposure. The filing noted that the company must trade on a developed stock market to be eligible. It also placed a $100 million market capitalization benchmark for the firm, with a six-month average daily turnover of at least $1 million. Here‚Äôs the strategy details. Will be an equity ETF that holds the stock of companies that hold Bitcoin as a part of their corporate treasury. pic.twitter.com/KVgUw5BViP ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 Grayscale confirmed that all securities to be included must have a free float. This must include at least 10% of their outstanding shares. This ETF from Grayscale Investments is one of the few it has filed today. As reported by Coingape, Grayscale has also filed to list a Litecoin ETF with the US SEC. The asset manager is one of the key pioneers in the digital currency ecosystem. Favorite Firms to Make the Grayscale ETF List The most popular publicly traded firm with a Bitcoin exposure is business intelligence and software firm MicroStrategy. This firm acquired 11,000 BTC recently, now holding over 2% of the total Bitcoin supply, and generally borrows capital to fund its purchases. Earlier, MicroStrategy announced a $1.05 billion BTC redemption for its convertible notes due in 2027. This underscores its active Bitcoin strategy, which complements the conditions Grayscale set for the Adapter ETF. Other firms eligible for inclusion in the ETF include Riot platforms, Mara Holdings, Metaplanet, and KULR Technologies. Over the past few months, these firms have intensified their BTC acquisition strategies with the benefit of the share price. All Eyes on the US SEC The US SEC has received a lot of applications for ETF-related rule changes in the past few weeks. BlackRock filed for in-kind redemptions for IBIT ‚Äì the iShares Bitcoin Trust, a move many believe was long due. Beyond Bitcoin-linked ETF products, other cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana, have also bagged similar filings. The projection hinges on the positive shift at the US SEC under the Donald Trump administration. With all eyes on Mark Uyeda and potentially Paul Atkins, it remains to be seen how the markets regulator will attend to these filings.

39402839,https://coingape.com/?p=235349,1737756275,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Breaking: CoinShares Files For XRP ETF With US SEC,https://coingape.com/coinshares-files-for-xrp-etf-with-us-sec/,"CoinShares has submitted a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). The move is part of a surge in cryptocurrency ETF filings as financial firms seek to expand options for digital asset investments in the U.S. market. CoinShares Seeks Approval for XRP ETF CoinShares has submitted a registration statement on form S-1 to launch a physical XRP exchange-traded fund. This comes under the backdrop of more financial firms seeking Cryptocurrency ETFs after the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the earlier part of last year. Apart from CoinShares‚Äô XRP ETF filing, several other applications for cryptocurrency ETFs were submitted on January 25. CoinShares also submitted an S-1 for a spot Litecoin ETF, indicating that there is growing interest in altcoins ETFs. At the same time, Grayscale filed a 19b-4 application to have its Solana Trust (GSOL) and Litecoin Trust turned into ETFs. Grayscale Investments also submitted a 19b-4 application to convert its Solana Trust and Litecoin Trust into spot ETFs. Similarly, BlackRock, an asset management company, has also submitted an application for in-kind creation and redemption of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Regulatory Landscape Shifts Under New SEC Leadership The filings occur at a time when there could be shifting regulatory environment under the new administration. Prior to this, the former SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, resigned and Trump nominated Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto chair, for the position. Market participants are hopeful that Atkins‚Äôs pro-crypto stance could lead to more ETF approvals in the market. The SEC, under acting chair Mark Uyeda, has also established a new cryptocurrency task force headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce to help develop better guidelines for the industry. The task force is to consider the registration issues, improve the disclosure requirements and employ the enforcement tools more effectively. This change in the regulatory landscape might be beneficial for cryptocurrency ETFs, including those that are linked to XRP and other altcoins. Will Ripple Vs SEC Case Influence XRP ETF Filings? Despite the XRP ETF filing, Ripple Labs, the company associated with XRP, is still embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC. The lawsuit centers on whether XRP should be classified as a security, a decision that could affect the cryptocurrency‚Äôs regulatory status and its prospects for ETFs. Ripple recently requested an April 16, deadline for its appeal and cross-appeal briefs in the case. Lawyers following the matter speculate that the new SEC leadership may opt for a resolution rather than prolonging litigation. Pro-XRP legal expert Bill Morgan opined that the SEC could try to negotiate a settlement or even dismiss the appeal particularly under the leadership of Atkins. Such a resolution could remove all legal ambiguities for XRP and also increase the chances of approval of the ETF. While this XRP ETF filing is ongoing, the XRP price has appreciated by 1.5% at the time of writing, trading at $3.12. Concurrent with XRP ETF approval speculation, analysts have predicted the XRP price would rally after a crucial bullish breakout toward the $10 high.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A veteran crypto investor has identified Rexas Finance (RXS) as the next Ripple (XRP). Table of Contents A familiar story of disruption Presale success sets the stage Real-world utility Comparisons to Ripple A veteran‚Äôs insight The way forward The cryptocurrency market is well-known for its surprises; chances arise from unanticipated directions. Although popular names like Bitcoin and Ethereum rule headlines, experienced investors constantly search elsewhere for the next great investment. Inspired by early breakout analogies to Ripple (XRP), a seasoned crypto investor recently named Rexas Finance (RXS) as the next major contender. As a concept that could change the market, Rexas Finance has been progressively attracting attention and causing ripples in the crypto world. A familiar story of disruption The early years of Ripple were defined by its aim to transform global payments. As institutions started using XRP‚Äôs technology, the coin‚Äôs value shot up, paying early investors handsomely. In 2025, Rexas Finance aims to upend another important component of the financial system: the tokenization of actual assets. Rexas Finance seeks to bring real estate, commodities, and other physical assets onto the blockchain. By streamlining ownership, trade, and fractional investment, this invention aims to open a fresh field of opportunities for both people and businesses. Presale success sets the stage In its eleventh presale round, Rexas Finance has produced amazing outcomes so far. The presale has drawn interest from investors, with over $37.8 million raised and 407.2 million tokens sold. Priced at $0.175, RXS offers a low starting point for investors wishing to get early on a project with great future development capacity. This degree of presale success reflects the excitement of the early Ripple days when visionary investors realized blockchain technology had the power to transform industries. The difference now is that Rexas Finance is using years of industry evolution to build a stronger and complete ecosystem from the beginning.

The platform‚Äôs tokenization system will facilitate transactions faster and more effectively, allowing investors to convert assets into blockchain-based tokens. Having a fraction of a high-value asset, such as a luxury house, will become as easy as purchasing a stock. This invention opens the path for more general acceptance and major development possibilities by bridging the gap between conventional finance and blockchain. Certik has already audited Rexas Finance, increasing investor trust in its openness and security. Moreover, its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have given more exposure, enabling RXS to reach a larger spectrum of investors. Comparisons to Ripple Making a comparison to Ripple is about vision rather than only commercial potential. While Rexas Finance aims to transform asset ownership, Ripple aims to solve inefficiencies in world banking. Both initiatives use blockchain technology to develop answers and point out important flaws in current systems. Ripple became well-known because of its potential to attract institutional interest. Likewise, Rexas Finance presents a modern solution that fits the direction of finance, drawing in individual and institutional investors. The presale is entering its later phases, and RXS is ready to hit the market hard. According to analysts, its unique value proposition could drive its valuation tremendously, paying early investors in ways evocative of XRP‚Äôs climb. You might also like: 3 altcoins below $10 with potential to turn $600 into $10,000 A veteran‚Äôs insight The experienced investor who selected Rexas Finance lists some factors explaining his optimistic view. Firstly, the time is perfect. Projects with clear use cases should trump speculative tokens as the crypto market prepares for a 2025 bull run. Second, RXS‚Äôs emphasis on tokenizing actual assets fits general market trends. Blockchain-based solutions that smoothly interact with current financial systems have increasingly piqued the curiosity of institutional investors. Finally, presale pricing offers a chance to lock in a share of a high-potential initiative before it goes public. Given the hope of a notable surge, early adopters could find gains that match those of early XRP investors. The way forward The market for cryptocurrencies is ready for a surge in 2025. Once leading the charge, Ripple proved blockchain technology could transform sectors. Rexas Finance is poised to carry that fire into fresh ground. With its emphasis on asset tokenization, successful presale, and expanding network of supporters, RXS is more than a token; it‚Äôs a movement. Investors who lost out on Ripple‚Äôs early days now have a second chance on a project that could change the crypto environment. As the seasoned investor said, ‚ÄúRexas Finance is the future ‚Äî more than the next big thing.‚Äù For more information on Rexas Finance, visit their website , whitepaper , X , or Telegram .

The blockchain‚Äôs co-founder Vitalik Buterin noted that Layer 2s in 2025 represents a significant evolution from their experimental beginnings in 2019, having achieved certain decentralization milestones, secured billions of dollars in value, and scaled Ethereum‚Äôs transaction capacity by 17-fold, all while simultaneously lowering fees. However, Buterin stated that challenges remain, particularly around scaling and heterogeneity. Blob Space and Interoperability Challenges In his latest blog post , Buterin pointed out that Ethereum‚Äôs current blob space ‚Äì a resource for storing and processing data on the blockchain ‚Äì barely meets the demands of today‚Äôs Layer 2s and their use cases. As such, this limitation could hinder the platform‚Äôs ability to accommodate future growth. Additionally, the heterogeneity of Layer 2s creates challenges when it comes to interoperability, composability, and user experience. While Ethereum‚Äôs initial vision for scaling involved a shard-based system of homogenous blockchains, Buterin noted that Layer 2s have instead evolved into a fragmented ecosystem of chains created by different actors, each with different standards and infrastructure requirements. To address these challenges, the Ethereum co-founder outlined several key steps. On the Layer 1 side, Ethereum must accelerate scaling blobs and expand the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and gas limits to handle activities such as proofs, large-scale DeFi, deposits, withdrawals, and mass exit scenarios. On the Layer 2 front, he stressed the need for improved security, ensuring guarantees such as censorship resistance, light client verifiability, and the absence of trusted parties. Interoperability across Layer 2s and wallets must also be prioritized to enable easy interactions across chains through standardized addresses, message-passing protocols, bridges, and efficient cross-chain payments. For users, Ethereum should feel like a unified ecosystem rather than a collection of disparate chains, Buterin added. Strengthening ETH as a Triple-Point Asset Buterin also stated that Ethereum‚Äôs future as a strong triple-point asset ‚Äì functioning as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account ‚Äì requires a ‚Äúmulti-pronged‚Äù strategy to maximize the value of ETH . The first step is to cement ETH as the primary asset across the combined Layer 1 and Layer 2 Ethereum economy. This includes prioritizing ETH, the main collateral for decentralized applications and financial ecosystems. Next comes incentivizing Layer 2s to allocate a portion of their fees toward the broader Ethereum ecosystem, which could generate sustainable funding. This may involve burning part of the fees, staking them, or channeling proceeds into public goods for the Ethereum network. Third, while rollups offer opportunities for Layer 1 to capture value through MEV, it‚Äôs important to maintain flexibility, recognizing that not all rollups can adopt this model due to different application requirements. Finally, Ethereum could explore raising the blob count as a potential revenue stream.

Despite the market‚Äôs inherent volatility, price action remains robust, fueling optimism among investors and analysts.

Market sentiment is growing increasingly positive, with analysts predicting a massive move into price discovery. Among them, crypto expert Carl Runefelt has shared an intriguing technical analysis on X, highlighting a bullish setup for XRP. According to Runefelt, the price is forming a bullish pennant pattern on the 4-hour timeframe, a classic indicator of potential upward continuation. This pattern suggests that XRP is consolidating before a significant breakout, which could propel the price into uncharted territory. As excitement builds, investors are watching closely to see whether XRP can sustain its momentum and capitalize on the bullish market environment. A breakout from the bullish pennant could confirm XRP‚Äôs trajectory toward new milestones, reinforcing its position as one of the market‚Äôs most dynamic assets. XRP About To Enter Price Discovery XRP is on the verge of entering price discovery as the broader crypto market signals a bullish rally. Following a strong pump in early November, XRP‚Äôs price action has remained resilient, fueling optimism for substantial gains in the months ahead. As the market flirts with a decisive phase, XRP continues to stand out as a top contender for life-changing returns for investors and traders. Renowned crypto analyst Carl Runefelt has shared an insightful technical analysis on X, highlighting a bullish setup for XRP. According to Runefelt, the price is forming a bullish pennant pattern on the 4-hour timeframe, a classic indicator of potential upward continuation. Based on this setup, Runefelt has set a price target of $4.20 in the coming weeks, aligning with broader expectations of a market-wide rally. The bullish pennant suggests that XRP is consolidating before its next major move. If the pattern holds, the breakout could propel XRP into uncharted territory, confirming its position as a leading asset in this market cycle.

With its strong price action and favorable technical setup, XRP has the potential to deliver significant returns. Investors and traders are closely watching as XRP prepares for its next move, with anticipation building for what could be a pivotal rally. Price Testing Critical Levels XRP is currently trading at $3.19, following a massive surge above its previous all-time high last week. The recent price action highlights XRP‚Äôs strength as it continues to attract investor interest during this bullish phase. However, the asset has entered a brief consolidation phase, which could signal preparation for its next move. For bulls to maintain momentum and sustain the uptrend, reclaiming the $3.25 resistance level is critical. Breaking above this mark would likely reignite buying pressure and pave the way for another push toward new all-time highs. Achieving this would reinforce the bullish structure and solidify XRP‚Äôs position as one of the market‚Äôs top-performing assets. Conversely, holding above the $3.05 support level is equally important to confirm the ongoing trend. This level has become a key line of defense, and a breakdown below it could signal weakness, potentially leading to a deeper correction and testing lower demand zones.

Significantly, CoinShares submitted applications for a spot XRP ETF and a Litecoin (LTC) fund, indicating an increasing enthusiasm for altcoin investment offerings. CoinShares Targets Litecoin And XRP ETF CoinShares‚Äô submission arises as the US ETF market is progressively concentrating on cryptocurrency investments, after the approval and resulting success of funds investing in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in 2024. The firm has submitted an S-1 registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the XRP ETF, aimed at providing investors with direct exposure to the market‚Äôs second largest altcoin.

Skepticism Surrounds Proposed Litecoin ETF Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the XRP ETF filing, the altcoin has shown a mixed response in the market. XRP recently emerged from a nearly three-year consolidation period below the $0.50 mark, boosted by excitement surrounding pro-crypto regulatory shifts under President Donald Trump. Currently, XRP is experiencing remarkable momentum, boasting a staggering 500% year-to-date gain, trading at approximately $3.10.

According to the Cornerstone report titled ‚ÄúSEC Cryptocurrency Enforcement‚Äù, the last year of Gensler‚Äôs tenure witnessed a significant drop in crypto enforcement. ‚ÄúAfter reaching the highest number of cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions in 2023, the SEC brought a total of 33 actions in 2024, a 30% decrease from the year prior. Half of the actions were brought in September and October‚Ä¶ In 2024, the SEC brought 33 cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions against 90 defendants or respondents. Of these actions, 25 were litigations and eight were administrative proceedings. The most frequent allegations continued to be fraud and unregistered securities offerings. Of the 33 enforcement actions brought in 2024, 73% alleged fraud, 58% alleged an unregistered securities offering violation, and 39% alleged both.‚Äù According to Cornerstone, 50% of all enforcement actions came in the final quarter of 2024. However, despite the fall in enforcement actions, fees for penalties imposed by the SEC against crypto firms reached new record heights. ‚ÄúMonetary penalties imposed in 2024 against digital-asset market participants reached a record high of $4.98 billion, almost entirely because of one multibillion-dollar settlement‚Ä¶ During 2024, the SEC obtained a total monetary settlement of $4.55 billion in SEC v. Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. et al., of which $4.05 billion consisted of disgorgement and prejudgment interest. This was the largest monetary penalty ever imposed in a cryptocurrency-related enforcement action.‚Äù Three days ago, President Trump named Mark T. Uyeda as Acting Chairman of the SEC.

Table of Contents Solana continues rally amid increased demand Remittix attracts massive capital inflows Solana (SOL) is regaining strength after its blockchain experienced record-high DEX volumes on January 19. Although SOL is yet to hit the $300 price level, analysts are optimistic that the rally will continue for the next few weeks. Meanwhile, another DeFi altcoin is dominating the headlines; the new Remittix PayFi protocol. By looking to simplify cross-border payments and remittances, Remittix is attracting thousands of new investors during its presale. Solana continues rally amid increased demand Solana reached a new all-time high price of over $290 on January 20 after the release of Donald Trump‚Äôs TRUMP token on its blockchain. After this rally, Solana‚Äôs price saw a minor correction though investors remain bullish. The SOL/USDT monthly chart also confirms the bullish theories as Solana recently broke out of a cup and handle pattern. Solana‚Äôs social dominance has also peaked in the last seven days. With more conversations around Solana, analysts expect SOL‚Äôs price to increase because of high demand. Solana‚Äôs decentralized exchange volume also surpassed $27 billion on January 19, which was more than BNB Chain and Ethereum combined. If the bullish trend continues, it could positively impact Solana‚Äôs price. Solana currently trades for $256.43 after a 24-hour increase of 16.82%. Since Solana‚Äôs Momentum Indicator reflects bullish dominance on the daily chart, Solana‚Äôs price could test the critical $300 resistance soon.

In the early stages of its presale, Remittix has accumulated over $5.4 million, with a massive adoption rate. Remittix‚Äôs appeal lies in its aim for seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion within 24 hours and the removal of hidden fees. Using the platform individuals will be able to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat and deposit funds in local bank accounts without third-party intermediaries. User security is the top priority on Remittix as the platform will use a fully audited smart contract to process every transaction. With no central authority, Remittix ensures that each transaction is peer-to-peer and has no banking restrictions. Remittix is also committed to transparency because the platform uses blockchain technology to provide a public ledger for all transactions made on the platform. All payment records are 100% immutable, enhancing user trust in Remittix‚Äôs new PayFi ecosystem. You might also like: Ripple bounces back as Remittix gains traction Remittix will further support cross-border e-commerce transactions through its Pay API. Merchants will be able to use Remittix to receive payments in cryptocurrency from customers and cash out in 30+ fiat currencies or 50 different cryptocurrency pairs. The user-friendly Checkout feature will give customers the same level of security as traditional payment methods, putting Remittix at the forefront of DeFi. The Remittix PayFi ecosystem is powered by a native RTX token, which will offer utility and governance rights to long-term investors. VIP-tier holders will enjoy staking rewards with up to 18% APYs as well as premium voting privileges that convert them from investors to significant stakeholders in the Remittix ecosystem. Given Remittix‚Äôs user-first approach and low-cost payment solution, analysts expect this new PayFi protocol to outshine Solana‚Äôs blockchain. As Remittix bridges the gap between traditional and digital currencies, the RTX token is expected to record several demand-induced price jumps. Currently, RTX tokens are selling for $0.0297, giving traders a lower entry point before the price increases in the next presale phase.

Such a significant investment hints at the possibility of even greater gains, with experts suggesting another 50% rise could be next. XYZ: First all-sports meme token XYZVerse is rewriting the playbook for meme coins by fusing the global passion for sports with the viral appeal of crypto. Positioned as the ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù of sports-driven meme tokens, XYZVerse aims to unite sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, offering a unique way to engage with football, basketball, MMA, esports, and beyond ‚Äî all within its thriving ecosystem. The momentum behind meme coins is undeniable, with the market surging by 500% in 2024. XYZ is aiming to become the G.O.A.T. of this trend, projecting a 4,900% increase by the end of its presale. Starting at $0.0001, early investors enjoy a 99% discount on the target price of $0.1 in the 15th and final presale stage.

In the last month, the coin‚Äôs value rose by 8.33%, indicating a positive trend. However, the past week showed a decline of 12.74%, suggesting some short-term volatility in the market. Currently trading between $0.34 and $0.43, Dogecoin faces the nearest resistance level at $0.49 with support at $0.24. The 10-day simple moving average is at $0.35, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.37, pointing to a recent dip in momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 38.01, which is approaching the oversold territory, while the Stochastic indicator at 14.42 confirms this potential overselling. The MACD level of -0.0036 suggests bearish momentum may continue in the short term. Based on these indicators, Dogecoin might experience further fluctuations. If the price breaks above the $0.49 resistance, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.62, offering a potential increase of over 40%. Conversely, if it falls below the $0.24 support level, it might test the second support at $0.1163. Traders should monitor these key levels and indicators for signs of a potential reversal or continued trend. Conclusion Dogecoin‚Äôs impressive rally signals market excitement, but XYZVerse, the first all-sport meme coin, aims for 20,000% growth, poised to become a cultural icon in the 2025 bull run.

The vision was formalized on Thursday, when signed an executive order establishing a working group on digital asset markets. The order reaffirms the administration‚Äôs commitment to key crypto principles, including coding transparency, self-custody, and fair banking access, aiming to integrate blockchain technology responsibly into the U.S. financial system. This idea of blending blockchain with traditional financial systems is bold, and Graphite Network offers the means to make it happen with its scalable and compliant solutions tailored to meet the modern financial needs of banks and financial institutions of all sizes. Speaking to crypto.news, Graphite Network CTO Marko Ratkovic said: ‚ÄúWhile it‚Äôs clear that the world is changing and the new US administration is becoming more open to cryptocurrencies, concrete regulations are still up in the air. What‚Äôs certain, though, is that Graphite Network offers the infrastructure banks need to make this transition. We can help traditional finance connect with the decentralized economy, and this support is just as important for mass adoption as the regulations will be.‚Äù Bank Integration Demo is built to address pressing challenges facing financial institutions as they struggle to implement blockchain adoption on their own through: Building Reliable Infrastructure: Graphite Network‚Äôs blockchain is built on a Proof-of-Authority Polymer 2.0 consensus mechanism, ensuring high security, scalability, and energy efficiency. This will assist financial institutions in adopting blockchain technology without compromising their existing and legacy business. Bridging Compliance and User Empowerment : By integrating ZKP-based KYC processes and reputation scoring, Graphite Network bridges the gap between institutional requirements and user autonomy. Strategic Partnerships: Graphite Network continues to collaborate with banks and other financial institutions and tailoring blockchain solutions to address any specific needs. Other bank-compliant Graphite Network‚Äôs features Predictable Fees, Even During Peak Activity Graphite Network‚Äôs Layer 1 blockchain is built to keep fees reasonable, even during periods of high network activity. For banks and financial institutions, this predictability is crucial for managing costs and ensuring smooth operations. In contrast, Ethereum lagged in 2024, with fees spiking unpredictably ‚Äî averaging $3.52 per transaction during peak times. Such volatility can disrupt cost projections and scalability, making Graphite Network a more reliable choice for institutions integrating blockchain technology. Non-Intrusive KYC Graphite Network‚Äôs optional KYC system is a game-changer for balancing privacy and compliance. The system is built with Zero-Knowledge Proof technology which allows third parties to verify user data such as age or location without revealing personal information. This ensures data security and privacy while providing regulatory agencies and financial institutions with a verifiable, compliant system. User data submitted during the KYC process is kept off-chain to minimize the likelihood of data breaches or unauthorized access. Trust Score and Interaction Preferences Graphite Network‚Äôs Trust Score reflects a user‚Äôs reputation based on things like their KYC status, transaction history, account activity, and interactions with others. It even looks at whether any fraud claims are associated with their account. However, Graphite Network doesn‚Äôt impose strict rules‚Äîit lets users decide how they want to manage their interactions. They can choose whether to complete KYC, who to engage with, how to filter transactions, and more. This flexibility is important because it gives users control over their own decisions. For banks, this is useful because it allows them to have insight into the trustworthiness of users without forcing everyone into a one-size-fits-all system. Banks can also benefit from knowing that users can set their own preferences while still maintaining the ability to track and assess risk through the Trust Score. Reputation-Based Smart Contracts Graphite Network will also provide tools for banks and businesses to develop smart contracts that consider reputation metrics, enabling customization of services for targeted user groups. A bank, for example, could create a contract to issue loans only to customers with verified credit scores or a history of account activity, meeting both business objectives and regulatory standards. Directed Fund Management Graphite Network is planning to introduce tagged addresses to improve transparency and accountability in blockchain transactions. These addresses will be linked to specific purposes, such as business-related payments or loan servicing, ensuring that funds are directed where they‚Äôre intended. For example, if a bank transfers funds to a loan repayment-tagged address, it will be clear that the payment is for that purpose. If the funds are later misused ‚Äî say, spent on unauthorized transactions ‚Äî the system will flag it immediately. Additionally, smart contracts will be able to block transactions from suspicious addresses, adding an extra layer of security. While this feature isn‚Äôt live yet, it‚Äôs a significant step toward making blockchain transactions more secure and trustworthy for financial institutions.

Entry-point nodes onboard transactions, earning 50% of transaction fees in @G, while authorized nodes validate blocks, earning 100% of fees for independent transactions and 50% for transactions involving entry-point nodes. This structure ensures fair rewards for both types of nodes, creating a secure, scalable, and incentivized network that transforms participation into an income opportunity. Marko Ratkovic, recently reiterated one of Graphite Network‚Äôs central visions, explaining: ‚ÄúOne of our key goals is to democratize access to blockchain revenue streams. With our dual-layer node system, we‚Äôve ensured that participants at every level can earn rewards while supporting the growth and security of the network.‚Äù Bank Integration Demo is closely tied to @G, Graphite Network‚Äôs native token, which is weaved into key operations across the network as well, including paying fees, verifying accounts, distributing rewards, and more.

Table of Contents Rollblock keeps soaring higher Bitcoin breaks records post-Trump inauguration XRP hits a new all-time high Solana surge fueled by Trump token mania Conclusion Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration triggered a crypto market surge, with Bitcoin, Solana, XRP, and Rollblock rallying strongly to the joy of ambitious investors. Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly stance, with promises to create U.S. crypto stockpiles, and the appointment of a crypto ‚Äúczar‚Äù has catalyzed massive market movement, creating numerous opportunities for investors to make big gains. Rollblock keeps soaring higher Rollblock is an online crypto casino that is taking the GambleFi space to a whole new level. Unlike its competitors, it incorporates blockchain technology into its offering, providing provably fair gaming to anyone who gets close enough to play its array of exquisite games. Even though Rollblock is at presale, it already has a working product, which blows all other GambleFi projects out of the water. This is the reason its presale keeps soaring higher each day. Currently priced at $0.047 in stage 9, the Rollblock presale has raised close to $10 million from the public. This demonstrates strong investor confidence, with the current price being a 300% increase from its debut price. Analysts have predicted an RBLK surge to $1 in due course, a development that would fetch early investors massive profits. Bitcoin breaks records post-Trump inauguration Following Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, Bitcoin surged to $109,114, the highest it has been in its entire existence. The daily trading volume also rose above $120 billion as investors, both traditional and retail, pocketed BTC. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows also approached $1 billion 24 hours after the inauguration, which further accelerated BTC‚Äôs momentum. With Trump expected to enact crypto-friendly policies in the coming weeks, BTC could still break new records. You might also like: XRP, PEPE, and RBLK see major price action causing FOMO XRP hits a new all-time high In the week of Trump‚Äôs inauguration, XRP climbed nearly 40% to hit a high of $3.4. This took XRP‚Äôs market cap above $190 billion, taking it closer to Ethereum. The surge was fueled by general feelings that the SEC‚Äôs case against Ripple would soon be thrown out. Once there‚Äôs a new positive development regarding this case, one can expect XRP to rally again. Crypto analysts believe a surge to $4 is very close, and once XRP is freed from SEC‚Äôs shackles, a surge to $10 could be on the cards. Solana surge fueled by Trump token mania A few days before his inauguration, Trump launched the TRUMP token on Solana . This token surged stupendously immediately after its launch, going from $1 to above $70. It also boosted Solana‚Äôs price, with SOL hitting close to $300 in the aftermath of Trump‚Äôs inauguration. Solana is now among the top 5 biggest coins by market cap thanks to this development. A bullish SOL run is expected in the coming weeks, and smart investors are positioning themselves to take full advantage of it. Conclusion Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration has injected life into the crypto market, sending BTC, SOL, XRP, and RBLK to break new price levels. For maximum profits, though, savvy investors are banking on RBLK. It is smaller than the other coins, has a low entry-level price, and it‚Äôs got a lot of room for growth.

The cryptocurrency surged by over 30% before experiencing fluctuations, ultimately settling at $244 a week later. This has led some crypto analysts to adopt a bearish view, predicting that the asset might decline to $100. At the same time, a new project in the PayFi sector is gaining momentum during its presale, having swiftly raised over $5.8 million. Remittix (RTX) is capturing interest by addressing real-world challenges and improving efficiencies in the global payments market. So, what features are attracting DeFi enthusiasts to Remittix, and how might Solana (SOL) perform in the first quarter of 2025? Solana (SOL) Sees 6% Price Drop in Just 24 Hours After Solana's dramatic rise last week, the asset is now undergoing a significant price correction. It has fallen by 6% in just the past day, reducing its monthly gain to 26.5% from over 40%. Yet, there is a glimmer of hope for investors, as Solana's trading volume has increased by 9% overnight, indicating that some investors are taking advantage of what they consider a buying opportunity. With this latest decline, Solana's (SOL) market cap has dipped below the crucial $120 billion threshold. The cryptocurrency continues to face criticism for its relatively high inflation rate and persistent network outages, though some improvements to these issues have been observed over the past year. Remittix Raises the Standard for Global Payments Remittix (RTX) is tackling banking inefficiencies to revolutionize global payment processing. By combining blockchain's transparency with fiat's reliability, the platform enables users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currency and transfer funds to bank accounts worldwide. Remittix offers 24-hour transaction times and flat fees, providing a modern alternative to traditional financial systems. Designed for both businesses and individuals, Remittix (RTX) features the powerful RemittixPay API, streamlining payment processes. This tool allows businesses to accept crypto payments and settle them in fiat, supporting more than 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs, thus facilitating cross-border financial transactions with unmatched versatility. A key highlight of Remittix (RTX) is its dedication to financial inclusion. Operating 24/7 without relying on traditional banking infrastructure, the platform gives underbanked communities access to global financial systems, aligning with its mission to democratize financial access and reduce global economic disparities. Remittix Presale Dominates, Exceeding $5.8 Million In its ongoing presale, the $RTX token is priced at $0.0297 and has already raised more than $5.8 million. The token is central to the Remittix ecosystem, enabling governance, staking, and rewards. Analysts forecast a potential 800% increase in value by the end of the presale, with the possibility of a 5,000% surge post-launch, positioning Remittix as a game-changer in the burgeoning PayFi industry.

With such a wild increase, it is important to address the following question: Who owns the most Ripple ( XRP )? You see, a token‚Äôs distribution has to be diverse, as concentration means that the majority holder of the token can heavily manipulate the price at any major buy or sell position. Understanding who holds the most XRP can be key for investors to make a long-term buying or selling decision about this popular cryptocurrency. In this article, we‚Äôll provide an overview of the number of XRP holders, the token holder distribution, and the possible impacts of this ownership in the future. Overview of XRP holders Ripple Labs, the creator of the XRP token, is reported to hold the largest share of the token‚Äôs supply, amounting to 46 billion XRP. Also, Chris Larsen, the co-founder of Ripple Labs, reportedly holds 5 billion XRP. Major cryptocurrency exchanges also hold a substantial amount of XRP, with Binance holding 1.83 billion tokens. As of January 24, 2025, XRP is trading at approximately $3.16 per token. The cryptocurrency has experienced an intraday high of $3.18 and a low of $3.04. The 24-hour trading volume stands at $8.2 billion, contributing to a market capitalization of around $182 billion. XRP 1D chart | Source: crypto.news How many people own XRP? Due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain network, it is almost impossible to calculate the number of XRP holders . However, it is possible to track the multiple wallet addresses that hold this token. According to the latest data collected by Bithomp , there are approximately 6,032,259 active XRP account holders who hold a total of 99,986,575,397 XRP. While these numbers provide an estimate of XRP holders, the actual number may be different, as many users may hold multiple wallets, and some wallets will also belong to many crypto exchanges.

Meanwhile, the top 20 holders own 50.30% of the total supply, and if we talk about the top 50 and top 100, they hold 63.71% and 71.74% of the total supply. As for centralized crypto exchanges, Upbit is the leader among XRP owners, with 4.37% of the total supply, followed by Binance with 1.31%, Bitbank with 0.58%, and Korbit with 0.12%. Distribution of XRP among holders If we look at the distribution among XRP owners, we can see that wallets in the range of 1 million to 10 million XRP account for 6.42% of the total XRP supply. Following this, wallets between 100,000 to 1 million XRP hold 11.14%, and smaller XRP holders with 1000 to 100000 XRP own 7.53% of the total supply. Meanwhile, holders with 1000 or fewer XRP tokens make up a small percentage of the total XRP token supply, highlighting the dominance of larger accounts in this token. Ripple Labs and XRP ownership Founded in 2012, Ripple Labs is the creator of XRP, a company that focuses on real-time payment solutions. Its primary offering is known as RippleNet, a technology used by major institutions for cross-border payments. While Ripple Labs does hold the largest share of XRP tokens, amounting to 46 billion XRP tokens, most of it is locked in escrow with scheduled releases to manage token supply effectively. This major ownership does promote the ecosystem‚Äôs growth, but it also points to the centralization of the token‚Äôs supply, which goes against the core principles of blockchain technology. The impact of XRP ownership distribution As mentioned above, a few entities hold a significant portion of the XRP token supply, with the top 20 holders collectively controlling 50.53% of the total supply. While it is common for many cryptocurrencies which are in their early stages to have a concentrated supply among a small number of holders, it is not good in the long run especially when it comes to price stability and market behaviour. If major holders were to sell off their XRP holdings in a small amount of time it can drastically affect the token‚Äôs price, and more importantly, it can dent the project‚Äôs reputation forever. It is advisable to do your research before investing in any token and take a look at its tokenomics, total supply, and the convention of token holders as well.

This again provides some optimism concerning ETH, which has continued to underperform in this market cycle. Ethereum Price Eyes $4,000 With This Bullish Pattern In a TradingView post, BasicTrading revealed that a breakout to $4,000 looks to be on the horizon for the Ethereum price following the formation of a rising channel pattern. This bullish prediction came as the analyst noted that ETH had been retesting the previous all-time high resistance and was not able to break it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 However, this time, it could be different following the rising channel pattern. The analyst added that with the bullish break and retest and Ethereum price action, the breakout is about to happen. With Ethereum likely to break this psychological $4,000 resistance level soon enough, the analyst suggested that this could ultimately pave the way for ETH to reach and possibly surpass its current ATH of $4,800. BasicTrading remarked that the sky is the limit for the Ethereum price if it manages to break above its current ATH. Interestingly, the crypto analyst raised the possibility of ETH rising to between $20,000 and $25,000 if it replicates its historical performance from previous bull cycles. This price range represents the upper resistance trendline of the rising channel. However, the analyst stated that the Ethereum price must first achieve a clear breakout of its current ATH before a rally to as high as $25,000 can become a possibility. This bullish projection for ETH comes just days after crypto analyst Ali Martinez explained why it wasn‚Äôt time to give up on Ethereum despite its underperformance in this market cycle. Martinez mentioned that a decisive breakout above $4,000 could send ETH to $7,000. ETH To Reach Five Digits In This Bull Run Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has also backed BasicTrading‚Äôs bullish outlook as he predicted that the Ethereum price would at least reach $10,000 in this market cycle. The analyst asserted that ETH will come back with a ‚Äúvengeance‚Äù in the coming months. He added that $10,000 is the bare minimum once Ethereum breaks out. CrediBULL Crypto further opined that $20,000 is certainly not unreasonable by the end of this cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Gets Massive $12,000 Price Tag From Research Lead Ahead Of Major Upgrade Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price, stating that ETH‚Äôs hated rally that will bring it to $12,000 is loading.

At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,400, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Some have faith in Ethereum due to its extensive developer community, while others lean towards Ripple for its banking connections. However, a growing segment is betting that Remittix could offer the best prospects for future returns. By simplifying international payments, Remittix has built a reputation for its low transaction fees and fast processing times. This article explores the distinctions among Ethereum, Ripple, and Remittix, and why experts predict Remittix might surpass the others. Current Status of Ethereum and Ripple At present, Ethereum (ETH) trades at around $3.21k, showing a -3.31% decrease in the past day. Throughout the last month, Ethereum has declined by -5.95%, prompting some investors to seek new avenues. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is valued at approximately $3.06, with a -2.96% drop over the previous week. Despite Ripple's partnerships with significant financial entities, ongoing regulatory challenges hinder its widespread adoption. Both Ethereum and Ripple are major players, yet their prices have encountered obstacles. Despite these setbacks, many still view Ethereum and Ripple as key assets in the crypto world. ETH supports numerous decentralized applications, and XRP is designed to enhance global banking transactions. Nevertheless, this popularity does not assure their status as a smart crypto investment in 2025. Emerging coins that offer direct solutions, like Remittix, could gain an advantage if they continue to offer lower fees and faster transactions compared to Ethereum or Ripple. Remittix: A Sensible Choice for 2025 Remittix (RTX) is a token designed for cross-border money transfers. Over the past month, Remittix has surged by +88%, partly due to a wave of new users. Unlike Ethereum, which can experience high gas fees, and Ripple, which often focuses on large financial institutions, Remittix serves individuals needing quick transfers. Many freelancers and small businesses commend Remittix for enabling them to convert digital funds into local currency in less than 24 hours. By maintaining low costs and fast processing, Remittix provides a practical service that resonates with everyday users. Analysts believe RTX could increase by another +40% if its adoption continues. WhileETH and XRP remain important within the crypto ecosystem, tokens like Remittix could soon surpass them in daily usage. Observers are already calling Remittix the smart crypto investment in 2025 because it tackles issues that older networks haven't fully resolved. 2025 Predictions: Why Remittix Could Excel Looking forward, Ethereum is set to evolve through enhancements, aiming to lower fees and increase speed. Ripple is optimistic that better regulations will allow XRP to flourish in bank-focused agreements. However, everyday users might opt for an easy-to-use tool like Remittix (RTX) if it remains more affordable and faster than either Ethereum or Ripple. Word-of-mouth could attract even more people to Remittix due to its simple, cost-effective transactions. Investors searching for a smart crypto investment in 2025 often focus on real-world applications. If a platform can address everyday money transfer challenges, it has the potential for steady growth. This is the main advantage of Remittix: it prioritizes real-world needs, drawing interest from both new and seasoned traders. While ETH and XRP may keep their loyal user bases, many experts believe Remittix could see wider adoption, making it a strong contender in the coming years. Conclusion Deciding between Ethereum, Ripple, and Remittix depends on what you're looking to achieve. Ethereum (ETH) supports a multitude of apps, and Ripple (XRP) works with global banks. Yet Remittix (RTX) is focused on solving everyday problems‚Äîlike slow and expensive remittances‚Äîmaking it an appealing choice for those in need of practical solutions. If it continues to gain momentum, Remittix might outshine established projects by addressing issues neither Ethereum nor Ripple can fully solve.

With its vast potential and intriguing features, Remittix is expected to create many millionaires. As interest swells, people are beginning to realize the impact of this presale token. Let's explore why Remittix is gaining so much attention and could be a game-changer! Ethereum Faces Price Drop Amid Market Challenges With the broader cryptocurrency market facing challenges, Ethereum (ETH) is losing its charm. Its price recently dipped below $3,300, reflecting a bearish sentiment among investors. Despite these hurdles, Ethereum's future remains promising, especially with the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). If approved, these ETFs could clear the way for substantial institutional investors, impacting Ethereum's value in the coming years. Ethereum is currently struggling to maintain upward momentum. Its failure to stay above the $3,400 mark has raised concerns among traders. This price drop is largely due to decreased demand from long-term holders and a reduction in funds flowing into Ethereum-based investment products. Now testing key support levels, Ethereum might face additional losses if it cannot stay above current levels. However, there remains hope for Ethereum's long-term prospects. The approval of Ethereum ETFs could attract major institutional investments, likely boosting Ethereum's value. Analysts suggest that as more investors get on board, if institutional access becomes easier, Ethereum's price could soar once again. Even though Ethereum is experiencing temporary setbacks, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs might serve as a catalyst for future growth. Investors should keep an eye on these developments, as they could influence Ethereum's performance in the upcoming months and years. RTX Poised for Significant Growth in the 2025 Bull Market For those seeking a potential cryptocurrency investment, RTX is worth watching. As the cryptocurrency landscape expands, RTX is gaining traction due to its capability to solve critical issues in the $180 trillion cross-border payment industry. This sector, which deals with international money transfers, can be slow and costly. Remittix aims to revolutionize this by enabling faster, cheaper, and more secure payments through blockchain technology. The Remittix platform allows users to send money directly to bank accounts worldwide. With rapid transfers and no hidden fees, it converts over forty different cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies like dollars or euros, making it a more affordable option than traditional banking systems. Through the Remittix Pay API, businesses can also accept cryptocurrency payments and convert them into fiat, offering a straightforward way to manage digital assets. The $RTX token is at the core of Remittix's platform. It is essential for staking, governance, and earning platform rewards. The token's limited total supply of around 1.5 billion adds to its demand and exclusivity. Currently priced at $0.0297 during the presale stage, the RTX token presents an excellent investment opportunity. Experts predict the token could see a 25x increase during the presale and over 1,500% gains post-launch. RTX presents a strong choice for those looking to invest in the top coins to buy now or the best coin to invest in today. It is expected to see a significant increase in value during the 2025 bull run, thanks to its innovative solution to a major global issue.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) says the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) has closed Pulaski Savings Bank. The FDIC has been appointed as the receiver and has transferred all deposit accounts and most of the bank‚Äôs assets to Millennium Bank. The FDIC says it will have to pay about $28.5 million from its Deposit Insurance Fund to cover the cost of the failure, pointing to ‚Äúsuspected fraud‚Äù as the primary factor driving the expense.

The US witnessed two bank failures last year, starting with the closure of Republic First Bank in April, which had $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits.

Key Bitcoin Investors Have Been In Accumulation Mode Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the total number of sharks on the Bitcoin network has registered an increase recently. The indicator of relevance here is the ‚ÄúSupply Distribution,‚Äù which tells us about the amount of BTC wallets that belong to a particular group. Addresses or investors are categorized into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. For example, wallets holding 5 tokens are put into the 1 to 10 coins group. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Hits 60-Day Low: Is This Bullish? In the context of the current topic, the wallet range of interest is 100 to 1,000 BTC. At the current exchange rate, the lower end of the range converts to $10.5 million and the upper one to $105 million. Thus, the only addresses that would qualify for the cohort would be the ones belonging to the large traders. This group is popularly known as the sharks. The sharks are certainly not the largest entities on the network‚Äîthat title belongs to the whales‚Äîbut they are still influential due to their notable holdings. Below is the chart for the Bitcoin Supply Distribution shared by the analytics firm, which shows the data for these key investors over the last few months. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for the 100 to 1,000 coins group saw a sharp upwards trajectory during the last few weeks of 2024, implying a large amount of new shark-sized investors popped up on the network. The growth in the indicator has significantly slowed down this year, but it has nonetheless continued as the metric‚Äôs value has just set a new record of 15,777 addresses. Bitcoin has seen a pause in its bull run recently, so to see the sharks still be interested in buying the asset could naturally be a positive sign for things to come in the near future. The sharks haven‚Äôt been the only investors accumulating recently, as the analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out that the shrimps and crabs have also been seeing positive flows. The shrimps and crabs refer to the Bitcoin investors owning up to 1 and 10 BTC, respectively. As is apparent from the chart, these small entities have combined bought 25,600 BTC during the past month, which is equivalent to 1.9x the Monthly Issuance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capital Inflows See Notable Slowdown, But Is This A Worry? The Monthly Issuance is the amount that miners have produced/mined over the last 30 days. Thus, it would appear that the retail investors have been absorbing almost twice as much supply as the miners have been minting. BTC Price Bitcoin has been moving sideways over the last few days as its price is still floating around the $105,100 level.

The market offers everything from well-known players like Solana to trendy meme coins such as Pepe. However, there's a new contender making waves for all the right reasons. Remittix, a crypto-to-fiat payment service, is transforming how cryptocurrencies interact with traditional banking systems. Remittix‚Äôs presale has already raked in over $5.6 million, with projections to soar by 100x. This impressive growth sets it apart from other altcoins, leading top crypto analysts to consider it the most promising altcoin emerging from the market this year. Solana: A Dominant Force in Blockchain Solana is often mentioned in discussions about blockchain leaders, and for good reason. It has become a go-to platform for developers focused on DeFi and dApp projects, thanks to its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low costs. One of the standout features of Solana is its ability to scale without compromising security. The platform has recently explored a deflationary model to boost its network's sustainability and efficiency. Leveraging Solaxy‚Äôs layer-2 solutions, Solana has improved its ecosystem, attracting both institutional investors and retail traders. Yet, challenges remain. High gas fees during peak times and network congestion have been points of contention. While Solana remains one of the top altcoins to watch, these issues might open doors for newer and innovative projects like Remittix. Pepe: The Resilient Meme Coin Pepe has made a name for itself in the meme coin arena. What started as a playful, community-driven token has grown into a formidable presence in the crypto market. Gaining traction after its listing on major exchanges like Coinbase, Pepe‚Äôs value saw a surge in December 2024. The appeal of Pepe is undeniable, but so is its famous volatility. Recently, the token has struggled to maintain its momentum, testing significant support levels. This performance is typical for meme coins, which often prioritize hype and community engagement over utility. This is why major investors and everyday users seek the stability that Remittix provides . Remittix: Transforming Crypto-to-Fiat Transactions Unlike Solana and Pepe, Remittix is not just another blockchain or meme coin. It's redefining how cryptocurrency is used practically. With over 295 million tokens sold, Remittix‚Äôs presale has already amassed over $5.6 million, and the excitement continues to build. So what makes Remittix stand out? Its main focus is simplifying crypto-to-fiat conversions. Whether you're a business looking to accept crypto payments or an individual sending money internationally, Remittix has you covered. Users can convert over 40 cryptocurrencies directly into fiat, transferring funds to any bank account globally. And the best part? There are no hidden fees, ensuring you know exactly what you're paying. Why Remittix Stands Out: ‚óè Innovation: Remittix provides unmatched convenience in bridging traditional finance with cryptocurrency.‚óè Transparency: A comprehensive smart contract audit has confirmed the system‚Äôs reliability, instilling trust.‚óè Accessibility: Supporting over 50 crypto pairs and more than 30 fiat currencies, it offers a truly global solution.‚óè Future Plans: Post-presale, Remittix aims to list on Uniswap and major centralized exchanges to ensure high liquidity and adoption. These aspects have led analysts to highlight Remittix as one of the top altcoins to monitor. Remittix Emerges as the Leader While both Solana and Pepe have their strengths, Remittix stands out as the most promising investment for 2025. Its innovative take on crypto-to-fiat exchanges, coupled with transparency and a global reach, could revolutionize how cryptocurrencies are perceived in everyday life. Remittix should be at the top of your list if you're scouting for the best cryptocurrencies to keep tabs on.

Sun‚Äôs Vision For The Ethereum Price In a recent social post on X (formerly Twitter), Sun proposed a plan that he believes could propel the Ethereum price to unprecedented heights, targeting a price of $10,000. Sun‚Äôs strategy hinges on a radical overhaul of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) and the Ethereum protocol itself. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Reserve: Eric Trump‚Äôs Deleted Tweet Raises Eyebrows The TRON founder asserts that under his leadership, immediate and decisive actions could almost double the current price peak for ETH. One of his primary proposals is to halt the sale of ETH for a minimum of three years. By doing so, Sun aims to stabilize the currency‚Äôs supply and bolster market confidence. To cover operational costs during this period, Sun suggests leveraging Aave (AAVE) lending, staking yields, and stablecoin borrowing, thereby ensuring that the ETH supply remains intact while aligning with deflationary goals. In addition to halting sales, Sun proposes imposing significant taxes on Layer 2 (L2) projects. He believes this move could generate at least $5 billion annually for Ethereum, either in stablecoins or tokens. The revenue from these taxes would be utilized to repurchase and burn ETH in a decentralized manner, further enhancing scarcity and potentially driving up demand. Major Staff Cuts To Transform Ethereum Foundation Into Meritocracy In his social media post, Sun also emphasized the need to streamline operations within the Ethereum Foundation. He suggests a significant reduction in staff, retaining only the most capable team members. Those who remain would receive substantial salary increases, transitioning the Ethereum Foundation into a merit-based organization that rewards high performance. Furthermore, the TRON founder calls for adjustments in node rewards and a stronger focus on fee-burning mechanisms. By reducing node rewards, Sun believes Ethereum can solidify its deflationary status, reinforcing its position as a store of value. Related Reading: Cardano Will Reach $1.50 Once The $1.10 Resistance Breaks ‚Äì Details The focus, according to Sun, would shift exclusively toward Layer 1 (L1) development, prioritizing scalability, security, and broader adoption. Sun is confident that these initiatives could lead the Ethereum price to surpass $4,500 within the first week of implementation, laying the groundwork for long-term success. While this only represents Sun‚Äôs vision for the Ethereum price, any of these proposals, if viable for driving another leg up of the altcoin, could ultimately be adopted by the co-founders or the developers of the platform. As of this writing, the Ethereum price hovers around the $3,200 mark, reflecting a loss of 4% over the past 24 hours. This decline has widened the gap between the current price and its ATH of $4,878, representing a difference of 34.5%.

At press time, XRP is trading at $3.12 and has slightly drifted to the green zone. The Key Scenario: Price Expected to Reach New Highs There is a scenario where XRP could make one more move to the upside before a potential shift in trend. As of now, the price is expected to rise, potentially reaching a new peak. However, the crucial question remains: will this push higher lead to further gains, or will it mark the peak of the rally before a correction begins? After a five-phase pattern, a major top or larger correction typically follows, signaling increased risk. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a bearish trend, but the current rally could be nearing its end. Potential Breakout Targets: Where Could the Price Head Next? On the smaller time frame, XRP is facing resistance at its all-time high of $3.30. A breakout above this level could see the price surge towards new targets, including $4.19, $5, and possibly even $6.61. XRP recently completed an internal triangle pattern, which broke out to the upside on January 13. However, the price failed to break above its all-time high and has since entered a consolidation phase. There is no clear breakout signal at the moment, and the price is holding above key support levels between $2.52 and $2.94. These support levels have been respected multiple times, and the price recently reacted to the $2.81 level, which represents a 50% retracement. The expectation remains for a continuation to higher prices, with potential moves to $4.90 or even $5. However, it‚Äôs also possible that XRP may form another low before continuing upwards. Traders should watch for a breakout above $3.30‚Äì$3.40 to confirm the continuation of the bullish trend. Until that happens, a pullback to the lower support levels remains a possibility.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-25 02:34:27

Bitcoin Whales Start Accumulating As Trump Era Begins,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/inauguration-effect-bitcoin-whales-start-accumulating-as-trump-era-begins/,"Following Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration on January 20th, Bitcoin (BTC) has remained range-bound, trading between $101,000 to $110,000. However, a new report by CryptoQuant states that behind this routine price action, Bitcoin ‚Äòwhales‚Äô are quietly back to accumulating the premier cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Whales Back In Accumulation Mode According to the report, large BTC holders ‚Äì commonly referred to as Bitcoin ‚Äòwhales‚Äô ‚Äì have re-entered the accumulation phase. Recent data shows a significant uptick in the monthly percentage growth of BTC holdings among these large investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast Of $150,000 ‚ÄòToo Low‚Äô Amid Rising Adoption, Crypto Trader Says Notably, Bitcoin whale holdings increased from a decline of -0.25% on January 14 to a growth of 2% by January 17, marking the highest monthly growth rate since mid-December. In absolute terms, these investors‚Äô BTC holdings rose from 16.2 million on November 4 to 16.4 million as of January 24. The surge in whale accumulation appears to be driven by several bullish developments early in Trump‚Äôs administration. For example, the US president has already signed an executive order establishing a Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. This Working Group has been tasked with proposing a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies ‚Äì including stablecoins ‚Äì within six months. Additionally, the group will evaluate the potential creation of a national digital asset stockpile, fueling speculation about a potential US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Besides growth in whale holdings, selling pressure for BTC has declined sharply since major profit-taking in December. This aligns with a recent report which found that BTC profit-taking has dropped by 93% from its December peak. The report reads: Bitcoin holders realized daily profits as high as $10 billion as Bitcoin approached $100K in December. However, daily realized profits have fallen to levels around $2-$3 billion in January, which indicates market participants may have finished selling Bitcoin for the most part. Moreover, the traders‚Äô unrealized profit margins have declined near zero, a level which typically marks a price floor during bull markets. However, the report also highlights that overall Bitcoin spot demand has weakened over the past month, raising concerns about the likelihood of another bullish rally. Specifically, the rate of demand growth for Bitcoin has fallen from 279,000 BTC in early December to just 75,000 BTC at the time of writing. Analysts Confident Of Another BTC Rally Despite the cooling of on-chain demand, crypto analysts remain optimistic about another major price rally for Bitcoin. For instance, a recent report suggested that BTC could target a price as high as $249,000 during Trump‚Äôs presidency. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Hit Its Peak In Summer 2025? Analysts Weigh In Another report by Bitfinex predicted that BTC is likely headed to $200,000 by mid-year amid mild price pullbacks. However, a lot depends on how the US Federal Reserve handles interest rate adjustments this year. From a technical standpoint, BTC‚Äôs cup-and-handle pattern projects a price target of as high as $275,000. At press time, BTC trades at $106,074, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

CEO Reacts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is climbing towards new all-time highs, with a major breakout on the horizon. A key driver of this upward momentum is a recent executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which includes the creation of a U.S. government Bitcoin Reserve. This move has raised excitement in the crypto world, particularly for Bitcoin enthusiasts. However, amidst the Bitcoin Reserve news, XRP is facing a lot of heat on social media. Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot Platforms, has claimed that the biggest challenge to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) isn‚Äôt the Fed, Treasury, or banks‚Äîit‚Äôs Ripple. Rochard argues that Ripple is spending millions of dollars lobbying politicians to block the SBR, fearing it could hurt their marketing narrative and push their own agenda for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Rochard even accused Ripple of trying to sabotage Bitcoin mining under the Biden administration and said Ripple has now ‚Äúdeclared war‚Äù by attempting to block the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to him, Ripple should have focused on its own business and not interfered with the SBR. ‚ÄúFace the facts: Ripple / XRP has been the leading source of anti-bitcoin misinformation for more than a decade. They have aggressively lobbied policymakers around the world to try to ban bitcoin mining. Weaponizing woke ESG narratives to promote their centralized token,‚Äù Rochard said. In response, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse fired back, stating that their efforts are actually boosting the chances of a crypto strategic reserve, which could include Bitcoin.

In a new video on the state of the markets, pseudonymous analysts DonAlt and Cred say the launch of Trump‚Äôs official memecoin (TRUMP) potentially squandered a massive fortune for the 47th President. After its initial launch on January 17th, TRUMP soared to a $72 billion fully diluted market cap in a couple of days, making it among the top 20 crypto assets in existence ‚Äì with Trump and his affiliates holding 80% of the supply. Then, Trump abruptly launched a second official coin called MELANIA, which triggered an immediate crash in the price of TRUMP as investors realized their coins can essentially be diluted by new Trump family tokens. Crypto trader Cred says the move hammered the seemingly unstoppable rise of TRUMP. ‚ÄúIt feels like one of the worst decisions of modern financial history, not to be too hyperbolic about it. But if you look at like how much it went up, how quickly it got to the tens of billions in market cap. The liquidity that was there. The attention. The mind share. It was literally cannibalizing the entirety of the market and you spawned it out of nowhere and then you just fumble that on a Melania coin.‚Äù Fellow trader DonAlt says he agrees, warning that Trump and his team‚Äôs 80% allocation will be unlocked over time, potentially hitting the open market. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying this is going to go to zero anytime soon. I think if anything is probably going to just stabilize and bleed over a while. But I would not want to hold anywhere close to the unlocks because I mean just by the way that they launched Melania coin I‚Äôm like 90% certain that you‚Äôre going to get dumped on your head.‚Äù TRUMP has now dropped from an all-time high of $72.62 on January 19th to $29.43 at time of publishing. The level of involvement that Trump directly had in the launches of both coins ‚Äì which are attributed to the Trump-affiliated organizations CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC ‚Äì is debatable. When asked about his new memecoin two days ago, Trump said he wasn‚Äôt closely following its progress. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know much about it other than I launched it. I heard it was very successful. I haven‚Äôt checked it.‚Äù Although his memecoins may have faltered, many in the industry are celebrating a number of Trump-fueled digital asset developments this week. On Thursday, President Trump signed an executive order to analyze the creation of a government-held strategic crypto reserve, prohibit the development of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and promote stablecoins. Trump‚Äôs new leadership at the SEC also eliminated a controversial accounting guideline that effectively prevented banks from holding crypto assets on behalf of their customers.

Data analyzed by the on-chain intelligence firm CryptoQuant now shows that Official Trump (TRUMP) has recorded roughly $38 billion in total trading volume across centralized crypto exchanges since its release on January 17. The token‚Äôs spot trading volume topped $17 billion on January 19; however, the recent figure indicates that the volume has almost doubled over the past few days. The TRUMP Pump CryptoQuant found that the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Binance, dominated the spot trading volume with $16 billion, while other platforms like OKX and Bybit followed suit with $7 billion and $6 billion, respectively. The Trump meme was promoted as a cryptocurrency created to express support for and engagement with Trump‚Äôs beliefs and ideals. These coins exist on the Solana blockchain, and 200 million TRUMP are currently in circulation, with the total supply expected to grow to one billion over the next three years. Less than two days after its launch, TRUMP became one of the top 20 altcoins on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap (now at number 25), with a market cap of nearly $15 billion. The rally also made the token the second-biggest meme coin, trailing behind Dogecoin (DOGE). Official Trump‚Äôs pump had never been seen before in the crypto space, so during the next few days after its launch, it ranked as the top trending token across the entire sector. Significant Correction Amid the growth in Official Trump‚Äôs market cap and spot trading volume, the token‚Äôs price skyrocketed from 0 to $72 in less than 48 hours. Although the meme coin‚Äôs price had corrected significantly by the time of writing, and it was trading at $35.88 on CoinMarketCap, TRUMP is still up more than 450% from its January 18 trading price of $7. Noteworthily, Official Trump‚Äôs market cap now hovers around $7.18 billion, and analysts have attributed this drop in price and market cap to the launch of MELANIA, a competing meme coin by First Lady Melania Trump. Interestingly, President Trump attempted to downplay the success of TRUMP at a press briefing a day after his inauguration; however, it cannot be denied that the memecoin‚Äôs pump created new crypto millionaires overnight.

CoinShares Joins The List appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A wave of excitement is building in the cryptocurrency industry as giant asset managers are doubling down on their pursuit of altcoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Big players like Grayscale and CoinShares are pushing for ETFs focused on Litecoin, XRP, and Solana. Could this be the turning point for crypto ETFs in 2025? Grayscale‚Äôs New ETF Filings Nate Geraci, the President of The ETF Store, recently pointed a key development in a tweet. He pointed out that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) had filed a 19b-4 form to list and trade Grayscale‚Äôs Litecoin Trust. These new filings are aiming to fix some of the issues that caused problems for crypto investments in the past, like ensuring security and clear rules around custody. However, the proposed Litecoin ETF would follow the price of Litecoin without investors needing to actually own the coins. It‚Äôs a step up from Grayscale‚Äôs existing Litecoin Trust, and it could make it easier for people to invest in Litecoin without the usual complications. Meanwhile, Grayscale is also hoping to convert its Grayscale Solana Trust into a Solana ETF. The SEC was supposed to make a decision on this by January 23, 2025, but there hasn‚Äôt been any public comment yet. This silence might mean the SEC is taking its time to carefully consider the proposal, perhaps under new guidelines and a fresh perspective. CoinShares Joins the Race with Litecoin and XRP ETFs Not far behind, CoinShares has also filed for two new ETFs, one for Litecoin and another for XRP. CoinShares is hoping to bring crypto closer to traditional investments, allowing more people to access the market through these new funds. Other companies like Bitwise, ProShares, WisdomTree, and REX Shares have also filed for XRP ETFs, showing that the demand for these kinds of investment products is growing quickly. New Era for Crypto ETFs These filings are happening at a time of big change in the U.S. government. With President Trump taking office on January 20, 2025, many believe the SEC will adopt a crypto friendlier approach. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepped down recently, and President Trump appointed Paul Atkins, a former regulator who is known for supporting cryptocurrencies, to lead the SEC. Price Analysis: XRP, LTC, Sol Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the ETF filing, the altcoin has shown a mixed response in the market.

You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Executive order The narrative U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn into office on Monday and quickly signed a flurry of executive orders. While it took him a few days to get to crypto-specific items, we've seen a number of actions from his administration already ‚Äî not to mention the broader Republican Party. Why it matters These agencies and Congressional bodies' initial actions set the tone for what we can expect as the new Congress and administration really get going this year. Breaking it down There'll be time to go more into detail on some of these later, but for now: White House/Administration Donald Trump signed a highly-anticipated executive order on crypto. Among its provisions are items that: Create a working group composed of Cabinet officials, White House advisers and others tasked with identifying regulations that address crypto and recommending whether they be changed. AI and crypto czar David Sacks will chair this working group. Task the working group with evaluating a digital asset stockpile. Ban any central bank digital currency, with a somewhat broad definition of a CBDC. Revoke former President Joe Biden's executive order on crypto, which mostly just directed his Departments to craft reports about various aspects of crypto and consumer protections. Trump also announced that Sacks would co-chair his President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, now operating under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda , formed a crypto-focused task force headed up by Commissioner Hester Peirce. Trump previously named Paul Atkins as his pick to serve as the agency's chair, once he's confirmed by the Senate. One of the SEC's first moves was to rescind Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 , which directed publicly traded companies holding crypto for their clients to mark those holdings on their own balance sheets. SAB 121 was strongly opposed by the crypto industry, which argued that it made it more difficult for banks to provide certain crypto services. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is now operating under Acting Chair Caroline Pham . Pham named CFTC Senior Policy Advisor Harry Jung as the regulator's lead for crypto industry engagement . Trump has not yet named a nominee to take over as permanent chair. Trump pardoned Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht , saying on Truth Social that he did so ""in honor of [Ulbricht's mother] and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly."" Ulbricht was convicted on criminal enterprise, narcotics distribution and various conspiracy charges and sentenced to double life in prison and 40 years with no parole. Trump announced he would rename the existing U.S. Digital Service as his Department of Government Efficiency, the entity headed up by Elon Musk (Vivek Ramaswamy, who was previously a co-head, has now left to run for Ohio governor). Initially, the entity's website just had the Dogecoin logo on it. Companies are also filing for dogecoin exchange-traded funds now. Trump spoke with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele shortly after signing his crypto executive order, though an official readout of the call did not mention crypto in any form. Senate The Senate Banking Committee has confirmed the creation of a subcommittee focused on digital assets , led by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.). The subcommittee's other members include freshmen Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), who unseated former Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) with $40 million worth of support from crypto political action committee Fairshake, Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who received $10 million worth of support and Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), among others. The Banking Committee is also holding a hearing on Feb. 5, though the specific time and witness list have yet to be announced. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) introduced a joint Congressional Review Act resolution alongside House Rep. Mike Carey (R-Ohio) to overturn the IRS' recent crypto broker rule. The rule, finalized late last month , defines the term ""broker"" for IRS tax reporting purposes, but has already drawn a lawsuit from the Blockchain Association. The industry lobbyists argue the final rule ""puts unlawful compliance burdens on software developers."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the new lead Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, is also asking the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to look into the TRUMP token. She sent an open letter co-signed by Massachusetts Representative Jake Auchincloss. House of Representatives The House Oversight Committee sent out a letter announcing it would investigate whether banks de-banked crypto companies at the government's behest. The House Financial Services Committee has already scheduled two hearings on crypto next month. The first, on Feb. 6, 2025, will focus on the aforementioned debanking. The second, set for Feb. 11, is titled ""A Golden Age of Digital Assets: Charting a Path Forward."" The leading Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Gerry Connelly, asked the panel's leading Republican, Rep. James Comer, to probe Trump's issuance of the TRUMP coin and his ties to World Liberty Financial .

While Bitcoin‚Äôs price held at the $105K level as the week came to a close, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP also managed to remain in the green territory. Simultaneously, the global crypto market cap jumped nearly 1% over the past day to rest at $3.58 trillion on Saturday. However, traders appear to be cautious amid the broader market turbulence, as flagged by a 34% decrease in the intraday global market trading volume. Meanwhile, meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE also gained roughly 1% intraday. AI coins such as NEAR, ICP, and FIL also followed, mimicking gains. So, let‚Äôs delve deeper into some of the most attention-nabbing cryptocurrencies for the day and their price movements on January 25. Crypto Market Today: Market Resilient As BTC, ETH, XRP Prevent Downfall Despite the broader market volatility brewing in recent days, Bitcoin and top assets have prevented price downturns, although they are moving sideways and consolidating. Notably, BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL prices were up nearly 1% from yesterday. Whereas, meme coins also witnessed an uptick of roughly 2% intraday. Also, the AI Coins sector saw NEAR, ICP, and FIL mimic a similar pumping movement. Flagship Crypto At $105K Amid Broader Market Turbulence As of press time, BTC price indicated a nearly 1% jump in value and is resting at $105,063. The flagship crypto‚Äôs 24-hour low and high were $103,805.97 and $107,098.55, respectively. Looking at the broader price chart, it can be seen that the asset is currently moving sideways, flagging a consolidation period. Nevertheless, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance rose by 0.20% from yesterday, reaching 57.84%. Notably, the flagship crypto consolidates and prevents a fall despite $1.24 billion worth of inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, as per weekly data by SosoValue for Jan 23. Crypto market watchers continue to monitor the token for further price shifts amid market uncertainty. Ethereum Price At $3,300 Level ETH price witnessed a slight 0.5% uptick at the time of reporting and was trading at $3,320. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs 24-hour low and high were $3,270.27 and $3,424.90, respectively. Even the broader price chart for Ethereum underscores a period of consolidation. This sideways trading session comes despite $130.14 million weekly inflows into the Ethereum ETFs as of Jan 23. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has recently posted on X, revealing that whales purchased over 1.14 million ETH in the last 48 hours. Nevertheless, traders and investors appear to be unsure of future movements amid the broader market turbulence. XRP Price Above $3 XRP price also witnessed a jump of nearly 0.5% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $3.13. The Ripple-backed crypto‚Äôs intraday low and high were $3.09 and $3.20, respectively. Intriguingly, XRP appears to be mimicking the broader market trend, with its weekly chart pointing to a consolidation. Solana Price Holds Above $250 Further, SOL price witnessed a marginal 0.2% jump as of press time, resting at $252. The coin‚Äôs 24-hour low and high were $248.35 and $269.81, respectively. Market watchers continue to eye the token amid broader developments, such as stablecoin giant Circle‚Äôs constant minting of USDC on the Solana network. Lookonchain revealed on Saturday that Circle minted another 250 million USDC on the network. Meme Crypto Market Shows Potential Simultaneously, DOGE price witnessed a nearly 2% price upswing in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.3524. SHIB price saw a pump of over 1% in value intraday, reaching $0.00002. Also, PEPE price rose by 1.5% over the past day and is sitting at $0.00001503. However, other tokens such as TRUMP, BONK, and PENGU have traded dominantly in the red zone today. AI Cryptos Pump Also, leading AI coins have witnessed remarkable price gains intraday. NEAR price soared nearly 2% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $4.99. Further, ICP price also followed, up by 2% to $9.20. Moreover, FIL price soared over 2% to reach $5.07. Overall, the AI cryptocurrency market has garnered significant attention as it showcased bullish potential despite the broader market turbulence.

Notably, this bearish prediction comes against the backdrop of the rising number of alt projects in the market, which appears to have impacted the supply dynamics. Ali states that ‚Äútoday, there are over 36.4 million altcoins, compared to fewer than 3,000 altcoins during the 2017-2018 alt season and even fewer than 500 altcoins in 2013-2014.‚Äù As a result, speculations of no alts season have also prevailed across the sector.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Small crypto investments, starting at $250 in coins valued at $0.20, can potentially grow to $8,000 with high-return assets. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Changing real-world assets Floki Inu: A rising meme coin Conclusion One of the best ways to gain significantly in the crypto market is to invest money into several cryptocurrencies. Still, small investors can invest as little as $250 and get as much as $8000 by choosing coins with great potential for high returns. With the lowest coins value of $0.2, these could be the leading choices to boost $250 investment to $8000. Rexas Finance: Changing real-world assets Rexas Finance is creating waves with its creative approach to tokenizing real-world assets (RWA). The platform breaks down assets into fractional units. As a result, small investors can own assets that were once reserved for the wealthy. Such assets include real estate, intellectual property, and artworks. Rexas Finance‚Äôs main feature is the Rexas Token Builder, which allows users to tokenize their assets easily. Owners can convert their holdings into digital tokens representing fractional ownership, whether a small parcel of land or an art piece. For instance, if someone owns property and needs funds, they can tokenize part of it and sell shares to investors worldwide. This removes complex paperwork and democratizes asset ownership. Additionally, the Rexas Launchpad facilitates fundraising for tokenized assets. Assets owners can find investors on the platform, making it easy to raise funds. If they need capital to renovate a luxury apartment, they can offer fractional ownership through Launchpad. Investors gain a stake in high-value assets while they secure the resources they need. The platform also shines with Rexas Estate, changing real estate investment. Typically, owning real estate requires significant capital, but Rexas Estate enables fractional ownership via digital tokens. This makes investing in commercial buildings or luxury condos possible without needing millions. Furthermore, these tokens are tradeable, offering liquidity similar to stocks. Rexas Finance extends beyond tokenization with decentralized finance (DeFi) utilities, including staking and yield farming. RXS token holders can stake or provide liquidity, earning rewards over time. These features encourage long-term holding and allow users to grow their investments passively. Its presale phase has already been a huge success, and it is currently in its eleventh presale stage after selling over 408 million out of 425 million RXS tokens. It is trading at $0.175, and crypto experts speculate it will hit $8 after its launch ‚Äî about a 3,900% rise from its current price ‚Äî which is more than enough to turn $250 to $8000. You might also like: Rexas Finance the next Shiba Inu: Why $1000 could hit $50000 by mid-2025 Floki Inu: A rising meme coin Floki Inu is another coin under $0.2 with great potential to turn $250 into $800. Top analysts, including Master Kenobi, predict a significant rally for FLOKI this month. The coin currently sits at $0.0001650, and Kenobi identifies $0.00021 and $0.00028 as key levels to watch before it reaches its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00035. From there, FLOKI could skyrocket to $0.0011, offering a stunning significant return. Technical indicators and ecosystem updates back FLOKI‚Äôs momentum. Analysts like Bluntz note that the coin has completed an ABC correction, a bullish signal often triggering a five-wave upward trend. Furthermore, the coin mirrors PEPE ‚Äòs past price pattern, which saw a 588% gain in 2024. This historical similarity suggests FLOKI could follow suit, riding a delayed but powerful wave of market interest. FLOKI is also gaining momentum because of its ecosystem developments. Its flagship metaverse game, Valhalla, is set to launch soon. The game will introduce play-to-earn features that could drive user adoption. Additionally, FLOKI is on track to release an Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) on the SIX Swiss Exchange in Q1 2025, making it only the second meme coin after Dogecoin to achieve this milestone. This ETP is expected to attract institutional investors, further fueling price rallies. With FLOKI showing strong support levels and increasing mid-term holders, it is poised for a breakout. Whether through retail interest or ecosystem growth, this coin could transform small investments into substantial returns. Conclusion Rexas Finance and Floki Inu are two coins below $0.2 that have the potential to grow a $250 investment into $8,000. Rexas Finance stands out because it is a new cryptocurrency. It has the potential to surge after its launch and yield significant returns for early investors who adopt the coin.

This could benefit the price in the short term, although the long-term consequences could be severe. The greed phase suggests that long-term Bitcoin holders are now excessively optimistic about BTC‚Äôs future trajectory. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Officially Enter Into Greed Territory In an X post, Martinez stated that long-term Bitcoin holders, having experienced every phase of the market cycle, are now letting greed take over. In terms of market sentiment, these holders have moved from capitulation to hope, optimism, and then belief and are now in the greed phase. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash To $99,000, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs Supposed To Happen Next This excessive optimism typically leads these investors to accumulate more BTC impulsively without considering rational analyses. In the short term, this greed phase is bullish for the Bitcoin price since this market sentiment could spark more buying pressure and drive the flagship crypto higher. This buying pressure for Bitcoin already looks to be evident as on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that the number of wallets holding 100 to 1,000 BTC has broken an all-time high (ATH), rising to 15,777 wallets. The platform also mentioned that Bitcoin whales peaked up steam this week with the US inauguration and a new BTC ATH as transactions exceeding $100,00 surged to their highest level in six weeks. This greed phase is good for the BTC price, as it could continue to send the flagship crypto to new highs. However, in the long term, this excessive optimism could put BTC in overbought territory, eventually sparking a massive wave of sell-offs that would send the Bitcoin price tumbling. This greed phase among Bitcoin long-term holders looks to be sparked by optimism around Donald Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto administration and the strategic BTC reserve especially. This still poses a risk for the Bitcoin price since the flagship crypto could be trading well above its actual value if the BTC reserve isn‚Äôt eventually created. What Needs To Happen For BTC To Stay Bullish In another X post, Ali Martinez warned that the Bitcoin price needs to stay above $97,530 to remain bullish. According to him, this price level is the key support level to watch for BTC, as holding above it is crucial to maintaining the current bullish momentum. Bitcoin is currently consolidating around this range after hitting a new ATH of $109,000 earlier this week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims For $150,000-$170,000 With Wave Formation, Here Are The Details Meanwhile, crypto analyst Crypto Rover highlighted the $102,000 support area as the most important for the BTC price right now. His accompanying chart showed that the flagship crypto could drop to as low as $98,000 if it drops below this support level. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $104,900, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The CFPB alleges Capital One misled consumers into believing that its product known as ‚Äú360 Savings‚Äù was offering the best and the highest interest rates in the US. The CFPB, however, says Capital One kept the interest rates on the 360 Savings account low even as they were rising across the country. In the process, ‚ÄúCapital One avoided paying more than $2 billion in additional interest to millions of customers because of these actions.‚Äù While marketing the 360 Savings account as offering attractive rates, Capital One simultaneously launched a similarly named product that was promising significantly higher rates, according to the CFPB. ‚ÄúAround the same time, Capital One created a virtually identical product, ‚Äú360 Performance Savings,‚Äù that differed from 360 Savings only in that it paid out substantially more in interest‚Äîat one point more than 14 times the 360 Savings rate. Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts.‚Äù CFPB says that Capital One deliberately took steps to prevent 360 Savings account holders from finding out about the 360 Performance Savings account. ‚ÄúFor example, Capital One named and marketed the two products similarly; it eliminated nearly all references to the 360 Savings account product on its website and replaced them with references to the essentially identical 360 Performance Savings account, without notice that 360 Savings continued to exist as a distinct product; it excluded 360 Savings account holders from a marketing campaign advertising 360 Performance Savings to Capital One‚Äôs other existing customers; and it forbade its employees from proactively telling 360 Savings account holders about 360 Performance Savings.‚Äù The lawsuit seeks to stop Capital One‚Äôs alleged unlawful conduct and offer compensation to harmed consumers if successful. The financial regulator‚Äôs director, Rohit Chopra, says, ‚ÄúThe CFPB is suing Capital One for cheating families out of billions of dollars on their savings accounts. Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can‚Äôt live up to.‚Äù Capital One boasts a little over $483 billion in total assets as of September 30th of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve.

Holding firm above the critical $105,000 mark, the leading cryptocurrency is signaling its readiness to continue its upward trajectory. Despite the turbulence, Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to maintain this level has bolstered investor confidence, with many anticipating further gains in the days ahead. Renowned analyst Axel Adler recently shared compelling insights on X, highlighting Bitcoin‚Äôs remarkable performance over the past five years. According to Adler, BTC has significantly outperformed traditional resources such as gold and oil by approximately tenfold during this period. This exceptional growth underscores Bitcoin‚Äôs evolution as a premier asset class and its increasing appeal to investors seeking high returns and a hedge against traditional markets. As the broader market continues to navigate uncertainty, Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to hold and build on its current levels could be a defining factor in the coming weeks. With a proven track record of outperforming conventional assets, BTC is poised to remain at the forefront of the financial landscape. Investors and analysts alike are watching closely, ready to see if BTC can sustain its momentum and lead the market into another bullish phase. Bitcoin Establishes As A Global Asset Bitcoin has come a long way from its early days of skepticism and rejection to being widely recognized as a global asset. Over the past five years, its performance has outshined traditional resources such as gold and oil, achieving returns approximately ten times greater, according to insights shared by top analyst Axel Adler on X. This remarkable outperformance highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs growing appeal as a revolutionary financial asset. One of Bitcoin‚Äôs key advantages lies in its function as a digital store of value. Unlike traditional commodities, BTC has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it inherently scarce. Its ease of access‚Äîallowing investors to purchase in fractions rather than full units‚Äîhas further contributed to its popularity. Adler notes that younger generations, in particular, are drawn to BTC, favoring it over traditional assets like gold or oil for its transparency, liquidity, and growth potential. Adding to the bullish sentiment is the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration, which has introduced the ‚ÄúCrypto Capital‚Äù agenda aimed at supporting cryptocurrencies. This could create a favorable regulatory environment, fostering innovation and adoption in the industry. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory will also depend on the broader resilience of risk asset markets, especially in the face of macroeconomic and political challenges. As BTC continues to evolve, its position as a dominant financial asset becomes increasingly solidified, appealing to both seasoned and new investors. Price Action Details: BTC Pushing To New Highs Bitcoin has just navigated one of its most volatile weeks in recent months, with the price surging from $89,100 to a new all-time high of $109,300 in less than six days. This explosive rally showcased Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience and ability to rebound sharply after significant corrections. Since reaching its peak, the price has entered a sideways consolidation phase, holding strong above the crucial $105,000 support level. For bulls aiming to sustain the momentum, a decisive push above the all-time high‚Äîparticularly breaking through the $110,000 mark‚Äîis critical. Such a move would signal renewed strength and could pave the way for BTC to enter a new phase of price discovery, attracting more buying interest and setting the stage for further gains. On the flip side, losing the psychological $100,000 support level would likely result in increased selling pressure, extending Bitcoin‚Äôs consolidation phase. A breakdown below this level could see the price retesting lower support zones, challenging the bullish narrative in the short term. As the market awaits Bitcoin‚Äôs next move, investors are watching key levels closely. Whether BTC continues its rally or pauses for a longer consolidation, its ability to hold critical support zones will be pivotal in shaping its trajectory in the weeks ahead.

This change would permit an ‚Äúin-kind creation and redemption,‚Äù but only for a select group of Authorized Participants (APs), not for individual investors. What does it Mean? BlackRock Files For In-Kind Redemption On Jan 24, a Nasdaq submitted a filing on behalf of BlackRock seeking to permit a new redemption model for the IBIT ETF. This model would allow Authorized Participants (APs) but not individual investors to redeem their shares for actual Bitcoin rather than cash. NEW: BlackRock/iShares just filed to allow in-kind creation and redemption on their Bitcoin ETF $IBIT pic.twitter.com/Hy0tIEK81h ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 If the rule change is approved, it would mark a significant change in the way Bitcoin ETFs are managed, offering greater efficiency and cost savings for APs. Currently, the standard redemption model involves cash transactions, but this process often comes with added costs, including bid/ask spreads and broker commissions. The new in-kind redemption model would eliminate these costs, making it a more streamlined and efficient process for institutional investors involved in the ETF. Why The Change Required? Bloomberg‚Äôs Senior ETF Analyst, James Seyffart, expressed his views on the recent filing, stating that BlackRock‚Äôs request should have been granted from the start, especially when the IBIT launched in early 2024 alongside other Bitcoin ETFs. According to Seyffart, this model is not only more efficient but also better for the long-term performance of the ETF. Another key reason behind this proposed change is its potential tax benefits. Chris J. Terry, Chief Architect at Bitseeker Consulting, noted that in-kind redemptions help minimize capital gains distributions for ETFs. This article from @CryptoSlate is completely wrong. ""In Kind Redemptions"" have nothing to do with the end investor (ETF Buyer) it only affects the AP ""Authorized Participant"" whom is the middleman between the ETF issuer like Blackrock or Fidelity. You cannot cash out your IBIT‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Chris J Terry (@chrisjterry) January 24, 2025 By allowing shares to be exchanged for underlying assets, the fund becomes more tax-efficient, benefiting investors in the long run. BlackRock‚Äôs BTC ETF Outperforms Expectations The move could also reflect BlackRock‚Äôs growing dominance in the Bitcoin ETF space. Since the launch of IBIT, the fund has quickly surged past the $50 billion milestone in December 2024, and its holdings have now exceeded $60 billion. However, BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF is undoubtedly one of the most successful, and this new rule change could make it even more attractive to investors.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-25 06:08:50
