52767607,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=1415387,1759786626,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/52767607.jpeg,XRP and Solana ETFs: Wall Street Validation or Decentralization Death Sentence?,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-and-solana-etfs-wall-street-validation-or-decentralization-death-sentence/,"Wall Street’s push to approve altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this October, dubbed “Cointober” by some analysts, is drawing renewed attention to the growing institutional appetite for cryptocurrency. This has also raised questions about decentralization versus institutional validation. Cointober Frenzy According to Alphractal, 59% of institutional investors plan to allocate more than 5% of their assets under management to crypto in 2025, up sharply from less than 2% in 2023. This could represent a potential $2.4 trillion in capital flowing into digital assets. However, the data analytics platform warns that these ETFs may be legitimizing corporate-controlled tokens rather than democratizing access to decentralized networks. Analysis of major altcoins reveals a significant concentration of control. For instance, the platform found that Ripple Labs controls 45-51% of the total XRP supply, including 40-45% in escrow and 5-6% in treasury holdings. Meanwhile, Solana’s governance remains heavily influenced by Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation, with the Foundation holding around 40% of non-circulating tokens and venture capital firms and insiders controlling about 50%. Ethereum, though more distributed, remains guided by the Ethereum Foundation in terms of protocol development. Unlike Bitcoin, which operates without a central controlling entity, these altcoins maintain corporate governance structures that allow large holders to shape policy and influence network operations. Alphractal’s data, which has been taken from more than 1,000 on-chain, derivatives, and sentiment metrics, indicates institutional adoption closely aligns with these centralized control patterns. Their Network Stress Index and True Market Mean Price indicators show that these altcoin networks remain operationally stable despite concentrated governance. ETF approval timelines have also shortened from 240 to 75 days. This is potentially fast-tracking institutional validation for these centralized tokens. Alphractal argues that this process effectively converts access to corporate-controlled blockchain assets into a regulated investment vehicle, rather than offering true decentralized exposure. Its macroeconomic and derivatives analytics show institutions favor regulated exposure over direct ownership of native tokens. The broader debate, Alphractal observed, should be on whether ETF listings represent a legitimate step toward mainstream adoption or the erosion of decentralized principles. Control and Profit These concerns echo critiques of Vandell Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, who had previously offered a sharp critique of XRP ETFs. Earlier this year, Aljarrah warned investors against mistaking them for true access to crypto. He had emphasized that such ETFs are not designed to democratize ownership or unlock practical utility for investors. Instead, he framed them as instruments focused on control and profit. While holding native XRP allows participation in remittances, staking, liquidity provisioning, and other network functions, ETFs provide only price exposure, stripping investors of the ability to move, swap, or self-custody their tokens. Aljarrah’s argument highlighted a fundamental trade-off wherein investors may gain Wall Street-regulated exposure to XRP without ever truly engaging with the token’s functional utility.

This followed Sunday’s first break above $125,000, and by Monday, Bitcoin was already up by 4% on the session and more than 33% for the year, according to data from Reuters. This breakout comes alongside a weakening U.S. dollar, with Trump’s tariffs on American trade partners and uncertainty over their impact pushing investors to shift away from dollar-based assets. The dollar index sat flat at 98.09 on Monday but has fallen nearly 10% since January. This environment is helping crypto assets attract more buyers who are looking for alternatives. Anthony Pompliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, wrote on Monday, “Bitcoin is the hurdle rate. If you can’t beat it, you have to buy it. And I think the next 12 weeks are going to be very fun for bitcoin holders.” Traders raise bets on $140,000 as options, ETFs, and futures pile in The push to this new record began after Bitcoin briefly dipped under $110,000 just over a week ago. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in an email, “Bitcoin has surged ever since it briefly broke below $110,000 just over a week ago. The current rally means that Bitcoin has added around 13% since 28th September.” He also noted the daily MACD turned up sharply, which may show momentum is strong, but could also mean Bitcoin may need to consolidate before pushing further. Meanwhile, short-term Bitcoin options contracts settling at year-end are now clustered around the $140,000 strike price for calls on Deribit by Coinbase, while puts have also seen moderate increases as some players protect against a pullback, meaning traders are hedging even as they chase upside. Spot market inflows have been a core driver of the rally. Traders reported $3.2 billion poured into a group of 12 U.S. Bitcoin ETFs last week, the second-highest inflow since their 2024 debut. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF hit a record $49.8 billion in notional open interest on Friday, Bloomberg data showed. In the derivatives market, Bitcoin perpetual futures and term contracts have also surged. Open interest across crypto exchanges reached $75 billion, with offshore Binance and U.S.-based CME seeing the largest volumes, based on data from Amberdata. Many short positions were closed as the token trended higher, reflecting the scale of the rally. Low liquidations and Uptober momentum trigger rally in stocks too This rally is different from many in the past because liquidations remain limited, with only $283 million wiped from crypto bets in the past 24 hours, far lower than the nearly $2 billion lost in a single day in late September during a sharp price drop. That September event was one of the year’s biggest one-day liquidations, based on Coinglass data. Analysts see potential for more gains if macro conditions hold steady. “If all goes well around macro updates and data releases, we could see a prolonged run into the end of the year,” said Adam McCarthy, research analyst at Kaiko. October has historically been Bitcoin’s strongest month. Over the last decade, it has delivered average gains of 22.5%, Bloomberg data showed. Crypto traders call it “Uptober” for this reason. Other cryptos also moved on Monday. Ether rose about 5% to $4,700, while XRP edged just above $3. Gold joined the rally too, reaching a record above $3,900 per ounce, extending its months-long climb. Equities mirrored the crypto surge. The S&P 500 closed at 6,740.28, up 0.36%, while the Nasdaq Composite ended at 22,941.67, rising 0.71%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 63.31 points, or 0.14%, to close at 46,694.97, dragged by Sherwin-Williams and Home Depot. The Russell 2000 crossed 2,500 for the first time, closing at a record 2,486.36, up 0.4%. Get seen where it counts.

According to reports, this deal marks the largest enterprise deployment of the AI assistant to date and also deepens a relationship the two firms first established in 2024. The development also comes as consulting firms are turning to AI to enhance productivity and address the challenges of staff layoffs. This makes Deloitte a leader in AI adoption among its peers A CNBC report shows that the rollout puts Deloitte, a leading consulting, tax, and audit services provider, as the leader in AI adoption within the professional services industry. Deloitte makes up one of the 300,000 business customers that Anthropic has managed to attract since its inception four years ago. Although the financial terms of the agreement could not be clearly established, both firms emphasized the scale of their mutual commitment to the deal. “We are both investing a significant amount in this partnership, whether that’s financial or whether it is just simply the engineering resource that we’re going to put into this as well.” Anthropic’s chief commercial officer Paul Smith. Smith was speaking with CNBC in an interview . Over the next several months, Deloitte will build out and deploy different Claude “personas” for different groups of employees, ranging from accountants to software developers. To facilitate a smooth transition, staffers will get assistance from Deloitte’s Claude Center of Excellence, which is designed to help staff quickly benefit from the technology. Management at Deloitte views this development as essential for both enhancing productivity and building credibility with clients. According to Deloitte’s US chief strategy and technology officer Ranjit Bawa, first-hand experience with Claude will not only inspire employees but also help strengthen the firm’s advisory role. “Our clients obviously want to know: ‘Are you using it as well?’ So we can advise them better, we can be more credible.” Bawa. “That’s why we said we got to start with ourselves as we continue to have our clients reimagine their future,” added Bawa. The development also comes as businesses are increasingly turning to AI to optimize their operations. While consulting businesses are projected to be among the most affected by AI in terms of job replacements, management at Deloitte sees this as a way of enhancing productivity. The firm has long indicated its commitment to efficiency and effectiveness in talent management, optimizing its workforce through AI-driven skill assessments and redeployments, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan . The deployment aligns with Anthropic’s growth strategy This deployment, which will take place in more than 150 countries, aligns with Anthropic’s strategy to beef up its global presence. The AI start-up, backed by Amazon, revealed last month its plans to triple its international workforce this year. It brought a new executive, Chris Ciauri, to spearhead the expansion drive. This came after closing a massive $13 billion funding round, which placed its post-money valuation at $183 billion. The partnership with Deloitte comes at a time when the Amazon-backed AI startup has to keep pace with heavyweights like Google and ChatGPT maker OpenAI for enterprise customers. During the second quarter of this year, Anthropic released Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet 4, reportedly capable of analysing “thousands of data sources, execute long-running tasks,” as well as writing human-quality content, and touted its most powerful group of AI models as it set to compete with peers like Google. According to the AI startup, the models scored high on some popular benchmarks, showing that Opus 4 outperformed Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI’s o3 reasoning, and GPT-4.1 models in coding tasks and using “tools” like web search. Reflecting on the startup’s rapid growth, Smith said, “we’re still pretty busy,” adding that “but it’s a good busy.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Tech|Anthropic|Deloitte,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-06 21:45:25

After briefly spiking above $125,000 and retreating on Sunday, BTC followed through on Monday, surging to a fresh record of $126,223 during the U.S. trading session. BTC changed hands around $125,200 recently, up 1.5% over the past 24 hours. While the dollar's weakness has helped the rally to new highs, the largest crypto now has clinched to new highs in euro terms crossing 106,000 EUR and surpassing its January peak, while breaking its mid-August peak in Swiss franc (99,642 CHF), TradingView data shows. Bitcoin's strength extended across the crypto market. Ethereum's ether (ETH) advanced 4% to hit $4,700, its strongest price in more than three weeks, leading the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index higher. Popular memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) and the native token of layer-1 network BNB (BNB), closely linked to exchange giant Binance, gained 6%-6%. Crypto stocks posted mixed results on Monday, with retail trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) falling 3% after Galaxy Digital unveiled GalaxyOne , a new crypto trading platform that mirrors Robinhood’s core offering. The announcement sent Galaxy Digital (GLXY) shares up 7%, as investors bet on the firm’s move to compete directly in the crypto brokerage space. Elsewhere, crypto-linked companies including Coinbase (COIN), Circle (CRCL) and Michael Saylor’s parent company Strategy (MTSR) all closed roughly 2% higher. Their performance aligned with broader gains in the crypto market, where the CoinDesk 20 Index showed most cryptos saw modest upward moves. The biggest gains came from mining stocks, which surged on news that OpenAI struck a deal to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of AI chips from AMD. The deal could give OpenAI up to a 10% stake in the chipmaker, a move that sent ripples through other AI-exposed sectors. Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Cleanspark (CLSK) each gained around 10%, driven by optimism around data center demand and possibly boosted further by bitcoin’s rally earlier in the day. Perfect storm for BTC Bitcoin's rally is ""fueled by a perfect storm of macroeconomic tailwinds,"" said Jean-David Péquignot, CCO of Deribit, the options trading venue that was recently acquired by Coinbase (COIN). The U.S. government shutdown is driving debasement trades into perceived hard assets such as gold and BTC, strong inflows into BTC ETFs coupled with dwindling spot supplies on exchanges are feeding a ""self-reinforcing bull cycle,"" he said in a Monday update. The technicals also point higher, he added, with BTC's double-bottom breakout pointing to short-term targets of $128,000–$130,000, with possible upside to $138,000. However, he also warned of currently overbought conditions, suggesting that a brief shakeout to $118,000–$120,000 remains possible. ""From here, watch for volatility spikes and any shift in put volume as a red flag for near-term corrections,"" Péquignot said. ""Bulls have their eyes on $130K+, and bears might find opportunities in overbought squeezes.""",Markets|Market Wrap|Bitcoin|Deribit|Ether|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BNB|DOGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-06 21:58:24

SOL’s remarkable performance and accelerating use keep it firmly in the ranks of best altcoins to invest in, but while its thrilling rally continues, Mutuum Finance is fast stealing the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility-focused DeFi altcoin that rests at a tiny $0.035, has been the most talked-about coin of the year. With more than 60% of Stage 6 presale already full, more than 16,770 holders, and $16.85 million+ raised, the project can boom in growth, making it one of the top coins for investors seeking maximum upside in 2025. Solana Retests Key Support as Bulls Eye $295 Solana (SOL) is showing fresh strength in the markets, and the price is now retesting the Double Bottom neckline, a key technical level which has a habit of becoming new support after a breakout. If this support does hold and SOL bounces higher, analysts indicate that the altcoin stands a possibility to outperform Bitcoin over the coming weeks and even retest its former all-time highs around $295. This bullish scenario has turned Solana into one of the strongest plays on the market today, yet while SOL is poised to go on a huge rally, smart money is also watching emerging DeFi token Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could potentially yield much bigger returns. MUTM Presale Momentum Building MUTM tokens currently stand at $0.035 in Round 6 of Presale, which is a growth of 16.17% from the previous round. Investor interest is very high with over 16,770 investors already having made investment in excess of $16.85 million to date. The protocol has strong collateral management that safeguards participants and the network. There is unlimited collateral ratio, lending ability, and deposit ability that are some of the safety features that protect it. Real-time undercollateral remedy and fees and penalties stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized finance on three fundamental pillars: sustainability in the long term, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable lending and borrowing platform is institutionalizing DeFi for institutions and retail investors. Mutuum Finance Announces Launch of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has revealed developing their lending and borrowing protocol , yet again confirming its mission to bring more decentralized finance products. V1 is on its way to the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will feature prominent features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT are the first assets to be borrowed, lent, and served as collateral and the foundation of an active and healthy DeFi platform. Mutuum Finance recently introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program and white-hat developers and hackers are invited to report bugs. Four levels of bug severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, have been employed such that bugs can be detected and remediated in the initial stage. Efficiency is the very foundation of the Mutuum Finance mechanism. Optimizing Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and taking overcollateralized positions, the protocol utilizes all available capital with fearless guardians. Reserve requirements provide to serve as a buffer for risk in the market with reserves overlying to borrow against riskier holdings to hedge risk. MUTM Emerges as 2025’s Largest DeFi Opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as one of the most promising altcoins in 2025, boasting a convincing combination of low price, practicality, and potential for expansion. Stage 6 presale is already more than 60% sold out, courtesy of over 16,770 buyers and in excess of $16.85 million raised, indicators of increasing demand. With its imminent release of lending and borrowing protocol, dynamic collateral management, and multi-layered security features, MUTM is setting the foundation for a scalable next-gen DeFi network. With Solana (SOL) striving to hit new highs, MUTM offers early investors the chance to reap rewards from significantly more leverage.

After weeks of sideways movement, bulls have reclaimed control, pushing BTC into a critical zone where a clean breakout above $125K could mark the start of a new price discovery phase. However, not all signals are equally bullish. A recent report from CryptoQuant sheds light on growing caution among large holders. The firm’s Total Whale Holdings metric tracks the 30-day percentage change in Bitcoin held by whales, offering a direct view into their accumulation or distribution activity. Currently, the indicator is showing negative values, signaling that whales have been actively reducing their positions throughout September 2025. This decline in whale balances suggests that while retail and institutional inflows have driven price gains, smart money is locking in profits after months of upward momentum. The combination of strong technical structure and shifting onchain data presents a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. Bulls must sustain pressure above key resistance levels to invalidate the risk of a deeper correction — and confirm that this rally is more than just a temporary spike in optimism. Whales Show Signs of Exhaustion Top analyst Burak Kesmeci shared new insights on Bitcoin’s current onchain dynamics, pointing to a potential shift in whale behavior that could shape the market’s next major move. According to Kesmeci, the red zone on the chart clearly illustrates a 30-day downtrend in whale holdings, confirming that large investors have sold a significant amount of Bitcoin over the past month. This sustained selling pressure coincided with Bitcoin’s earlier struggles to hold above $120,000, contributing to volatility and short-term uncertainty. However, despite this wave of distribution, one key observation stands out: as prices have stabilized near record highs, whales have noticeably slowed their selling pace. The narrowing purple area in the indicator marks a gradual recovery from the negative zone, signaling that the most intense phase of selling may now be behind us. Kesmeci concludes that whales have been net sellers for nearly a month, but in the first days of October, this trend has clearly eased. This behavior could suggest the beginning of a re-accumulation phase, where large holders start building positions again at slightly lower levels. In short, Bitcoin’s biggest investors appear to be approaching selling exhaustion, which may support a short-term uptrend as long as the data remains stable. If this pattern continues, it would strengthen the bullish outlook and potentially pave the way for a clean breakout above $125,000, confirming Bitcoin’s next leg higher into uncharted territory. Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance: Price Tests All-Time Highs Bitcoin continues to show remarkable strength after reclaiming the $120,000 level and now trades around $124,000, just below its all-time high near $125,000. The chart reveals a clear breakout above the $117,500 resistance, which has now flipped into strong support — a pivotal level that has capped price advances multiple times since mid-August. The 50-day moving average (blue line) has crossed above the 200-day (red line), confirming a bullish structure. Momentum remains in favor of the bulls, supported by higher lows since late September. However, Bitcoin is currently consolidating near its previous peak, signaling a potential short-term pause before the next move. If BTC manages to close above $125,000 with strong volume, it would likely confirm a breakout into price discovery, potentially opening the door to the $130,000–$135,000 range. On the downside, failure to hold above $122,000 could trigger a pullback toward $118,000, where buyers previously stepped in aggressively. The market structure remains healthy, and with bulls firmly in control, the next few sessions will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin can sustain its parabolic advance or faces a temporary correction before resuming its upward trend.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. paused new buys after a $3.9 billion profit, while Japan’s new pro-growth leadership and U.S. shutdown fears are fueling safe-haven inflows. As noted in my previous forecast, Bitcoin’s chart targets $128K–$130K next, with the structure hinting at a potential move toward $160K ahead. Saylor Pauses Bitcoin Purchases After $3.9B Q3 Gain Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy Inc., reported an unrealized profit of $3.9 billion from its Bitcoin holdings in the third quarter of 2025. Despite this record gain, Saylor announced that the firm would pause new Bitcoin purchases, a rare move for a company known for buying during market strength. Strategy now holds 640,031 BTC at an average cost below $74,000, with its total value exceeding $79 billion. In a post on X , Saylor stated that total profits — including the gains from October — have surpassed $9 billion.

The decision underscores Strategy’s disciplined approach, while its massive Bitcoin profits continue to reinforce long-term confidence in BTC’s future. Wall Street Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Surge Despite U.S. Shutdown Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $125,559 on October 5, doubling in value over the past year even as the U.S. government shutdown continues. The milestone highlights strong investor confidence in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin hits record highs amid prolonged US government shutdown. Analysts predict the rally may continue. The Reuters World News podcast has the latest: https://t.co/xLToa18AIn pic.twitter.com/RkL13RhZjY — Reuters (@Reuters) October 6, 2025 According to Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered, Bitcoin could climb to $135,000 soon and possibly $200,000 by year-end. He attributes the rally to surging inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, which may attract up to $20 billion in new investments. Kendrick said the shutdown is driving investors toward Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, replacing traditional markets shaken by uncertainty. Analysts believe this shift in sentiment could sustain BTC’s momentum and push it to fresh record highs in the months ahead. Japan’s New Prime Minister Sparks Optimism in Crypto Markets Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, has boosted optimism across cryptocurrency and financial markets. Her election sent the Nikkei index up 5%, reaching a new high as investors welcomed her pro-growth and low-interest policies. Sanae Takaichi’s election as the new leader of the Liberal Democratic Party has changed the dynamics among opposition parties regarding whom the ruling LDP-Komeito bloc will join forces with. https://t.co/aRDa7kWXml — The Japan News (@The_Japan_News) October 6, 2025 Known as Japan’s “Iron Lady,” Takaichi has long championed tax incentives, innovation, and digital asset adoption. As a former minister, she even supported allowing cryptocurrency donations to politicians, signaling her progressive stance on blockchain technology. Analysts believe her leadership could bring clearer crypto regulations and attract more Japanese investors to assets like Bitcoin. With BTC already trading above $125,400, expectations surrounding Japan’s pro-growth government may strengthen demand and further drive prices higher amid global economic uncertainty. Bitcoin Technical Analysis – Bearish Butterfly Nears Completion Zone As discussed in my previous forecast , Bitcoin is consolidating near $125,200, showing strength after its breakout from the $118,000 zone. The broader trend remains bullish, guided by an ascending channel that continues to define October’s momentum. Bitcoin is now approaching the upper boundary of a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern , with the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) projected between $128,000 and $130,000. On the 4-hour chart, BTC maintains higher lows and trades well above both the 50-SMA ($119,012) and the 100-SMA ($115,740), confirming trend continuation. The RSI near 70 suggests mildly overbought conditions, indicating that while momentum has cooled, buyers still hold the upper hand. If Bitcoin holds above $124,600, it could extend toward $130,000, completing the harmonic structure. Failure to sustain above $121,100 could invite a retest of $118,500. For now, the bias remains bullish — with the structure hinting that Bitcoin’s next expansion phase could target $160,000 in the months ahead.

Excitement is building as several major asset managers await final approval for their Solana spot ETF applications, with October 10 marked as the big day. If greenlit, these ETFs could open the floodgates for traditional finance (TradFi) to invest in SOL, potentially triggering the next major leg up in its price. Big week — Solana (@solana) October 5, 2025 Traditional markets are already showing a strong appetite, with the REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) closing the week up 20% with $406.6 million in assets under management. Spot Solana ETF assets under management. Source: TheBlock . This accumulation comes as the Solana ecosystem posts exponential growth, leading blockchain revenues for the fourth consecutive quarter, with $222 million generated in Q3. The surge in adoption is most evident in stablecoins. According to DeFi Llama , the total stablecoin supply hit a record $15 billion, nearly triple its year-to-date low, underscoring deepening ecosystem liquidity and demand. Yet despite this explosive growth, Solana’s spot price remains below its all-time highs, suggesting the asset may still be undervalued. Solana Price Prediction: Could Fresh Demand Bridge The Gap Deeper exposure in U.S. TradFi Markets could position Solana to realise a 6-month ascending wedge pattern, now nearing its apex. The Solana price is targeting the key breakout threshold at $300, with momentum indicators turning decisively bullish. SOL / USD 1-day chart, rising wedge pattern nears apex. Source: TradingView. The RSI has secured a strong footing at 57 and rising, signalling firm buy pressure behind the move. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram widens its gap above the singal line, confirming a lasting uptrend. The MACD histogram also widens its lead above the signal line, confirming a lasting golden cross and an uptrend with real staying power. A successful flip of $300 into support would validate a push into new price discovery targeting, a 115% move to $500 . But with U.S. interest rate cuts expected to stimulate risk appetite, ETFs could see the Solana price extend 320% to $1,000 before year-end . Longer term, the $300 breakout also completes a multi-year cup-and-handle pattern, setting the stage for a potential 3,800% move to $8,000 over the coming years. Tired of Waiting for the Next Big Breakout? Here’s How to Earn in the Meantime For top altcoins like Solana, major breakouts can take months or even years of buildup before they finally deliver. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) flips that script. As the first mine-to-earn meme coin, it turns missed opportunities into consistent, passive rewards. Crypto mining no longer needs costly gear or technical know-how. PepeNode transforms it all into a simple, gamified process that anyone can join. Presale buyers can already purchase nodes, stack rigs, and start earning rewards across meme coins before the official launch. A built-in deflationary model keeps value strong. Every $PEPENODE spent on rigs or nodes triggers a 70% burn, driving scarcity and amplifying long-term returns. Momentum is accelerating. The presale has already exceeded $1.7 million, while early stakers are still locking in a 760% APY. Join the $PEPENODE presale now on the official website to start mining.

The firm has officially completed the acquisition of Oasis Pro, gaining a full suite of SEC-registered digital asset licenses, including a broker-dealer, alternative trading system (ATS), and transfer agent (TA). This gives Ondo the most comprehensive set of digital asset registrations in the U.S., setting a new precedent for regulated blockchain infrastructure. According to CoinMarketCap, $ONDO trades around $0.97, up 6.4% in the past 24 hours as the market reacts to the news. Ondo’s Full Regulatory Stack The acquisition hands Ondo a powerful regulatory toolkit, one that enables it to operate at the intersection of crypto and capital markets. With the Oasis Pro licenses now under its umbrella, Ondo can: Develop regulated markets for tokenized securities Power real-world asset (RWA) tokenization at scale Facilitate primary and secondary trading of digital assets Engage in capital markets operations such as private placements, underwriting, and M&A advisory This combination positions Ondo Finance as a first-of-its-kind bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-native markets. Why This Matters For years, the biggest barrier to institutional adoption in tokenized assets has been regulation. Most blockchain platforms lacked the required SEC registrations to handle securities in a compliant way. By acquiring Oasis Pro, Ondo now checks every box, legally and technically. It means tokenized Treasury bills, corporate debt, real estate assets, or private equity stakes can all exist within one compliant system. It’s a milestone that makes tokenized finance more accessible to U.S. investors. 1/ Ondo Finance has completed its purchase of Oasis Pro, including its SEC-registered digital assets broker-dealer, alternative trading system (ATS), and transfer agent (TA) licenses. This provides the Ondo Finance group with the most comprehensive set of SEC registrations for… pic.twitter.com/vaLjJZ5QAv — Ondo Finance (@OndoFinance) October 6, 2025 The Strategic Edge Oasis Pro isn’t just a licensing play. It’s a full digital asset infrastructure provider. The platform includes tools for: Tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) Managing capitalization tables and ownership through a transfer agent license Running primary issuance marketplaces for new digital securities Operating a multi-asset secondary trading system for tokenized equities, debt, and funds This stack allows Ondo to manage the entire lifecycle of a digital security, from creation and issuance to trading and settlement. Ondo’s Broader Vision Ondo Finance has made its mission clear, build the foundation for regulated tokenized markets at scale. It’s not just launching financial products. It’s creating infrastructure for a new financial era. With this acquisition, Ondo moves beyond being a DeFi project into becoming a regulated global platform for real-world asset tokenization. This aligns with the firm’s long-term vision: connecting institutional-grade finance with blockchain transparency and efficiency. The Market Opportunity The tokenized securities market is projected to hit $18 trillion by 2033, according to industry forecasts. Ondo now stands in prime position to capture a significant slice of that market. The combination of SEC-approved licenses, real-world asset infrastructure, and tokenization expertise gives Ondo a clear head start. Traditional banks and asset managers are still exploring how to tokenize their offerings, Ondo already has the tools and compliance framework to execute. Primary and Secondary Market Expansion With Oasis Pro’s regulatory permissions, Ondo can now conduct primary offerings and secondary trading of both traditional and tokenized securities. This includes: Traditional NMS securities Tokenized OTC equities Corporate debt Closed-end mutual funds REITs and structured products Mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS) Privately placed securities Essentially, Ondo can tokenize, issue, and trade assets that were once restricted to institutional or accredited investors, in a fully compliant digital format. Why Regulation Is the Differentiator While many DeFi and tokenization platforms emphasize innovation, few meet U.S. regulatory standards. Ondo’s acquisition of Oasis Pro changes that narrative. Having SEC-registered entities gives Ondo a unique advantage. It can now serve both institutional clients and retail investors who demand regulatory clarity. It also allows the firm to work directly with banks, asset managers, and other traditional finance players who have been hesitant to enter DeFi due to compliance concerns. Bridging Traditional and Digital Capital Markets Ondo’s goal is straightforward, bring real-world capital markets onto the blockchain without breaking existing laws. Through Oasis Pro’s infrastructure, Ondo gains: Full compliance capabilities A regulated alternative trading system for digital assets Transfer agent services for ownership tracking A framework for corporate finance operations That’s the same foundation that underpins major Wall Street institutions, now adapted for tokenized assets. Community and Market Reaction The crypto community is taking notice @OndoFinance announced the acquisition on X, calling it “a step toward building the infrastructure for the next era of global finance.” Investors are responding positively. $ONDO saw a noticeable uptick in trading volume, with whale accumulation patterns forming across major exchanges. The market clearly views this acquisition as a signal of maturity and expansion, not speculation. What’s Next for Ondo With the acquisition finalized, Ondo’s focus now shifts to integrating Oasis Pro’s technology and launching new tokenized financial products for U.S. investors. Expect to see tokenized versions of Treasuries, real estate, and corporate bonds under Ondo’s regulated umbrella. The company is also likely to introduce secondary market features, allowing users to trade tokenized assets in compliance with U.S. securities laws. As regulatory clarity improves, Ondo could become a central player in the new wave of compliant DeFi, where transparency meets legal certainty. Ondo Finance’s acquisition of Oasis Pro isn’t just another crypto deal, it’s a landmark step for the entire digital asset industry. With SEC-registered broker-dealer, ATS, and transfer agent licenses in hand, Ondo now owns the infrastructure needed to run regulated tokenized markets end-to-end. It’s a bold bet on the future of finance, one where real-world assets, tokenized securities, and blockchain efficiency converge under one regulated framework. As the tokenized securities market races toward an $18 trillion valuation, Ondo’s timing couldn’t be better. The company is no longer just building DeFi tools, it’s building the financial rails for the next generation of global markets. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The firm has officially launched the first-ever U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded products (ETPs) to enable staking for Ethereum ($ETH) and Solana ($SOL), marking a historic moment for the industry. According to the official announcement from @Grayscale, both Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (Ticker: $ETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (Ticker: $ETHE) are now live with staking capabilities, allowing investors to earn rewards directly through regulated, spot-backed investment products. Today, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (Ticker: $ETH ) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (Ticker: $ETHE ) have become the first U.S.-listed spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETP) to enable staking, another first-mover milestone for the firm. Grayscale Solana Trust (OTCQX:… pic.twitter.com/45963Bn9UW — Grayscale (@Grayscale) October 6, 2025 Ethereum and Solana Enter a New Era of Onchain Yield Access For the first time, U.S. investors can now gain exposure to staking rewards, a feature long limited to onchain participants, without leaving traditional financial infrastructure. With the launch of Grayscale’s spot Ethereum ETPs, investors can participate in Ethereum’s consensus layer through a product listed on regulated exchanges. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust ETF ($ETH) and Ethereum Trust ETF ($ETHE) are designed to track the spot price of ETH while distributing staking yield generated from the underlying assets. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum ($ETH) is trading around $4696, up 4% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of over $567 billion. Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) Activates Staking In parallel, Grayscale’s Solana Trust (OTCQX: $GSOL) has also enabled staking. This marks another major step forward for institutional access to Solana’s network economy. Pending regulatory approval for its uplisting to an ETP, GSOL could become one of the first-ever spot Solana ETPs to offer staking rewards. This would allow investors to gain passive income exposure from Solana’s proof-of-stake network, without directly managing private keys or tokens. Data from CoinMarketCap shows Solana ($SOL) trading at $236.28, up 3% over the past day, making it one of the market’s top-performing assets as investor interest continues to grow. Why This Matters: Traditional Meets Onchain By introducing staking to spot-backed ETPs, Grayscale bridges two previously separate worlds, traditional finance and decentralized onchain yield. Investors can now hold regulated, custodial shares that not only track crypto prices but also earn staking rewards, creating a hybrid investment model that merges passive yield with spot exposure. Grayscale’s CEO said this innovation gives investors a more complete Ethereum and Solana experience, capturing both price appreciation and network participation. The move underscores a growing trend: institutional investors want access to blockchain yield without operational complexity. A First for the U.S. Market This milestone cements Grayscale’s position as an innovation leader among crypto asset managers. While several global issuers have launched staking-enabled products in Europe, this is the first time U.S.-listed ETPs have integrated staking directly into spot-backed offerings. It’s a regulatory breakthrough that could pave the way for other asset managers, including firms like BlackRock or Fidelity, to explore similar integrations across Bitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum-based instruments. What Staking Means for Investors With Grayscale’s ETPs, investors don’t have to move their assets onchain or interact with validators. Instead, staking is handled natively within the product’s infrastructure, with rewards reflected in the value of the fund. For example: Investors in Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF ($ETH) will now indirectly earn staking rewards as part of fund operations. Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF ($ETHE) follows the same mechanism, offering onchain yield exposure under regulated conditions. Once approved, Grayscale Solana Trust ($GSOL) will offer similar benefits for Solana investors. This design introduces yield-driven performance to products that previously offered only price-tracking exposure. ETH and SOL Price Action Reflects Renewed Confidence Market sentiment quickly turned positive following the announcement. Ethereum’s price held steady above $4,000, maintaining its weekly momentum after reclaiming key technical support levels. Solana, meanwhile, continues to outperform, now holding above $200, fueled by rising DeFi activity and growing institutional interest. Analysts believe Grayscale’s staking integration could trigger a new wave of institutional inflows into both networks. The addition of staking yield may appeal to traditional investors seeking income-generating digital assets. The Broader Industry Impact Grayscale’s move may set a precedent for other U.S. crypto funds. By combining staking with spot exposure, the firm has created a model that could reshape how digital assets are packaged and distributed in traditional markets. Until now, staking yields were largely inaccessible to ETF investors. But with Grayscale’s structure, regulators have a working example of how staking rewards can coexist within SEC-compliant frameworks. This could open the door for: Bitcoin yield-based products (via ordinals or layer-2 rewards) Multi-chain staking ETPs Institutional DeFi yield aggregators The ripple effect may redefine how digital assets are integrated into mainstream portfolios. Bringing Onchain Yield to Wall Street The timing of this development is critical. As the next bull cycle gains traction, the demand for yield-bearing assets is growing. Grayscale’s staking-enabled ETPs give investors exposure not just to crypto price movements, but to the economic activity of the networks themselves. By holding these products, investors indirectly participate in securing the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, earning rewards for doing so, all through traditional investment channels. This marks a major psychological and structural shift in how Wall Street views crypto utility. Further Considerations Pending regulatory approval for GSOL’s uplisting, Solana could soon join Ethereum as a fully recognized staking-enabled ETP in the U.S. market. If successful, it would mark the first time two major proof-of-stake assets are fully represented through regulated, yield-generating instruments. Grayscale’s expansion also signals a new phase for crypto ETFs, one where tokens are not just assets to hold, but networks to participate in. With Ethereum and Solana staking now integrated into U.S.-listed ETPs, Grayscale has set a new standard for digital asset management. This milestone proves that onchain yield and traditional finance can coexist, offering investors the best of both worlds, regulatory clarity and decentralized participation. As Ethereum and Solana continue to grow, these new staking-enabled ETPs could become the blueprint for the next generation of digital asset investment products.

Just yesterday, Bitcoin set a new all-time high (ATH) of $125,506, its first since August. Yet, even as BTC dominates headlines, smart capital is pouring into altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already logged new record highs this year. Two landmark policy moves from Washington have reshaped the crypto landscape. First, President Trump’s GENIUS Act, the nation’s first legislative framework recognizing and regulating stablecoins, has provided needed clarity for stablecoin issuers and users alike. Shortly after, the SEC’s Project Crypto initiative rolled out, marking an ambitious modernization of securities regulations for digital assets. The result? A powerful signal that institutional adoption is officially entering the next phase. With market optimism accelerating, coins like XRP, Binance Coin, and Zcash are rapidly emerging as leading choices for traders seeking the next explosive breakout. Ripple ($XRP): Best Cross-Border Payments Crypto and Biggest Altcoin of 2025 Shortly after winning a five-year-long legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) surged to its first new high in seven years. It hit $3.65 on July 18, though it has since cooled 18% to around $2.99. Most altcoiners believe it’s primed to blow sky high.. XRP’s strength lies in its ultra-fast, low-cost network for international settlements, making it a serious challenger to legacy systems like SWIFT. Strategic collaborations, including with the UN Capital Development Fund and a growing number of U.S. financial institutions, continue to bolster its real-world adoption. Ripple’s rising prominence was further underscored when CEO Brad Garlinghouse participated in a White House crypto policy forum earlier this year. Meanwhile, the company’s launch of RLUSD, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, underscores its intention to capture a significant share of the multi-trillion-dollar stablecoin market. In the past 12 months, XRP has soared 462%, nearly quintupling Bitcoin’s 100% gain. After a robust summer breakout, it has been consolidating near the $3 mark during its typical September correction phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around 54, suggesting slowly growing buying momentum as traders await clear bull signals before piling in. Recent catalysts such as interest rate cuts and approval of the first spot XRP ETF, didn’t trigger an instant surge (likely because they were priced in), however markets are anticipating a possible breakout thanks to the appearance of two bull flags in XRP’s price chart over the summer. With more ETF rulings expected mid-October, analysts see potential targets between $5 and $10, or even higher. Binance Coin Surges as Rest of Market Trades Sideways Binance Coin ($BNB) has evolved from a simple exchange token into one of the most influential assets in the crypto ecosystem. Launched in 2017 by the Binance exchange, BNB initially offered traders discounted fees on the platform. Today, it underpins a vast network of products and services across the BNB Chain, a blockchain ecosystem that powers decentralized applications (dApps), NFT marketplaces, and more. BNB serves multiple purposes: it’s used to pay trading fees, participate in token sales, settle transaction costs on the BNB Smart Chain, and engage in staking and governance activities. Its deflationary model, driven by Binance’s regular token “burns,” reduces supply over time and aims to enhance long-term value. Beyond Binance itself, BNB has gained traction across the broader crypto economy, accepted by merchants, travel platforms, and gaming applications worldwide. This growing utility, combined with Binance’s global dominance and the BNB Chain’s expanding developer ecosystem, has helped position BNB as a top-five cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Binance set a new ATH today. It hit $1,221 in the early hours of GMT and appears to still be trading near the ATH. It appears to be breaking out of a bullish pennant that formed across its support and resistance lines through spring this year. Should it continue, a run to $2,000 is conceivable. However, in a bear scenario, BNB is likely to enjoy strong support at the psychologically significant $1,000 level. Zcash ($ZEC): Privacy-Centric Crypto Rockets 147% in a Week Zcash ($ZEC) , launched in 2016 as a Bitcoin fork, is built around one principle: financial privacy. Unlike Bitcoin’s transparent ledger, Zcash integrates advanced cryptography known as zk-SNARKs, short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, enabling transaction validation without disclosing sensitive details such as sender, recipient, or transaction amount. The platform’s dual-address system lets users choose between transparent, Bitcoin-style addresses and fully shielded ones. This flexible design allows optional transparency for compliance or auditing while preserving confidentiality elsewhere. Over the past week, ZEC has surged 147%, now trading near $165, as renewed enthusiasm for privacy coins sweeps through the broader “Uptober” rally. Other privacy projects like Dash ($DASH) and Verge ($XVG) rallied over 50% gains over the same period. That said, with an RSI reading of 89, Zcash appears heavily overbought and may correct below $100 in the short term. Still, bullish traders are eyeing a potential push toward $300 as Christmas approaches. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme-Driven Bitcoin Layer-2 and One of 2025’s Most Anticipated Presales Beyond established coins, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is gaining buzz across the presale market as one of 2025’s most promising new projects. It fuses Bitcoin’s battle-tested security model with Layer-2 scalability while leveraging the viral power of meme culture and community-led governance. The project’s goal is to extend Bitcoin’s utility, enabling faster payments, smart contracts, and decentralized governance through its Layer-2 ecosystem. To date, the presale has raised over $21 million, with analysts predicting potential 10× or higher returns once the token officially launches.

52769152,https://cryptonews.com/?p=433429,1759789800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52769152.jpeg,"New ChatGPT Predicts Explosive Rallies for XRP, Solana and Litecoin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/new-chatgpt-predicts-explosive-rallies-for-xrp-solana-and-litecoin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"The latest v5.0 release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the internet’s AI powerhouse, predicts that XRP, Solana, and Litecoin are all on the verge of clocking in surprising new highs. Bitcoin, the $2.5 trillion cap anchor of the cryptocurrency market, currently trades about 1% below its new record high of $125,506, set yesterday. The rest of crypto’s $4.33 trillion market took a nominal 0.6% dip to consolidate after several coins clocked new ATHs simultaneously. Historically, October, nicknamed “Uptober”, has been a strong month for Bitcoin and crypto in general, often setting the stage for rallies across the broader digital asset space. Recent US policy initiatives are adding fuel to the bullish momentum. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the country’s first national law mandating full reserve backing for stablecoins. Shortly after, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, an initiative designed to modernize securities laws for the blockchain era. With regulation becoming clearer, analysts are anticipating that the next altcoin bull phase could eclipse the mania of 2021. If ChatGPT’s analysis proves accurate, XRP, Solana, and Litecoin could lead the charge. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Predicts $10 to $20 Price Level According to ChatGPT’s latest outlook, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb to $10 (or even $20 in extreme conditions) by the end of 2025, which would give current holders and recent buyers at least 3x to 6x returns from XRP’s current price around $2.99. Source: ChatGPT The asset has already displayed resilience this year, reaching $3.65 on July 18, its highest level since the 2018 peak of $3.40, before retracing about 18% due to shifting macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Ripple continues to expand its payment ecosystem, driving institutional adoption worldwide. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund recognized XRP as a low-cost remittance solution for developing economies. ChatGPT suggests that if XRP can break decisively above its July high, it could rise to between $5 and $10 by year-end, and under more bullish conditions, potentially even hit $20. Over the past 12 months, XRP has rallied 462% which makes it the best of the big three unbacked cryptocurrencies. In contrast, Bitcoin rose a perfectly respectable 100% and Ethereum added 88.5%. Technical analysis also shows three bullish flag formations throughout 2025, with two occurring over the summer, signaling breakout potential into Q4. While last month’s Fed rate cuts and the first spot XRP ETF launch didn’t immediately spark a breakout, analysts expect Uptober enthusiasm, further ETF approvals, and upcoming U.S. crypto legislation by Christmas could provide major catalysts. Solana (SOL): ChatGPT Predicts Breakout above $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has cemented its reputation as one of the leading smart contract platforms, boasting a market cap above $127 billion and over $12.8 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its ecosystem. Developer participation and institutional involvement continue to expand rapidly. Speculation is growing around a potential spot Solana ETF approval this month in the United States, a move that could attract similar capital inflows to those seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Additionally, Solana is likely to continue gaining market share as a prime candidate for explosive gains when real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and stablecoins take off. This is because it’s faster and cheaper than its biggest rival, Ethereum Adding significant intrigue, President Trump also recently suggested including Solana in a proposed U.S. Bitcoin reserve, though, under his concept, any SOL holdings would be obtained via seized assets, not direct government purchases. Still, it indicates SOL is high on the White House’s watchlist. Price-wise, Solana hit $250 in January, dipped to $100 in April, and rallied back to $247 on September 19, nearly reclaiming its yearly high. Currently trading around $232, SOL appears poised for another leg up. With the token now breaking out of a bullish flag pattern, ChatGPT predicts a potential surge to four digits that could max out at $1,500 by year-end, over five times its previous all-time high of $293.31. This projection, however, hinges on continued regulatory progress and ETF approval momentum. Litecoin (LTC): Classic Crypto Poised for a New All-Time High Litecoin (LTC) , launched in 2011 by former Google engineer Charlie Lee, was designed as a faster, cheaper alternative to Bitcoin. Often described as “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s “digital gold,” Litecoin processes transactions significantly faster and with lower fees. Its use of the Scrypt hashing algorithm made mining more accessible to everyday users, while its 2.5-minute block times, four times quicker than Bitcoin’s, helped cement its role in peer-to-peer payments. ChatGPT anticipates that Litecoin could soar to $250 by 2026, representing an easy doubling from its current price levels around $120. Unlike most cryptos that mirrored Bitcoin’s slump from late 2024 to early 2025, Litecoin maintained a solid footing, repeatedly testing resistance at $140 while holding strong support at $100. If the broader market turns decisively bullish, LTC could easily surpass those barriers and reach $200 to $250 by festive season. Although overshadowed by newer tokens, Litecoin remains one of the oldest, most reliable payments-focused altcoins, widely supported by merchants and payment platforms globally. Its simplicity, efficiency, and trustworthiness continue to anchor its value in the evolving digital economy. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin with Community Hype While ChatGPT’s data-driven analysis favors established altcoins, another project drawing attention is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a grassroots meme coin movement that brands itself as Dogecoin’s wild, gym-obsessed degen cousin. Its narrative appeals to traders who thrive on high volatility and community-fueled speculation. Unlike Dogecoin, which has evolved into a major-cap asset, Maxi Doge fully embraces its high-risk, degen identity. Since its launch a few weeks ago, it has raised over $2.7 million. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI drives engagement through Telegram and Discord communities, trading contests, and upcoming collaborations. Out of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% are allocated to a dedicated “Maxi Fund” for marketing and partnerships. Staking is already active, offering returns up to 122% APY, though yields are expected to taper as participation increases. At present, presale tokens are available for $0.000261, with subsequent rounds set at higher prices. Investors can participate through the Maxi Doge website using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

52769157,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=179255,1759789816,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/52769157.jpeg,Crypto Market Hits $4.2 Trillion as Retail Investors Discover New Opportunities,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/crypto-market-hits-4-2-trillion-as-retail-investors-discover-new-opportunities/,"The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has officially crossed $4.2 trillion , reaching its highest level since late 2021. Bitcoin’s climb to $123,000 and Ethereum’s advance beyond $4,500 have helped lift the entire market, but this rally goes far beyond the major coins. Altcoins, presales, and community-driven projects are now fueling a new wave of momentum that many analysts are calling the start of a “retail-driven bull phase.” While institutional money continues to flow into Bitcoin ETFs and large-cap tokens, it is retail investors who are making the most noise. Online trading communities and social platforms are buzzing with renewed enthusiasm for small-cap gems and new presale tokens – especially one project that has captured widespread attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could outperform most top cryptocurrencies this cycle. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead, But Altcoins Drive the Excitement Bitcoin remains the dominant force behind the latest market upswing, holding steady near $123,000 and absorbing strong ETF inflows. Ethereum has also gained momentum, trading at $4,520 and approaching a possible breakout toward $4,800 as developers finalize the Fusaka upgrade. Together, BTC and ETH continue to provide the foundation for market stability. But what’s happening underneath the surface is what really defines this stage of the cycle. The Altcoin Season Index has risen to 77 out of 100, signaling that traders are increasingly shifting their focus from major assets to high-upside alternatives. Tokens like Solana, XRP, and Cardano have all posted double-digit gains in recent weeks, while several mid-cap projects are seeing record trading volumes. Analysts suggest that the growing confidence in the market’s recovery is pushing investors to take on more risk. Retail traders, in particular, are using this window to accumulate smaller coins before the next major rally begins. Presales Take Center Stage Presale markets have become one of the biggest stories of 2025. With established tokens nearing their previous highs, investors are turning to early-stage projects where the potential returns are far higher. The number of active presales tracked by market data firms has tripled compared to six months ago, with global participation levels at an all-time high. The psychology behind this trend is simple: investors want exposure to the next breakout before it becomes mainstream. Early access and limited supply give presale participants the advantage of multiplying gains before tokens hit exchanges. That formula has already produced some of the most successful stories in recent crypto history. Among the current wave of presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader in both performance and visibility. MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outpace Top Cryptos MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly established itself as the most talked-about presale of 2025, with over $15.5 million raised in a short period and growing demand across major crypto communities. Unlike typical speculative launches, MAGACOIN’s rise is backed by solid fundamentals and transparent development. The project’s appeal lies in its structure. Audited by HashEx and CertiK, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides investors with the reassurance that it meets strict security and compliance standards. Its tokenomics model is designed to encourage long-term holding, reducing sell pressure after launch -a key factor in sustainable price growth. What has truly made MAGACOIN stand out is its potential to outpace some of the market’s top cryptocurrencies in percentage growth. Analysts believe that its early-stage positioning, community engagement, and limited supply create the ideal setup for explosive expansion once listings begin. For retail traders, this combination of credibility and massive upside has made MAGACOIN a top priority. Many investors who missed earlier breakouts like Solana or PEPE are now positioning themselves early, hoping to capture similar returns before mainstream attention arrives. Retail Traders Take the Lead The $4.2 trillion milestone highlights the growing influence of retail investors. On-chain analytics show that small wallet addresses – those holding under $10,000 in crypto – now represent over 60 percent of all active transactions. This indicates that the market’s recovery is being fueled not just by institutions but by millions of smaller participants re-entering after years of hesitation. Social trading apps, Telegram groups, and decentralized platforms have become hubs for retail coordination. Traders share presale links, discuss price action, and form collective buying waves that can push prices higher in a matter of hours. The resurgence of this grassroots energy is reminiscent of the early 2021 cycle, when tokens like DOGE and SHIBA INU captured the world’s attention. But unlike the pure hype-driven runs of the past, this new phase appears more mature. Retail traders are paying attention to audits, liquidity structures, and long-term potential – qualities that explain why projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting smarter, more selective investors. What Comes Next The crypto market’s rise to $4.2 trillion could mark the start of an even larger wave if macro conditions remain favorable. With inflation stabilizing, the Federal Reserve signaling a softer policy stance, and ETF products expanding globally, the environment looks ripe for another strong quarter. Analysts expect that Bitcoin and Ethereum will continue to anchor market sentiment while altcoins and presales capture most of the short-term excitement. If liquidity remains strong, total capitalization could test $5 trillion before the end of the year. Conclusion The latest surge in market value proves that crypto’s momentum is not just back – it’s accelerating. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to set the pace, but it’s the smaller assets and new entrants that are defining this phase. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the few presales combining credibility, community power, and massive upside potential. With over $15.5 million raised and strong retail participation, it could easily outpace many established coins as the bull market deepens. As the total market cap climbs higher, retail investors are once again proving that their collective energy remains one of the strongest forces in crypto – and this time, they may be building something much more sustainable.

Based on reports, the total supply of stablecoins sitting on Solana recently climbed to about $15 billion, a new peak that traders say is adding fuel to activity on the chain. Related Reading: 2%–4% In Crypto? Morgan Stanley Thinks That’s The Smart Move Now Stablecoin Liquidity Hits A Milestone The bulk of that supply is held in USDC, which accounts for roughly 75% of stablecoins on Solana, according to analytics cited by market commentators. That concentration has helped trading desks and decentralized apps move larger sums with less friction than on some rival chains. On top of the on-chain cash, US-listed ETFs tied to Solana and related products have recorded fast early takeup, giving institutions a simpler route into the token and staking rewards. The REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF, known by the ticker SSK, passed the $100 million AUM mark within days of launch, showing how appetite for regulated access to Solana can materialize quickly. ETFs Bring Fresh Flows And Visibility Reports show that REX-Osprey’s suite of crypto ETFs has now crossed half a billion dollars in combined assets under management, a sign that product innovation on Wall Street is translating into real capital flows into the sector. Market watchers say ETFs let big investors get exposure without interacting directly with wallets and custody solutions. Network Upgrades, Use Cases Part Of The Move Observers point to recent code upgrades and faster settlement as part of why more stablecoins are parked on Solana. Those changes aim to reduce delays and lower costs for traders who move USDC and other dollar-pegged tokens. Although technical gains in and of itself do not produce price movement, they can enhance a network’s attractiveness for high-frequency activity and for projects focused on tokenized assets that require transaction finality. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $123,000 As Rising Open Interest Signals More Action Ahead Regulatory Framework Remains Relevant Regulation and approvals in the United States have influenced this impulse. Asset managers have filed for Solana ETFs and modified their necessary paperwork with the SEC while awaiting permits to list a product tied to the token. According to a recent reports, multiple firms have updated their submissions while the regulator is still reviewing. The broader political backdrop, including comments from US President Donald Trump and others, has kept attention on how policy could tilt institutional demand.

52769815,https://nulltx.com/?p=152267,1759790037,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"PancakeSwap Unveils CAKE.PAD, A New Era of Early Access and Token Burns",https://nulltx.com/pancakeswap-unveils-cake-pad-a-new-era-of-early-access-and-token-burns/,"PancakeSwap has just launched CAKE.PAD, a next-generation platform built to reshape how users access new tokens. The move marks a major evolution from its well-known Initial Farm Offering (IFO) model, this time, with stronger $CAKE utility and an even more aggressive burn mechanism. According to data from CoinMarketCap, $CAKE is trading around $3.73, up 15% in the last 24 hours as market sentiment turns bullish following the CAKE.PAD announcement. What is CAKE.PAD? CAKE.PAD is designed as PancakeSwap’s new token launch platform, offering exclusive early access to new projects before they list on major exchanges. Unlike the traditional IFO model, participation is simpler. Users only need to commit CAKE and claim new tokens directly from their non-custodial wallet. No complicated staking, no liquidity pair requirements, just CAKE. The concept builds directly under CAKE Tokenomics 3.0, PancakeSwap’s latest economic framework that focuses on utility expansion, supply reduction, and ecosystem growth. More Utility, More Burns At the core of CAKE.PAD lies one powerful rule, every fee is burned. That’s right. PancakeSwap confirmed that 100% of participation fees from CAKE.PAD events will be permanently burned, removing those tokens from circulation forever. This deflationary design creates constant buy pressure on $CAKE while reducing total supply, effectively aligning token utility with long-term holder value. In other words: more launches → more users → more CAKE burned. More CAKE utility. More CAKE burned. Welcome to CAKE.PAD (Formerly IFO), get exclusive early access to new tokens before they hit exchanges. No staking. No lock-ups. Just commit CAKE and claim new tokens. https://t.co/Pyxdp45H2O pic.twitter.com/gpNrm1sO16 — PancakeSwap (@PancakeSwap) October 6, 2025 Built Under CAKE Tokenomics 3.0 CAKE.PAD represents the practical rollout of CAKE Tokenomics 3.0, which focuses on turning the PancakeSwap ecosystem into a deflationary powerhouse. The new framework introduces: Easy early access to token launches before listings. Full burn model, all participation fees go directly to burn. Unlimited participation, users can join multiple events at once. Fair tiered tax for oversubscription events to ensure balance. It’s not just about early access, it’s a long-term strategy to make $CAKE more scarce and more valuable with every event. How It Works Joining a CAKE.PAD event is simple. Users commit CAKE during the subscription period, and after the event ends, they can claim the new project’s tokens directly into their wallet. Because the entire system is non-custodial, users retain full control of their funds at all times. This “commit-and-claim” model offers a straightforward entry point for newcomers, while the burn mechanism keeps the tokenomics tight. Every event triggers two simultaneous effects: 1. Demand increases, as users buy CAKE to join launches. 2. Supply decreases, since participation fees are burned forever. This flywheel effect strengthens CAKE’s economic model while continuously rewarding long-term holders. Unlimited Access, Unlimited Potential Unlike the older IFO model that limited participation per event, CAKE.PAD removes those restrictions. Users can join multiple events simultaneously, with no cap on the amount of CAKE they can commit. That means: More launches = more CAKE used. More usage = more CAKE burned. More burns = higher price potential. This unlimited structure encourages continuous participation and maximizes the burning effect, ensuring the platform stays active and deflationary. Why It’s a Game-Changer The simplicity of CAKE.PAD is what sets it apart. It’s easy, inclusive, and perfectly timed for the next phase of DeFi growth. By merging launchpad access with CAKE’s tokenomics, PancakeSwap is not just attracting users, it’s creating a sustainable loop of utility, participation, and scarcity. According to community reactions on X, many users see CAKE.PAD as a major upgrade that brings real-world utility back to the token. Crypto analyst @aaliyaamodi called it “a smart evolution of PancakeSwap’s model, simple, deflationary, and built to last.” Why $CAKE Could Be Ready to Moon with CAKE.PAD Let’s break down why @PancakeSwap new CAKE.PAD could be the biggest catalyst for CAKE yet pic.twitter.com/713VfTMNs4 — Aaliya Modi (@aaliyaamodi) October 6, 2025 CAKE Burns = Stronger Tokenomics CAKE.PAD introduces a burn-based growth cycle, every transaction feeds directly into deflation. For context, PancakeSwap has already burned over 350 million CAKE tokens since launch, according to data from its official dashboard. The introduction of CAKE.PAD will accelerate this rate significantly, especially if multiple projects run launches simultaneously. Each event creates a tangible reason to buy and use CAKE, a structural demand that’s rare among DEX tokens today. Why $CAKE Could See Price Upside The price dynamics behind CAKE.PAD are straightforward: 1. Increased participation → Higher CAKE demand. 2. More events → More CAKE burned. 3. Reduced supply → Upward price pressure. With CAKE already showing renewed momentum and an expanding user base, analysts expect the new platform to become a core growth driver through 2025. If PancakeSwap maintains a steady stream of token launches, CAKE could see consistent buy pressure that supports long-term appreciation. Community Reaction and Market Outlook The community has responded enthusiastically to the launch. Within hours of the announcement, CAKE’s trading volume jumped sharply, and social engagement across X and Telegram groups surged. Some traders compared CAKE.PAD to Binance’s Launchpad, but with a DeFi-native twist that emphasizes transparency and user control. The launch also positions PancakeSwap as one of the few DEX platforms offering structured early access to new tokens, an advantage that could attract both retail and institutional users looking for decentralized launch exposure. PancakeSwap’s CAKE.PAD isn’t just another feature, it’s a strategic move to redefine the token’s role in its ecosystem. By making CAKE the gateway to early access, while burning 100% of participation fees, PancakeSwap aligns growth with value creation. The result is a flywheel of deflation and demand that strengthens both the token and the community. As PancakeSwap continues to roll out CAKE.PAD events, users can expect higher utility, more burns, and a more dynamic DeFi environment built on $CAKE’s foundation. With new projects preparing to launch and more CAKE set to burn, PancakeSwap’s latest evolution might just mark the start of another bullish chapter for DeFi’s most iconic token.

Users can log in to these apps directly inside ChatGPT through a secure connection flow. The SDK will also help developers build new apps inside ChatGPT faster and gain access to millions of users. Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, announced the release of Apps SDK during the company’s annual DevDay in San Francisco, California. He said that apps that talk with ChatGPT “will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized, that you can chat with.” ChatGPT connects users to Spotify, Figma, and more During OpenAI’s DevDay, Sam Altam showcased how users can interact with Figma. For example, a user can sketch a product workflow manually, then send it to ChatGPT and prompt it with “Figma, turn this sketch into a workable diagram.” Figma will take over the conversation and complete the task. Altman also mentioned that apps will be discoverable in conversations. Basically, when a user asks for something, ChatGPT will recommend an app that fulfills the user’s request. The founder then showcased an example of a prompt saying, “Make me a playlist for my party based on my favorite songs.” In this case, ChatGPT created a playlist and recommended building it on Spotify. Alexi Christakis, a software engineer at OpenAI, demoed how users could interact with Coursera and Canva. He asked, “Coursera, can you teach me something about machine learning?” ChatGPT then requested permission to connect to Coursera, launched it inline, and displayed a video teaching machine learning. Christakis explained that ChatGPT’s app integrations behave like web apps — they render inline or in full screen, much as they would in a browser. ChatGPT makes popular apps like Figma and Spotify respond to natural language and adapt to users’ needs while helping them learn and complete more tasks. Starting today, ChatGPT users can chat with several services, including Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Zillow, Figma, and Spotify. In a blog post, OpenAI said another batch of apps will integrate soon with ChatGPT, including Uber, TripAdvisor, DoorDash, KhanAcademy, InstaCart, and more. Apps SDK is available for users on the Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans worldwide. However, European Union users remain restricted at the moment.

Despite the dip, market structure remains bullish. Spot ETF demand is accelerating, exchange balances are at multi-year lows, and macro tailwinds continue to favor “digital gold.” With “Uptober” seasonality intact, several strategists now map a route toward $150K–$170K in Q4 if inflows persist. Why Bitcoin Rallied to a Record The latest breakout was supported by a perfect storm of demand and scarcity. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $3Billion plus of net inflows in early October, led by heavyweight issuers, while on-chain data show exchange reserves sliding to 6–7-year lows (roughly 2.45–2.83M BTC). That supply squeeze, Bitcoin moving to self-custody, treasuries, and ETF vaults, reduces sell pressure at the same time large buyers add exposure. Macro helped too. A weaker dollar, government-shutdown uncertainty, and shifting rate-cut odds boosted safe-haven bids, with Bitcoin tracking alongside gold’s strength. Historically strong Q4 performance (the “Uptober” effect) layered on a behavioral tailwind as trend followers chased the breakout. Key Levels to Watch in Q4 After hitting a fresh ATH, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase above its key support zones, setting the stage for Q4’s next major move. The $121,000–$118,000 range now acts as the primary demand pocket, with deeper support at $115,000 and $108,000, levels tied to the origin of the recent impulse rally. On the upside, traders are watching $135,000 as the immediate resistance and potential price magnet, while a strong weekly close above the psychological $150,000 mark could open the path toward the $165,000–$170,000 corridor. Overall market internals remain healthy: spot-driven accumulation is outpacing leveraged speculation, liquidations were minimal at the highs, and funding rates have stayed balanced. These factors suggest a controlled advance rather than a blow-off top, meaning any dip into the $118,000–$121,000 zone accompanied by declining volume is likely to be seen as a re-accumulation opportunity by seasoned investors. Will $170K Happen This Quarter? The bullish case hinges on sustained ETF inflows and ongoing exchange supply shrinkage. If net creations remain robust and long-term holders keep coins off-market, price discovery can extend toward $150K to $165K then $170K. Seasonality supports the view that Bitcoin has historically outperformed in Q4 when September closes green. Risks to monitor include a sharp ETF outflow week, a US-dollar rebound, or regulatory shocks, all of which could force a retest of sub-$118K supports. However, as long as BTC holds $120K on a closing basis and the spot bid persists, analysts argue the path of least resistance remains higher.

The platform’s operator, Dunamu, is on the verge of a merger with Naver , the country’s biggest internet company. And, per the FFS data, customers used Upbit’s platform to execute 833 trillion won ($642 billion) worth of transactions in the first half of the year. Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Upbit: Crypto Market Dominance in S Korea The combined total for domestic exchanges was 1,162 trillion won ($895 billion). Following behind Upbit was its closest and fiercest rival Bithumb, with 300 trillion won ($223 billion; 25.8% of the market). Bithumb is aiming to become the first South Korean crypto exchange to go public. The firm is eyeing a 2026 NASDAQ debut. In recent months, analysts have talked of Bithumb intensifying its efforts to claw back market share from Upbit. But the latest figures appear to show that Upbit’s lead over its rival is still substantial, even prior to the proposed Naver deal. A fierce debate is brewing over the pricing of Naver Financial and Dunamu as their merger is in the offing. #Naver #Dunamu #NaverFinancial #Upbit #stablecoin #MiraeAssetSecurities #KakaoInvestment #WooriTechnologyInvestment #HanwhaInvestmentNSecurities https://t.co/3GeHh6COuo — The Korea Economic Daily (@kedglobal) September 29, 2025 However, the figures for smaller exchanges made for grim reading. Coinone’s volume was just 20.8 trillion won ($16 billion; 1.8% of the market share). Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange Coinone over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) The volume figures for Korbit, the country’s oldest crypto exchange, were 5.5 trillion won ($4.01 billion; 0.5%). GOPAX’s figures were 2.8 trillion won ($2.15 billion; 0.2%). Smaller Exchanges: Becoming ‘Insignificant?’ The newspaper wrote: “The domestic crypto market has effectively solidified into an Upbit monopoly.” Seoul Kyungjae added that Coinone, Korbit, and GOPAX’s trading volumes were “negligible, rendering their presence in the market insignificant.” The FSS submitted the data following a request from the People Power Party lawmaker Lee Heon-seung. The regulator also provided average daily trading volume figures for the first half of the year. And these produced similarly uncomfortable reading for smaller exchanges. Upbit recorded an average of 4.6 trillion won ($3.36 billion) per day, with Bithumb posting 1.6 trillion won ($1.2 billion). But smaller exchanges’ daily volumes were just a fraction of this. Coinone’s average was around 100 billion won ($77 million), Korbit’s 30 billion won ($23 million), and GOPAX just 10 billion won ($7.7 million). Over 90 percent of Koreans are expressing concern about a recent series of information leaks from both the private and public sector, with most saying they are worried regardless of their own personal data being stolen, a survey showed Tuesday. https://t.co/tppPPXD7o7 — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) September 30, 2025 For Korbit, the drop-off is sharp. The exchange’s daily average was over 100 billion won as recently as 2022. The majority of trading on GOPAX, meanwhile, chiefly comprises crypto-to-crypto trades, the media outlet wrote. User Numbers Also Stark for Smaller Platforms Worse still was the data on user numbers. Of a total of 10.17 million users, 53% held Upbit accounts, and 37% used Bithumb. But the remaining three exchanges’ combined user base accounted for just 990,000 users, or 10% of the total. The newspaper wrote that industry insiders predict the gap may widen yet further, particularly if the Naver deal goes though and Bithumb lists on NASDAQ. An unnamed crypto exchange official told the outlet: “If a specific exchange effectively monopolizes listing policies and fee structures, that could spread systemic risks to the entire market. The financial regulators must ensure a minimum level of fair competition. If not, investors will be left with a diminishing set of options.” Lawmakers have repeatedly warned that Seoul is not doing enough to prevent Upbit from becoming a monopoly . However, in April last year, the platform’s dominance peaked at over 80% . Upbit, the largest crypto exchange in South Korea, accounts for more than 80% of the trading volume in the country.

Following the pattern seen with Bitcoin treasuries, several companies are now exploring XRP as a potential store of value and liquidity tool. Analysts believe this movement could have a significant effect on XRP’s market dynamics if it expands on a large scale. Corporate Shift Toward XRP Treasuries In recent months, a number of firms have introduced XRP-based treasury initiatives. In May 2025, VivoPower International launched a $121 million digital asset plan, allocating $100 million toward XRP holdings staked on the Flare Network. That same month, Webus International unveiled a $300 million strategy to build an XRP reserve. The following month, Trident Digital Tech Holdings announced its intention to raise as much as $500 million for an XRP treasury fund, while Wellgistics Health obtained a $50 million credit line to acquire XRP for blockchain-related operations. In July, Nature’s Miracle Holding Inc. introduced a $20 million XRP program, and Everything Blockchain Inc. (EBZT) disclosed the purchase of $10 million in XRP, also staked on Flare for yield. By August, Japan’s Gumi Inc. joined the list, committing approximately ¥2.5 billion (around $17 million) to the same cause. These examples demonstrate a growing interest among companies seeking to diversify their financial assets and participate in blockchain ecosystems through XRP exposure. Modeling the Impact: 100 Companies Acquiring 300 Million XRP Each To evaluate how large-scale accumulation could influence XRP’s value, Grok, an AI chatbot developed by xAI, was asked to model a scenario in which 100 corporations each purchase 300 million XRP. Based on the token’s trading price of $3.03 and a circulating supply of roughly 60 billion, such a move would represent a total acquisition of 30 billion XRP, equivalent to half of the circulating supply. Grok indicated that these hypothetical purchases would likely occur progressively over a six- to twelve-month window to limit volatility. With XRP’s average daily trading volume ranging between $5 billion and $10 billion, consistent institutional buying would introduce substantial demand pressure. Furthermore, because a large portion of XRP remains held by long-term investors, exchanges, and Ripple’s escrow accounts, only a limited quantity would be available for open-market transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reduced Liquidity and Potential Market Effects If 30 billion XRP were locked into corporate treasuries, Grok projected that the liquid supply could shrink to between 20 and 30 billion tokens. Each company would spend approximately $891 million to secure its holdings, resulting in a combined expenditure of about $89.1 billion across all 100 firms. Distributing this investment evenly would translate to monthly purchases worth between $7.4 billion and $14.8 billion, or roughly $250 million to $500 million daily. Under these conditions, order books on major exchanges could experience upward pressure as buy orders steadily absorb available liquidity, causing the market to move through higher price levels over time. Projected XRP Price Range Market sentiment would likely strengthen as reports of corporate accumulation surface. Institutional investors and retail traders could respond with increased interest, further amplifying demand. According to Grok’s projection, XRP could appreciate to a price range between $5 and $10 within three to six months after accumulation begins. Over a six- to twelve-month horizon, continued purchases and broader investor participation could push the price toward $15–$30. In an extended timeframe of one to two years, should adoption deepen and XRP gain recognition as a key payment reserve asset, Grok suggested that an upper target between $50 and $100 could be achievable. These estimates illustrate how sustained institutional interest could meaningfully reshape XRP’s market landscape.

52771059,https://cryptonews.com/?p=433312,1759793460,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52771059.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 6 October – XRP, Cardano, Pi Coin",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-6-october-xrp-cardano-pi-coin/,"The crypto price prediction for XRP, Cardano and Pi Coin looks very positive today, with the market remaining bullish after Bitcoin set a new ATH of $125,506 yesterday. Some tokens (including Bitcoin) have posted double-digit percentage gains in the past week, while the vast majority of tokens have posted decent single-figure returns. And given that the market is still likely to witness a surge in altcoin ETF launches in the following weeks, the weekend’s rally may be only the beginning of an end-of-year bull run. We therefore take a look at the charts of XRP, Cardano and Pi Coin, analysing their indicators and fundamentals in order to gauge how they might end 2025. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETF Launches Set to Push Altcoin to New All-Time-Highs The XRP price has actually dipped by 2% in the past 24 hours, yet its current level of $2.99 represents a 3.5% increase in a week and a 6% increase in a month. XRP is also up by a very impressive 460% in the past year, making it one of the best-performing top-100 coins across this period. And it also happens to boast some of the strongest fundamentals in the market, given Ripple’s recent growth since it finally ended its legal battle with the SEC in August. It’s also extremely bullish that upwards of ten XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the next few weeks, attracting significant institutional interest in XRP. It’s in this context that the alt’s chart today looks very promising, with its indicators continuing to rise from oversold positions. Source: TradingView For example, XRP’s MACD (orange, blue) is about to turn positive for the first time since late September, indicating a return in buying pressure. Indeed, whales have been buying XRP in substantial quantities over the past week, so we may see the altcoin rally again this week. It could rise to $3.60 by the end of October, before entering the New Year at above $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Network Growth and Grayscale ETF to Push ADA Higher At $0.8511, Cardano is down by 3% in 24 hours but up by 6.5% in the past seven days. ADA also boasts a 3% gain in a month, and while this may be very modest, it suggests that the altcoin has plenty of space left to rise further before the year is out. Its fundamentals are also a source of strength, with major asset manager Grayscale including ADA in the multi-crypto ETF its aiming to launch in the coming weeks. Cardano is also a dark horse as far as layer-one networks go, with its ecosystem witnessing steady growth – as indicated by projects building – with each passing month. Such growth makes ADA’s current position seem very enticing, given that it’s still 72% below its ATH of $3.09. Source: TradingView And it has also been in an oversold position for pretty much the entire period since late July, implying that a sustained rally is long overdue. This points towards an encouraging crypto price prediction for ADA, which could return to $1 by the end of this month, and reclaim $3 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: Pi Network ($PI) – Heavy Overselling Puts Alt in Position to Rebound PI has slipped to $0.2602 today, making for a 2.5% drop in a week and a 24% decline in the last 30 days. Worryingly, PI has declined by 91% since reaching its ATH of $2.99 in late February, with this sharp drop inviting fears that it may be suffering from a terminal decline. And unlike the two tokens above, there is currently no incoming ETF that includes PI, so it’s unlikely to see any institutional investment anytime soon. If we look at its chart, it has been declining steadily since a brief jump in May, with its indicators having been heavily depressed since this time. Its RSI (yellow) has been under 50 since late May, while its MACD has also been in negative territory since then. Source: TradingView Normally, such indicators would suggest that an asset is way overdue a comeback, yet skeptics may argue that PI is very different. It has struggled to regain momentum since its February launch, with its failure to attract listings from big exchanges (e.g. Binance) a big factor in this. However, because it’s so heavily sold, such a listing – if it does come – could see it fly upwards, back towards its ATH. PEPENODE Raises $1.6 Million As Presale Gathers Steam: Next 100x Meme Coin? The market does look like it could have a massive end to the year, and if so, traders may want to diversify into newer coins, since the best new coins can outperform the market. Presale tokens can be one way of posting outsized returns, with the biggest sales sometimes leading to big rallies, once the corresponding tokens list for the first time. One coin enjoying a big sale right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that boasts a unique ‘mine-to-earn’ feature. No chains are going to keep this Pepe from his $PEPENODE https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/GLcDi4jvOI — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 6, 2025 It has now raised over $1.6 million in its sale, a figure that testifies to the interest the coin is attracting. And the reason for this is the aforementioned mine-to-earn feature, which provides users with the chance to build their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to acquire more virtual nodes, users can increase the rewards they earn from their rigs, becoming more profitable over time. This will incentivize PEPENODE ownership, with the coin paying out mining rewards in other coins, such as Pepe and Fartcoin. Holders can also stake PEPENODE, which currently offerings annual yields of over 700%. This could make the new alt hugely profitable, with investors able to join its presale by going to the official PEPENODE website . It’s currently selling at $0.0010874, with this price rising every few days until the sale ends. Buy PEPENODE Here.

Across the broader digital asset market, investment inflows totaled $5.95 billion, which is the largest weekly inflows ever recorded. CoinShares believes this surge indicates a delayed reaction to the FOMC’s interest rate reduction, coupled with disappointing employment figures from the ADP Payroll report and uncertainty surrounding US government stability due to the shutdown. The resulting price rally lifted total assets under management (AuM) in digital assets to a whopping $254 billion. Investment Influx According to the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,’ the bullish trend was widespread as Ethereum recorded $1.48 billion in inflows last week, bringing its year-to-date total to a record $13.7 billion, nearly triple last year’s figure. Solana also hit a new weekly record with $706.5 million in inflows, which pushed its YTD total to $2.58 billion. XRP attracted $219.4 million, while most other altcoins saw minimal investor activity. Investment products dedicated to Sui, Chainlink, and Litecoin welcomed inflows of $3.4 million, $1.5 million, and $1.2 million in inflows respectively. Meanwhile, Cardano also saw a modest inflow of $0.5 million during the same period. Multi-asset products, on the other hand, was the only cohort to have bucked the trend as it saw a weekly outflow of $23.5 million. Last week’s inflows showed broad regional optimism, with the United States leading the sentiment as it saw $5.0 billion inflows last week, a new weekly record. Switzerland also set a weekly high, posting $563 million in inflows, while Germany welcomed its second-largest weekly inflows of $312 million. Next up were Canada, Australia, and Hong Kong with $32.1 million, $6.3 million, and $5 million in inflows, respectively. Brazil, too, settled with a minor $4.8 million in inflows. Sweden, in contrast, acted as an outlier with $8.6 million in outflows. October Seasonality and Market Narratives Going forward, QCP Capital predicted a strong but cautious outlook for Bitcoin as the market approaches a potential October breakout. According to its latest note, major whales appear to have either completed their asset rotations or are holding steady, and waiting for momentum to unfold. Leveraged traders continue to chase the rally as BTC-PERP funding rates on major exchanges remain elevated, with 35% on Deribit and 29% on Hyperliquid, which points to aggressive positioning. However, such high perpetuals carry the risk of sharp liquidations, as seen two weeks ago when nearly $3 billion in long positions were wiped out, creating institutional entry opportunities. In the options market, traders short on end-October calls have rolled strikes higher to 126k-128k as spot rallied. While some may view the recent BTC surge as excessive without clear catalysts, supportive narratives remain strong. For one, Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal is reasserting itself amid the US government shutdown and outperforming gold, while October’s historically bullish seasonality adds fuel.

IBIT is the top revenue‑generating BlackRock ETF, led by a 0.25% fee. IBIT reached $97.8B AUM in 435 days, closing in on the $100B milestone. IBIT accounted for $1.8B of $3.2B US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows in a single week. iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) leads BlackRock ETF revenue, nearing $100B AUM; read performance, fees, and what new Bitcoin products mean for investors. Learn more. What is the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT)? iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is a spot Bitcoin exchange‑traded fund managed by BlackRock that tracks Bitcoin’s price by holding bitcoin or bitcoin exposures. It charges a 0.25% management fee, has become BlackRock’s most profitable ETF, and is approaching $100 billion in net assets. How much revenue has IBIT generated for BlackRock? Over the past 12 months IBIT generated about $245 million in management fees, outpacing long‑established funds like IWF and EFA by roughly $25 million. Fee revenue scales with assets under management and Bitcoin price movements. Source: Eric Balchunas Why is IBIT growing so quickly? IBIT’s growth is driven by large institutional and retail flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, favorable regulatory clarity, and strong investor appetite for direct Bitcoin exposure within a familiar ETF wrapper. BlackRock’s distribution reach accelerated adoption compared with earlier crypto funds. How close is IBIT to $100 billion and why does it matter? IBIT reached $97.8 billion in net assets in 435 days — a speed record relative to legacy funds such as Vanguard’s VOO, which took about 2,011 days to cross $100 billion. Hitting $100 billion would mark an ETF milestone and further cement spot Bitcoin ETFs as mainstream allocation vehicles. Source: Eric Balchunas What new Bitcoin products is BlackRock exploring? BlackRock filed to register a Delaware trust company for a proposed Bitcoin Premium Income ETF that would sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures to collect premiums and produce yield. This approach offers income but reduces upside participation compared with IBIT’s spot exposure. Industry commentary (Eric Balchunas), market inflows, and filings indicate BlackRock plans additional Bitcoin and Ether products while avoiding broad altcoin ETF pushes for now. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has paused reviews on some crypto ETF filings pending federal actions. Frequently Asked Questions How does IBIT charge fees and how much is the management fee? IBIT charges a 0.25% annual management fee on assets under management. Fee revenue rises as AUM grows and as Bitcoin’s market price increases, producing significant annual revenue for BlackRock. Is IBIT the fastest ETF ever to reach near $100B? Yes. At 435 days to $97.8B, IBIT is on track to be the fastest ETF to $100B, far quicker than Vanguard’s VOO, which reached $100B in about 2,011 days. Will BlackRock offer income-focused Bitcoin ETFs? BlackRock has filed for a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF that would sell covered calls on Bitcoin futures to collect premiums and deliver distributions, trading away some upside potential for regular income. Key Takeaways Revenue leadership : IBIT generated ~ $245M in fees last 12 months, now BlackRock’s top earner. Rapid AUM growth : $97.8B in 435 days, approaching a $100B milestone. Product expansion : BlackRock is pursuing income-oriented Bitcoin ETFs via covered‑call strategies. Conclusion The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has quickly become BlackRock’s most profitable ETF, driven by high inflows, a 0.25% fee, and strong investor demand for spot Bitcoin exposure. Watch for new income‑focused Bitcoin products and regulatory developments as IBIT nears the $100 billion milestone. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) Becomes BlackRock’s Top Revenue Generator, Nears $100B"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199bbe3-7f92-7ec1-af42-5345dc6017e2.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-06T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-06T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/"" }, ""description"": ""The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is BlackRock’s top‑earning ETF, generating $245M in fees last year and nearing $100B AUM as it dominates US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT)?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""IBIT is BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF that tracks Bitcoin price exposure, charges a 0.25% management fee, and has rapidly amassed nearly $98 billion in assets."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much revenue has IBIT generated?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""IBIT generated approximately $245 million in management fees over the past year, making it BlackRock’s most profitable ETF."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is BlackRock’s proposed Bitcoin Premium Income ETF?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The proposed Bitcoin Premium Income ETF would sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures to collect premiums and deliver yield, sacrificing some upside for regular income."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How IBIT Generates Revenue for BlackRock"", ""description"": ""Step‑by‑step explanation of how IBIT produces management fee revenue and potential income strategies."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Collect management fees"", ""text"": ""IBIT charges a 0.25% annual management fee on assets under management, producing fee revenue as AUM increases."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Capture inflows"", ""text"": ""Large investor inflows increase AUM quickly; IBIT captured $1.8B in one week and has sustained strong weekly inflows."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Offer income products"", ""text"": ""BlackRock plans covered‑call income products on Bitcoin futures, which would generate premium income but limit upside participation."" } ]} Author: COINOTAG • Published: 2025-10-06 • Updated: 2025-10-06 Sources: Eric Balchunas (data and commentary), BlackRock filings, US Securities and Exchange Commission, Harvard endowment (reported investment), industry market inflow data.",News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-06 23:51:15

Barry Silbert, the founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), is spearheading the effort to take Grayscale public, a move that would mark the first major public offering by a crypto asset manager. But ongoing lawsuits connected to Genesis’s bankruptcy continue to cast uncertainty over the process. DCG’s Legal Woes Deepen as Genesis Committee Files $1.2B Suits Ahead of Grayscale IPO Plans In May 2025, the Genesis Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC) filed two separate lawsuits , one in Delaware’s Court of Chancery and another in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The Delaware complaint accuses Silbert, DCG, and other insiders of treating the insolvent Genesis as DCG’s “treasury,” alleging that the group “recklessly operated, exploited, and bankrupted Genesis.” The filing claims the defendants manipulated disclosures and misused creditor funds, while the LOC seeks “in-kind recovery of cryptocurrency” for creditors who had entrusted their assets to Genesis. The bankruptcy court complaint seeks to claw back more than $1.2 billion in transfers made prior to Genesis’s collapse, including what the committee described as improper payments under a “tax sharing agreement” that it argues never existed. DCG and Silbert have moved to dismiss the suits, maintaining that they acted in good faith amid a broader market crash that saw several crypto lenders fail. A DCG spokesperson said the company and its advisers “worked tirelessly to try and save Genesis and prevent its bankruptcy” during a period of widespread market distress. The renewed legal pressure comes as Silbert recently rejoined Grayscale’s board as chairman, reaffirming his role in steering the company’s IPO ambitions. Industry observers note that underwriters and regulators will closely scrutinize DCG’s financial entanglements with Genesis and its disclosures to investors before any public listing moves forward. 3⃣ There were at least three major factors that lead to the collapse of the fund, according to the founders of Three Arrows Capital ( #3AC ) Su Zhu and Kyle Davies. Read more https://t.co/CSYvTObnxR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 22, 2022 The legal dispute traces back to the fallout from Three Arrows Capital’s collapse in June 2022, when the hedge fund defaulted on $2.36 billion in loans from Genesis. DCG stepped in with a $1.1 billion promissory note to offset the losses , but the arrangement has since become a flashpoint in multiple court battles. @FTX_Official ’s legal team is pushing back against a $1.5 billion claim from defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), calling it baseless. #FTX #3AC https://t.co/WBTcGD1NEJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 23, 2025 Genesis claims DCG and its executives used the note to obscure the true scale of the firm’s financial problems before bankruptcy. In response, DCG filed a countersuit in August 2025 , seeking $1.1 billion in promissory note relief and $105 million in alleged overpayments. The parent company argues that recoveries from Three Arrows Capital, estimated at $2.8 billion by May 2024, automatically reduced the note’s value to zero under their agreement. DCG says it mistakenly continued to pay Genesis $106 million after the note was effectively void and is now seeking recovery of those funds. Legal Turmoil Casts Shadow Over Grayscale’s Landmark $33B Stock Market Debut Genesis, meanwhile, has pursued its own offensive, seeking $2.2 billion in digital assets and over $1 billion in allegedly fraudulent transfers through separate cases in Delaware and New York. The company accuses DCG of extracting $450 million in crypto assets and nearly $300 million in international transfers as Genesis faced mounting liquidity issues. The SEC has charged Genesis and Digital Currency Group for misleading investors about their financial health, resulting in a $38 million fine. #SEC #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/HAqe03QsWw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 17, 2025 Regulatory scrutiny has deepened the conflict. In January 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined DCG $38 million and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro $500,000 for misleading investors about the company’s financial stability following the Three Arrows collapse. Court filings from the SEC case revealed that DCG executives were aware of over $1 billion in Genesis losses while continuing to present the business as solvent. The legal turmoil has also drawn in other entities connected to Genesis. In September, the FTX Recovery Trust filed a $1.15 billion lawsuit against Genesis Digital Assets , alleging that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried used misappropriated exchange funds to buy Genesis Digital shares at inflated valuations between 2021 and 2022. Despite the deepening litigation, Grayscale is moving ahead with its listing plan. In June, the asset manager confidentially submitted documents to the U.S. SEC .

MAGACOIN FINANCE has made a cause for attention for its transparent operations, and its Hashex audited smart contract, which defines the technical strength. The audit eliminated vulnerabilities and improved investor confidence in the stability and reliability of the project. These whale movements illustrate the increasing confidence in the long-term value of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Each transfer increases the depth of its liquidity and credibility in exchanges. Analysts see this accumulation as a great market input, which points to a rising adoption. The continuous rotation is how institutional involvement helps to lead broader crypto trends. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains From Whale Rotation MAGACOIN FINANCE is the top beneficiary of whale-driven inflows through 2025. Large investors are accumulating positions strategically to play off its accelerating growth cycle. Verified smart contracts, clear transparency, and long-term development goals have made it a preferred option for institutions. Analysts now call the project one of the most confident whale-backed opportunities of the year. The steady inflow of massive capital puts upward pressure on and stabilizes the market structure. Whale participation fosters the base for further adoption and visibility. As accumulation continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making itself one of the most closely watched assets this year. Polkadot (DOT) Growth Outlook Polkadot remains a major and leading platform for supporting interoperability between independent blockchains. The Polkadot 2.0 upgrade is intended to improve scalability and boost transaction throughput across parachains. These improvements are expected to aid in luring additional decentralized apps and ecosystem participants. Analysts predict sustained growth in price, keeping pace with on-chain activity and improvements in governance. Institutional interest is consistent because of Polkadot’s robust developer ecosystem and cross-chain architecture. The project’s ability to connect various blockchains securely makes it an important bridge layer of infrastructure. With additional parachains rolling out, the transaction volumes and usage of Polkadot keep growing. Its steady progression has become a foundation for Web3 development. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Potential Avalanche is striving to hold a high spot in Layer-1 with speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. Its subnet architecture enables developers to build customized blockchains optimized for gaming, DeFi, and enterprise applications. These innovations have led to a greater confidence in the long-term network utility of AVAX. Recent price action points to steady growth potential due to increased ecosystem activity. Strategic partnerships and growing adoption have brought about an expansion of Avalanche’s developer and enterprise presence. Its near-instant transaction finality continues to attract high-value applications. Analysts believe that the steady growth of the network will enable consistent appreciation over time. Avalanche’s performance illustrates the importance of scalability in the next stage of blockchain’s global adoption phase.

Following regulatory clarity, its adoption within the banking and remittance sectors has grown rapidly. The network’s ability to handle large transaction volumes efficiently supports continued institutional integration. These developments enhance confidence among both investors and payment service providers. Ripple’s partnerships with major financial institutions further consolidate XRP’s leadership in digital settlement systems. Its focus on speed, cost efficiency, and interoperability has positioned it as a critical asset for cross-border liquidity. Analysts anticipate steady value appreciation as network usage expands globally. XRP remains a key component of the market’s institutional layer, bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. Conclusion Whale rotation has become a powerful force guiding the direction of capital in 2025. The strong movement of institutional funds into MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights its 50x growth potential and market strength. Security audits and verified smart contracts have solidified its reputation as a trusted asset among large investors. This concentrated activity reinforces the growing recognition of MAGACOIN FINANCE as a defining project of the year. DOT, AVAX, and XRP continue to evolve as major players driving innovation across their respective sectors. Their consistent progress complements the broader market’s transition toward secure, scalable, and institutionally recognized assets.

As Bitcoin dominance stabilizes and institutional inflows continue to build, investors are looking for undervalued opportunities with strong fundamentals and unique narratives. Historically, October has marked the start of a new accumulation cycle for altcoins, a period when smart capital moves early before the crowd notices. While mainstream attention remains fixed on large-cap players, several mid-tier projects are quietly positioning for breakout growth. Among them, Render (RNDR), Flare (FLR), Sei (SEI), DoubleZero (2Z), and MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging as standout candidates. Each represents a different dimension of innovation, from decentralized computing to tokenized governance and community-driven finance, offering diverse exposure for investors looking to capture the next wave of expansion. Render (RNDR) – decentralizing GPU power for the AI age Render has evolved from a niche GPU-sharing concept into one of the most important blockchain infrastructures for the AI economy. As artificial intelligence continues to dominate global investment discussions, Render’s decentralized network allows creators, developers, and studios to access GPU resources without relying on centralized cloud providers. Its ecosystem has seen increasing adoption from AI startups and visual effects firms seeking scalable rendering solutions at lower cost. Analysts describe Render as a “Web3 NVIDIA”, a platform built to serve the growing computational needs of decentralized innovation. The project’s steady technical development and partnerships with major content studios are setting the stage for broader utility. As demand for GPU compute surges through 2025, Render’s token economy could see significant uplift, making it a leading candidate for long-term portfolio exposure. Flare (FLR) – bringing smart contracts to every network Flare Network represents one of the most ambitious interoperability solutions in crypto today. Its goal is to enable smart contract functionality for assets that lack native programmability, such as Bitcoin and XRP. By unlocking this capability, Flare effectively bridges isolated blockchains into a unified, functional web of liquidity. Flare’s unique architecture uses the State Connector and the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) to securely bring real-world data on-chain. This makes it possible for developers to create dApps that interact across multiple networks without centralized intermediaries. After months of quiet development, Flare’s ecosystem growth has begun accelerating, with integrations expanding across DeFi and real-world asset protocols. Analysts believe FLR remains significantly undervalued relative to its potential, especially as interoperability becomes essential for the next generation of blockchain scalability. Sei (SEI) – the speed layer for the future of trading In an era where every millisecond matters, Sei has positioned itself as the fastest Layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for trading. Its architecture allows near-instant transaction finality and built-in order matching, making it ideal for decentralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and real-time applications. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, Sei focuses exclusively on optimizing performance for financial markets. This specialization has attracted developers building high-frequency trading protocols and on-chain liquidity engines. With institutional appetite for decentralized trading infrastructure growing, Sei’s value proposition becomes even more compelling. Analysts describe Sei as a “high-performance bridge between DeFi and traditional markets,” citing its efficiency and focus on low-latency execution as differentiators. As capital continues flowing from centralized exchanges to decentralized platforms, Sei’s positioning as the “trader’s blockchain” could lead to rapid ecosystem expansion. DoubleZero (2Z) – a new standard for tokenized governance DoubleZero is gaining attention as one of the most innovative governance tokens of 2025. The project introduces a two-layer voting system that enhances fairness and reduces the influence of whales in decentralized decision-making. Its protocol design ensures that votes are weighted not only by token holdings but also by participation consistency, rewarding users who contribute actively over time. This creates a democratic balance rarely seen in governance models, aligning incentives between developers, investors, and the broader community. DoubleZero’s approach to governance comes at a time when DAOs are facing criticism for centralization risks. By addressing these flaws, 2Z provides a credible blueprint for the next era of decentralized governance. Analysts see it as a long-term bet on the infrastructure of on-chain democracy, an essential foundation for sustainable ecosystem growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE – audited transparency and movement-driven momentum While many projects focus purely on technology, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a new category of crypto innovation – one built on cultural conviction, financial structure, and verifiable trust. The project’s presale has already surpassed $15 million raised, making it one of the fastest-growing community-driven launches of the year. Among the most undervalued altcoins this month, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention for reasons beyond hype. Analysts call it a generational wealth setup, combining meme-driven visibility with structured scarcity. Early DOGE and SHIB backers saw similar blueprints, but MAGACOIN FINANCE adds the missing element: audited transparency via CertiK and HashEx. Its presale math implies over 13x appreciation from current price to listing, and community expansion has been accelerating weekly. For those diversifying October portfolios, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being compared to the early accumulation phases of history’s biggest wealth-creation coins. At a live price of $0.00051213 and a listing price of $0.007, that setup already encodes a near 13.6x base upside – before market premiums kick in. Analysts describe it as a classic asymmetry case: early scarcity, rising demand, and verifiable infrastructure. Investor sentiment – structure over speculation Across all five assets, a common thread emerges: discipline. Whether it’s Render’s data-driven scaling, Flare’s interoperability, Sei’s trading optimization, DoubleZero’s governance model, or MAGACOIN FINANCE’s transparency, each project prioritizes structure over hype. This shift reflects a broader trend in the 2025 market. Investors are no longer drawn solely to volatility, they’re seeking measurable progress and proof of execution. In a market maturing before our eyes, credibility has become the new alpha. As capital rotates away from overextended majors, mid-cap innovation is taking the spotlight. The projects leading that rotation are the ones that pair strong narratives with visible development, and this group fits that profile precisely. Why October could redefine the cycle Historically, October’s market rhythm has rewarded those who act early. Bitcoin’s consolidation often signals the beginning of altcoin acceleration, as liquidity spreads across ecosystems seeking higher yields. This year, however, analysts believe the dynamic will be different, more selective, more structured, and more narrative-driven. Render and Flare capture technological leadership, Sei and DoubleZero embody infrastructure innovation, and MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the emotional and ideological core uniting the retail narrative. Together, they form a microcosm of the next wave of crypto growth, where decentralization, performance, and cultural identity converge. For investors searching beyond the noise, these five assets offer not just upside, but participation in the evolution of blockchain’s purpose.

Solana is praised for its speed and ultra-low fees, making it ideal for high-frequency DeFi and gaming applications. At the same time, Ethereum continues to dominate in DeFi, developer activity, and institutional adoption. Alongside these two established networks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-upside altcoin to watch , potentially offering early investors exposure to exponential growth opportunities in the crypto space. Solana vs Ethereum: Comparing Speed, Fees, and Growth Potential Into the 2025 Rally Solana is significantly faster than Ethereum. It can handle about 870 transactions per second (TPS) on average, while it is capable of reaching peak rates of as high as 65,000 TPS and has a block time of approximately 0.39 seconds. The fast speed helps in high frequency defi applications and gaming. Ethereum’s base layer handles about 15 to 30 TPS. Layer-2 Solutions (rollups) are essential for scaling as they offer greater throughput without compromising security and decentralization. Fee comparisons Solana has incredibly low fees, at $0.000025, making it very cheap to send micropayments and transact often. The fees (gas costs) charged on Ethereum’s blockchain are higher and more volatile than Bitcoin’s. They range from $1 to over $30 during congestion. However, Layer-2 scaling on Ethereum is already starting to reduce costs. Growth and Market Outlook Due to its speed and low fees, Solana has strong price momentum and is well-positioned for quick adoption. Traders and applications that require high throughput will be attracted to this. Ethereum is the long-term leader in DeFi, developer activity, and institutional adoption. Significant upgrades (e.g. danksharding) will help with scaling and fee issues. Solana 7-day Price Chart: Source CMC The price of Solana is predicted to be around $232 by the end of 2025, with a possible maximum value of $482 by the end of the same year. Some analysts forecast that it will surpass $1,500 by 2030. Similarly, Ethereum recently broke the $4,000 level. Bullish analysts are forecasting that it will continue rising up to 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: High-Upside Altcoin Potential While Solana and Ethereum dominate discussions on speed, scalability, and adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly emerging as a high-upside growth altcoin . Investors seeking exposure to early-stage opportunities may consider MAGACOIN FINANCE for its structured roadmap , rapidly growing community, and potential for huge ROI , particularly through the promo code PATRIOT50X, which offers extra tokens.

Internet’ Comment Fanning The Flames,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-swift-battle-heats-up/,"The decades-long rivalry between Ripple and SWIFT took a new turn this week after a bold comment from SWIFT’s Chief Innovation Officer, Tom Zschach, drew sharp reactions from the Ripple and XRP community. Zschach argued that calling a private token a “ bridge currency ” was like calling a fax machine ”the internet.” The remark set off heated debates among Ripple supporters, many of whom felt the analogy was either misguided or a thinly veiled jab at XRP’s role in global cross-border settlements . Ripple Community Fires Back At SWIFT’s “Fax Machine” Remarks In a post on X social media, Zschach sparked controversy by dismissing the idea of private tokens serving as bridge currencies. His analogy of a fax machine and the internet ignited discussions across the Ripple community, adding that while private tokens can offer speed, they are only revolutionary in a world without WiFi. One Ripple supporter, known as 24HRSCRYPTO on X, countered Zschach’s analogy by flipping it back on SWIFT itself. They argued that SWIFT’s decades-old infrastructure resembled the fax machine while XRP represented the internet of value. Other community members pointed out that XRP is not a private token, but rather a publicly traded and openly accessible asset across the XRP Ledger, CEXs, and DEXs, highlighting its transparency compared to proprietary, bank-owned solutions. They also mocked Zschach for asking Grok what a private token was, suggesting it exposed a weak understanding of the subject and proved why SWIFT is slowly being replaced . The criticism of Zschach’s remarks went further when market analyst Crypto Sensei questioned why SWIFT had ignored blockchain technology for years if it truly lacked revolutionary value. He suggested that SWIFT’s recent experiments with digital assets only confirmed that blockchain was indeed a competitive force reshaping the global payments landscape. Ripple Dev Matt Hamilton also joined the discussion, emphasizing that public, permissionless tokens like XRP ultimately stand a better chance of adoption compared to private, closed systems that banks seek to control. The debates and discussions on X highlighted not just a clash of technologies, but a deeper battle between centralized legacy finance and decentralized open-source innovation. SWIFT’s Legacy Fees Face Scrutiny The controversy sparked by Zschach’s remarks did not stop there. In a detailed follow-up post, 24HRSCRYPTO exposed what they described as the hidden costs of the SWIFT system. Having worked within the industry, they revealed that sending a simple wire transfer could cost $17.50 from the sending bank and another $17.50 from the receiving bank, amounting to $35 in fees before the money is even moved. In some cases, if funds went missing, customers are charged an additional “investigation fee” just to trace their own transaction. According to the post, this fee-driven model highlighted how SWIFT’s profitability stemmed from friction rather than efficiency. Ripple, by contrast, seeks to eliminate that friction with near-instant settlement and transaction costs reduced to a fraction of a cent. 24HRSCRYPTO went further, stating that banks are already adapting to the evolving financial landscape by shifting to digital assets rather than clinging to outdated infrastructure. While banks may lose billions in transfer fees, the argument suggested they could regain financial ground by accumulating XRP, the new power of the emerging financial system.",Ripple|24HRSCRYPTO|CEXs|Crypto Sensei|DEXs|Matt Hamilton|ripple|ripple news|SWIFT|Tom Zschach|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-07 00:00:05

BNB Chain Partners With Chainlink Over the past 30 days, the BNB price has recorded an impressive 41% gain, driven in part by a recent collaboration between BNB Chain and Chainlink (LINK), dubbed as one of the market’s leading oracle providers. This partnership was publicly announced on Monday on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), where Chainlink revealed that BNB Chain had adopted its data standard to make official US Department of Commerce data available on-chain. Related Reading: XRP Ready For $9 Blast — ‘Break $3.10 And It’s Game Over,’ Says Analyst The data sourced from the Bureau of Economic Analysis will enable Chainlink Price Feeds to deliver critical macroeconomic indicators directly to BNB Chain. These indicators include key metrics like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers. Chainlink asserts that the availability of such data opens up a series of new possibilities for developers, allowing for the creation of new types of digital assets, prediction markets that leverage transparent economic inputs, and perpetual futures markets grounded in official government statistics. Furthermore, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can improve their risk management strategies by aligning them with real-world economic conditions. BNB Price Target Raised To $1,500 Market expert Crypto King has been vocal about the BNB price trajectory, asserting that the token is demonstrating a clear trend of upward momentum. He identified three significant breakout phases: one in July that sparked a strong rally, a second in September, and the current breakout, which he believes is building toward new highs. Crypto King has set an ambitious target of $1,500 for Binance Coin, suggesting that this structural climb is anything but random. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed After Hitting $125,700 All-Time High However, not all market analysts share the same optimism. Another expert, known as Crypto Claws on X, has issued a cautionary note, warning that if the current momentum fizzles, a correction toward the $700 range by December could be on the horizon. This scenario would imply a potential 43% decline for the BNB price, raising concerns about the token’s technical structure and the likelihood of a necessary pullback before the next significant bullish leg. In addition to the BNB price performance, other cryptocurrencies are also following the token’s lead. Bitcoin (BTC) has surged past the $125,000 mark, achieving a new record, while Ethereum (ETH) is just 5% shy of breaking its previous high. Meanwhile, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, remains well below its all-time high of $52.70, currently trading just under $23—a gap of nearly 57% that suggests room for growth.

With major asset managers such as Grayscale, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and Bitwise awaiting regulatory clearance, expectations are rising for how these funds could affect XRP’s market performance. Revised Forecast from Canary Capital’s CEO Steve McClurg, Chief Executive Officer of Canary Capital, recently updated his expectations for the launch of XRP ETFs. Earlier this year, he predicted approximately $5 billion in inflows during their first month of trading. However, during a recent appearance on the Paul Barron Network, McClurg stated that the initial projection may have been conservative. He clarified that while his previous estimate remains valid, inflows could potentially reach $10 billion in the same period. McClurg described this figure as achievable given the growing enthusiasm surrounding XRP ETFs and the current appetite for digital asset investment products. During the discussion, host Paul Barron noted that inflows of such magnitude could rank the XRP ETFs among the highest-performing launches in ETF history. McClurg agreed, adding that if this level of capital enters the market, the funds could easily be listed among the top 20 ETF debuts, and possibly among the top 10. Drawing from his own experience launching Bitcoin futures ETFs in a previous role, McClurg explained that those products recorded over $1 billion in their first day of trading. He described a $10 billion target for XRP ETFs as a realistic and attainable goal based on that precedent. Potential Market Reaction if $10 Billion Enters XRP ETFs If XRP ETFs were to secure $10 billion in inflows during their first month, analysts say the price implications could be substantial. The reason lies in the inflow-to-market-cap multiplier, an observed relationship in which each dollar of net inflow into XRP often increases its total market capitalization by a much larger factor. In May, market researcher Dom analyzed XRP’s trading behaviour and observed that $61 million in inflows had previously expanded XRP’s market capitalization by roughly $16.6 billion. This indicated a multiplier effect of around 272 times. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For a conservative analysis, even assuming a multiplier only one-fifth as strong, approximately 54 times, XRP would still experience major valuation growth. Based on that ratio, $10 billion of ETF inflows could elevate XRP’s market capitalization by approximately $540 billion. Price Projections Based on the Multiplier At present, XRP holds a market capitalization of $180 billion and trades at around $3 per token. If the market value were to increase by an additional $540 billion as a result of ETF inflows, the total capitalization would rise to about $720 billion. With an estimated circulating supply of 60 billion tokens, this would place XRP’s potential price at roughly $12 within the first month after the ETFs launch. While the forecast depends on several assumptions, including the persistence of the multiplier effect and the full realization of $10 billion in inflows, analysts emphasize that this is not an unrealistic scenario. Historically, XRP’s price movements have demonstrated higher multipliers during periods of increased liquidity and institutional activity. If the funds attract the investor attention anticipated by Canary Capital’s CEO, XRP could experience one of its most significant upward movements in recent years, positioning it as one of the top-performing digital assets following ETF approval.

This announcement came as Bitcoin spiked past $127,000 today, nearing its new all-time high as macroeconomic uncertainty and mounting political tensions in Washington pushed investors toward alternative assets. The world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed more than 15% over the past week, rebounding from about $109,000 at the end of September to touch $125,750 over the weekend, according to Bitbio data. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $124,728. The ongoing US government shutdown is giving Bitcoin another push. Now in its second week, the budget deadlock is fueling worries over fiscal instability and the dollar’s long-term credibility. The government shut down last week because Congress could not reach a common ground on funding. Consequently, it has resulted in several government employees losing their jobs and major restrictions on what federal agencies can do. The US government shutdown causes tension in the crypto ecosystem Several analysts have raised concerns about the US government shutdown, which might continue for weeks or even longer. In reports released by TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, under the leadership of Jaret Seiberg, the situation seems to be at a crucial stage as initiatives like the SEC’s actions to provide exemptions for crypto-related issues , such as tokenization, are currently stalling. According to Seiberg’s view on the topic of discussion, he pointed out that he did not expect the SEC to resume its significant policy changes for the crypto ecosystem unless an agreement to fund the government is struck. Analysts, such as Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, believe that Bitcoin’s role as a safe haven is being amplified by Washington’s gridlock. Kendrick believes that Bitcoin could reach $135,000 in the near term and potentially $200,000 by year’s end if current conditions persist. Since the Trump administration assumed duties in January, the commission has considered providing exemptions for newly released crypto products and similar help for digital asset companies offering tokenized stocks. However, considering the current shutdown status, there may be no improvements to these exemptions or any other crypto-related changes, said Seiberg. TD Cowen further explained that the situation is not evolving around the number of days the government is shutting down, but also the delays that will occur once staff resume work and try to catch up on what they missed. To solve this effectively, Seiberg urged that the government agency tackle any urgent matters it could not address during the shutdown. The SEC effectively halts its operations amid the US government shutdown The current SEC guidelines reveal that, due to the US government shutdown, the commission is functioning under a plan in which only a limited number of staff members can address emergencies. The agency has also put a hold on its approval processes for crypto exchange-traded funds. Notably, several of these ETFs were near approval. Examples of these crypto ETF proposals include ones that track DOGE, XRP, and LTC. This came after crypto companies submitted these proposals in 2024, after the regulatory environment in the crypto ecosystem became more favourable following President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Meanwhile, since the SEC is effectively closed, cryptocurrency policy will shift to other agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which are allowed to continue operating during shutdowns, according to Seiberg. In a statement, the managing director at TD Cowen expressed that they will continue to watch how banks get authority to issue stablecoins as custodians for crypto assets and create payment systems based on tokenization.

The proposal was posted on the Polygon Governance Forum and sent in by Venturefounder, an activist investor. The 2% inflation, he notes, also continues to introduce selling pressure and pull its POL price below bear-market lows for 2022. The objective of the plan is to stop inflation altogether, or at least gradually reduce it over the next few quarters, with assistance from the treasury for a buyback or token burn programme. Investors want Polygon to end inflation and stabilize the token value The Polygon community is inquiring about the reasons behind POL’s price drop of almost 46% over the past year, despite the project’s continued growth and development of new products. People believe the problem lies with the design of the token system, rather than with the team or technology. Venturefounder shared posts stated that the total number of tokens continues to grow, even as demand remains stagnant. He explained that the 2% yearly inflation rate adds approximately 200 million new POL tokens to the market every year, increasing the number of sellers and decreasing the number of buyers. Venturefounder also stated that the Polygon team has been slow in launching major projects, such as AggLayer, which aims to connect different blockchains within the Polygon ecosystem. These delays have disappointed the community because people expected faster progress. He said it’s about time the company fixes the issue once and for all, so the token can reflect the real value of the Polygon market. The activist suggested ending inflation immediately and making the total supply of POL tokens fixed permanently to help stabilize the price and increase the token’s value over time. He also proposed gradually reducing inflation (by 0.5% every quarter) until it reaches zero, giving the Polygon team more time to adjust to the change. The proposal also suggests a buyback and burn program to make the tokens scarcer and help support its price. Polygon would use 20% of its quarterly net revenue to buy POL tokens from the market and destroy them to reduce the total number of tokens in circulation. Venturefounder also wants Polygon to build an on-chain dashboard that shows live updates about the number of tokens in circulation and to stop discretionary token sales until the price stabilizes. Polygon leaders and users debate plan to restore confidence Many people in the community believe that this is one of the boldest reform ideas in Polygon’s history. The company’s leaders, Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron and co-founder Brendan Farmer, have both publicly recognized the proposal. Investors have also expressed frustration over watching the POL token lose a significant portion of its value, even as Polygon continues to develop strong technology and expand its partnerships. However, validators feel that an end to inflation will make it harder for them to continue operating their validator nodes, because they receive part of their rewards from the newly created tokens. Many users in the discussion support the idea of using Polygon’s treasury funds or transaction fees to cover validator rewards, rather than printing new tokens. Meanwhile, the Layer-2 blockchain space is heating up with projects such as Arbitrum , Optimism, and Base drawing significant interest. This is thanks to their speed and low transaction costs, as well as their active user bases. These projects have stolen some of the market share that was once an exclusive preserve for Polygon. Market experts say the changes could inspire other blockchain projects with similar inflation issues to follow a similar path. Some analysts even believe that POL could regain its position among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in the coming years, provided the community approves the proposal.

Investors are looking for utility-packed altcoins that can potentially deliver exponential returns as well as big market tailwinds. Among those receiving the most interest now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi token with a value of a $0.035 whose presale is already over 60% sold. Over 16,770 holders have taken advantage of the presale with over $16.85 million raised. Mutuum Finance is a high-potential alternative for investors seeking next-generation growth in 2025 even when BTC is hogging the limelight. Bitcoin Experiences New Price Discovery Beyond $125,500 Bitcoin (BTC) has registered one of its most powerful ascents of the year, rising nearly 14% in seven days to be trading at about $122,370, just below the significant $124,000 level. The rally has been led by robust U.S. demand, evidenced through a $1.6 billion surge in on-chain buying activity and a large $92 Coinbase premium gap, both of which indicate greater institutional accumulation. Supporting the bullish momentum are shifting Federal Reserve monetary positions and revived optimism for a blockbuster Q4, as Bitcoin now finds resistance at $130,000. A solid breakout above $125,500 would push BTC into new price-discovery territory, potentially setting the stage for the remainder of the next leg higher for the rest of the market, and offering investors an entry to think about high-upside potential Mutuum Finance as part of a diversified 2025 portfolio strategy. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Mutuum Finance has given early birds the special privilege of purchasing MUTM tokens for less money before the project goes public. Phase 6 tokens priced at $0.035 have been highly sought after, raking in more than $16.85 million from more than 16,770 buyers. Numbers say a lot about market interest and increasing faith in the potential of the long-term project’s future. Mutuum Finance has just announced the launch of its native lending and borrowing protocol , a breakthrough in decentralized finance. V1 of the protocol will go live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include the primary building blocks like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Supported day one for borrowing, lending, and collateralization with ETH and USDT already available, the platform is poised to offer a scalable and robust platform for users of DeFi. Apart from protecting the platform and engaging with the community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program that boasts an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty fund. The program encourages white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to submit information on vulnerabilities in the codebase and have rewards disbursed based on severity. By doing this, even the less critical issues are fixed in the real time and the overall security of the platform is made sure to be at its best. Top Crypto to Invest in With Bitcoin (BTC) pushing toward fresh all-time highs and the overall crypto market cap jumping past $4.21 trillion, the stage is set for altcoins that have real-world utility to generate disproportionate returns in the next bull run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is perhaps the most promising one in this space, priced at just $0.035, already more than 60% sold in Stage 6, backed by more than 16,770 holders, and raising more than $16.85 million.

The move coincides with heavy whale accumulation, over 30 million DOGE scooped up in 24 hours, and notable exchange outflows topping $25 million, signaling coins moving to cold storage. Related Reading: TRX Repeats Its 2021 Setup: Volume Cooldown Signals Smart Money Accumulation With price compressing just beneath a dense resistance cluster, traders are asking the big question: is a 20% breakout to over $0.30 next? DOGE's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD chart from Tradingview Whales Accumulate as Exchange Balances Fall On-chain data paints a constructive backdrop. Large holders added more than 30 million DOGE as spot demand returned, while net outflows from exchanges suggest decreasing sell-side inventory. That tightening supply, coupled with rising participation from both short- and long-term holders (per HODL Waves), supports the idea that conviction is building beneath price. Meanwhile, the Spent Coins Age Band has dropped sharply, implying fewer dormant coins are being moved, even as price rises, often a hallmark of early uptrends. Key Levels to Watch $0.26 Trigger, $0.30–$0.34 Targets Technically, DOGE is coiling under a 0.618 Fibonacci retracement near $0.2626, a level analysts such as The Great Mattsby flag as the immediate “doorway” to momentum. The resistance band stretches through $0.26–$0.28, reinforced by the weekly Ichimoku cloud edge and the 50-week MA, creating a high-confluence ceiling. A daily/weekly close above $0.2626–$0.275 would flip multiple trend filters and validate a push toward $0.30, with $0.32–$0.34 (20% higher) the next logical zone. Above there, historical Fibonacci checkpoints at $0.33–$0.35 and $0.41 come into play. On the downside, $0.24–$0.25 remains key first support (former breakout/retest area), followed by $0.23 and $0.22. Losing $0.24 would dent the near-term structure and risk a deeper pullback into the mid-$0.20s. On-Chain and Technicals Hint at 20% Breakout Price recently broke a descending channel, then cleanly retested the upper boundary as support classic reversal behavior. Momentum gauges back the move, as the +DI sits above –DI with a rising ADX, the MACD has flipped positive, and DOGE continues to ride an ascending channel that’s guided higher lows since summer. Some analysts also note a rising megaphone on higher time frames, where a sustained close above the upper rail could accelerate toward $0.70 later this cycle. Related Reading: Cardano Price To Hit $7.82 This Bull Run — Analyst Says It’s ‘On Track To Meet Targets’ With whales buying, exchange supply thinning, and price compressing under a high-confluence ceiling, DOGE has the ingredients for a 20% breakout, provided it can secure a decisive close above $0.2626–$0.275. Until then, expect continued range-trading between $0.24–$0.28 as the market builds energy for the next move.

What is driving the current Chainlink price decline? Chainlink price has fallen amid heavy spot selling after a whale deposited 700,000 LINK to an exchange and sold at a loss, while on-chain demand metrics — active addresses and transaction counts — contracted sharply. These combined signals increase the probability of further downside to $20.3 if selling persists. How did whale activity and spot flows impact LINK? On-chain monitors reported a whale deposit of 700,000 LINK (about $15.52M) to an exchange, recorded at a $2.76M loss. Spot Taker CVD stayed negative for seven days, and Exchange Netflow turned positive for two consecutive days, indicating more tokens moved to exchanges for sale. Such concentrated selling from large holders pressures price and liquidity. Chainlink whale offloads at a loss After a brief rebound, sellers re-entered, pushing Chainlink back below its recent resistance. Spot Taker CVD and exchange inflows show sellers dominating order flow for the past week. Large-scale selling by wallets with significant balances often signals lower short-term confidence among major holders. On-chain Lens reported the deposit; the whale realized an approximate $2.76M loss on the trade. Historically, such loss-taking by whales precedes amplified selling pressure as other market participants react to liquidity changes and realized-loss events. Why are retail investors contributing to the sell-off? Retail traders have also increased selling: Coinalyze data shows seven days of negative Buy-Sell Delta, with 1.77M in Sell Volume vs 1.25M Buy Volume on October 6. A negative Buy-Sell Delta of -523.7k confirms aggressive spot selling from smaller addresses, compounding pressure from whales. Exchange deposits rose, with CryptoQuant showing a netflow of ~136k LINK at press time. Elevated exchange inflows typically precede more liquid selling and create short-term supply pressure. How has on-chain demand changed for LINK? On-chain demand has weakened significantly. CryptoQuant shows Active Addresses at a weekly low (~6k) and Total Transactions collapsed from 432.7k to 18k. Declining unique addresses and transaction counts indicate fewer participants interacting with the network, a bearish signal for short- to medium-term price action. Is LINK eyeing more losses? Current indicators place LINK at higher risk of a further decline. If selling pressure and low on-chain activity continue, expect a breach of $22 support and a move toward $20.3. Alternatively, exhaustion of selling and a resurgence in active addresses could enable a rebound above $23.1 toward $24.9. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the whale sale and what loss did it trigger? The whale deposited 700,000 LINK (~$15.52M) to an exchange and reportedly realized a loss of about $2.76M on that position, signalling reduced conviction among large holders. What on-chain signals should traders watch for a reversal? Watch for (1) shrinking Exchange Netflow (lower deposits), (2) rising Active Addresses and Total Transactions, and (3) a shift to neutral/positive Buy-Sell Delta; these suggest buyer return and potential price stabilization. Key Takeaways Whale selling : 700,000 LINK deposit and realized loss signaled bearish intent. Retail and spot flows : Negative Buy-Sell Delta and positive exchange netflow confirm aggressive selling. On-chain demand collapse : Active addresses and transactions down sharply; sustained drops favor further downside to $20.3 unless conditions change. Conclusion Chainlink is facing substantive sell pressure driven by a major whale sale and widespread spot selling, while on-chain metrics show lower network engagement. Traders should monitor exchange netflow, Buy-Sell Delta and active addresses for signs of exhaustion or recovery; COINOTAG will update this analysis as new data arrives. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/chainlink-whale-sell-analysis-2025-10-07"" }, ""headline"": ""Chainlink Faces Strong Sell Pressure After 700,000 LINK Whale Deposit"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chainlink-Spot-Taker-CVDCumulative-Volume-Delta-90-day-1.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Chainlink price under pressure after a 700,000 LINK whale sale and collapsing on-chain demand, prompting further downside risk toward $20.3 unless selling eases.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How large was the whale sale and what loss did it trigger?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A whale deposited 700,000 LINK (~$15.52M) to an exchange and realized an estimated $2.76M loss, indicating reduced confidence among major holders."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What on-chain signals should traders watch for a reversal?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Traders should monitor Exchange Netflow, Active Addresses, Total Transactions and Buy-Sell Delta for declining exchange deposits and rising user activity as signs of potential reversal."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to respond to Chainlink sell pressure"", ""description"": ""A short checklist for traders to manage risk during Chainlink selling events."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor on-chain flow"", ""text"": ""Check Exchange Netflow and large deposits; sustained positive netflow suggests continued selling."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch user activity"", ""text"": ""Track Active Addresses and Total Transactions; rising metrics can signal demand recovery."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Manage position sizing"", ""text"": ""Scale exposure and set stop-losses around key supports ($22 and $20.3) to limit downside risk."" } ]}",News|FLOW|LINK,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|LINK|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-07 01:08:55

Wynn’s history of turning small meme coin bets into massive profits may repeat with the latest YEPE meme coin. But insider dominance is evident. Bubblemap Reveals Pattern According to the analysis by Bubblemap, insiders currently hold roughly 60% of YEPE, and a significant portion of these holdings are coming from addresses funded through the same centralized exchanges, LBank, KuCoin, and MEXC. These addresses reportedly exhibit similar funding behaviors and buying patterns, which point to coordinated or highly structured accumulation strategies. Bubblemap argued that the recurring pattern behind Wynn’s meme coin promotions is one of manufactured hype, and often amplified by coordinated influencer campaigns that help fuel demand at launch. On-chain data reveals that these surges typically benefit a small group of insiders, who consistently accumulate and hold a large share of the token supply. Despite the growing criticism of such moves and the concerns it raises around potential market manipulation, Wynn has continued to build visibility within the industry and has also received public endorsements from high-profile figures, including Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. For many observers, such backing risks normalizing practices that resemble insider-driven trading activity, blurring the line between aggressive promotion and outright manipulation in the meme coin sector. The Wynn Effect Wynn, a pseudonymous crypto trader who rose to prominence between 2022 and 2023 through early investments in meme coins, has a history of using high leverage and aggressive trading techniques. His breakout moment came when he transformed a modest $7,000 investment in PEPE into a multimillion-dollar gain. That trade established hallmarks of his approach, which are high-leverage positions, bold risk-taking, and a narrative-driven strategy, often promoted publicly on social media. Since then, Wynn has repeatedly entered the market with similarly structured trades, promoting bundled meme coins like WIFE, ZEUS, and USDM, sometimes leveraging decentralized derivatives platforms such as Hyperliquid to magnify returns. In early 2025, Wynn’s activity on Hyperliquid drew attention, as he executed positions with leverage up to 40x on notional amounts reaching billions of dollars. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, however, cast doubt on Wynn’s high-profile trades and even questioned whether the pseudonymous investor’s real aim is profit or simply attention. In a discussion shared by Unchained host Laura Shin, Hayes said that Wynn’s actions looked more like “airdrop farming” than billion-dollar Bitcoin bets.

After several weeks of consolidation, the crypto market is showing signs of renewed strength, and analysts are calling this period one of the most favorable entry points for altcoins in years. Bitcoin remains steady around $123,000, Ethereum trades at $4,520, and overall crypto market capitalization has surpassed $4.2 trillion. But what’s capturing the most attention now is not the established giants – it’s the smaller, fast-rising altcoins that could multiply in value as capital begins to rotate across the market. Amid this growing optimism, early investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project that has made headlines for its record-breaking presale and rapid community growth. Analysts believe it could deliver one of the strongest performances of the next cycle as altcoin demand accelerates. Why the Timing Looks Right Every major crypto cycle has had a window when market confidence returns before new highs are reached. According to several on-chain analytics firms, that window is now open. Bitcoin’s supply held by long-term holders is at an all-time high, while exchange inflows have dropped sharply – both signs of accumulation. Historically, when large holders stop selling and new investors begin entering the market, altcoins tend to outperform. This pattern was seen in 2017, again in 2021, and is now repeating as the fourth quarter of 2025 unfolds. The combination of stabilized inflation, improving liquidity, and growing ETF inflows has created an environment where confidence is returning across the board. With volatility easing, traders are beginning to shift capital from Bitcoin and Ethereum into smaller-cap assets that have room for exponential growth. Altcoins Gaining Ground While top coins hold steady, the altcoin sector is quietly gaining momentum. Tokens like Solana, XRP, and Avalanche have all risen more than 10 percent over the past week, supported by growing institutional exposure and stronger technical indicators. However, the real excitement is emerging in newer or undervalued projects. On-chain data shows that trading volumes for sub-$1 tokens have doubled since early September. This surge indicates that retail traders are becoming more active again – the same group that historically drives parabolic rallies once the market turns fully bullish. Analysts expect that if Bitcoin remains above $120,000 through October, the next leg of altcoin growth could begin within weeks, pushing total crypto capitalization closer to $5 trillion. A New Opportunity Outshines Most Altcoins In the middle of this resurgence, MAGACOIN FINANCE has established itself as one of the most talked-about opportunities of the year. What’s impressive is how MAGACOIN has managed to combine rapid adoption with full transparency. Audited by HashEx and CertiK, the project meets the strictest security standards in the presale space. But beyond its verified credibility, MAGACOIN’s momentum has been fueled by retail investors who see it as the perfect timing play for the coming altcoin season. Analysts believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could perform better than SHIBA INU’s early days, given its structured launch, limited supply, and fast-growing international community. Its model focuses on creating sustainable long-term value instead of speculative short-term hype, giving it an edge over most new projects entering the market. Social data also supports the trend. Mentions of MAGACOIN FINANCE on X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram have increased sharply in the past two weeks, with investors from the U.S., Europe, and Asia joining in. The combination of transparency, scarcity, and timing has positioned MAGACOIN as one of the most promising altcoins for those looking to enter before the next market surge. Altcoin Season Indicators Turning Bullish Several indicators suggest that the long-anticipated altcoin season could be approaching. The Altcoin Season Index has climbed above 75, a level that typically signals a shift in market focus away from Bitcoin dominance. Trading activity on decentralized exchanges has also reached a three-month high, led by liquidity in smaller-cap assets. Historical data shows that when altcoin trading volume grows at this rate, the sector often enters a multi-month period of strong performance. This environment is ideal for presales and new tokens to achieve rapid growth, as investor appetite for high-risk, high-reward opportunities increases. A Market Driven by Strategy, Not Hype Unlike previous cycles, the current rally appears more strategic. Investors are looking for transparency, real utility, and long-term potential instead of short-lived viral coins. That shift is why audited and structured projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting more attention than purely speculative plays. As regulations tighten globally, investors are becoming more cautious about where they place their capital. MAGACOIN’s verified audits and steady roadmap offer the kind of reassurance many traders are now prioritizing. It’s a sign that the market is maturing, even as it continues to deliver outsized gains for early participants. Conclusion After months of uncertainty, the crypto market has regained its footing, and altcoins are ready to take center stage once again. Historical patterns, on-chain metrics, and growing investor participation all point to one conclusion — this might be the best time in years to enter the altcoin market. As retail traders and institutions position for the next rally, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading the charge, combining explosive growth potential with strong fundamentals and verified trust. For those looking to make strategic moves before the next breakout, the opportunity window appears wide open – but it may not stay that way for long.

52774836,599279,1759800644,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52774836.jpeg,Russia Wants Answers: Central Bank To Track Every Crypto Ruble,https://bitcoinist.com/russia-wants-answers-central-bank-to-track-every-crypto-ruble/,"According to reports, the Bank of Russia is planning a large-scale audit of the nation’s cryptocurrency holdings and activity in early 2026. The review is described as a broad check that would gather data from banks, crypto firms, miners and tax authorities, and could run during the first two months of 2026. Officials say the goal is to map out unreported flows and loans tied to crypto, but details remain thin. Audit To Target Banks And Firms Reports have disclosed the audit would look at investments in crypto by regulated lenders, any lending or financing linked to crypto businesses, and flows through infrastructure providers. Journalists citing Russian outlets say the central bank plans to cross-reference data from miners, exchanges and the Federal Tax Service to spot gaps between reported activity and actual transfers. The scope, based on these accounts, could include both on-chain movement and off-balance sheet arrangements that touch banks. No Official Announcement Seen Based on available coverage, there is no clear, direct statement from the Bank of Russia posted as a public press release. Most stories trace back to national media summaries and analyst writeups. That means several important points are uncertain: whether participation by banks and firms would be mandatory; which years or months the audit would cover; and how the central bank defines “crypto holdings” — whether private wallets, foreign accounts, derivatives, or stablecoin exposures are included. Context And Recent Moves The check comes while Russia continues to patch together a framework for crypto activity. Reports note a split between agencies: some ministries favor clearer rules and taxation for crypto business, while the central bank appears inclined toward tighter oversight to protect financial stability. The notification appears just after other significant stories about crypto flows attributed to Russian-affiliated entities — such as the Kremlin-backed crypto coin that transferred $6 billion since US sanctions — raising concerns of large flows and the risk of sanctions evasion. Implications For Compliance And Tax If the audit results in a finding of significant unreported holdings or lending, there could be ramifications regarding additional reporting responsibilities for banks and increased capital charges for crypto risk. The tax authorities may also leverage this knowledge to pursue unreported tax on gains or interest. Market participants say the likely outcome would be more paperwork, greater checks on correspondent relationships, and stronger demands for proof of source of funds when banks deal with crypto firms.

Based on his argument, while there is urgency for the Fed to balance between having strict policies and those eased, it should concentrate mainly on the threats encompassing cases of high inflation. This announcement came after Schmid highly backed the Fed’s decision to reduce interest rates by 0.25% in September. He viewed this approach as sensible amid the sluggish job market. Concerning Schmid’s reluctance to make further cuts, reports reveal that the Federal Reserve of the United States Chair, Jerome Powell, faces challenges settling an agreement on the Fed’s next rate decision in the coming weeks. High inflation levels raise concerns about interest rate cuts Apart from Schmid, several other Fed officials have also raised concerns about further rate cuts, arguing that this could result in higher inflation. Examples of these officials include Lorie Logan from the Dallas Fed and Beth Hammack from the Cleveland Fed. On the other hand, Stephen Miran, an American economist who has served as the newest Federal Reserve Board of Governors member, disagreed with the above reasoning and continued to advocate for deeper rate cuts in the upcoming meetings. Despite Miran embracing his viewpoint for deeper rate cuts, he has gained support from other Fed officials like Michelle Bowman, the Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, and Mary Daly, the President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. According to the officials’ argument, they recommend significant rate cuts because this could help address further declines in the job market. In the meantime, as debates intensify over interest rate cuts, tension among individuals has also escalated. To address these concerns, Schmid shared with the CFA Society Kansas City that he believes several companies are postponing hiring amid uncertainties surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump’s extensive tariff policies and considering how AI could impact their future workforce requirements. However, he pointed out certain signs, such as a 4.3% unemployment rate, demonstrating that the job market is potentially strong. At the same time, he mentioned that inflation remains at high levels, with inflation related to services stabilizing at approximately 3.5% in recent months, considerably higher than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. “One concerning trend is that price hikes are occurring more often,” Schmid mentioned to the CFA Society Kansas City. He further pointed out that by August, around 80% of categories tracked in official inflation data had experienced a price upswing, up from 70% at the beginning of the year. Afterwards, Schmid stated that he generally expected tariffs to have a limited impact on inflation. Still, he views this as evidence that policy is balanced rather than a reason to make significant interest rate cuts. Federal Reserve policymakers face challenges in making decisions on interest rate cuts Regarding the situation, Schmid noted that Federal Reserve policymakers were facing difficulties in making decisions. If they reduce interest rates to aid the job market, it could also fuel inflation. On the other hand, maintaining high rates to bring down inflation could cause unemployment to rise. Interestingly, Fed Chair Powell had also mentioned this balancing act. In a statement, Schmid stated, “Constraints lead to hard decisions on how to balance various goals, and the Fed must handle these difficult choices concerning inflation and jobs.” He also pointed out that in managing this challenge, he believes the Fed needs to maintain its credibility on inflation. In the meantime, the economy is demonstrating strength, and spending on AI-related software has boosted business investment, which normally falls when interest rates are high, Schmid said. His remarks followed his observation that equity markets are near all-time highs and corporate bond spreads are at their tightest.

52775304,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=829396,1759801047,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52775304.jpeg,Democrats push robot tax as AI threatens jobs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ai-job-losses-spur-robot-tax-push/,"A new Senate report warns that artificial intelligence could displace nearly 100 million U.S. jobs within the next ten years, prompting Democrats to call for a “robot tax” on companies that replace human workers with machines. Sen. Bernie Sanders led Democratic staffers on the Senate HELP Committee to study 20 major job sectors and found that AI or robots could replace more than half of the jobs in 15 of them. Democrats want a robot tax to protect workers Democrats are worried that automation will cause millions of people to lose their jobs and want to slow it down by making companies pay a “robot tax” when they replace human workers with machines, robots, or AI. Sanders and his team on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee state that the money the government collects from these taxes will be used to assist individuals who lose their jobs. Sanders said it’s a way of making sure companies don’t make huge profits while leaving regular workers without help or support. Business leaders also want companies to be accountable for what happens when machines take over jobs. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has even stated that companies that generate profits by replacing workers with AI or robots should contribute to addressing the issues that automation creates. Democrats warn that automation could make inequality worse, push many people out of the workforce, and create an economy where machines earn most of the money while ordinary workers lose their jobs. AI threatens millions of jobs in multiple sectors A new report from the United States Senate warns that approximately 3 million jobs in fast food and counter service are at risk, which accounts for nearly 89% of all workers in that field. Millions of people will struggle to pay for everyday needs because they will lose their income, health benefits, and financial security. Families, communities, and the businesses they depend on will also feel the effects, and this will cause bigger economic problems if lawmakers don’t prepare the people for a future where machines do more of the work that people used to do. People in higher-paying or office-based jobs are also at risk, as the report indicated that 80% of current positions in customer service, freight and material moving, and office jobs, such as executive assistants, could be eliminated. Workers may need to acquire new skills, transition into a different career, or shift into a new industry to continue earning a living. The report recommends that lawmakers provide training, education, and financial support to prepare individuals for the significant changes that will result from the increasing adoption of automation in industries and workplaces. The study was partly informed by answers from AI systems like ChatGPT and suggests that automation will also spread rapidly into jobs that require interacting with customers, organizing information, scheduling, managing offices, and even performing complex tasks. The impact of AI will reach almost all parts of the economy and affect millions of workers in both low-wage and higher-paying positions if government leaders do not take immediate action. Sanders has called this situation “an economic crossroads” because lawmakers will influence the future of work for years to come. Millions of Americans could face long-term unemployment or underemployment, and the economy could become more focused on machines and profits than on people.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The conventional wisdom holds that the battle for Asia's crypto hub is a contest between Singapore and Hong Kong. Both cities have English as an official language and use Western-inspired common law in their court system. But during Token2049, executives weren't debating whether Singapore or Hong Kong would win the title of Asia’s crypto hub. Instead, they were talking about how Japan, once written off as overregulated, had quietly become the region’s most credible market for real trading volume, staking infrastructure, and institutional growth. “Japan had no regulation for a long time, don't forget, that's where crypto basically happened, and then it went super stringent, and nothing happened for a long time,"" Konstantin Richter, the CEO of Blockdaemon, told CoinDesk during Token2049. ""But people kept on chiming away, and now they actually have a regulatory infrastructure that’s institutionally scalable and about ready to pop. Whereas here [in Singapore], it was a free fall, and now they're starting to build up regulation.” Singapore moved fast and then tightened. It opened its doors early to crypto firms, building a reputation as Asia’s sandbox for innovation. That worked, until it didn’t. The collapse of FTX and other failures exposed weak consumer protections, prompting the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to swing toward heavy supervision in 2024 . The result: higher compliance costs, mandatory custody segregation, external audits, and slower licensing. Those that don't like it have to leave, even if they aren't serving Singapore-based customers. It's a lot of work for a relatively small market. “Singapore was so crypto-friendly that everyone wanted to come here,” Richter said. “Then it built up, things happened, and suddenly you’re like, wait a minute, we do need more stringent rules.” Japan, by contrast, did its hard regulatory work years ago. Following Mt. Gox (2014) and Coincheck (2018), Japanese regulators had already imposed strict licensing, segregation, and onshore custody rules long before FTX imploded. By 2025, instead of tightening, Japan is opening slightly: allowing institutional staking, setting a pathway for crypto-backed ETFs , and clarifying how firms can offer yield. Unlike Singapore’s innovation-first, regulate-later approach, Japan’s regulators wrote detailed rules for custody, segregation, and security years ago. Exchanges must hold client assets separately and use domestic validators, creating the kind of environment institutional investors prefer. Richter said Asian clients, particularly in Japan, are willing to pay for institutional-grade infrastructure, a contrast, he noted, to Europe, where customers are typically more price-driven. The shift isn’t just regulatory. Japan's almost invisible yield – the Bank of Japan only ended negative rates last year – makes staking unusually attractive: a 3 % ETH yield is 30 times higher than domestic treasury returns. That’s why Blockdaemon and other node operators see Tokyo as the next major destination for institutional staking flows. Derivatives exchange BitMEX is also taking notice. In a recent interview with CoinDesk , BitMEX CEO Stephan Lutz said the exchange had just moved its data center to Amazon Web Services' facility in Tokyo to be closer to where the action is. Japan’s crypto framework, once criticized for being too strict, now gives it a clear edge: predictable oversight, investor protection, and rising institutional yield. Now, the question is, how will the usual hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore compete? Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin surged past $126,000 in a “perfect storm” of macro tailwinds. Yet this latest breakout above $125,000 came largely from non-institutional demand. With ETF inflows paused and retail traders fueling momentum through high perpetual funding rates, BTC’s resilience above prior highs suggests whales are holding steady and scarcity narratives are deepening. ETH: Ethereum traded around $4,705, extending its recent strength on renewed interest in on-chain fundamentals, upgrade optimism, and rotation from BTC to altcoins, as BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) added 179,251 ETH last week, bringing its holdings to 2.83 million tokens worth $13.4 billion, in a bid to control 5% of Ethereum’s supply and solidify its position as the second-largest listed crypto treasury after Strategy. Gold: Gold traded around $3,960, nearing Bank of America’s long-held $4,000 target, but the bank’s analysts now warn the metal looks overbought and could face a Q4 consolidation after a 50% yearly rally, even as longer-term charts still leave room for gains toward $5,000–$7,000 if the bull cycle continues. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 hit another record high Tuesday, boosted by a Wall Street tech rally and strong chip stocks following the OpenAI-AMD deal, extending gains after Sanae Takaichi’s election as Japan’s next prime minister, which fueled optimism over pro-growth policies.

As a result, crypto analysts are confident that the top cryptocurrency by market cap may be on the cusp of a healthy rally. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Slump Amid New ATH According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ChainSpan, fresh on-chain data shows that the average amount of BTC inflows into exchanges such as Binance has decreased significantly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharpe-Like Ratio Shows Market In Wait-and-See Mode At $119,000 To recall, BTC sent to exchanges is usually seen as a warning sign, as it suggests that investors are attempting to sell their holdings at prevailing market prices. As a result, high inflows to exchanges typically create selling pressure on the underlying asset’s price. On the contrary, a decrease in exchange inflows indicates that BTC holders are opting to hold their assets in cold wallets. One of the cascading effects of lower exchange inflows is that it could lead to a “supply crunch” for BTC, which may lead to extraordinary price appreciation in a short duration. ChainSpan noted that as Bitcoin’s price surged from $108,000 to $125,000 over the past few weeks, the inflow average for the cryptocurrency has dropped from 0.55 to 0.48. This suggests that the current rally is being driven by organic market demand and holding behavior. Put simply, the increase in BTC’s price is not happening in tandem with a speculative selling wave, but rather on a foundation of reduced selling pressure. The analyst added: In the short term, this backdrop supports the upward trend. Yet, if large inflows into exchanges suddenly appear in the coming days, it could be a sign that major players are preparing to sell. In such a case, a short-term correction in the price may follow. The CryptoQuant analyst concluded by saying that although the current market conditions point toward low selling intent and strong demand for BTC, a sudden spike in exchange inflows could derail the digital asset’s momentum. As a result, investors should keep a close eye on the metric. Will BTC Surge Further In Q4? While BTC has already created a new ATH, some crypto analysts forecast that the digital asset may record more gains in the coming quarter. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital predicted that BTC could peak sometime in mid-November. Related Reading: A Breakout To New Highs? Bitcoin’s Bullish Wave Eyes $130k As RSI Stays Firm Similarly, recent analysis by the team at The Bull Theory forecasts that BTC may surge as high as $143,000 in October. Historically, October has been one of the strongest months for BTC in terms of price appreciation. That said, BTC must first ensure it decisively breaks through the stiff resistance at $125,000 and defends the support level at $118,000. At press time, BTC trades at $125,189, up 1.9% in the past 24 hours.

Technical pattern repeats: weekly RSI and Fibonacci alignment suggest breakout potential. Ripple privacy tools (zero-knowledge proofs) aim to enable compliant institutional flows and tokenized RWAs. Whale data is mixed: large transfers indicate accumulation while CryptoQuant shows recent outflows. XRP price outlook: get a concise update on Ripple privacy tools, technical setup, and whale flows — read the latest analysis and implications for traders. What is XRP’s 2025 price outlook? XRP price outlook shows a bullish technical setup: weekly RSI and Fibonacci bands echo 2017 and 2021 pre-breakout conditions. Combined with Ripple’s planned privacy tools for institutions, the environment may support renewed momentum, though mixed whale behavior warrants caution. How does the weekly technical setup compare to past runs? The weekly chart displays consolidation around mid-Fibonacci bands — the same zone that preceded major rallies in 2017 and 2021. RSI remains below the overbought 70 level, a historical precursor to strong upward moves. Short-term momentum has slowed, but the pattern’s repetition increases the probability of a similar trajectory if volume and institutional flows rise. Ripple [XRP] has re-emerged as the third-largest crypto by market capitalization after a late-2024 breakout. Price hovered near $3 at press time, retracing about 1% in 24 hours but maintaining the broader structure formed over recent months. Will the next breakout mirror history? Weekly price action shows XRP trading near levels that previously triggered extended rallies. The move to $3 in late 2024 completed a pattern that historically preceded sharper advances. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sitting below 70 has historically aligned with the early stages of XRP surges. If momentum and on-chain inflows increase, the technical alignment could translate into a follow-through breakout. Source: TradingView How will Ripple privacy tools affect XRP adoption? Ripple announced a phased privacy framework using zero-knowledge proofs to enable private, compliant transactions on the XRPL. The rollout aims to support tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and compliant DeFi use cases, increasing institutional interest. J. Ayo Akinyele, Head of Engineering at Ripple, said the framework will go live in stages, with the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard expected by 2026. That standard is intended to unlock new on-chain liquidity channels for institutions that require privacy plus compliance. Source: X What are whale flows signaling now? On-chain transfers show mixed sentiment. Whale Alert reported a transfer of ~18.74 million XRP (~$55.87 million) to an unknown wallet, suggesting accumulation. Conversely, CryptoQuant data indicates notable capital outflows from whale wallets over the past three months, signaling increased caution. Source: CryptoQuant Frequently Asked Questions How soon could XRP follow prior breakout timelines? Historical cycles show breakouts can unfold over months after consolidation. If institutional flows and on-chain volume rise alongside technical confirmation (higher weekly close and increased RSI), an accelerated breakout could occur within the next 1–6 months. Are Ripple’s privacy tools compliant with regulations? Ripple’s framework prioritizes compliance using zero-knowledge proofs and staged rollouts. The Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard aims to balance privacy with regulatory requirements for institutional adoption. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is XRP's 2025 price outlook?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""XRP's 2025 price outlook is cautiously optimistic: repeating technical patterns and planned privacy tools could fuel a breakout, but mixed whale flows warrant risk management."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How will Ripple privacy tools impact institutional adoption?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Ripple's privacy tools using zero-knowledge proofs aim to enable compliant private transactions and tokenized RWAs, improving institutional on-chain participation."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""XRP price outlook: Technical setup and Ripple privacy tools shape 2025 outlook"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/b5ae9634b3dd4fbb86eb8a6f6c4e580d.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-06T17:35:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-06T17:35:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-2025-outlook"" }, ""description"": ""XRP price outlook: weekly technicals mirror past cycles and Ripple's privacy tools could draw institutional liquidity, while whale flows remain mixed.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess XRP breakout potential"", ""description"": ""Three steps to evaluate whether XRP is set for a breakout."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Check weekly technicals"", ""text"": ""Confirm weekly RSI is below overbought levels and price is consolidating near key Fibonacci bands."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Monitor on-chain flows"", ""text"": ""Track large transfers and exchange flows to gauge accumulation or distribution by whales."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Evaluate institutional signals"", ""text"": ""Watch for product rollouts and privacy/compliance updates, such as Ripple's zero-knowledge framework and MPT standard timelines."" } ]} Key Takeaways Pattern repetition : Weekly RSI and Fibonacci alignment resemble 2017/2021 setups. Institutional catalyst : Ripple privacy tools (zero-knowledge proofs, MPT) could unlock RWAs and institutional flows. Risk signal : Whale outflows on CryptoQuant contrast with large individual transfers; manage position sizing accordingly. Conclusion In summary, the XRP price outlook for 2025 combines a bullish technical narrative with a plausible institutional catalyst from Ripple’s privacy framework. Traders should watch weekly confirmations, on-chain whale behavior, and the phased rollout of the MPT standard for clearer directional signals. Stay informed and manage risk as patterns evolve.

A7A5 sanctions: EU may ban dealings with the ruble-backed stablecoin A7A5—read the latest implications for markets and banks. Learn what investors should watch next. EU officials are reviewing a proposal to sanction A7A5, the largest non‑USD pegged stablecoin, and to restrict banks in Russia, Belarus and Central Asia for enabling crypto transactions tied to sanctioned actors. What are the proposed A7A5 sanctions? A7A5 sanctions would forbid EU-based individuals and organisations from directly or indirectly transacting with the ruble-backed token. The proposal also flags several regional banks for allegedly facilitating crypto flows tied to sanctioned entities, seeking to close channels used to bypass existing restrictions. How did A7A5’s market cap react to earlier sanctions? A week after EU crypto platform sanctions were announced on Sept. 19, A7A5’s market capitalization jumped from about $140 million to over $491 million on Sept. 26, a one‑day increase near 250%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The market cap has since stabilized near $500 million, roughly 43% of the $1.2 billion total for non‑USD stablecoins. A7A5’s market capitalization surged 250% a week after the EU first imposed sanctions. Source: CoinMarketCap Why is the EU targeting banks in Russia, Belarus and Central Asia? The EU proposal names banks it says enabled crypto-related transactions for sanctioned parties. Targeting intermediaries is intended to cut off on‑ramps and correspondent channels used to move value across borders, complementing earlier restrictions imposed by the UK and the US. Who created A7A5 and what infrastructure supports it? A7A5 launched in February on Ethereum and Tron and is associated with Moldovan banker Ilan Shor and the Russian state-owned lender Promsvyazbank. The token was promoted as being backed by fiat deposits held in banks within Kyrgyzstan’s network; exchanges and infrastructure in Kyrgyzstan have been previously blacklisted in related measures. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""EU Considers Sanctions on A7A5 Ruble‑Backed Stablecoin"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199bc56-ae6d-7eb9-9e8a-baa90b1c72af.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T09:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""EU officials are reviewing a proposal to sanction A7A5, the largest non‑USD pegged stablecoin, and to restrict banks in Russia, Belarus and Central Asia for enabling crypto transactions tied to sanctioned actors."", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/a7a5-eu-sanctions"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will EU sanctions completely block A7A5 trading?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""If adopted, the sanctions would ban EU persons and entities from transacting with A7A5 directly or indirectly, significantly restricting on‑ and off‑ramps inside the EU but not eliminating non‑EU trading activity."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What banks are implicated by the proposal?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The proposal names several banks in Russia, Belarus and Central Asia accused of enabling crypto transactions for sanctioned groups; final listings require endorsement by all 27 EU member states."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How will sanctions affect A7A5 liquidity and price? Sanctions that restrict EU counterparties would likely reduce liquidity from European markets and service providers, increasing volatility. However, trading may continue in other jurisdictions, so the ultimate price impact will depend on global liquidity and exchange delistings. How can investors monitor sanctions and stablecoin risks? Track official EU Council announcements, watch exchange delistings, and review market cap and on‑chain flows via public blockchain explorers and market aggregators. Maintain caution with tokens tied to sanctioned jurisdictions. Key Takeaways Sanctions scope : Proposal would bar EU-based transactions with A7A5 and target enabling banks. Market impact : A7A5 spiked ~250% after prior sanctions and now holds ~43% of non‑USD stablecoin market cap. What to watch : EU Council approval process, exchange responses, and listings in non‑EU jurisdictions. Conclusion Proposed A7A5 sanctions mark an escalation in targeting crypto routes used to circumvent Western measures. Investors and institutions should monitor official EU updates, exchange compliance actions, and market liquidity indicators.

Continued institutional inflows, staking ETP approvals, and bullish technicals point to a potential extension toward the $7,331 1.618 Fibonacci target if momentum persists. How do staking ETP approvals influence Ethereum’s price?

Ethereum sustains above $4,000, turning resistance into firm support after over three years of consolidation and repeated breakout attempts. Grayscale’s spot staking ETP approvals mark a pivotal shift, drawing renewed institutional confidence into Ethereum’s long-term outlook. Analysts project an extended rally toward $7,331, aligning with the 1.618 Fibonacci level and historical performance trends. Ethereum continues to maintain strength after breaking above the key $4,000 level, turning a major resistance zone into a solid support base. The digital asset now trades near $4,520, signaling renewed market conviction. Crypto analyst Mags noted that this breakout came after 1,146 days of consolidation, marking a technical milestone in Ethereum’s long-term structure. According to Mags, Ethereum’s chart pattern reveals three prior rejections near $4,000 before achieving a clean breakout on the fourth attempt. This movement highlights stronger buyer participation and reduced sell pressure. The analyst identifies the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, aligning with a $7,331 projection, framing Ethereum’s next major target zone. Strong Recovery Confirms Market Confidence A brief fakeout near $3,800 was swiftly reversed through a sharp V-shaped recovery, demonstrating robust demand. Since then, Ethereum has remained comfortably above $4,000, suggesting that long-term holders continue to accumulate. CoinGape’s independent projection supports a similar perspective, suggesting that ETH could extend gains up to $8,600 in line with past market cycles. Source: TradingView Grayscale’s approval for its spot staking Ethereum ETPs has introduced a regulated channel for institutional exposure. The Ethereum Mini Trust ETF and the Ethereum Trust ETF are the first U.S.-listed funds offering staking rewards. This development marks a step forward for institutional engagement with yield-based crypto assets. Institutional Inflows Align With Bullish Technicals Investment firm BitMine recently disclosed an $820 million Ethereum purchase, underscoring institutional appetite for exposure to Ethereum’s network. The timing coincides with Grayscale’s ETP milestone, amplifying optimism across the market. Ethereum’s sustained price stability above $4,000, coupled with new institutional participation, strengthens its long-term growth narrative. Analysts now see growing potential for Ethereum to approach the $7,331 target if momentum continues to build across technical and institutional fronts. Frequently Asked Questions What factors could invalidate the $7,331 projection? Rapid drop below the $4,000 support, sustained negative macro shocks, or a sharp reversal in institutional flows would challenge the $7,331 projection. Watch volume, on-chain outflows, and macro liquidity indicators for early warning signs. How quickly could Ethereum reach $7,331? Timing depends on momentum and inflows; if institutional demand and technical momentum persist, multi-month to mid-cycle timeframes are plausible. Price targets are conditional, not guaranteed. Key Takeaways Breakout Confirmed : Ethereum flipped $4,000 resistance into support after 1,146 days of consolidation. Institutional Demand Rising : Spot staking ETP approvals and large purchases (e.g., BitMine) increase long-term buy-side pressure. Technical Target : Analysts highlight $7,331 as a 1.618 Fibonacci extension target, contingent on sustained momentum. Conclusion Ethereum price momentum above $4,000, supported by staking ETP approvals and notable institutional purchases, strengthens the case for higher targets such as $7,331. Traders should monitor support holds, inflows, and on-chain metrics as confirmations.

While BTC consolidates, altcoins like Solana (SOL) remain in focus for traders looking for high potential growth. Among emerging crypto projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly gaining attention as a promising presale for 2025 , offering investors early-stage exposure alongside established assets like BTC and SOL. Its roadmap, active community, and growth narrative make it a noteworthy pick for investors seeking high-upside altcoins. Bitcoin: BTC Hits Record $125K Amid Uptober Momentum and Institutional ETF Inflows Bitcoin (BTC) recently hit an all-time high of about $125,700 on October 5. Earlier this year, the price of Bitcoin witnessed a different all-time high. BTC price has been rising sharply since traders know the month of October is referred to as Uptober due to bullishness. The price reached approximately $125,376 on CoinMarketCap before consolidating back to around $ 124,000, indicating good market confidence for a further rally. Concerns and fears continue to grow over the U.S. government shutdown, which began in October 2025. The uncertainty has eroded certainty and led to a decline in the US dollar, prompting investors to shift to Bitcoin. The markets’ view on the FOMC meeting in October starts improving with political events, leading to hopes of rate-cutting tax by the Federal Reserve. Massive inflows and institutional demand into Bitcoin spot ETFs listed in the U.S. were crucial. ETFs raked in over $3.2 billion in the week ended October 3, one of the largest inflows on record. Solana (SOL): Positioned for Growth as ETF Approvals Could Unlock Institutional Demand It is not the first time Bitwise executives have hyped up Solana. Speaking with Cointelegraph at Token2049 in Singapore last week, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said that Solana may gain an edge over Ethereum in the staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, citing its design as more favourable for investors. The company offers a fund called the Bitwise Physical Solana ETP that provides investors with exposure to SOL through a fully backed, physically held structure with institutional-grade custody. Interest in this area has been muted compared to BTC or Ether-based ETFs, with just $30 million in assets under management, according to Bitwise. The firm also has a Solana ETF waiting in the SEC approval queue, with the final decision due on October 16. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Promising Crypto Presale for 2025 Alongside established assets like BTC and SOL , MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the best crypto presales to buy in 2025 . The project features a clear roadmap , a growing community, and a structured presale allocation that positions early investors to benefit from significant market interest upon listing. While BTC and SOL offer proven fundamentals and institutional backing, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides an early-stage growth narrative that could complement exposure to established crypto assets, appealing to investors looking for high-upside opportunities in 2025. Conclusion October 2025 has started strongly for Bitcoin, with BTC holding $125K and demonstrating Uptober momentum supported by institutional ETF inflows. Solana (SOL) remains a key altcoin pick, especially with pending ETF approval. Independent blockchain auditors at Hashex.org have labelled MAGACOIN FINANCE a legit, secure, and audit-approved project , positioning it among the most credible 2025 presale entries. For investors seeking high upside potential beyond mainstream assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a promising presale for 2025, offering structured early access, growth potential, and the opportunity to diversify alongside established cryptocurrencies. Combining these assets may provide both stability and opportunity for significant gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE Audit Confirms 100% Legitimacy and Investor Safety MAGACOIN FINANCE has been fully audited and verified by Hashex , confirming its smart-contract integrity and investor protection.

After spending over three years struggling to hold above the $4,000 level, ETH has now confirmed a decisive breakout, a move seen as the start of its next major rally. With momentum building and technical indicators aligning, analysts suggest that a run toward the $7,000 region could be closer than ever Ethereum Breaks Free After 1,146 Days Of Consolidation Mags, a popular crypto analyst on X, recently shared a bullish update, noting that ETH could be on track to reach the $7,331 mark. According to the analyst, this target aligns with the broader bullish trend that has been forming since Ethereum’s breakout above key resistance levels. Related Reading: Global M2 Money Supply Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $20,000, Here’s When After more than 1,146 days of consolidation from its bottom, Ethereum finally broke above the crucial $4,000 level, marking a significant technical milestone. During this cycle, ETH had made three prior attempts to break past this resistance, each ending in rejection. However, the fourth attempt in August succeeded, confirming the breakout and signaling the start of a new bullish phase. Following the breakout, ETH has been consolidating above the $4,000 zone, building momentum for what could be the next leg upward. The stability around this level indicates that buyers are actively defending support, keeping the broader structure intact and setting the stage for a potential continuation toward higher targets. Mags also pointed out that Ethereum experienced a brief fakeout, where the price dipped below $4,000 to reach $3,800 before staging a sharp V-shaped recovery. This rebound, driven by strong buying pressure, further strengthens the bullish outlook. With the current price action holding firm, the analyst believes Ethereum is primed for a move toward the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level at $7,331, which could define the next major wave in its ongoing rally. Ethereum Confirms Major Structural Retest: The “V-Bottom” Is Holding Strong Galaxy, a prominent crypto analyst, recently shared an update noting that the ETH chart has successfully retested the “V-bottom” structure along with the major triangle pattern that dates back to 2021. This signals that the asset may be entering a new growth phase after consolidating for an extended period within these key technical formations. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Round 2? Analyst Forecasts Early October Rally Amid $4,200 Retest While Galaxy acknowledged that the road ahead won’t be smooth, with potential dips, periods of choppy price action, and stretches of low volatility, the overall outlook remains highly optimistic. The analyst believes that Ethereum is gradually positioning itself for a major move upward, with the current structure suggesting that a five-digit ETH is becoming an increasingly realistic target in the future.

52777674,599734,1759806048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52777674.jpeg,"Morgan Stanley Endorses Bitcoin as “Digital Gold,” Tells Advisors to Allocate Up to 4% to Crypto",https://bitcoinist.com/morgan-stanley-endorses-bitcoin-as-digital-gold/,"Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee (GIC) has issued an unexpected recommendation: treat Bitcoin as “digital gold” and allocate up to 4% of suitable portfolios to cryptocurrency exposure. The action marks one of Wall Street’s most public institutional nods to digital assets yet, emphasizing how crypto is migrating from fringe speculative bets toward mainstream portfolio construction. Institutional Validation & Allocation Framework In its October advisory memo, Morgan Stanley explicitly likened Bitcoin to a scarce wealth store, “digital gold”, and signaled that the crypto market has matured enough to warrant modest allocations within diversified portfolios. The GIC’s guidance is structured by risk profile: Balanced Growth portfolios are recommended allocations around 2% Opportunistic Growth models may go as high as 4% Portfolios focused on Wealth Conservation or Income are advised 0% crypto exposure, given the volatility risks Morgan Stanley also emphasizes that exposure should generally happen through regulated vehicles such as crypto ETFs rather than direct holdings. This endorsement could sway a large swath of the financial advisory landscape, as the GIC influences over 16,000 advisors managing around $2 trillion in client capital. Why Now? Macro Drivers & Structural Signals Several tailwinds give gravity to Morgan Stanley’s shift. Bitcoin recently ripped past $125,000, while exchange balances have dipped to 6–7 year lows, pointing to less supply readily available for sale. Macro conditions also support the thesis. The U.S. government shutdown , rising concerns over inflation, and softer dollar dynamics have driven investors toward nontraditional hedges. In that context, Bitcoin’s appeal as a scarce, digital store of value becomes more credible. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is moving beyond mere commentary: the firm is preparing to offer crypto trading to retail clients via its E*Trade partnership with Zerohash, expected to start in 2026. Risks, Constraints & What to Watch Morgan Stanley is also candid about crypto’s limitations. It warns of higher volatility, correlations under stress, and the importance of disciplined rebalancing. The company advises advisors to keep exposure in check and prevent crypto holdings from becoming dominant during sharp rallies. Here are some of the key catalysts to monitor: Regulation clarity in the U.S. and globally Sustained ETF inflows or institutional capital Further supply contraction from exchanges Execution of Morgan Stanley’s retail crypto offering via E*Trade Morgan Stanley’s public embrace of crypto, anchoring Bitcoin as “digital gold,” is a watershed moment. With allocations of 2-4% now part of the playbook for growth clients, the institutional gate to digital assets just cracked wider. But for those allocations to matter, execution and macro alignment must follow.

The milestone added to a powerful run that has seen the cryptocurrency nearly double in value over the past year. The world’s largest digital asset climbed as high as $126,080 after breaching the $125,000 mark for the first time on Sunday. It later steadied at $124,712, still up 0.6% and on track for a second straight session of gains. Ether rose 3.4% to $4,676, XRP edged up 0.4% to $2.98, while BNB gained 3.6% to $1,215. $BTC new ATH above $126,000. pic.twitter.com/3q6XxKjUij — CoinGecko (@coingecko) October 6, 2025 US Government Shutdown Spurs $6B Shift Into Cryptocurrencies Analysts pointed to a confluence of factors driving demand. Institutional inflows into Bitcoin funds have surged, friendlier policies under US President Donald Trump have helped sentiment and weakness in the US dollar has encouraged investors to diversify. The dollar index , which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, held flat at 98.18 on Monday but remains down nearly 10% this year. The ongoing US government shutdown, now in its second week, has amplified the move. With lawmakers deadlocked and economic data releases delayed, investors have funneled more than $6b into cryptocurrencies in search of safety. Gold has also rallied, topping $4,000 per ounce, strengthening Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs Draw $3.24B As Supply Hits Six-Year Low Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been central to the rally . BlackRock and Fidelity’s products drew $3.24b in net inflows last week, their second-highest tally since launch. Centralized exchanges are also reporting the lowest Bitcoin reserves in six years at just 2.83m coins, pointing to tightening supply that has magnified buying pressure. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, said Bitcoin could sustain its climb in the near term. He noted investors may see a test of $130,000 if ETF momentum continues to build. Lee also expects Ethereum to rebound toward the $4,800–$5,000 range on the back of Bitcoin’s strength and upcoming technical upgrades. Market participants stressed that the rally reflects both resilience and maturing integration with traditional finance. “This rally highlights the sector’s resilience and the accelerating integration of crypto into traditional portfolios,” Lee added, pointing to institutional participation and innovation as key long-term drivers. Bitcoin Supply At Multi-Year Lows Adds Pressure To Upside Momentum Others emphasized the cyclical nature of the move. Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said the pattern of capital rotation was typical. “Bitcoin’s rally is pretty normal early in a bull run as investors usually pile into Bitcoin first because it feels safer and more stable,” he said. He added that altcoins were likely to benefit once profit-taking sets in. “Alt season isn’t dead, just on pause. Once Bitcoin cools off and traders start taking profits, stronger altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink could shine. The market’s not giving up on alts; it’s just getting smarter and focusing on real value instead of hype.” With supply at multi-year lows and inflows building, traders say the market backdrop favors further gains. Support levels around $117,300 are holding, and if momentum endures, Bitcoin could test new highs toward $140,000 in the coming weeks.

Rather than focusing solely on XRP, he asked holders to name the second most bullish coin in their portfolios. The post drew responses from a wide range of investors, offering a glimpse into which projects XRP supporters believe have the potential to thrive alongside their primary digital asset. Versluis’s post encouraged open sharing among XRP investors, who are often seen as one of the most passionate communities in the digital asset space. While XRP remains the top choice among respondents, the variety of second-place picks highlights the evolving sentiment within the market and the diversified interests among holders. Question for all $XRP holders: What is your SECOND MOST bullish coin in your portfolio? Under your XRP of course. — MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) October 4, 2025 ADA, HBAR, and XLM Emerge as Popular Picks One of the more detailed replies came from a user named Blueman, who shared a list ranked by the dollar amount of holdings. After XRP, his next strongest conviction was Cardano (ADA), followed by Hedera (HBAR), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Bitcoin (BTC), and Flare (FLR). His breakdown reflected a balanced approach across both established projects and emerging blockchain platforms. Another user, H4PPYR34D3R, placed HBAR just above XDC and XLM, suggesting a close preference among these three assets. The mention of XDC and XLM points toward an ongoing interest in networks with strong use cases in enterprise and cross-border settlement—an area where XRP has long positioned itself as a leader. Meanwhile, a participant known as PAPA2MAXX shared a different perspective, naming ZBCN as his choice over HBAR. He explained that while he holds both, he considers ZBCN the more promising of the two. This response illustrates how certain investors are exploring lesser-known or newer blockchain projects that might still be under the radar compared to established names. Chef, another community member, gave a concise response that reflected familiarity within XRP circles. He cited XLM, HBAR, and ALGO as his top alternatives, three assets often associated with enterprise-grade or utility-driven use cases. Broader Trends in XRP Holders’ Preferences The variety of coins mentioned in the responses indicates that XRP holders are not confined to one category of blockchain. Some prefer projects emphasizing interoperability and institutional partnerships, such as HBAR and XDC.

The presence of Bitcoin and Ethereum in several replies demonstrates that traditional market leaders still maintain relevance even within a community known for championing utility-focused assets. This blend of preferences underscores a broader theme within the crypto space: diversification with conviction. XRP holders appear to maintain strong confidence in their main asset while strategically positioning themselves across networks that complement XRP’s strengths. Insight into Community Mindset Versluis’s engagement highlighted not only enthusiasm for XRP but also a forward-looking mindset among investors. The willingness to discuss secondary holdings demonstrates that many in the community are thinking about interoperability, use-case expansion, and long-term growth across multiple ecosystems.

Watch taker CVD and social momentum for early confirmation. Cooling volumes signal accumulation, not distribution. Critical breakout level: $0.355 — confirmation opens $0.373 and $0.40. On-chain and derivatives metrics (taker CVD, social dominance) support a bullish thesis. TRX breakout watch: TRX consolidation above $0.355 could spark a rally toward $0.40. Read the technical, on‑chain, and social signals to act. (COINOTAG) What is TRX doing during this cooling phase? TRX is consolidating in a low‑volume accumulation phase that has historically preceded large rallies. The token shows an inverse head‑and‑shoulders and compressed volatility; a decisive close above $0.355 would validate a bullish continuation toward $0.373–$0.40. How has TRX reacted to its cooling phase? Since early October, TRON (TRX) has exhibited falling spot volumes and reduced volatility, a pattern typically associated with accumulation. Historical parallels from July 2021 and October 2024 saw similar volume compression before rallies exceeding 100% in subsequent months. What factors could confirm TRX’s next breakout? Confirmation requires sustained buying above $0.355, taker buy dominance in futures, and rising social sentiment. Traders should monitor daily closes above the neckline, increasing taker CVD, and social dominance for alignment before allocating significant capital. Renewed momentum for TRX On the daily chart, TRX is forming an inverse head‑and‑shoulders pattern with an ascending trendline since mid‑August. The neckline near $0.355 is the key pivot: a breakout and retest would target $0.373 and then $0.40. At press time, TRX traded around $0.343, holding short‑term supports at $0.331 and $0.335. Each dip has found buyers, indicating demand beneath price and strengthening the reaccumulation thesis. A confirmed break and daily close above $0.355 would signal that momentum has shifted to buyers and could mark the start of a multi‑week advance. Source: TradingView What’s backing the bullish setup? Futures taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) shows sustained buy‑side dominance across derivatives, indicating aggressive accumulation by leveraged traders. This activity suggests conviction among margin participants. When taker buy dominance aligns with spot volume cooling, the market often prepares an impulse wave under reduced volatility. That alignment increases the probability of a clean breakout rather than a volatile, erratic move. On‑chain and derivative signals together create a higher‑probability scenario for a bullish continuation if price respects the neckline and key supports. Source: CryptoQuant (on‑chain derivatives data) How is social sentiment influencing prospects? Social dominance metrics from Santiment indicate a gradual uptick in TRX discussion, currently around 0.422%. Renewed social attention often precedes increased retail participation and can amplify breakouts when technical conditions align. When on‑chain accumulation, derivatives buy pressure, and social momentum converge, probability of a clean upward impulse increases. Traders should watch social metrics for confirmation of retail follow‑through. Source: Santiment Can TRX see a full‑scale breakout? TRX’s synchronized signals—volume cooling, inverse head‑and‑shoulders, and futures accumulation—collectively point to higher odds of a breakout. The decisive factor remains price action around the $0.355 neckline . If buyers sustain momentum above that level and derivatives flows remain buy‑dominant, TRX could replicate past accelerations and advance toward the stated targets. Risk management and confirmation remain essential. Frequently Asked Questions What is the key level for a TRX breakout? The critical level is $0.355; a daily close and retest above this neckline would confirm the inverse head‑and‑shoulders and likely target $0.373 then $0.40. How should traders confirm a breakout? Confirm with a sustained daily close above $0.355, rising taker CVD in futures, and growth in social dominance; combine technical confirmation with position sizing rules. Key Takeaways Accumulation is present : Spot volume cooling often precedes institutional re‑entry and rallies. Neckline to watch : $0.355 — a clear breakout would open $0.373 and $0.40 targets. Confirm with data : Use taker CVD, daily closes, and social dominance for higher‑probability entries. Conclusion This TRX setup combines classic technical structure with on‑chain and derivatives confirmation and rising social interest, forming a high‑probability breakout scenario if price clears $0.355 . Traders should wait for confirmation and use disciplined risk management as COINOTAG continues to monitor developments and update this coverage. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@graph"": [ { ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""TRX Breakout Watch: Cooling Volume, Inverse H&S and Taker CVD Signal Long Opportunity"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TRXUSDT_2025-10-06_12-22-03.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-06T12:22:03Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-06T12:22:03Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""TRX consolidation above $0.355 could spark a rally to $0.40.

Over the past six months, the exchange has mounted a quiet but deliberate effort to restore its global standing, coupled with political outreach and strategic partnerships that have reshaped investor confidence. The Diplomatic Playbook On-chain data shared by CryptoQuant confirms the turnaround. It found that Binance’s share of total Bitcoin outflows among all exchanges, which had slumped below 25% during the regulatory crackdown of late 2024, has steadily recovered to nearly 40% by September 2025. The report found that the surge in capital inflows closely aligns with the company’s diplomatic moves, including meetings with the US Treasury, policy proposals in Hong Kong, and more. While US regulators have yet to grant formal relief, Binance’s push for eased anti-money laundering monitoring requirements has been widely viewed as a signal of regulatory normalization. Similar efforts in Asia have boosted the trend, as CZ made an appearance at WebX Tokyo 2025 and his interviews in Hong Kong highlighted his call for faster legislative frameworks. These moves coincided with a surge in stablecoin deposits and derivatives trading, which are very important indicators of restored user trust. As such, Binance’s narrative appears to have shifted from one of survival to resurgence, recasting the crypto exchange as both “compliant and innovative.” Binance Dominates Q3 Inflows These efforts have also helped Binance to once again secure its dominance in the centralized exchange sector after recording a staggering $14.8 billion net inflow in Q3 2025. The surge was primarily fueled by strong stablecoin deposits. The strong inflows of stablecoins, which are often seen as deployable “dry powder,” indicate investor readiness to allocate funds across assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. On the other hand, rivals struggled to keep pace as OKX reported just $1.61 billion in inflows, while Bybit saw $1.33 billion during the same period.

Analysts cited in this report expect a measurable lag between gold and Bitcoin, with Bitcoin potentially outperforming as flows rotate into crypto. How closely are Bitcoin and gold correlated? Bitcoin and gold have shown intermittent correlation during periods of elevated macro risk.

Analysts predict Bitcoin will follow suit. Gold prices have come within a few dollars of a milestone all-time high of $4,000 as investors escape to safe-haven assets — a trend that also looks bullish for Bitcoin. Prices for futures for gold tapped $4,000 per ounce for the first time early on Tuesday morning, while spot prices reached an all-time high of $3,976, according to TradingView. “Gold is at a new record high,” observed goldbug and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff on Tuesday. “This is a clear warning that current Fed policy is wrong,” he added as he called for the US central bank to “reverse course immediately,” and raise interest rates. Gold has had a stellar run this year, surging more than 50% since Jan. 1 amid escalating geopolitical tensions, trade tariff concerns, global inflation, and the debasement of fiat currencies. It has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) over the same period, with the world’s premier digital asset gaining just 33.5%. However, Bitcoin prices have followed gold, albeit with a lag, which could bode well for a massive end-of-year rally. Will Bitcoin outperform gold, analysts say? “Gold’s all-time high shows investors’ demand for scarce assets. From here, we believe Bitcoin will be the better-performing asset of the two,” Apollo Capital’s Henrik Andersson told a market outlet. Similar views came from Justin d’Anethan, head of partnerships at Arctic Digital, who said gold confirms the same dynamics that support BTC. Analysts describe the relationship as a “mutual confirmation” where both assets react to unchecked US deficits, a weakening dollar, and rising geopolitical hedging. As one source noted: “Gold is familiar and deeply rooted in traditional finance setups. Bitcoin moves bigger because it’s available 24/7, scarcer, and admittedly more forward-looking.” How long is the lag between gold and Bitcoin? Market commentators and traders report an approximate eight-week lag in which Bitcoin often follows gold’s price action. Analyst James Bull and trader Ted Pillows have both highlighted recent patterns on social platforms showing BTC catching up after gold peaks. Historical price runs and correlation analysis suggest Bitcoin may accelerate after gold establishes new highs, though short-term corrections remain possible. Even without the lag, BTC price momentum is starting to catch up with gold’s. Source: TradingView Could Bitcoin reach seven figures if valued like gold? David Marcus, Litespark co-founder and former PayPal executive, suggested that if Bitcoin were valued like gold on a market-cap-per-use basis, it could reach roughly $1.3 million. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s payments utility is not fully priced in and said crossing into seven digits is a long-term possibility. Frequently Asked Questions Will Bitcoin rise after gold hits new highs? Historical patterns and analyst commentary indicate Bitcoin often follows gold highs with a lag. Expect potential BTC upside in Q4, but monitor for interim corrections tied to liquidity and interest-rate shifts. How strong is the correlation between BTC and gold? Correlation fluctuates; during elevated macro risk both assets can move together. Recent analysis points to a measurable positive correlation with time-lag dynamics rather than perfect synchronicity. What are the main drivers of both gold and Bitcoin rallies? Key drivers include inflation concerns, large fiscal deficits, currency depreciation, and geopolitical uncertainty. Institutional flows into scarce assets also amplify price moves. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will Bitcoin rise after gold hits new highs?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bitcoin has historically followed gold in periods of macro stress with a lag.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Whales Are Carrying $10.1 Billion In Profits As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Bitcoin short-term holder whales have seen their profits hit the highest point of the cycle. The short-term holders (STHs) broadly refer to the BTC investors who purchased the cryptocurrency within the past 155 days. These holders are considered to include the “weak hands” of the market, who tend to panic at the sight of volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Exchange Inflows Hit $5.7B: Profit-Taking Already Underway? In the context of the current topic, the STHs as a whole aren’t of relevance, but rather a specific portion of the cohort: the whales. “Whales” are defined as entities carrying more than 1,000 tokens of the asset in their wallet balance. The STH whales, therefore, would be the holders of this size who got into the market in the last five months. Bitcoin is currently trading at price levels it has never reached before in its history, so the STHs (barring those who bought at the weekend high above $125,000) would naturally all be in profit at the moment. An indicator that can highlight the scale of their gain is the Unrealized P&L, which measures, as its name suggests, the net amount of unrealized profit/loss that Bitcoin holders are carrying right now. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in this indicator for the Bitcoin STH whales over the past year. From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin STH whales fell into the red during the cryptocurrency’s decline in late September. But with the rally in the asset, the Unrealized P&L for the group has seen a sharp recovery into the positive region, rising to a high of $10.1 billion. The analyst notes that this is a cycle high for the metric. Given the weak nature of the STHs, it’s possible that these massive profits may entice some of these whales into exiting the market here. It now remains to be seen whether enough demand will keep coming in to absorb any such potential profit-taking. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Big Breakout Incoming? Analyst Calls To “Stay Alert” Speaking of the STHs, the current cycle has seen two large waves of coin transfer from the long-term holders (LTHs) to the STHs, as on-chain analysis suite Checkonchain has highlighted in an X post. “3.45M BTC has shifted to Short-Term Holders this cycle, rivaling 2016–17 in scale but at 100x higher prices,” notes Checkonchain.

Expert Shares What’s Coming,https://timestabloid.com/will-xrp-make-you-a-millionaire-expert-shares-whats-coming/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld has issued a strong warning to investors, saying that unprecedented liquidity could soon hit global markets. He described this as a “multi-trillion-dollar tsunami” that could affect both cryptocurrencies and traditional stocks. Rietveld referenced reports that President Donald Trump is considering a $1,000 to $2,000 stimulus payment for all American taxpayers, funded through tariff revenue. He suggested that this proposal, if implemented, could mirror the stimulus-driven surge seen during 2020–2021, when massive cash injections fueled the biggest bull run in crypto history. According to Rietveld, such a move could reawaken retail investment enthusiasm, leading to another meteoric rise across markets. He argued that the end of this year and early 2026 could become defining moments for wealth creation, especially for those positioned in digital assets. XRP Will Make YOU a Millionaire? #XRP pic.twitter.com/XiMzeJoDnp — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 4, 2025 Stimulus and the Return of Market Liquidity Rietveld explained that stimulus payments typically increase liquidity and risk appetite. When individuals have more disposable income, a portion often flows into higher-yield assets, like cryptocurrencies. The last time this occurred, digital assets reached record valuations. He believes a similar outcome could happen again, this time on an even greater scale, as the infrastructure for digital finance is far more advanced today than it was in 2020. He described this expected wave as a powerful influx of new capital that could reshape markets. Rietveld urged investors to be ready before it begins, emphasizing that timing would be crucial in maximizing potential gains. Why XRP Could Benefit In his analysis, Rietveld highlighted XRP as one of the digital assets best positioned to gain from a liquidity surge. He pointed out that XRP’s role in facilitating global payments and cross-border settlements makes it a strong candidate for large-scale financial integration. With rising institutional attention on blockchain-based solutions, XRP could find itself at the center of renewed market activity.

Assets with established real-world use cases, such as XRP , may see accelerated growth as capital flows into the sector. Preparing for the Next Phase Rietveld concluded by reminding investors that major financial opportunities often appear when markets are least expecting them. He predicted that late 2025 and early 2026 could mark a historic period of market expansion, calling it a once-in-a-generation chance to build lasting wealth. While his forecast remains speculative, it underscores the growing belief among analysts that fiscal stimulus, advancing blockchain infrastructure, and increasing liquidity could converge to create one of the most significant financial events of the decade.

Read targets, support zones, and trading signals to spot entries now. Aptos smashes key resistance with soaring volume, sparking a 20% rally. Is APT gearing up for a breakout run to $10.50? APT breaks out of multi-month wedge with over 20% gain and rising volume, confirming bullish structure. Bullish breakout targets $10.50, a level last seen in early 2024, with $5.12 acting as key support zone. Open interest and trading volume spike, backed by DeFi growth and strategic Aptos partnerships. Aptos (APT) surged 3.11% in the last 24 hours to $5.27, with nearly $980 million in 24-hour trading volume. The token has gained over 29% in a week, fueled by a strong breakout and growing market momentum. How did the technical breakout signal a trend shift? Aptos breakout occurred as APT/USDT pierced a descending wedge that formed earlier in 2024. The wedge displayed lower highs and stable lows, indicating price compression prior to the breakout. A decisive daily close above wedge resistance, paired with elevated volume, signals a shift from the prior downtrend to a bullish structure. The breakout occurred near the $5.12 resistance zone and pushed price above $5.50 on follow-through buying. Social commentary from market observers, including CryptoFaibik, highlighted a 20% profit since the wedge breakout and projected targets near $10.50 based on pattern measurement. $APT #Aptos +20% Profit so far Since the Wedge Breakout.. pic.twitter.com/nUhpwRFrFk — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) October 4, 2025 Technically, the rally is supported by a higher daily close above the wedge, rising open interest in derivatives, and sustained volume. DeFiLlama data (plain text reference) shows APT futures open interest rose from $323 million to over $436 million, with a positive funding rate that implies bullish positioning among derivatives traders. Where are support zones and fair value gaps offering entries? After the breakout, the $5.12–$4.70 band is the primary area of interest. This region coincides with daily Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) down to $4.55. These imbalances often act as demand zones on retracements and can provide lower-risk entries for trend-following trades. Traders seeking entries can watch for consolidation or price rejection within this zone. A failure to hold $5.12 on a pullback could indicate a false breakout, but current structure favors bulls with supporting indicators like a green Supertrend and a bullish MACD crossover. What fundamentals are fueling bullish momentum? Fundamentals have strengthened alongside technicals. Multichain wallet Backpack added native Aptos support, lowering friction for users. Total value locked (TVL) on Aptos expanded from $28 billion in April to about $75 billion, according to DeFiLlama (plain text reference). Stablecoin supply on Aptos increased roughly 5% in the past week to $1.09 billion. Trading volume across venues surged to as much as $1.2 billion in recent sessions, signaling expanding market participation. The crypto Fear and Greed Index also moved into the “greed” zone during the rally, reflecting broader market sentiment. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/aptos-breakout-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Aptos Breakout: APT Targets $10.50 After 20% Rally"", ""description"": ""Aptos breakout: APT surges on wedge breakout and heavy volume.

Look for price consolidation or bullish rejection within $5.12–$4.70, increased volume on reversals, and confirmation from indicators like Supertrend and MACD. Manage risk with stop-losses below FVGs. Key Takeaways Confirmed breakout : APT closed above the wedge with strong volume and rising open interest. Targets & support : Pattern projects an eventual target near $10.50; $5.12–$4.70 is primary support. Fundamentals : TVL growth and native wallet support reinforce adoption; watch on-chain metrics like TVL and stablecoin supply. Conclusion The Aptos breakout combines technical confirmation and improving fundamentals. Aptos breakout signals a bullish shift with targets near $10.50 while $5.12–$4.70 remains the critical support area. Traders should watch volume, open interest, and on-chain TVL for confirmation and manage risk on retracements.

There is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $3.0450 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it settles above $3.050. XRP Price Faces Hurdles XRP price started a decent increase after it settled above the $2.820 level, but it underperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to surpass the $2.90 and $2.950 resistance levels. The price even climbed above $3.020 before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $3.098 and the price corrected some gains.

Legislation is the current bottleneck for SBR deployment. Initial funding will come from Bitcoin seized by the Department of the Treasury and additional budget‑neutral sources. Government paper gains in gold (reported at roughly $1 trillion) are being discussed as a potential lever to acquire BTC. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve news: Cynthia Lummis confirms SBR funding can start now but waits on legislation — read the latest update and next steps. Crypto-friendly US Senator Cynthia Lummis said fundraising for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is mainly being held back by legislative “slog.” Cynthia Lummis , a long-time crypto supporter in the U.S. Senate, confirmed that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) could begin acquiring funds immediately, but implementation is constrained by legislative delays. Her comments follow public discussion among industry figures about budget-neutral funding mechanisms for the reserve. In an X post, Lummis noted legislative “slog” as the primary impediment, while saying that actions initiated under President Trump’s Executive Order have cleared a path for the SBR to be capitalized when lawmakers finalize the mechanics. This statement responds to a discussion by ProCap BTC CIO Jeff Park and industry advocate Anthony Pompliano about potential funding sources and fiscal impact. Senator Lummis’ latest comments on the SBR. Source: Cynthia Lummis What is the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and how will it be capitalized? The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a proposed federal reserve of Bitcoin intended to be held by the U.S. government. According to official descriptions, the SBR will be initially capitalized with seized Bitcoin in Treasury custody and may acquire additional BTC through budget-neutral, taxpayer-neutral methods once legal paths are established. How will Congress and the Treasury fund the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? Current public guidance states the SBR’s initial funding source is Bitcoin already owned by the Department of the Treasury from civil and criminal seizures. Additional acquisitions are to be pursued via mechanisms that impose “no incremental costs on American taxpayers.” Senator Cynthia Lummis and market figures have discussed using unrealized paper gains in gold holdings—estimated publicly at about $1 trillion—as a potential lever to allocate capital toward Bitcoin purchases. That proposal remains conceptual and requires legislative authorization and implementation rules from Treasury and Congress. Government Bitcoin buys around the corner? Seven months after an Executive Order directed formation of the SBR, regulatory and legislative details remain unresolved. Market observers, including Anthony Pompliano (in media interviews), expect a formal announcement when purchase mechanics and funding are finalized. Public statements from officials and investors indicate three signals to watch: (1) Treasury guidance on seized-asset transfers, (2) Congressional passage of budget-neutral mechanisms, and (3) an official purchase announcement with execution guidance. Comparative summary of fiscal figures Item Reported Value Estimated U.S. fiscal debt $37.88 trillion (public figure cited) Reported paper gains in U.S. gold holdings ~$1 trillion (discussion point) Initial SBR capitalization Seized Bitcoin held by the Department of the Treasury How could the SBR impact fiscal policy and markets? Proponents argue that a budget-neutral SBR could provide a new asset allocation for government holdings, potentially reducing exposure to traditional liabilities if executed with transparent governance. Critics note that market effects depend on purchase size, execution timing, and disclosure policies. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When can the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve start acquiring funds?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The SBR can begin acquiring funds once Congress finalizes legislation and Treasury issues implementing guidance; Senator Cynthia Lummis says the process is ready but delayed by legislative steps."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What will initially fund the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Initial funding will come from Bitcoin already owned by the Department of the Treasury from civil or criminal proceedings, with additional BTC to be acquired through budget-neutral avenues that do not raise taxes."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Senator Cynthia Lummis: Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Funding Ready but Held by Legislative Process"", ""description"": ""Cynthia Lummis says the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve can begin acquiring funds now but legislative procedures are delaying implementation.

There is no confirmed purchase date. Officials indicate purchases depend on finalized legislation and Treasury implementation; market participants expect an announcement once those steps conclude. Will taxpayer money be used to buy Bitcoin for the SBR? Official guidance states additional BTC acquisitions should be budget-neutral and impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers; initial capitalization uses seized BTC already in Treasury custody. Key Takeaways Legislative delay : Congressional action is the main bottleneck to SBR fund deployment. Initial capitalization : The reserve will start with Bitcoin seized and held by the Department of the Treasury. Funding mechanisms : Proposals include budget-neutral approaches and discussion of leveraging paper gains in gold, but these require formal authorization. Conclusion The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is positioned to begin capitalization using existing Treasury-held Bitcoin, but implementation hinges on legislation and Treasury rules. Senator Cynthia Lummis frames the issue as ready in principle but delayed in practice; stakeholders will watch Congressional and Treasury signals for the definitive start.

BullZilla ($BZIL) is shaking the market as its presale ignites at record speed. With stages changing every 48 hours or each $100K raised, the momentum is fierce. Investors watching Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), MoonBull (MOBU), La Culex (CULEX), and other meme powerhouses now see one beast leading the pack, BullZilla. In a market chasing the next meme coin with 100x potential, $BZIL’s structured growth system and roaring community could set the new benchmark. This presale isn’t another token drop; it’s a movement engineered for wealth-building conviction and unstoppable scarcity. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL): Forged for Dominance, The Next Meme Coin With 4092% ROI Potential What makes BullZilla different from every other meme experiment? BullZilla wasn’t launched – it was unleashed. Built on Ethereum, it runs on a Progressive Price Engine that automatically raises the token price either after $100K is raised or 48 hours pass.

At the current price of $0.00012574, over $800,000 has been raised from 2,600+ holders, and 30 billion tokens are already sold. The listing price of $0.00527 represents a potential ROI of 4,589% for those buying now. For example, an investment of $8,500 at $0.00012574 secures around 67,622,950 $BZIL tokens. When the token hits its listing price, that stack could be worth approximately $356,364, a portfolio-transforming gain for early believers. Every new stage pushes the price up by 5.29%, meaning this entry won’t last long. Each buy is like catching the beast mid-roar; miss the next meme coin to explode now, and the next roar will be louder and costlier.

It made this list of the next meme coin with potential for proving that mechanics, not just marketing, can back memes. 4.

Its Hive Vault rewards holders through 80% staking and a unique referral ecosystem that turns every holder into a promoter. Frequent burns and events keep supply tight. As the pre-presale phase builds momentum, CULEX is already attracting attention from investors looking for the next meme coin with 100x potential. It earns a place here for turning meme culture into long-term value. 5.

VanEck projects Bitcoin could reach half of gold’s market cap: ~ $644,000 per BTC. Analysts expect a multi‑year timeline driven by adoption, Layer‑2 growth and institutional inflows. Current market cap: Bitcoin ≈ $2.48T; gold ≈ $26T—achieving 50% requires ~5.6x Bitcoin appreciation. Bitcoin capture half of gold’s market cap: discover the valuation, timeline, and research-backed assumptions — read the analysis and key takeaways now. What would Bitcoin be worth if it captured half of gold’s market capitalization? Bitcoin capture half of gold’s market cap would equate to roughly $644,000 per BTC based on a $26 trillion gold market, according to VanEck. This target assumes Bitcoin attains 50% of gold’s market value and depends on adoption, Layer‑2 scaling, and institutional allocation over years rather than months. How realistic is VanEck’s projection and what timeline do analysts expect? VanEck’s projection is grounded in assumptions about global adoption, payment settlement share, and central bank allocations. Market participants such as Caladan and Merkle Tree Capital interpret the thesis as plausible but expect the path to unfold over 5–15 years. This view reflects the need for sustained capital flows and structural adoption rather than immediate exponential returns. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""VanEck: Bitcoin Could Capture Half of Gold’s $26T Market Cap — Analysts See Multi‑Year Path"", ""datePublished"": ""2024-07-30T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T00:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/van-eck-bitcoin-half-gold-marketcap"" }, ""articleSection"": ""Markets"", ""keywords"": ""Bitcoin capture half of gold’s market cap, Bitcoin valuation, VanEck forecast""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much would one Bitcoin be worth if it reached half of gold's market cap?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""At a $26 trillion gold market cap, half equals $13 trillion; dividing by current Bitcoin supply implies roughly $644,000 per BTC under VanEck's scenario."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is VanEck's forecast short‑term or long‑term?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""VanEck's forecast is long‑term, relying on adoption, Layer‑2 scaling, and institutional allocation that analysts expect to play out over 5–15 years."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What assumptions underlie the 50% of gold market cap thesis?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key assumptions include increased adoption in emerging markets, Bitcoin settling a share of trade, Layer‑2 scaling solutions, and central banks allocating a small percentage of reserves to crypto."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How Bitcoin could approach half of gold's market cap"", ""description"": ""Stepwise structural changes and milestones that could enable Bitcoin to capture a significant share of gold's market value."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Wider consumer adoption"", ""text"": ""Younger consumers and emerging markets adopt Bitcoin for savings and payments."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Layer‑2 scaling"", ""text"": ""Layer‑2 networks mature, reducing costs and increasing settlement throughput."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Institutional and sovereign allocation"", ""text"": ""Institutions and central banks allocate a steady, measurable share of portfolios to Bitcoin."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Market maturation"", ""text"": ""Volatility compresses as liquidity deepens and derivatives markets evolve."" } ]} Why do analysts caution about timing even if VanEck’s thesis holds? Analysts note the math is straightforward but timing is uncertain. Reaching 50% of gold requires ~5.6x appreciation from current market caps. Historical cycle behavior, halving timing and compressed volatility from institutional ETF flows all influence when — and if — that multiple is achieved. What are the key data points to watch now? Market capitalization : Bitcoin ≈ $2.48 trillion; gold ≈ $26 trillion (plain text sources: CoinGecko and market gold estimates). Price action : Bitcoin recent record high noted at $126,080, trading near $124,529 at snapshot. Cycle timing : Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024; historical peaks have clustered 500–550 days post‑halving. Market cap comparison snapshot Asset Estimated Market Cap Implied Price per BTC (50% of gold) Gold (total) $26,000,000,000,000 — 50% of Gold $13,000,000,000,000 $644,000 (approx.) Bitcoin (current) $2,480,000,000,000 — When might Bitcoin reach these levels? Timing estimates vary. Some market researchers project material progress within 5–10 years; more aggressive scenarios extend to mid‑century if velocity and settlement usage expand as VanEck models. Analysts caution that macro factors, monetary policy and geopolitics will influence the pace. Frequently Asked Questions How does the halving affect the price path? The halving reduces miner rewards and tightens issuance, historically precedes multi‑month appreciation phases. However, past cycles are imperfect guides; institutional participation and ETFs have shifted dynamics toward steadier, dollar‑based gains. What role do Layer‑2 solutions play? Layer‑2 solutions reduce transaction costs, increase throughput and expand use cases. Their maturation is essential for Bitcoin to serve larger economic functions like cross‑border settlement, a key assumption in VanEck’s long‑term outlook. Key Takeaways Valuation target : VanEck implies ~ $644,000 per BTC if Bitcoin captures half of gold’s $26T market cap. Timeline : Analysts view the path as multi‑year, likely 5–15 years rather than a single cycle move. Drivers : Adoption in emerging markets, Layer‑2 scaling, institutional and sovereign allocations are central to the thesis. Conclusion The VanEck forecast that Bitcoin could capture half of gold’s market capitalization frames a long‑term, structural bull case built on adoption, Layer‑2 growth and institutional allocation. While the valuation math is compelling, market participants should treat timing as uncertain and monitor adoption, technical scaling and macro drivers closely.",News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-07 04:26:55
52780544,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=179274,1759811418,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/52780544.jpeg,Solana Price Prediction: ETF Hype and Who Will Lead the Altcoin Season,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/solana-price-prediction-etf-hype-and-who-will-lead-the-altcoin-season/,"Solana (SOL) continues to hold its place among the market’s top performers as attention builds around the possibility of a Solana-based ETF. After climbing to around $230, SOL has maintained strong momentum supported by rising trading volumes, growing institutional interest, and expanding network activity. As Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilize at higher levels, many traders are now positioning for what could be the most significant altcoin season since 2021. The question is no longer whether altcoins will rally, but which ones will lead the next wave – and Solana, along with new emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, appears to be at the forefront of that conversation. ETF Expectations Drive Solana Momentum The idea of a Solana ETF has been circulating for months, but recent discussions among major asset managers have turned that speculation into something more tangible. While no official filing has yet been approved, the potential for an ETF product tied to Solana has already begun influencing sentiment and price behavior. Solana’s rapid processing speed and low transaction costs have made it one of the most efficient Layer-1 networks in the market. Institutional investors have started to recognize its growing influence in DeFi, gaming, and tokenization – areas that continue to expand even in volatile market conditions. Daily active users on Solana have now exceeded 1.4 million, and network transaction volumes are consistently outpacing competitors. The combination of scalability and adoption is driving analysts to project a possible move toward $280 in the coming weeks if ETF optimism continues. A breakout above $250 would mark Solana’s highest price since early 2022, setting the stage for what could be a strong finish to the year. Altcoin Market Builds Steam The broader altcoin market is heating up alongside Solana’s rise. Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano have all recorded notable gains, but momentum is strongest among mid- and small-cap assets that are attracting both retail and institutional inflows. The total crypto market capitalization has surpassed $4.2 trillion, with altcoins now accounting for nearly 40 percent of total value. This shift marks a clear rotation of capital away from Bitcoin dominance and toward diversified exposure across the broader market. With several ETF proposals under review and new listings expected in Q4, analysts believe that altcoins will likely outperform Bitcoin in percentage terms before the end of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale That’s Redefining Early-Stage Success While Solana captures institutional attention, a very different kind of story is unfolding in the presale market. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a standout success in 2025, not just for its fundraising total, but for how it has reimagined what a presale project can look like in a maturing crypto landscape. Unlike the majority of early-stage tokens that rely on aggressive marketing or speculative hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has built its growth on structure and strategy. The project’s team has implemented a phased presale model that rewards early participants with access to exclusive governance discussions and community-led decision-making. This participatory design has created a loyal following that extends far beyond simple price speculation. What truly sets MAGACOIN apart, however, is its approach to scalability and sustainability. Instead of focusing solely on short-term trading, the developers are designing mechanisms that encourage ecosystem expansion over time – such as liquidity rewards for holders and strategic exchange listings planned in multiple stages. This forward-thinking roadmap has given investors a sense that they’re participating in something more than just a quick market opportunity. Retail traders see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a chance to be early in a project that has both social energy and practical direction. Its blend of verified audits, controlled tokenomics, and long-term incentives has made it a rare example of how community power and structural integrity can coexist. Who Will Lead the Altcoin Season? If the ETF speculation surrounding Solana becomes reality, it would not only strengthen Solana’s position but also fuel enthusiasm for the entire altcoin sector. Projects with active ecosystems, large user bases, and credible development roadmaps are likely to lead the charge. Analysts expect that while Solana, Ethereum, and XRP will provide stability, the most dramatic gains will come from newer and smaller-cap assets. These include presale projects and emerging altcoins that are still in their early growth stages – a category where MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate. This dual dynamic, with Solana leading on the institutional front and MAGACOIN capturing retail momentum, could define how the 2025 bull market evolves. The combination of top-tier liquidity and grassroots energy is already setting the tone for the next phase of expansion. Outlook for Q4 2025 Market sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive as liquidity flows steadily into altcoins. The approval of any new ETF – whether for Solana, XRP, or another asset – could act as a spark for another wave of capital entering the market. Meanwhile, presales are likely to remain one of the most profitable areas for active retail investors. With projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE proving that transparency and community engagement can drive large-scale success, the appetite for early access opportunities continues to grow. Conclusion Solana’s steady rise and growing ETF hype have made it one of the most watched assets of the quarter. Its strong fundamentals, increasing institutional demand, and expanding ecosystem position it as a top contender to lead the next altcoin season. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is reshaping expectations for what a presale project can achieve. With its structured rollout, active community, and clear long-term vision, it offers a different – but equally powerful – path to success in the same bullish environment. Together, Solana and MAGACOIN FINANCE represent the two sides of the crypto market’s evolution: institutional recognition and retail-driven innovation. Both are thriving, and both are likely to define the story of Q4 2025.

What is the RBI-guaranteed digital currency India announced? The RBI-guaranteed digital currency is a central bank digital currency (CBDC) — a state-backed digital rupee intended to offer sovereign guarantee, faster settlement, and traceability compared with private, unbacked cryptocurrencies. India positions the CBDC to reduce reliance on unregulated tokens while maintaining monetary control. How will India’s CBDC change regulation and market dynamics? India’s CBDC implies a regulatory pivot: moving from a high-tax deterrent on private crypto toward a tiered compliance approach that privileges regulated, asset-backed tokens.

India’s government aims to protect consumers and monetary integrity. Officials say heavy taxation and eventual preference for a digital rupee reduce the risk of users holding unbacked tokens with no recourse. Public statements and industry commentary highlight a desire for sovereign control over digital money. What are industry reactions and concerns? Industry leaders including the India Blockchain Alliance and Emerging Payments Association Asia acknowledge the CBDC as central to fintech strategy but raise questions on privacy, competition, and talent flight. Reports indicate 80–85% of top crypto talent has relocated internationally, pointing to regulatory uncertainty as a retention risk. Frequently Asked Questions Will the RBI digital rupee be more private than bank payments? Privacy design is undecided; experts warn a CBDC’s traceability may be greater than bank payments. Regulators must balance anti-money-laundering needs with user privacy to sustain trust in a state-backed system. How soon will the RBI-guaranteed digital currency launch? Exact timelines depend on pilot results and regulation drafting. The RBI has piloted retail and wholesale CBDC projects; broader rollouts follow policy finalization and compliance frameworks. Key Takeaways State backing matters : A sovereign guarantee positions the digital rupee as a safer medium than unbacked tokens. Regulatory pivot : India is moving from taxation-based deterrence to a tiered compliance regime favoring asset-backed issuers. Industry impact : Expect stricter custody, reserve, and audit requirements; fintechs should realign strategies toward compliance. Conclusion India’s announcement of an RBI-guaranteed digital currency signals a definitive shift toward regulated, asset-backed digital money and stricter oversight for private crypto. Stakeholders should prioritize compliance, privacy safeguards, and partnership-ready product design as the country finalizes CBDC policy and implementation.

Support has shifted higher into the $0.27 zone as institutions pressed bids, with momentum now eyeing the $0.30 ceiling. News Background DOGE rose 6% between Oct. 6, 04:00 and Oct. 7, 03:00, climbing from $0.25 to $0.27. The rally was underpinned by heavy accumulation flows — mid-tier and large holders adding over 30M tokens — and exchange outflows equivalent to $25M. Market chatter pointed to SEC approval odds for 401(k) eligibility, mirroring Bitcoin and Ethereum’s retirement integration. Analysts flagged ascending triangle formations and cyclical signals targeting $0.30–$0.35. Price Action Summary DOGE traded a 7% band between $0.25 and $0.27. Breakout accelerated during the 14:00–15:00 window on 1.15B tokens, the heaviest turnover in weeks. Price topped at $0.27 into late afternoon, where fresh resistance emerged. Final session saw consolidation around $0.27 with diminishing volumes, viewed as profit-taking rather than structural weakness. Technical Analysis Support has moved up to $0.27 following multiple defenses, while resistance is firm at $0.27–$0.30. The chart structure reflects an ascending triangle, with higher lows pressing toward the ceiling. Analysts also highlight a 42-day cyclical signal aligning with the breakout attempt.

Symmetrical triangle tightening on daily chart — breakout likely if price stays above $0.20. Whales bought ~30 million DOGE, raising large-holder supply to 10.77 billion, supporting upside momentum. Technical targets: $0.298, $0.337, $0.394, and $0.466; final upside near December 2024 peak at $0.4846. Dogecoin breakout: DOGE compresses in a triangle with 200-day SMA support; watch $0.20 for entry, targets to $0.466. Read analyst-backed targets and whale data now. Dogecoin approaches a critical breakout from a tightening triangle pattern, with whales buying 30M DOGE and targets near $0.46. Dogecoin is approaching a pivotal technical level that could trigger a significant price move. According to analysis by Bithereum_io on TradingView, the token is tightening within a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart; the pattern commonly precedes breakouts. The study surfaced on October 5 as the broader crypto market consolidated, with Dogecoin retracing 3% over 24 hours. What is the current Dogecoin technical setup? Dogecoin is trading inside a symmetrical triangle on the daily timeframe, with the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $0.204 acting as key support. A confirmed close above the triangle resistance and above $0.220 would increase the likelihood of an upward resolution. How did analysts and on-chain data describe recent activity? Technical commentary from Bithereum_io (TradingView) outlines staged upside targets if the triangle resolves upward. On-chain data referenced by analyst Ali Martinez, citing Santiment, shows large-holder accumulation of ~30 million DOGE in the past 24 hours, lifting combined whale holdings to 10.77 billion tokens. This accumulation is a supportive signal for bulls. Technical Targets After Triangle Breakout The analysis provided several progressive targets in the event of an upside breakout. Initial resistance and measured-move objectives are listed below as discrete levels for traders to monitor. Each level corresponds to common Fibonacci and measured-triangle projections used in technical analysis. Target Level Price (USD) Approx. Move from Current Initial target $0.298 ~16% Secondary target $0.337 ~36% Extended target $0.394 ~60% Primary upside target $0.466 ~100%+ Long-term reference $0.4846 December 2024 high Why does whale accumulation matter for Dogecoin? Large-holder accumulation often reduces available market supply and signals investor conviction. The reported 30 million DOGE buy, attributed to addresses holding 1M–10M tokens, increased combined whale holdings to 10.77 billion, per Santiment and analyst commentary from Ali Martinez. This pattern historically correlates with improved short-term momentum in altcoins. When should traders consider entering DOGE? Conservative entries are suggested around $0.220–$0.209, which overlaps the 200-day SMA at $0.204. Traders may wait for a validated breakout above triangle resistance or use staged buys within the support band. Risk management should include defined stop-loss levels below $0.20 to limit downside if the formation fails. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What technical pattern is Dogecoin forming?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Dogecoin is forming a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart, tightening toward a potential breakout with the 200-day SMA near $0.204 acting as key support."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much did whales accumulate recently?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""On-chain data reported that large holders accumulated approximately 30 million DOGE in 24 hours, increasing combined whale holdings to about 10.77 billion DOGE."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are the key price targets if DOGE breaks out?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Primary targets include $0.298, $0.337, $0.394, and $0.466, with a long-term reference near the December 2024 high of $0.4846."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How can I confirm a Dogecoin breakout? Confirm a breakout by waiting for a daily close above the triangle resistance and sustained volume increase. A follow-through close above $0.220 strengthens confirmation; use smaller timeframes for entry precision and a stop-loss beneath $0.20. What role does the 200-day SMA play for Dogecoin? The 200-day SMA at roughly $0.204 acts as a long-term trend filter and practical support. Sustained trading above this moving average indicates that medium-term trend bias remains constructive for Dogecoin.

On-chain signal: Whale accumulation of ~30M DOGE raises large-holder totals to 10.77B, supporting bullish momentum. Strategy: Consider entries near $0.220–$0.209, confirm breakout with daily close and volume, and manage risk under $0.20. Conclusion Dogecoin’s technical setup and recent whale buying create a conditional bullish case if the token holds above the $0.20 support zone. Traders should seek confirmation via a daily close above the triangle and volume confirmation before committing capital. Continued monitoring of on-chain metrics and the 200-day SMA will guide short-term trade management. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/dogecoin-triangle-breakout-analysis"" }, ""headline"": ""Dogecoin Nears Breakout as Whales Accumulate 30M DOGE; Targets to $0.466"", ""description"": ""Dogecoin breakout: DOGE compresses in a triangle with 200-day SMA support and whale accumulation; targets include $0.298, $0.337, $0.394, and $0.466."", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-06T12:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z""} Published: 2025-10-06 · Updated: 2025-10-07 · Author: COINOTAG",Analysis|Guides|News|DOGE,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-07 04:54:47

Here's Why,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/07/xrp-traders-eye-bullish-breakout-toward-usd3-10-here-s-why,"XRP spiked to $3.05 on doubled turnover before fading into consolidation, with whales offloading more than $300M as institutional desks repositioned ahead of a pivotal Fed decision. The $2.99 floor held on repeated defenses, leaving price boxed between $2.99 and $3.05 while ETF deadlines and rate speculation loom. News Background XRP gained 3% in the 24 hours to Oct. 7, trading between $2.97 and $3.05 before closing near $2.99. The move was driven by a surge in institutional flows — over 1.5B tokens transacted — and whale disposals exceeding $300M. Macro catalysts dominated sentiment. Markets now price a 96% chance of a Fed rate cut on Oct. 29, while 70+ ETF applications, including seven for XRP, face SEC deadlines starting Oct. 19. Price Action Summary XRP’s session range spanned $0.08 (3%), from $2.97 low to $3.05 high. Afternoon rally lifted price from $3.00 to $3.04 on 137M turnover, nearly 2x the daily average. Repeated rejection at $3.04–$3.05 confirmed resistance. Price consolidated around $2.99, where buyers stepped in multiple times. A late flush to $2.981 was absorbed quickly, with volume spikes of 2.2M creating a short-term floor. Technical Analysis Resistance remains entrenched at $3.04–$3.05, where heavy selling capped the advance. Support is validated at $2.99, reinforced by multiple retests and absorption of intraday liquidation flows. The price structure suggests accumulation at the $2.99 base, with a potential bullish continuation if momentum can retake $3.03 and challenge $3.05. Breakout through this resistance could set up targets toward $3.10, though macro catalysts remain the dominant driver. What Traders Are Watching? Whether $2.99 holds as a firm support base under continued whale distribution. If institutional positioning sustains momentum into the Oct. 19 SEC ETF deadlines. Market reaction to Fed policy signals — a cut could lift flows across risk assets.

Here’s how flows have broken down between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. US Funds Led The Latest Record Crypto Market Inflows In its latest weekly report on digital asset fund flows, CoinShares has shared the latest data related to cryptocurrency investment fund netflows for the past week. The investment funds here include not just the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , but also other vehicles like CoinShares’ own XBT Provider, an exchange-traded product (ETP). Digital asset investment products like ETFs allow investors in the traditional market to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other coins without having to directly own tokens on the blockchain. Since the US SEC approved the BTC spot ETFs last year, these vehicles have grown to be a cornerstone of the sector, attracting demand from investors who had previously stayed away due to digital asset exchanges and wallets being unfamiliar. Last week was a milestone one for digital asset investment funds, as the market witnessed net inflows of a whopping $5.95 billion, a new record. In terms of flows by country, the US products dominated with around $5 billion in net inflows. Switzerland and Germany followed with $563 million and $312 million in positive flows, respectively. From the above table, it’s visible that the US-based BlackRock’s iShares ETFs saw the strongest inflows at $2.5 billion. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund came second at $692 million. When it comes to individual assets, Bitcoin-related products were at the top of the sector, gathering an all-time high (ATH) inflows of $3.55 billion. These massive capital injections into BTC investment vehicles have come as the cryptocurrency’s price has rallied to a new ATH . Ethereum, which also saw a surge last week, witnessed almost $1.5 billion in inflows. Solana and XRP products set notable records of their own at $706 million and $219 million, respectively. Though, while these two altcoins saw this attention, others like Litecoin and Cardano only gained minimal net inflows. As for what was behind the record-setting week for digital asset funds, CoinShares noted in the report: We believe this was due to a delayed response to the FOMC interest rate cut, compounded by very weak employment data, as indicated by Wednesday’s ADP Payroll release, and concerns over US government stability following the shutdown. It now remains to be seen how flows related to ETFs and other investment vehicles will develop this week, particularly in the context of Bitcoin already having reached a new ATH. BTC Price Bitcoin touched $125,700 over the weekend, but its price has since seen a small decline to $124,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum ETFs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-07 05:00:20

Related Reading: XRP Ready For $9 Blast — ‘Break $3.10 And It’s Game Over,’ Says Analyst But the move comes with a caveat: on-chain trackers flagged 320 million XRP ($950Million) moving onto exchanges over the past week, an overhang that could test buyers’ resolve as price approaches a crowded resistance band. With ETF chatter heating up and Ripple’s banking ambitions in motion, the next leg hinges on whether bulls can absorb supply and force a clean breakout toward $4.00. Bitcoin Tailwinds, XRP ETF Buzz, and Banking Ambitions Momentum spilled over from Bitcoin’s surge above $125K, historically a favorable backdrop for large-cap alts like XRP. Traders also point to seven active spot XRP ETF filings slated for October decision windows, potentially binary catalysts for Q4, and Ripple’s application for a U.S. OCC banking license, which, if approved, could bolster institutional-grade custody, settlement, and on-chain liquidity services. In parallel, Asia hours showed persistent accumulation signals earlier in the week, with whale-linked wallets snapping up dips around $2.95–$3.00. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview $3.10–$3.30 Is the Battleground; $4.00–$4.20 on Break Technically, XRP’s structure retains a bullish tilt. Price is holding a fresh base around $2.95–$3.00, with the 50-day SMA near $2.93 and Parabolic SAR support around $2.74 cushioning downside. A multi-month symmetrical triangle from July looms overhead. Traders are watching a daily close above $3.12–$3.30 to validate breakout conditions. Clear that band on strong volume, and models point to $3.38 to $3.67 then $3.95, with extensions into the $4.00–$4.20 zone if momentum accelerates. Indicator-wise, RSI 54 leaves headroom before overbought, while a pending MACD bullish cross supports continuation. Derivatives are leaning constructive too, with open interest up 4% to $8.9B, signaling growing participation. The $950M Question: Can Bulls Absorb Supply? The main risk lies in renewed supply pressure, as exchange balances climbed from 3.45 billion to 3.85 billion XRP between September 26 and October 5, while ‘Age Consumed’ spikes suggest that some long-term holders have joined in profit-taking. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed After Hitting $125,700 All-Time High If those tokens rotate into asks, bulls must defend $3.00 / $2.93 to prevent a drift toward $2.85–$2.75.

Here’s More to Know,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ledgers-censorship-resistant-consensus-model-heres-more-to-know/,"In a recent statement, XRP Ledger dUNL validator VET emphasized that the XRP Ledger’s censorship-resistant consensus model was the foundation upon which the first decentralized cryptocurrency exchange was built. His post revisited an older but crucial piece of writing from 2018 by David Schwartz , Chief Technology Officer at Ripple, who explored the concept of censorship resistance and how it differs across blockchain systems. The tweet highlighted how the XRP Ledger’s design principles continue to be central to its performance and use cases years after their introduction. The XRP Ledger censorship resistant consensus model led to the creation of the first decentralized exchange in crypto. It's the nuanced difference that makes the XRPL so differentiated but so hard to story tell because of the knowledge barriers you need to overcome. pic.twitter.com/dnjn98iem8 — Vet (@Vet_X0) October 5, 2025 The XRP Ledger’s consensus mechanism was designed to make censorship both improbable and detectable. Unlike proof-of-work systems, where miners can delay or exclude transactions, the validators within the XRP Ledger operate under a transparent model that makes any attempt at censorship observable and provable. Each validator issues signed statements that reveal their voting behavior, meaning attempts to exclude valid transactions are traceable. This framework enables users to hold validators accountable and ensures that no single entity can manipulate the network’s outcomes without detection. Soft Censorship and Detectability In David Schwartz’s 2018 article, he described how “soft censorship,” which is the intentional exclusion or delay of legitimate transactions, is treated differently in various blockchain models. He noted that while soft censorship is inherent in proof-of-work systems such as Bitcoin due to their competitive mining structure, the XRP Ledger only tolerates it if network participants collectively choose to accept such behavior. This distinction, according to Schwartz, gives the XRP Ledger a degree of accountability that proof-of-work systems cannot easily replicate. Because validators’ actions are cryptographically verifiable, users can see if certain transactions are consistently excluded, identifying which validators are responsible. This transparency not only deters malicious behavior but also strengthens the trust framework necessary for the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange to operate effectively. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Suitability for Censorship-Sensitive Use Cases VET’s statement highlights how this aspect of the XRP Ledger enables it to target use cases that demand high resistance to soft censorship. Proof-of-work networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, face structural challenges in guaranteeing immediate and provable censorship resistance. In contrast, the XRP Ledger’s consensus design provides real-time detection of validator misbehavior, making it more suitable for applications where the reliable inclusion of transactions is essential, such as decentralized trading and payments. This difference, as VET pointed out, is not easily conveyed without technical understanding. The XRP Ledger’s consensus protocol is complex, and explaining its layered safeguards against censorship requires familiarity with cryptographic validation, voting mechanisms, and principles of distributed agreement. A Differentiated Model in Blockchain Design By referencing David Schwartz’s earlier discussion, VET reaffirmed that the XRP Ledger’s consensus model is not only about efficiency or speed but also about governance transparency and the ability to expose any attempts at manipulation. This characteristic has allowed the XRP Ledger to maintain one of the earliest and most functional decentralized exchanges in the crypto industry.

The central bank-backed crypto is aimed at faster and traceable transactions compared to traditional banking. India does not encourage digital assets that lack sovereign or asset backing, he said during the financial cooperation between India and Qatar in Doha. “We don’t encourage it because we don’t want anybody to be stuck at some point with a cryptocurrency that has no backing and nobody at the backend.” ‘We only tax it’: Piyush Goyal Per local reports , the minister clarified that India has imposed heavy taxes on unbacked crypto to discourage their use, rather than blanket bans. “As far as cryptocurrency, which is not backed by the Central Govt, while there is no ban as such, we are taxing it very heavily,” he added. Despite having the highest crypto adoption rankings this year, India’s heavy taxation to curb illegal activity has pushed more than 90% of Indian crypto trading offshore, according to a report by the Esya Centre. India’s crypto sector has previously pushed the government to lower a 30% capital gains tax and a 1% levy on every crypto transaction. India’s Digital Rupee Features Similar to Stablecoins Goyal said that India’s digital currency would be faster to transact, skipping paper consumption. It would carry features similar to stablecoins as envisioned in the US GENIUS Act. Last week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stressed that nations must prepare to “engage” with stablecoins, whether they like it or not. She highlighted the growing influence of digital currencies on the global financial system.

The price could aim for more gains if it remains stable above $0.2550. Dogecoin Price Turns Green Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.2350, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.250 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.260 and $0.2620. A high was formed at $0.2701 and the price is now consolidating gains near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $0.2507 swing low to the $0.2701 high. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.260 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2580 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.270 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2720 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.280 level. A close above the $0.280 resistance might send the price toward $0.2880. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.2920. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.30. Pullback In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.270 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2650 level. The next major support is near the $0.2580 level and the trend line. The main support sits at $0.250. If there is a downside break below the $0.250 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.2320 level or even $0.2250 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.2580 and $0.2550.

Ethereum breaks $4K after 1,146 days with $92.8M inflows as analysts target $7,331 amid strong technical and on-chain momentum. Ethereum has entered a renewed bullish phase after breaking above the $4,000 resistance level, ending 1,146 days of consolidation since its previous cycle bottom. The asset is now consolidating above this level, maintaining strong structure and forming a potential foundation for its next upward expansion toward $7,331. What triggered Ethereum’s breakout above $4,000? Ethereum broke $4,000 after cumulative buying pressure, a V-shaped recovery from a $3,800 fakeout, and renewed accumulation that shifted the zone from resistance to support. Front-line on‑chain metrics and technical confirmation across daily and weekly charts triggered momentum for sustained upside. How significant were the $92.8M inflows on October 5? On-chain reporting shows a $92.8M net inflow, one of the largest accumulation sessions in recent weeks. This inflow signals increased participation from both retail and institutional traders and aligns with reduced circulation inflation and steady token supply near 120.7 million ETH. ETH Breaks Multi-Year Range After Fourth Attempt Analysis from market commentators indicates Ethereum’s fourth breakout attempt closed decisively above $4,000 in August, converting the level into sustained support. The pattern follows three prior failed attempts in this bull cycle and a final successful breakout that confirmed the multi-year range breach. $ETH is going to $7,331 Ethereum broke out above the $4,000 level after 1,146 days of consolidation from its bottom. In this bull cycle, the price attempted three times to break out above it but failed. The price finally broke out on the 4th attempt back in August and has been… pic.twitter.com/kEOfwBA1IY — Mags (@thescalpingpro) October 6, 2025 CoinGecko data shows Ethereum trading near $4,587 with a 1.0% 24‑hour gain. The 24‑hour range sits roughly between $4,481 and $4,593, and market capitalization is approximately $553.20 billion. Circulating supply remains near 120.7 million ETH, with minimal inflationary pressure observed. Source: Coingecko Earlier, a brief drop to $3,800 formed a fakeout followed by a V‑shaped recovery that restored bullish momentum above $4,000. On‑chain monitoring services reported a clear accumulation session with $92.8M net inflows on October 5, indicating higher demand and balance sheet rebuilding among buyers. How does technical structure point toward a $7,331 Fibonacci extension? Technical analysis shows Ethereum trading above key moving averages with support around $4,475 and immediate resistance near $4,780. Using the breakout range, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension yields a $7,331 target, a common objective for sustained impulse moves when trend structure remains intact. Source: MisterSpread(X) Analysts highlight that holding above $4,260 keeps the bull thesis valid. Continued inflows, stable liquidity, and rising tokenization activity on the Ethereum network add structural support to the bullish scenario, provided macro conditions do not sharply deteriorate. Frequently Asked Questions How long did Ethereum consolidate below $4,000? Ethereum consolidated for 1,146 days below $4,000 from its previous cycle bottom, with multiple breakout attempts before a decisive breach on the fourth attempt in August 2025. What does a $92.8M inflow mean for ETH price action? Large net inflows typically indicate renewed demand and accumulation. The $92.8M session suggests increased buying interest and can support higher prices if follow‑through volume and on‑chain metrics remain constructive. Key Takeaways Breakout confirmed : $4,000 converted from resistance to support after 1,146 days of consolidation. On‑chain accumulation : $92.8M inflows point to renewed buyer participation across market segments. Targeting $7,331 : Technical Fibonacci extension and trend alignment suggest $7,331 as a potential medium‑term objective. Conclusion Ethereum’s break above $4,000, underpinned by $92.8M of inflows and confirmed trend structure, sets a constructive path toward a $7,331 Fibonacci extension if key supports hold. Readers should monitor on‑chain flows, moving averages, and macro liquidity as the next indicators of sustained expansion. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/ethereum-breaks-4k-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Ethereum breaks $4K after 1,146 days with $92.8M inflows; $7,331 target"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-78-1024x648.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Ethereum breaks $4K after 1,146 days with $92.8M inflows and technical momentum targeting a $7,331 Fibonacci extension.

The wallet app described the initiative as “one of the largest onchain rewards programs ever built,” while stressing it is “not a farming play” but a way to “regularly give back” to users. Rewards will include referral bonuses, mUSD incentives, exclusive partner rewards, token access and other perks, MetaMask said. Long-time users will receive special benefits, with the program explicitly connected to the long-anticipated MetaMask token. “OGs will not be ignored,” the team wrote, hinting at allocations for early adopters. Linea is Consensys’ in-house Ethereum layer-2 network, launched in September with a 9.4 billion token airdrop. Allocating $30 million in Linea for MetaMask Rewards ties two flagship projects together, effectively using MetaMask’s reach to bootstrap activity on the new rollup.

The move places Fasset within a regulated sandbox for Islamic fintech, enabling the company to expand its existing digital asset platform into full-service banking, the company said in a press release on Tuesday. With the new license, Fasset plans to offer Shariah-compliant savings, financing, and investment services that use stablecoins and tokenized assets. Customers will be able to hold deposits, invest in U.S. stocks, gold, and crypto, and spend through a planned Visa-linked crypto card. CEO Mohammad Raafi Hossain said the new license combines “the credibility of a global banking institution with the innovation of a fintech insurgent.” Fasset also plans to roll out “Own,” an Ethereum Layer 2 network built on Arbitrum, to settle regulated real-world assets on-chain. The company said that its stablecoin infrastructure allows users to avoid interest-bearing products while preserving the value of their assets against inflation or currency swings. Shariah forbids all forms of interest (known as riba ). Fasset aims to address a persistent gap in financial inclusion across the $5 trillion global Islamic finance industry. Access to halal, asset-backed financial products remains limited in many Muslim-majority regions, especially in Asia and Africa.

Robert Putnam defines social capital as a combination of “networks, norms, and trust,” emphasizing that the balance between bonding capital (among homogeneous groups) and bridging capital (among heterogeneous groups) is the very foundation of a healthy society. In reality, although digital technology has brought about a revolution in connectivity, it is paradoxically facing the dilemma of a further weakened foundation of community trust and reciprocity. Presenting a solution to this challenge of the times, WonderChain has declared a new paradigm called Web3.5. This declaration is drawing attention as it sets the revival of social capital as its ultimate goal, going beyond decentralization. Recently, major global media platforms, including Benzinga, have continuously praised WonderChain, showing extraordinary interest. They evaluated WonderChain as “the beginning of a new digital empire surpassing Apple and Google,” and “a project that has secured a leading position and is expanding from a single community into a global ecosystem.” Such reports suggest that WonderChain is being widely recognized as a digital movement oriented toward the restoration of social capital emphasized by Robert Putnam. WonderChain Declares the Web3.5 Era, Presenting the Mission of Reviving Social Capital The prevailing assessment is that although the existing Web3 ecosystem has achieved technical decentralization, it has failed to systematically build the trust and reciprocity necessary to realize community values, revealing fundamental limitations. In response to the demands of the times, WonderChain has attracted the attention of the industry by presenting its Web3.5 vision. This vision clearly contains the mission of reviving Robert Putnam’s philosophy of social capital within the context of an era that integrates both online and offline. The core of WonderChain’s strategy is to shift from a structure centered on private interests to one centered on collective benefit. It aims to realize community-based values grounded in trust and reciprocity through blockchain technology and real-world community activities. Global media DailyHunt recognized WonderChain as “a pioneer of Web3.5 in global media” and reported that “it is leading the design of the Web.5 era.” This shows that WonderChain is being spotlighted as a leading player in the next-generation Internet paradigm. Technological Embedding of Transparency, Trust, and Fairness WonderChain takes decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and smart contracts as its core, creating a structure in which all contributions are transparently returned to the community, and authority and capital are distributed fairly and equitably. Because contributors are justly rewarded according to their contributions, and all processes, including the management of foundation donations and funds, are transparently disclosed, WonderChain itself becomes the solution that completes the systemic reciprocity emphasized by Putnam. WonderChain begins the revival of social capital, powered by its community. The driving force of WonderChain’s system lies in its strong community. WonderChain plans to actively promote participation by users around the world, not only within online networks, but also in real-world activities such as travel, shopping, reputation building, local volunteering, and community participation. By providing benefits for practical activities, community participants create their own value and realize transparent reciprocity. This shows a new model in which “the more one participates, the more one is rewarded,” revealing the potential to restore lost trust in the digital age and rebuild the ecosystem of social capital. In particular, it is seen as the first attempt in blockchain history to naturally give value to lifestyle itself through users’ daily consumption and activities. Such an innovative approach works as a driving force that strongly increases voluntary participation among users. The data analytics platform CoinStats reported that WonderChain is showing “explosive expansion with 300% monthly growth,” and “This mirrors Apple’s early iPhone growth curve, a typical exponential growth pattern when innovative technology and strong community combine.” The WonderChain community, which has currently achieved explosive growth, immediately led to a cultural phenomenon. The authoritative media of the Greater China region, China.com, reported WonderChain as the first “cultural phenomenon” project in blockchain history, and it is being evaluated as a new turning point that leads culture beyond technology. Web3.5: A Global Alternative Toward a World Where Everyone Can Live Well WonderChain declares its goal to carry out a global mission for people around the world who need a foundation to grow through social capital. The project builds opportunities for global solidarity and cooperation through communities in regions suffering from a lack of trust and networks. It also connects communities and mentorships in areas facing social isolation or in need of social connection, launching a large-scale global solidarity campaign. Through this worldwide initiative for the revival of social capital, WonderChain seeks to create “a world where everyone can live prosperously” and helps communities revive vibrantly around the world. Conclusion: WonderChain Answers Robert Putnam’s Question with “The Revival of Social Capital” The message of WonderChain, which is implemented through Web3.5, is clear. To the question about the collapse of social capital that Robert Putnam threw, “Will we collapse as we are?”, WonderChain presents the practical and powerful solution of “Again, Social Capital Revival.” Through smart contracts and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) systems, WonderChain records every mission and fund management process transparently, ensuring fair rewards according to each contribution. All information, including foundation donations, stays open and visible to the community. This shows that blockchain technology no longer remains limited to the financial field but works as a tool for social solidarity. WonderChain stands as a platform that presents a tangible future, one that builds a shared environment where everyone can live together. Web3.5, pioneered by WonderChain, is a human-centric, virtuous cycle ecosystem that breaks down the boundaries between online and offline by using blockchain technology to return power and rewards (value) to users (the community). In other words, it is an innovative platform where all daily life activities (lifestyle) are transparently recognized as value and fairly rewarded.

In an X post on Tuesday, Sigel said surveys show younger consumers increasingly favor Bitcoin for wealth preservation. He noted that around half of gold’s market value comes from its role as a store of value rather than industrial or jewelry use. If Bitcoin were to capture half of that market, he argued, it would imply a value of $644,000 per coin at today’s record gold price. We’ve been saying Bitcoin should reach half of gold’s market cap after the next halving. Roughly half of gold’s value reflects its use as a store of value rather than industrial or jewelry demand, and surveys show younger consumers in emerging markets increasingly prefer Bitcoin… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 7, 2025 Erosion Of Trust In Traditional Reserves Drives Case For Bitcoin Adoption His comments came just hours after Bitcoin hit a new record high of more than $126,000 , marking a 95% gain in the past year. The surge has been fueled by institutional inflows, shrinking supply on exchanges and demand for safe-haven assets during political and economic uncertainty. VanEck’s broader research frames Bitcoin as more than just a speculative asset. In a report published earlier , the firm projected that by 2050, Bitcoin could solidify its role as a key international medium of exchange and evolve into one of the world’s reserve currencies. The analysis is based on expectations that trust in existing reserve assets will continue to erode. VanEck believes Bitcoin’s scalability challenges, which have limited mainstream adoption, will be addressed by emerging Layer-2 solutions. These upgrades, the firm argues, could unlock faster and cheaper transactions while preserving Bitcoin’s core qualities of immutability and sound monetary design. VanEck Sees Bitcoin Settling Ten% Of Global Trade By 2050 According to VanEck, Bitcoin could be used to settle 10% of global trade and 5% of domestic trade by 2050. Central banks, in that scenario, would hold about 2.5% of their reserves in the cryptocurrency. Applying a velocity of money framework, the firm suggests this level of adoption could support a long-term price of $2.9m per Bitcoin, equal to a total market capitalization of $61 trillion. The report also assessed the potential value of Bitcoin’s Layer-2 ecosystem. VanEck estimated these networks, which include scaling solutions for payments and smart contracts, could collectively be worth $7.6 trillion, representing about 12% of Bitcoin’s total future value. Billions Flow Into Bitcoin ETFs Signaling Growing Mainstream Acceptance The comparison between Bitcoin and gold has grown sharper this year. Gold climbed above $4,000 per ounce. At the same time, Bitcoin set back-to-back record highs. For many investors, gold still serves as the established hedge. However, Bitcoin’s digital attributes and scarcity are resonating with a younger generation that is more accustomed to digital-native assets. Meanwhile, institutional adoption has added further weight to this shift. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and other markets have attracted billions in inflows. These products provide regulated access and signal growing mainstream acceptance. As a result, the psychological gap between Bitcoin and gold as competing stores of value has narrowed. Sigel’s remarks reflect this generational shift in preference. Gold has served as a safe haven for centuries. Yet younger investors in fast-growing economies now appear more willing to back Bitcoin’s long-term role in the financial system.

Market context: Ethereum price $4,717.03; market cap $569.36 billion; 24-hour volume $43.73 billion; 24h price change +4.13%; 90-day price change +81.32% (CoinMarketCap, October 7, 2025 — mentioned as plain text). Why does this matter for investors and markets? The move reduces friction for institutional staking participation and may reframe yield expectations for ETF investors. It could attract capital that prefers regulated fund wrappers over direct staking custody, potentially altering ETH supply dynamics and investor behavior. Who confirmed the launch and what did they say? Grayscale’s CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, said: “This is a groundbreaking moment for institutional investors as we enable staking directly within our spot ETFs, allowing investors to earn rewards seamlessly.” On-chain confirmations were shared by analyst Yu Jin. These statements are reported here as direct quotes and attributions without external links. Frequently Asked Questions Can U.S. investors earn staking rewards via Grayscale’s Ethereum ETFs? Yes. Grayscale now offers staking capability within its U.S.-listed spot Ethereum ETFs, enabling investors to gain staking rewards through the ETF structure rather than direct wallet staking. Does staking inside an ETF change tax or custody responsibilities? Staking inside an ETF centralizes custody under the fund, which may simplify custody for investors. Tax treatment varies by jurisdiction; investors should consult tax professionals for specifics. Will staking affect ETH price immediately? There is no direct, provable causal link between the announcement and short-term price moves, though market sentiment and institutional flows could influence price over time. Analysts will monitor on-chain metrics and ETF inflows. Key Takeaways First-mover product: Grayscale introduced staking in U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, the first under the 1933 Act. Institutional access: The change simplifies staking access for institutional and retail ETF investors through a regulated vehicle. Market watch: Investors should track ETH supply signals, ETF inflows, and staking reward mechanics to gauge long-term impact. Conclusion Grayscale’s staking integration represents a notable advance in traditional finance meeting decentralized networks. By offering staking inside spot Ethereum ETFs, Grayscale bridges on-chain yield with regulated fund structures—a development that could accelerate institutional adoption and reshape how investors access Ethereum staking rewards.

After just under two years on the market, it’s also approaching $100 billion in assets. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared on X on Monday that IBIT is currently generating $25 million more in annual revenue than the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF) and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA). This news follows BlackRock’s filing for a Bitcoin premium income ETF in the state of Delaware. The aim is to launch a fund that pays investors income using premiums tied to Bitcoin. This product is different from their earlier Bitcoin ETF spot. It’s built to hand out actual income rather than the price of Bitcoin. IBIT matches BlackRock ETFs ‘ two-decade growth in just 435 days Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas described the rapid rise of IBIT as “absurd,” noting that it took only 435 days to reach that level. He noted that even long-established funds, such as IVV and EFA, took over 20 years to reach similar milestones. Balchunas also said that IBIT would likely be the fastest ETF to reach $100 billion in assets under management in the history of ETFs, a record currently held by Vanguard’s VOO, which took 2,011 days to achieve this level. IBIT’s assets are currently subject to a management fee of 0.25%, with BlackRock earning revenue as both investor interest and the price of Bitcoin climb. The fund continues to dominate the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market, as it did last week, with $3.2 billion in inflows, its second biggest level yet, a week that saw Bitcoin break $125,000. The surge in demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs comes partly from a more pro-crypto mood in Washington, as the Trump administration pushes to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” BlackRock is planning to establish a Delaware trust company At the end of last month, BlackRock unveiled its plans to create a Delaware trust arm for its Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. This, however, is just part of BlackRock’s efforts to establish a deep presence in the cryptocurrency field. The ETF would yield income by selling option contracts on Bitcoin futures. The steady payouts, however, would come at the cost of missing potential upside from IBIT, which tracks Bitcoin’s price directly. Balchunas noted that the move suggests BlackRock plans to stick with Bitcoin- and Ether-linked products rather than join the current wave of altcoin ETF proposals for the time being. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has temporarily suspended work on crypto ETF proposals due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. Harvard Management Company revealed it invested in the iShares Bitcoin ETF In August, Harvard Management Company announced that it held approximately 1.9 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin ETF as of June 30. Harvard also reported its endowment totaled $53.2 billion, keeping it ahead of Yale, Stanford, and Princeton as the nation’s wealthiest university fund. As early as 2018, Harvard reportedly began investigating the potential for investing in crypto-related funds. Emory University followed suit in 2024, disclosing a $15 million stake, 2.7 million shares, in the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, marking one of the first such moves by a major U.S. endowment. In a 2017 video , Professor Robert Kaplan, Martin Marshall Professor of Management Practice, expounded on the Harvard endowment, saying, “The endowment and its asset allocation is set up to anticipate you’re gonna have some volatile period.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-07 05:27:43

Investment bank TD Cowen said this is “bad news” for crypto, noting that the work of federal agencies, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has ground to a halt. Last week, Congress's failure to reach a budget agreement effectively shut down the federal government, furloughing numerous public employees. This situation is expected to last several weeks, or even longer. Jaret Seiberg of TD Cowen's Washington Research Group argued that the shutdown has completely halted the SEC's work on policy changes for the crypto industry: “Unless there is agreement on government funding, it is unlikely the SEC will reverse any significant policy changes for the crypto sector.” Since the Trump administration, the SEC has been working on regulations to grant exemptions to new crypto products and digital asset companies offering tokenized stocks, but with the current shutdown, all of that work has been put on hold. Seiberg stated that the closure will not only cause a delay in its duration, but will also take longer due to the backlog of work once employees return: “This isn't just a delay due to the closure itself. When staff return to work, they will have to both tie up loose ends and deal with urgent matters that accumulated during the closure.” Related News: Bitcoin Breaks Records While Big Whales Keep Going: They Accelerated Altcoin Trading - Here Are the Transactions The SEC's current operating plan only allows for “a limited number of personnel to respond to emergencies.” This has also completely halted the approval process for crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. According to Seiberg, with the SEC effectively “closed,” crypto policy is now being passed to institutions unaffected by the shutdown, such as the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): “We will closely monitor the steps these institutions will take regarding the authorization of banks to issue stablecoins, the storage of crypto assets and the development of tokenization-based payment systems.” *This is not investment advice.

The move also follows similar actions by the US and UK and comes as A7A5’s market cap skyrocketed to around $500 million. At the same time, the EU’s markets regulator, ESMA, is pushing to centralize crypto oversight under the new MiCA framework. It plans to transfer power from national regulators to a single EU authority. The main goal of the plan is to create a more unified and competitive financial system, but it faces resistance from member states over MiCA’s passporting rules and the balance between national autonomy and EU-wide regulation. A7A5 Faces EU Scrutiny The European Union is reportedly preparing to impose sanctions on A7A5, a Russian ruble-backed stablecoin that became the world’s largest non-US-dollar pegged digital asset. According to Bloomberg, the proposed sanctions would ban EU-based individuals and entities from directly or indirectly engaging with the token. This will be another step in the bloc’s efforts to clamp down on crypto avenues allegedly used by Russia to evade Western restrictions. The proposal also targets several banks across Russia, Belarus, and Central Asia which are accused of facilitating crypto-related transactions for sanctioned entities. This move follows a number of recent measures by the EU, including sanctions announced on Sept. 19 that blocked all crypto transactions involving Russian residents and prohibited dealings with foreign banks connected to the country’s financial sector. Not long after the EU’s latest sanctions on crypto platforms were unveiled, A7A5’s market cap surged from around $140 million to over $491 million in a single day, which was a 250% jump. The token’s market cap has since stabilized close to $500 million—making up roughly 43% of the total $1.2 billion capitalization of non-dollar stablecoins. In comparison, Circle’s euro-pegged EURC holds a market cap of about $255 million. A7A5’s market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) EU sanctions require unanimous approval from all 27 member states before implementation, leaving room for some revisions. The European Council describes these measures as tools to influence the behavior of targeted actors in line with the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. The EU’s move is also very similar to earlier actions by the US and the UK, which sanctioned financial networks allegedly helping Russia skirt restrictions. Those sanctions included Kyrgyzstan-based exchanges Grinex and Meer, as well as infrastructure linked to A7A5. A7A5 was launched in February on the Ethereum and Tron blockchains by Moldovan banker Ilan Shor and Russia’s state-owned Promsvyazbank, and claims to be backed by fiat deposits in Kyrgyzstan’s banking system. Despite facing bans and growing scrutiny, the company behind A7A5 made an appearance at the Token2049 event before being removed by organizers. EU Eyes Central Crypto Regulator Meanwhile, the EU’s markets regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), wants to gain expanded authority over crypto exchanges and related operators to unify oversight under the bloc’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. ESMA chair Verena Ross told the Financial Times that the European Commission is developing plans to transfer supervision of several financial sectors, including crypto, from national regulators to ESMA. She said the move will strengthen Europe’s financial integration and global competitiveness by addressing the ongoing fragmentation in the single market. Currently, under MiCA, crypto-asset service providers are licensed by national authorities rather than a central EU body. Smaller member states have been at the forefront of the rollout, with Lithuania granting a MiCA license to Robinhood Europe, and Malta approving major exchanges like OKX and Crypto.com. Luxembourg also authorized Bitstamp and Coinbase. However, Ross argued that this decentralized approach led to certain inefficiencies, as each member state has to develop its own regulatory expertise and systems. ESMA previously raised concerns about inconsistent licensing standards, and pointed out issues in a July report that criticized parts of Malta’s process. ESMA was created in 2011 after the global financial crisis, and its original mission was to harmonize financial regulation across the EU. The expansion of its powers to include direct oversight of crypto firms is a massive step toward centralizing authority under MiCA, which came into force in mid-2024 to establish a unified framework for digital asset issuers and service providers. However, there are still tensions over MiCA’s “passporting” rule, which allows companies licensed in one EU country to operate across all 27 member states without seeking separate approvals.People in the industry warned that the system’s uneven implementation threatens to undermine regulatory consistency. Some countries, like France, are reportedly considering limits on passporting rights for crypto companies licensed elsewhere in the bloc, which critics argue could violate the EU’s single-market principles. Marina Markezic of the European Crypto Initiative said the challenge lies in having multiple national regulators oversee the same law, which risks fragmenting the system MiCA was designed to unify.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-07 05:30:00

The analyst notes that tightening price action and strengthening on-chain momentum, signs that a major breakout could be imminent. Trading at $2.99 , XRP has been consolidating tightly for weeks, forming a “spring-loaded” setup beneath key resistance. Such compression phases often precede sharp moves, and with sentiment leaning bullish, traders are watching for a potential breakout. CryptoCeek highlights $3.15 as the key breakout level for XRP. A decisive close above it could ignite a run toward $3.50 and beyond. Momentum remains strong, with RSI climbing yet not overextended, signaling ample room for further gains if buying pressure intensifies. Beyond technicals, macro catalysts are fueling XRP’s momentum. Rising institutional adoption of blockchain payments and global upgrades to real-time settlement systems are reinforcing XRP’s core utility. XRP, HBAR, and XLM Lead the Charge Ahead of 2025 Fedwire & SWIFT Upgrades According to renowned market analyst X Finance Bull, ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrencies, XRP, Hedera (HBAR), and Stellar (XLM), are positioning ahead of the next major ETF wave. As global payment networks like Fedwire and SWIFT prepare for major 2025 upgrades, these assets are emerging as key pillars in the modernization of cross-border finance and real-time settlement systems. ISO 20022 is rewriting the rules of global payments — unlocking faster, smarter, and more secure transactions. With full compliance, XRP, HBAR, and XLM are positioned to lead the next wave of blockchain-finance integration. While investors fixate on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the next institutional wave may favor utility-focused, ISO 20022-compliant networks. XRP, HBAR, and XLM are already leading this shift. Therefore, these three networks share a unified mission, connecting traditional finance with the decentralized future. XRP is solidifying its role in global payments after Ripple’s legal win in the U.S., Hedera is driving enterprise-grade, eco-efficient blockchain innovation with backing from giants like Google and IBM, and Stellar continues to lead in remittances and financial inclusion across emerging markets. Notably, the alignment of ISO 20022 assets with upcoming Fedwire and SWIFT payment upgrades could signal a pivotal shift for digital assets in institutional finance. As a result, X Finance Bull predicts that once these integrations roll out, adoption of blockchain-based settlement systems will accelerate, potentially igniting fresh ETF demand and institutional inflows into utility-driven cryptos. Conclusion XRP’s consolidation near $3 signals mounting tension ahead of a decisive move. Strengthening technical momentum, rising institutional interest, and favorable payment infrastructure trends all point toward a potential breakout. Notably, a sustained close above $3.15 could confirm bullish conviction and ignite a rally toward $3.50 and beyond, reaffirming XRP’s position as a frontrunner in the next crypto upswing. On the other hand, the alignment of XRP, HBAR, and XLM with ISO 20022 standards, and their integration into upcoming Fedwire and SWIFT upgrades, places them at the core of a financial revolution. As global payment systems modernize, these compliant, utility-driven networks are emerging as the backbone of faster, smarter, and more transparent transactions.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|HBAR|XLM,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-07 05:30:29

The company has also activated staking for its Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), which currently trades over-the-counter and is awaiting regulatory approval. The two Ether funds have different investment goals, with ETHE to pay distributions for those who like cash flow, while ETH will roll staking returns into net asset value (NAV) so they can compound over time, the firm stated. At Grayscale, you can now choose how you want to experience Ethereum staking. $ETHE will pay distributions for those who like cash flow, while $ETH will roll staking returns into NAV so they can compound over time. Different goals, same platform. https://t.co/LtGJWGpxXP — Grayscale (@Grayscale) October 6, 2025 Ethereum Staking Still Healthy The products will offer additional staking yields, supposedly making it more attractive than a regular spot crypto fund, such as the Bitcoin ETF. Staking will be conducted passively through institutional custodians and validator providers to help secure the underlying blockchain protocols. The company also plans to expand staking to additional products and has published educational materials on how staking works. “Staking in our spot Ethereum and Solana funds is exactly the kind of first mover innovation Grayscale was built to deliver,” said Peter Mintzberg, CEO of Grayscale. The Grayscale ETHE fund has hemorrhaged capital since it launched with $4.5 billion exiting the product because its fees are much higher than its competitors, such as BlackRock (ETHA) and Fidelity (FETH). However, its mini-trust (ETH) has seen some of that in inflows, which have totalled $1.5 billion. It is highly likely that the major ETF issuers will follow suit and offer staking in their own funds soon. There is currently a total of 35.7 million ETH worth $167 billion and representing around 30% of the total supply staked. However, the exit queue is still very high with around 2.5 million ETH waiting to be unstaked . ETH Closes On ATH The Grayscale launch has come as Ether closes in on its all-time high, reaching a three-week high of $4,734 on Monday. It has currently cooled back to $4,680 during Tuesday morning Asian trading, which puts ETH just 5.4% away from its all-time high in August. “Ethereum’s liquidity reset is complete,” and the sweep below $4,000 was the “reload zone,” said analyst ‘Merlijn the Trader.’ “Now the chart screams expansion,” he added with a prediction that ETH would reach $10,000 to $14,000 this cycle.

The rally that started on June 23 continues to this day. During this period, in just a little over three months, BNB has doubled in value, rising from $615 to its current level of $1,245 . Given that $BNB is now trading in uncharted territory, speculation is running rife about where its next ceiling could be, with many predicting that BNB might mirror its 2021 rally, when it gained over 2,200% in just five months. So, to get to the bottom of this BNB price prediction, we turned to Gemini – one of the most powerful AI chatbots, capable of reading the crypto market in real time thanks to its direct integration with Google Search. Keep reading to find out what Gemini has to say about BNB’s next potential target. The AI also pointed us toward the best cryptos to buy now to ride this blue-chip crypto’s rally. Gemini’s BNB Price Prediction Points to $2,500 Gemini noted that BNB’s recent run-up comes after the breakout of a major consolidation pattern – an ascending triangle that had been in place since May 2021. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that the breakout from such a long-drawn consolidation is producing the kind of one-sided rally we’re seeing now. Most notably, $BNB could be far from done. Gemini pointed out that since the token is now in uncharted territory – meaning it has no previous resistances to grapple with – we can use classic technical analysis to project its next potential target. The AI measured the width of this ascending triangle pattern and mapped it onto the breakout level to estimate BNB’s future trajectory. This target comes out to around $2,500, representing a chunky 100%+ gain from even its current levels. Here’s the kicker now : while investing in $BNB directly could be a smart decision, an even smarter move would be to complement your BNB investment with some low-cap, high-upside altcoins that could ride alongside this Q4 crypto boom and potentially generate far better returns. Here are Gemini’s top three suggestions. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New Bitcoin Layer-2 for Faster Transactions and Web3 Support Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building a new Layer-2 solution for the Bitcoin blockchain. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it aims to solve Bitcoin’s age-old issues of speed and scalability. Unlike Bitcoin, which currently processes transactions one by one, $HYPER will introduce parallel execution, boosting Bitcoin’s throughput from just 7 transactions per second to thousands. Moreover, the integration of the SVM will allow developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) directly on Bitcoin – something that wasn’t possible before. The result? A never-before-seen Web3 environment on Bitcoin, complete with high-speed DeFi trading apps, DAOs, governance, lending, staking, and gaming dApps. It’s important to note that you can’t simply use your Layer-1 Bitcoin tokens on any Layer-2 network. That’s why Bitcoin Hyper offers a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge . It locks your original Bitcoin and mints an equivalent amount of ‘wrapped’ tokens for use on Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer 2 network. Given its potentially game-changing mission to crank up Bitcoin’s real-world utility, it’s no wonder Bitcoin Hyper has become one of the best crypto presales of 2025. The project has already raised over $22.1M from early investors, with each token still available for a low price of $0.013075. Here’s how to buy Bitcoin Hyper . And based on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $2,400 by the end of 2025 alone. Join the Bitcoin Web3 revolution – grab your $HYPER tokens today. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Crypto-Powered Content Creation Platform Offering AI Tools SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) aims to revolutionize the $85B online content industry, which is currently plagued with arbitrary bans, little to no assistance for creators, and exorbitant fees. SUBBD, on the other hand, will charge only a minimal fee from creators and, in return, offer them a never-before-seen suite of AI-powered tools, including voice, video, image, and profile generators. These tools will help creators automate their content production and management, freeing up more time to organically engage with their audiences. At the same time, SUBBD also promises an enriching experience for fans. All you need to do is buy and hold $SUBBD tokens, as these are the key to this vibrant ecosystem. $SUBBD lets you: Unlock premium content on SUBBD Subscribe to your favorite creators Send them tips or even personalized content requests Enjoy greater discounts the more SUBBD you hold Access beta features and gain voting rights on key platform decisions, such as creator onboarding You can also stake your SUBBD tokens for a new set of exclusive rewards. This includes a fixed 20% APY for the first year, along with access to exclusive creator livestreams, daily behind-the-scenes drops, and content from SUBBD’s top talents. Currently in presale, $SUBBD has already pulled in over $1.24M from early investors. Here’s how to buy $SUBBD in four simple steps . Each token is priced at just $0.056625, and according to our $SUBBD price prediction , it could reach $0.301 by year-end – delivering a massive 430% ROI. Get $SUBBD now and join the creator economy revolution. 3. nubcat ($NUB) – Cat-Based Meme Coin Gaining Steam After being in a downtrend ever since it first listed on exchanges, nubcat ($NUB) turned the tide in July when it soared over 1,000% in just a little over a month. As expected after such a strong rally, the token cooled off a bit, forming a descending triangle, which is often considered a continuation pattern following a major uptrend. Then, on October 6, $NUB gave a decisive breakout of this consolidation pattern, surging 41% in a single day. It now looks poised to rally at least to its latest swing high of $0.0615 – nearly a 100% gain from current levels. So, what exactly is nubcat, and why is it gaining so much steam? Well, unlike Bitcoin Hyper and SUBBD Token, $NUB isn’t a utility-backed altcoin. It’s an out-and-out meme coin with no intrinsic value, tokenomics, staking, or governance mechanisms. Based on a playful cat with a quirky personality, nubcat’s charm lies entirely in its meme power and viral appeal. Interested? Buy $NUB on MEXC or other crypto exchanges. Recap : With BNB poised for a 100%+ rally in the coming weeks, now’s the perfect time to load up on under-the-radar altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , and nubcat ($NUB). Disclaimer: Kindly bear in mind that crypto investments are risky. None of the above is financial advice. Always do your own research before investing.

Few tokens capture that spirit better than Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). As traders look for the next moon mission, the debate over where the Shiba Inu price prediction lands and what is DOGE up to is heating up again. Could a SHIB or DOGE’s $100 bag really turn into $10,000 before 2026? Or are the smarter plays now shifting toward newer names like Layer Brett ? Shiba Inu (SHIB): The OG That Refuses To Fade The Shiba Inu price prediction narrative has seen countless cycles with wild rallies, steep retraces, and an ecosystem trying to evolve beyond its meme roots. With SHIB still commanding one of the largest communities in crypto, it remains the go-to benchmark for meme coin success. But here’s the challenge: while SHIB has delivered astronomical gains in the past, its current market cap makes another 100x nearly impossible without trillions in new capital inflow. Even with Shibarium and a growing burn mechanism, SHIB may struggle to recreate its 2021 magic. Still, traders remain obsessed with the next Shiba Inu price prediction, hoping for at least a 10x run. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme King Still Has Teeth When Dogecoin (DOGE) first launched, few imagined it would become the blueprint for meme culture in crypto. Backed by an army of loyal holders, DOGE set the stage for everything that followed. Even now, the DOGE brand power is unmatched. It continues to hover near the top of the market, defying all odds. However, growth from here is a different story. Its lack of deflationary mechanics limits how far it can climb. For those hoping $100 in DOGE becomes $10,000, the math just doesn’t line up unless another viral mania hits. Layer Brett ($LBRETT): The Next-Gen Meme Chain Ready To Explode This is where Layer Brett already got the degens fired up. Priced at just $0.0058 , $LBRETT is quickly emerging as the bridge between meme coin hype and serious blockchain functionality. Built as a Layer 2 network, it is a supercar that runs 10,000 TPS and guzzles only $0.001 average gas fee. It’s lightyears ahead of SHIB and DOGE in scalability. Even better, Layer Brett offers staking yields around 610% APY, giving holders a reason to stick around beyond hype cycles. Its NFT and DeFi integrations are exactly why early believers are jumping in. This is a project in its ignition phase, not its cooldown. Analysts already project a 100x presale upside, putting $LBRETT in the same speculative range that Shiba Inu once occupied during its early run. In short, Layer Brett is the meme coin blueprint for 2025: high throughput, ultra-low fees, and Degen-tier staking rewards — all packed into one narrative rocket. Turning $100 Into $10,000 With Layer Brett The battle between these three represents distinct eras of meme coin evolution. DOGE built the culture. SHIB brought the ecosystem. And Layer Brett is fusing that history with cutting-edge blockchain performance. If the Shiba Inu price prediction of 10x holds true, that’s solid. If DOGE does another 3–5x, that’s nostalgic. But if Layer Brett delivers its projected 100x from the $0.0058 presale , the gains could leave both veterans in the dust. Layer Brett is shaping up as the meme coin that’s actually built to scale. For traders looking to turn $100 into $10,000, it might not happen through SHIB or DOGE, but $LBRETT just might make it real before 2026.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.18B inflows on Monday BlackRock’s IBIT led with $967M, pushing IBIT toward $100B AUM. October inflows reached $3.47B in four trading days; total ETF inflows near $60B since launch (source: James Seyffart, Bloomberg). US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.18B inflows as Bitcoin hit $126K—read the full breakdown and implications for institutional flows. Learn more. What caused the $1.18 billion inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on Monday? US spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $1.18 billion in net new money on Monday as a cluster of institutional buyers concentrated allocations while Bitcoin surged to a fresh record above $126,000. The bulk of flows landed in BlackRock’s IBIT, indicating strong demand from large-scale investors and rafted ETF rebalancing activity. How were inflows distributed across funds and which products led? The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated Monday’s flows with approximately $967 million, accounting for most of the day’s net new assets. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) added about $112 million, Bitwise’s BITB recorded $60 million, and Grayscale’s BTCE saw roughly $30 million. Smaller inflows went to Invesco, WisdomTree, and Franklin products. These figures align with public fund tallies and market commentary from industry analysts. According to CoinGlass data reporting and statements by ETF analysts observed on industry microblogs, October’s flows have accelerated: $3.47 billion in net inflows across four trading days. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted cumulative spot-BTC ETF inflows of roughly $60 billion since these products launched. Why is IBIT approaching $100 billion in assets under management? IBIT’s rapid AUM growth stems from a combination of large initial allocations, ongoing inflows from institutional investors, and strong performance as Bitcoin set new highs. Industry observers, including Nova Dius President Nate Geraci, highlight IBIT’s speed to near-$100B relative to established ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, which took far longer to reach the same milestone. Official fund statistics show IBIT holding nearly 783,767 BTC plus cash equivalents, at roughly $98.5 billion in reported AUM. Spot BTC ETF assets under management total $168 billion. Source: James Seyffart How do these ETF flows affect market dynamics and investor participation? Large concentrated ETF inflows typically increase liquidity and can amplify price momentum as portfolio managers acquire spot Bitcoin. Institutional participation—evident from the ETF flow mix—has played a significant role in the current bull market. Retail investors, by contrast, appear comparatively cautious, with several analysts noting retail activity remains muted versus institutional buying. What authoritative data and expert commentary support these findings? Key data points and expert observations referenced in this report include flow aggregates reported by CoinGlass and commentary from Bloomberg ETF analysts and industry veterans such as James Seyffart and Nate Geraci.

October’s inflows totaled $3.47 billion across four trading days, reflecting a rapid acceleration in demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs during the month. Are retail investors participating in these ETF flows? Retail investor participation appears limited compared with institutional demand; most reported flows and commentary point to large-scale allocations by institutional managers driving the recent inflows. Key Takeaways Massive single-day inflows : US spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $1.18B on Monday, the second-largest day on record. IBIT dominance : BlackRock’s IBIT captured the majority with ~$967M, pushing it close to $100B AUM. Institutional leadership : Data indicate institutions are the primary drivers of the current ETF-led rally; retail remains comparatively sidelined. Conclusion US spot Bitcoin ETFs’ $1.18 billion inflow on Monday, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, underscores the growing institutional role in crypto markets as Bitcoin reached a new all-time high. Continued monitoring of ETF flows and official fund disclosures will be essential for assessing sustainability and liquidity during this phase of the rally.

Decentralization efficiency: Optimum mumP2P cuts Ethereum block spread to ~150ms, lowering latency and fees — read implications and how to test. (COINOTAG) What is decentralization efficiency in blockchain systems? Decentralization efficiency is the idea that distributing control and data responsibilities across many nodes improves system scalability and resilience. Optimum’s mumP2P tests show that decentralized data propagation can sharply reduce block spread and latency, improving transaction finality and market responsiveness. How did Optimum test mumP2P on Ethereum Hoodi testnet? Optimum deployed mumP2P on Ethereum’s Hoodi testnet and measured block spread times. The system propagated blocks in approximately 150 milliseconds , around 6.5× faster than Ethereum’s Gossipsub baseline for validator data sharing. Tests focused on throughput, latency, and propagation fairness. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/decentralization-efficiency-mump2p"" }, ""headline"": ""Decentralization Efficiency: Optimum’s mumP2P Cuts Ethereum Block Spread by 6.5×"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T09:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Optimum’s mumP2P demonstrates how decentralization efficiency reduces block spread and latency on Ethereum Hoodi testnet, improving on‑chain performance."", ""articleSection"": ""Technology"", ""keywords"": ""decentralization efficiency, mumP2P, Ethereum Hoodi testnet, blockchain latency, data propagation""} Why does decentralization efficiency matter for Ethereum and other blockchains? Decentralization efficiency matters because central control often fails to scale: as networks grow, single points of control create bottlenecks. Distributed data handling—what Optimum calls a memory layer—allows quicker, parallel propagation and reduces reliance on centralized relays. What results did mumP2P produce and what do they mean? In controlled Hoodi testnet trials, mumP2P spread blocks in ~150ms. That measured improvement implies: Lower latency : faster block visibility for validators and nodes. Reduced arbitrage windows : markets react faster to new information. Potential fee benefits : quicker confirmations can indirectly reduce user costs over time. How does mumP2P differ from Gossipsub? mumP2P is built on mathematical principles of distributed memory and reliable communication developed by Muriel Médard and colleagues. Unlike Gossipsub’s gossip‑based dissemination, mumP2P focuses on structured, efficient memory-layer propagation that optimizes for latency and redundancy without central coordination. Propagation performance: mumP2P vs Gossipsub (Hoodi testnet) Metric mumP2P Gossipsub (baseline) Median block spread ~150 ms ~975 ms Relative speed ~6.5× faster 1× Expected market impact Lower latency, narrower price gaps Higher arbitrage windows How can developers test mumP2P on a testnet? Developers can reproduce Optimum’s experiments by running node software configured for mumP2P on an Ethereum testnet like Hoodi, instrumenting propagation timing, and comparing metrics against a Gossipsub baseline. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to benchmark mumP2P propagation on Hoodi testnet"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step checklist to measure block propagation and compare mumP2P vs Gossipsub."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/decentralization-efficiency-mump2p#step1"", ""name"": ""Deploy testnet nodes"", ""text"": ""Launch a set of validator and non-validator nodes on Hoodi with identical hardware and network settings."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/decentralization-efficiency-mump2p#step2"", ""name"": ""Enable mumP2P on one cluster"", ""text"": ""Run Optimum’s mumP2P configuration on a controlled cluster and record timestamps for block creation and receipt."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/decentralization-efficiency-mump2p#step3"", ""name"": ""Measure and compare"", ""text"": ""Compare median block spread and tail latency against a cluster running Gossipsub under the same load profiles."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/decentralization-efficiency-mump2p#step4"", ""name"": ""Analyze market effects"", ""text"": ""Simulate simple trading flows to estimate changes in arbitrage windows and responsiveness."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Does decentralization efficiency mean faster transactions?

Coinbase ADA holdings rose 462% to ~9.56M ADA, driven by cbADA demand on Base. Coinbase XRP reserves fell from ~970M to ~16.39M, a near 98% decline. Total cbADA supply now ~9.53M vs. 1.7M at launch, signaling institutional uptake. Coinbase ADA holdings jumped 462% to 9.56M ADA; learn why this matters and how XRP reserves fell 98% — read the full analysis and implications. Coinbase’s ADA holdings soar by 462% amid a steep 98% drop in XRP reserves, signaling changing demand trends on the exchange. Coinbase’s ADA holdings increased by 462% to 9.56 million tokens, signaling growing demand for wrapped ADA on the Base network. The exchange’s XRP reserves plunged from 970 million to 16.39 million, reflecting a 98% decline within a few months. Analysts link the rise in ADA reserves to increasing institutional interest and reduced market activity surrounding XRP. Coinbase ADA holdings have seen a sharp increase in recent months, while its XRP reserves have declined significantly. Data from Coinbase’s Proof-of-Reserves shows the exchange now holds around 9.56 million ADA, marking a notable 462% increase since June. The surge in ADA holdings aligns with the growth of Coinbase Wrapped ADA (cbADA) on the Base network. The total supply of cbADA currently stands at approximately 9.53 million, reflecting expansion from an initial 1.7 million ADA at launch. The increase suggests a steady rise in user demand for wrapped Cardano assets on Coinbase’s platform. What caused Coinbase ADA holdings to surge while XRP reserves collapsed? Coinbase ADA holdings rose due to expanding cbADA supply on the Base network and increased institutional flows into Cardano, while XRP reserves fell as withdrawals, reduced deposits, and lower wrapped-XRP demand depleted exchange balances. Coinbase’s Proof-of-Reserves data quantifies these shifts. How large is the shift in Coinbase’s reserves and what does it mean? Coinbase’s ADA position grew from roughly 1.7M to 9.56M ADA — a 462% increase. XRP reserves declined from about 970M to 16.39M — a near 98% drop. Together, these changes highlight a rebalancing of on-exchange liquidity and user preference toward wrapped Cardano products like cbADA. XRP Reserves Drop by Nearly 98% In contrast, Coinbase’s XRP reserves have dropped sharply over the same period. The exchange, which once ranked among the top ten holders of XRP, saw its reserves fall from about 970 million tokens to roughly 16.39 million. The wrapped version, cbXRP, mirrors this figure at 16.38 million tokens, indicating the depletion of XRP reserves on the platform. Coinbase’s Cardano reserves just shot up by 462%, going from 1.7M to 9.56M ADA. This means two things are happening: demand for Coinbase Wrapped ADA is exploding, and institutions are buying ADA and parking it on Coinbase. On the flip side, their XRP reserves have plummeted from… pic.twitter.com/AqODKIpP3k — dori (@dori_coin) October 5, 2025 Cardano DRep Dori highlighted the sharp contrast between ADA and XRP activity on Coinbase. He emphasized that the 462% increase in ADA holdings demonstrates growing institutional interest and user adoption of the asset. Meanwhile, the substantial reduction in XRP reserves may indicate a slowdown in institutional engagement or a decrease in demand for Coinbase’s wrapped XRP product. Why are analysts linking ADA growth to institutional interest? Analysts point to increasing cbADA supply (now ~9.53M) and large on-exchange ADA balances as indicators of institutional accumulation and custody use cases. Institutions commonly hold wrapped tokens for smart-contract interoperability and on-chain settlement, which explains rising cbADA demand on the Base network. Frequently Asked Questions How did Coinbase’s cbADA supply expand so rapidly? cbADA supply grew from about 1.7M at launch to ~9.53M as users and institutions bridged ADA onto the Base network, increasing demand for wrapped Cardano assets and custody services on Coinbase. Will the decline in Coinbase XRP reserves affect XRP’s market price? Reduced on-exchange XRP reserves can lower selling pressure, but price impact depends on broader market liquidity and demand. The reserve drop is significant but not alone sufficient to predict price direction. Key Takeaways Reserve shift: Coinbase ADA holdings rose 462% to ~9.56M ADA while XRP reserves fell ~98% to ~16.39M. cbADA growth: cbADA supply expanded to ~9.53M, suggesting institutional and user demand on Base. Market implications: The reallocation may reduce selling pressure for XRP and reflect increased custody demand for ADA. Conclusion The data shows a clear reallocation of Coinbase’s reserve composition with Coinbase ADA holdings emerging as a bigger custody position and XRP exposure contracting sharply. This trend underscores growing demand for wrapped Cardano products and a notable reduction in on-exchange XRP liquidity.

With more than just another technical iteration, Fusaka represents a major step toward solving Ethereum’s long-standing scalability and efficiency challenges. Why Fusaka Matters For Ethereum’s Next Era Of Decentralized Innovation Crypto markets are buzzing with the anticipation of the Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade. According to the CryptosRus post on X, VanEck has mentioned that the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, expected in December, could unlock one of the most transformative moments in the network’s history, making ETH faster, cheaper, and more scalable than ever before. Related Reading: Big Move: Ethereum Foundation Trades $4.5M ETH For Stable Assets The Fusaka upgrade will introduce PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling), a breakthrough that allows validators to verify blocks without downloading them in full. This innovation will significantly improve efficiency, increase blob capacity, enhance throughput for rollups, and reduce transaction costs for users across the ecosystem. As CryptosRus explains, the best way to imagine this is like ETH upgrading its plumbing, resulting in cheaper and faster operation for everyone using the network. However, VanEck believes Fusaka could be a game-changer, especially for rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, which depend on ETH for settlement. By reducing data overhead and optimizing block verification, the upgrade strengthens ETH’s foundation as the global base layer for crypto’s financial infrastructure. Furthermore, as network fees drop, ETH’s monetary importance rises. VanEck also believes that ETH is evolving from a simple gas token into the settlement currency of the entire rollup economy. Fusaka represents the next major phase in ETH’s journey, transforming it from a programmable chain into the financial backbone of Web3, ready to power the next wave of global digital finance. Analyst Tom Tucker shared his thoughts that Ethereum might be on track for a revolution. If the price continues to follow a pattern correlated with this increase in global money supply (M2) liquidity, it could climb to $15,000. Tucker highlights that the rapid increase in M2 is causing Fiat money to lose value fast, and ETH is being viewed as a smart hedge against global monetary debasement. “Doubters are gonna doubt, but this looks like a solid opportunity to me,” the expert noted. The Hidden Correlation Fueling ETH’s Next Rally Ethereum’s path to a new all-time high may be building faster than many in the market are expecting. Economist trader known as MikybullCrypto highlighted that the Russell index, which measures the performance of small-cap US stocks and tends to track the credit cycle, has just broken a new all-time high for the first time in four years. Related Reading: Global M2 Money Supply Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $20,000, Here’s When The trader noted that ETH has maintained a positive correlation with the Russell 2000 cycle.

Simultaneously, MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-growing presale project, is drawing the interest of investors with projections of 100x returns by 2026. In the meantime, as DOGE gains momentum, whales are moving into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE . This is an indication that capital is shifting toward crypto presales with higher upside potential. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction: DOGE to $1? Dogecoin price is trading near $0.26, with strength after breaking from an extended consolidation phase. The price stabilized inside a rising channel since mid-June, before the recent rebound from $0.24, which confirms that lower support is strong. With the next resistance zone forming around $0.27 to $0.30, the structural breakout is hinting at a bullish continuation. DOGEUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: TradingView If DOGE continues to move on the upside beyond the mark of $0.30, analysts note that the price could extend its gains to $1 in the next months. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55, indicating moderate buying power, with the possibility of continuation. Market sentiment is becoming better as the community expects possible regulations that can boost institutional exposure. Additionally, investor optimism is growing amid speculation that the SEC could approve a spot Dogecoin ETF this month. Following the September debut of the Rex-Osprey DOGE futures ETF, new ETF filings from Bitwise and Grayscale raised hopes for broader adoption. These developments solidify investor confidence while institutional traders explore DOGE’s liquidity and appeal. According to Arkham Intelligence, $700 million worth of DOGE was withdrawn from Binance and Coinbase, which suggests that pressure is accumulating. Should this trend persist, Dogecoin’s breakout above $0.30 could strengthen, pushing it closer to the $1 mark that is the long-term target. DOGE Whales on the Move Furthermore, according to on-chain data, Dogecoin whales bought more than 30 million DOGE in a day, at an estimated price of around $8 million. Analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that wallets containing one to ten million DOGE have increased their shares in common, in which they now hold close to 7% of the supply. This accumulation phase is an indication of increased confidence among large investors and an indicator of possible accelerating prices if retail momentum follows. Whales have a reputation for predicting the reversal of trends, and their recent purchasing activity is an indication of their belief in the potential of DOGE. Analyst Trader Tardigrade highlighted a Bull Pennant formation, with possible targets near $0.30. DOGEUSD Price Action | Source: X Similarly, other analysts predict a 200–300% pump toward the $0.74 level if market conditions remain positive. Dogecoin’s market cap stands at close to $40 billion, representing about half of the total meme coin sector capitalization. Interestingly, several whale wallets previously active in Dogecoin have started diversifying into presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which promises 100x ROI by 2026. As seasoned investors look for early opportunities beyond major caps, the flow of capital toward MAGACOIN FINANCE shows its rising profile among crypto veterans. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Rally 100x by 2026 MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming one of the most promising presale projects of 2025 with audited and verified, community-driven, and institutional-tier security. The project is an Ethereum-based blockchain and has undergone a full smart contract audit by Hashex.org, which has verified that there are no critical vulnerabilities. Also, the top altcoin is also undergoing a secondary audit with Certik, adding further legitimacy. These measures enhance investor confidence, addressing long-standing concerns about presale transparency. Besides security, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already collected over $15 million in its presale, signalling high retail and whale involvement. Analysts note that its organized tokenomics, strategic alliances, and practical financial usage will see early investors realize up to 100x returns by 2026. Most importantly, transparency, compliance, and innovation have been combined in the project, an aspect that is comparable to early DeFi presales that have since recorded tremendous expansion. Moreover, the increase in the need for diversification is reflected by whales shifting capital from previously safe assets, such as DOGE, to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Having verified audits, KYC compliance leadership, and a defined roadmap, the presale has become a suitable alternative in the unstable market. Long-term investors who perceive the upside consider MAGACOIN FINANCE as a risk-free, high-return chance in the existing bull run. Conclusion Whales and ETF optimism have helped Dogecoin price get renewed momentum to reach the $1 mark, a potential turning point for the meme coin. Nevertheless, as much as DOGE is the established favorite, other upcoming presales, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, are taking over. Having its Hashex-verified smart contract, continuing Certik audit, and rising investor engagement, MAGACOIN FINANCE is considered the next 100x opportunity going into 2026.

52783550,599761,1759816828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52783550.jpeg,"EU Plans Transfer Of Crypto, Stocks Oversight Power To Address Market Fragmentation – ESMA Chair",https://bitcoinist.com/eu-plans-transfer-of-crypto-oversight-esma-chair/,"The European Union (EU) is reportedly planning to shift oversight power of key financial market areas, including crypto, from national authorities to a centralized supervisory authority to help boost the bloc’s capital markets and harmonize regulation. EU Eyes Centralized Crypto Market Oversight On Monday, Verena Ross, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), affirmed that the regulation of stock exchanges, crypto companies, and clearing houses in the EU will likely be transferred to the bloc’s market watchdog. Ross told the Financial Times that the European Commission is preparing new rules that would shift the supervision of several areas of EU financial markets from national authorities to ESMA, to push for “a capital market in Europe that is more integrated and globally competitive.” Last month, the EU commissioner for financial services, Maria Luís Albuquerque, shared they were “considering a proposal to transfer supervisory powers to Esma for the most significant cross-border entities,” including crypto companies. “All of this would imply changes to the governance and decision-making processes of Esma, and we have various models to consider based on other existing models of centralised supervision,” said Albuquerque. The change aims to address the continued fragmentation in markets to “create more of a single market for capital in Europe,” the ESMA chair stated, arguing that “while we are doing a lot of work to try to make sure the implementation of MiCA is aligned, it clearly takes a lot of effort from us and the national supervisors to achieve that.” “It also means that people had to build up specific new resources and expertise 27 times in different national supervisors, which could have been done more efficiently once at a European level,” she added. Single Supervisor Proposal Faces Backlash Notably, the EU first proposed making ESMA the main supervisory agency of Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASP) during the development of its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The plan received backlash from smaller EU nations, such as Luxembourg, Ireland, and Malta, which criticized the watchdog’s ability to oversee the fast-growing crypto market and feared it could undermine their flourishing financial sectors. As a result, the supervision of these markets was left in the hands of the 27 national authorities, which Ross considers has created inefficiencies . She explained that the Paris-based authority has “tried for quite some time with the capital markets union and other initiatives to build a more effective capital market,” but “the reality has been that it is not easy to do given we have very different market structures.” In July, ESMA raised concerns about Malta’s process for approving pan-EU licenses for crypto companies, arguing that “some risk areas were not adequately assessed during the authorisation process.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the bloc watchdog’s Peer Review Committee (PRC) conducted a review of Malta’s Financial Services Authority (MFSA) CASP authorization process, finding the national regulator only “partially met expectations,” despite having adequate staffing and technical infrastructure. At the time, ESMA stressed that the concerns extended beyond Malta and urged all EU competent authorities to align their oversight mechanisms to ensure consistency under MiCA’s regulatory regime. Last year, former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi identified transforming ESMA into a single common regulator for all the bloc’s securities markets, similar to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as a “key pillar” to boost European capital markets. Since then, the European watchdog has been granted greater powers. The regulator will oversee new providers of consolidated tapes for equity and bond prices, and agencies that provide environmental, social, and governance ratings starting in 2026. However, Claude Marx, Director General of Luxembourg’s financial watchdog, considers that a single financial regulator would turn into a “monster.” “It is a fantasy that the European Commission wants to push a single supervisor,” Marx stated in June. “The European Commission has always stated they do not have an idée fixe to have a European SEC,” he argued, adding that there remain several barriers to providing financial services across European borders.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto market regulation|ESMA|ESMA Chair|EU crypto regulation|European Commission|MiCA regulation|US SEC|Verena Ross,EN,0,0,MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-07 06:00:28

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-national-trust-bank-is-coming-big-for-xrp-threat-to-swift-heres-why/,"A recent tweet by crypto analyst and investor Xaif drew attention to a video outlining what could become one of Ripple’s most consequential developments to date. It’s its potential evolution into a full-fledged banking entity. While Xaif’s post briefly mentioned the end of banking reliance on SWIFT and the growing influence of Ripple’s technology through ISO 20022 integration, the real focus lies in the accompanying video. The speaker in the clip presented a detailed breakdown of how Ripple’s integration with government systems and stablecoin reserves could redefine institutional payments, create new liquidity pathways, and accelerate the global use of XRP. The speaker began by explaining that Ripple may soon be able to hold stablecoins, particularly RLUSD, as reserves with the U.S. Treasury. This, according to them, would represent a major shift in how Ripple operates, moving it closer to functioning as a government-connected institution. He described this development as a direct integration between Ripple, RLUSD, and U.S. financial infrastructure, a move that could significantly enhance liquidity and performance across the Ripple ecosystem. The immediate effect, they argued, would be greater efficiency, higher transaction volumes, and an increase in XRP’s market demand. Banks don’t need SWIFT anymore the future is Ripple + $XRP . With ISO 20022 integration, XRP can settle massive transactions instantly Now you know why SWIFT is rushing to adopt blockchain tech they see what’s coming, and it’s called RIPPLE NATIONAL TRUST BANK pic.twitter.com/wVwEJX3bzr — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 5, 2025 The Start of the “Utility Phase” Throughout the video, the speaker emphasized that these integrations mark the beginning of the “utility phase” for XRP. They suggested that the current phase of speculative growth could soon give way to one defined by real-world utility, where Ripple’s banking status , once formalized and approved by the SEC, would establish XRP as the foundation of global transaction systems. According to their explanation, Ripple’s potential status as a bank would allow it to conduct transactions directly with governmental bodies, bypassing the need for the SWIFT network entirely. With ISO 20022 as the new communication standard, Ripple’s technology could seamlessly manage settlements using XRP, enabling near-instant global payments at minimal cost. The speaker described this as the turning point for the digital asset, asserting that once Ripple secures official banking approval, the landscape of cross-border transactions would fundamentally change. Transaction Efficiency and Cost Advantage A key part of the video focused on the practical cost difference between the traditional financial system and Ripple’s technology. The speaker shared a clear comparison: a $1 million transaction through existing banking channels could cost around $1,000 in fees, while the same transaction processed via Ripple’s network could cost less than $10. Even if Ripple applied its own fee margin, the overall cost to users might still total around $200 — far below the existing standard.

In their view, this advantage could quickly attract attention from banks worldwide once the technology’s profitability becomes evident. As more institutions recognize that they can reduce operational costs while improving service delivery, Ripple’s solutions could become a preferred alternative to the current SWIFT framework. Industry Impact and Competitive Dynamics The speaker concluded by highlighting that Ripple’s transformation into a banking entity would not simply be an internal milestone but a broader shift in the financial industry. By offering a faster and more cost-effective global settlement mechanism, Ripple could expose inefficiencies in legacy systems and force competitors to adapt or risk obsolescence. The integration of ISO 20022 compatibility, XRP liquidity, and RLUSD reserves, they suggested, would place Ripple at the center of an emerging financial infrastructure designed for the digital age.

Senator Cynthia Lummis says funding can begin immediately pending legislation, signaling a move to integrate Bitcoin into U.S. financial planning and reserve policy. Immediate funding possible: Senator Cynthia Lummis says SBR capitalization can start once legislation is approved. Initial funding likely from Bitcoin seized through legal processes and managed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Analysts estimate government Bitcoin buys could materially affect market dynamics and fiscal planning. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve news: US SBR funding ready pending law—learn how seized BTC could fund a budget-neutral reserve. Read the latest update now. What is the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR)? The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) is a proposed federal reserve to hold Bitcoin assets—initially capitalized by seized BTC and managed by the Department of the Treasury—to support national fiscal strategy and store-of-value allocations. Senator Cynthia Lummis has confirmed legislative approval is the remaining step to begin funding. How would the SBR be funded and managed? Initial capitalization is expected to come from Bitcoin seized through legal proceedings and transferred to Treasury custody. Future acquisitions are framed as budget-neutral , intending to avoid direct taxpayer expense. Management would likely follow Treasury protocols for asset custody and disposition, with oversight from Congress. Legislative progress: When can funding begin? Senator Cynthia Lummis has stated funding for the SBR can begin immediately once Congress passes enabling legislation. While an executive order signaled intent months ago, formal appropriation language and statutory clarity remain the primary legislative hurdles. Why are experts discussing seized Bitcoin and “paper gains”? Industry analysts, including Jeff Park (ProCap BTC), have discussed using unrealized “paper gains” from gold holdings as part of a broader reallocation strategy toward Bitcoin. These discussions highlight how seized BTC and reallocation of paper gains could create a path for budget-neutral SBR funding without new debt issuance. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Ready for Funding Pending Legislation, Says Senator Lummis"", ""description"": ""Senator Cynthia Lummis confirms the federal government can begin funding a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using seized BTC, pending legislative approval."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/us-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-sbr"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How the U.S. could implement a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR)"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step outline of likely steps to fund and operationalize a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using seized Bitcoin and budget-neutral mechanisms."", ""totalTime"": ""P0DT30M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Authorize funding"", ""text"": ""Congress passes enabling legislation or budget language to authorize the SBR and define Treasury custodial authority."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Allocate initial seized Bitcoin"", ""text"": ""Transfer seized Bitcoin to Treasury custody and designate those holdings as initial SBR capitalization."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Establish management framework"", ""text"": ""Develop Treasury rules for custody, reporting, valuation, and disposal to ensure transparency and fiscal accountability."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Plan future acquisitions"", ""text"": ""Define budget-neutral acquisition mechanisms, including exchanges of assets or proceeds, to grow the reserve without adding new taxpayer burden."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can the U.S. government start funding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve now?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Senator Cynthia Lummis says funding can begin immediately once Congress passes appropriate legislation; initial capitalization is expected from seized Bitcoin held by the Department of the Treasury."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Where will initial SBR funds come from?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Official statements indicate initial SBR capitalization will use Bitcoin seized through legal processes, with future purchases intended to be budget-neutral."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Could government Bitcoin purchases affect the market?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Analysts believe a government-backed Bitcoin acquisition could influence price discovery and market dynamics, potentially encouraging broader institutional adoption."" } } ]} What are the main risks and safeguards? Crypto assets are highly volatile, and integrating Bitcoin into federal reserves requires robust custody, valuation, and disclosure safeguards. Oversight from Treasury and Congress, plus established custody protocols, are essential to mitigate operational and fiscal risks. Who has commented publicly on the SBR? Senator Cynthia Lummis publicly affirmed readiness to fund the SBR. Jeff Park, Chief Investment Officer of ProCap BTC, has discussed potential strategies for using seized BTC and reallocating paper gains from gold as part of SBR funding models. Department of the Treasury is cited as the likely custodian for initial holdings (plain text reference). Frequently Asked Questions How quickly could seized Bitcoin be transferred to the SBR? Transfer timing depends on legal clearance and Treasury processing; once legal custody is established and statute permits, transfers can occur within standard federal asset disposition timelines. Will SBR purchases cost taxpayers? Proposals emphasize budget-neutral mechanisms: initial seized BTC provides capital and future purchases are described as not requiring new taxpayer-funded appropriations. Key Takeaways Immediate readiness : Senator Lummis says SBR funding can start pending legislative approval. Initial funding source : Seized Bitcoin held by the Department of the Treasury is the likely initial capital. Budget-neutral intent : Policy language aims to avoid direct taxpayer costs for future acquisitions. Conclusion The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve represents a significant policy development as U.S. lawmakers consider integrating blockchain assets into federal fiscal tools. With Senator Cynthia Lummis signaling readiness to begin funding and Treasury positioned as custodian, the SBR could reshape how the U.S. manages reserve assets—pending clear legislative authorization and robust oversight.

XRP’s prolonged consolidation below key resistance levels has attracted the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Dominus highlights that this tight price compression is not a sign of weakness but a classic precursor to a significant move. Market patterns suggest that XRP is coiling energy, waiting for the right catalyst to ignite a rapid ascent. Notably, multiple catalysts are converging in XRP’s favor. The broader crypto market is regaining bullish momentum, fueled by rising institutional adoption and a shift toward utility-driven assets. With its unmatched speed and low-cost cross-border capabilities, XRP stands to be a prime beneficiary. According to Dominus, this combination of real-world utility and surging demand could trigger a swift and decisive breakout. Meanwhile, resistance near the $3 mark has solidified XRP’s base, forming a strong launchpad for bullish momentum. According to Dominus, a breakout above $3.15 could ignite a powerful rally, propelling XRP toward $10. Ripple’s Footprint in Global Banking: 38% of Top 100 Banks Have Used Its Products Crypto observer SMQKE notes that Ripple once achieved a remarkable milestone, 38% of the world’s top 100 banks had integrated its products, cementing its position as a key bridge between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. Ripple’s suite of solutions, spanning RippleNet and XRP Ledger-based services, empowers banks to process cross-border payments with unprecedented speed, transparency, and cost efficiency. Unlike traditional systems plagued by delays, high fees, and multiple intermediaries, Ripple’s technology enables near-instant global settlements. For financial institutions, this translates to a decisive competitive edge in an industry where speed, reliability, and efficiency define success. Notably, the adoption of Ripple’s technology by leading banks underscores the growing institutional embrace of blockchain. Despite legal and regulatory hurdles, Ripple’s partnerships with major financial institutions highlight blockchain’s real-world impact, enhancing liquidity management, streamlining operations, and elevating customer experience. These institutions aren’t merely testing digital assets; they’re redefining modern finance through practical blockchain integration. Notably, Ripple’s adoption by major banks signals a growing shift toward mainstream crypto integration. By embedding Ripple’s blockchain-based payment infrastructure, traditional institutions are legitimizing digital assets and paving the way for a hybrid financial model, one where conventional banking and crypto solutions coexist to create faster, more efficient, and globally connected networks. Conclusion After a year of consolidation, XRP appears primed for one of its most significant moves yet. Strengthening technical momentum, growing institutional confidence, and favorable market conditions point to an impending breakout, supporting Dominus’s bold $10 target within three months and signaling a potential turning point for XRP’s position in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Ripple’s integration with 38% of the world’s top 100 banks is more than a milestone, it’s a clear sign of blockchain’s deepening influence in global finance.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-07 06:11:55

An altcoin season is a market phase where altcoins outpace Bitcoin in returns. The clearest signals are a range-bound BTC price, a marked drop in Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), rising TOTAL3 and a high Altcoin Season Index. These indicators together show capital rotating from BTC into altcoins. How is the Altcoin Season Index and TOTAL3 used as evidence? The Altcoin Season Index near 75 signals broad altcoin strength. TOTAL3 (the combined market cap of mid-to-small caps excluding ETH) making new highs indicates money flowing into non-BTC, non-ETH tokens. Historical data: in 2021 BTC.D fell from ~62.9% to ~40.87% while altcoin market cap (ex-ETH) rose from $406.8B to $857B in two months. In a public post on X, analyst Mags explained rotating part of BTC holdings into altcoins to capture superior returns, highlighting increased altcoin volume and improving market breadth. Source: Blockchain Center for Altcoin Season Index; TOTAL3 and BTC.D chart data from TradingView (plain text references). The market structure today differs from 2017: fewer tokens will rally simultaneously. Expect selective, liquidity-driven winners rather than uniform token-wide moves. Investors should combine on-chain signals with project-level fundamentals. Why does Bitcoin Dominance falling matter for altcoins? Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) measures BTC’s share of the total crypto market cap; a falling BTC.D signals capital leaving BTC for altcoins. Historically, substantial BTC.D drops coincide with strong altcoin rallies because capital rotates into smaller, higher-beta assets as BTC price plateaus. When should traders increase altcoin exposure? Traders should consider increasing exposure when multiple signals align: BTC consolidates or moves sideways, BTC.D declines, TOTAL3 sets new highs, and altcoin volumes increase. Entering earlier — before full mainstream recognition — typically yields better risk/reward, but requires disciplined risk management. Frequently Asked Questions What indicators confirm an altcoin season is underway? Primary indicators: falling Bitcoin Dominance, rising TOTAL3 and Altcoin Season Index above ~70, increasing altcoin trading volume, and BTC price moving sideways or range-bound while altcoins appreciate. How can investors limit risk during an altseason? Use position sizing, stop-losses, diversified allocations across vetted projects, and monitor liquidity metrics. Focus on projects with clear use cases and active development to reduce idiosyncratic risk. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What indicators confirm an altcoin season is underway?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Falling Bitcoin Dominance, a rising Altcoin Season Index (above ~70), TOTAL3 making new highs, and rising altcoin volume while BTC consolidates."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How can investors limit risk during an altseason?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Limit position sizes, use stop-losses, diversify across vetted projects, and prioritize liquidity and on-chain fundamentals."" } } ]} Key Takeaways Signal alignment : BTC range-bound + falling BTC.D + rising TOTAL3 = high probability of altcoin season. Selective exposure : Not all altcoins will rally; prioritize liquidity and fundamentals. Risk management : Size positions, set stops, and monitor volume and on-chain flows before scaling. Conclusion Current signals — an Altcoin Season Index near 75, TOTAL3 making new highs and returning altcoin volume — point to a rising likelihood of an altcoin season . Traders should combine these macro indicators with project-level research and strict risk controls. For timely decisions, track BTC.D, TOTAL3 and volume trends closely and maintain discipline as market dynamics evolve.
