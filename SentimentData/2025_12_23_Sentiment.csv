56205342,647706,1766444407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56205342.jpeg,BitMine Doubles Down on Ethereum With $40M Accumulation,https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-doubles-down-ethereum-with-40m-accumulation/,"Ethereum is currently trading above the $3,000 level, offering a surface-level sense of stability after weeks of volatility. However, beneath this price resilience, market sentiment remains decisively bearish. Many analysts are openly calling for lower levels in the coming months, citing weakening momentum, macro uncertainty, and persistent selling pressure across risk assets. Extreme fear dominates positioning, with investors showing little conviction that the recent recovery can evolve into a sustained uptrend. This pessimistic backdrop makes recent institutional-linked activity stand out. Amid widespread caution, data suggests that Bitmine—an entity associated with Fundstrat’s co-founder Tom Lee—has increased its exposure to Ethereum. Bitmine is a digital asset mining and investment vehicle focused on long-term participation in blockchain infrastructure, combining mining operations with strategic accumulation of major crypto assets. Rather than trading short-term price swings, entities like Bitmine typically operate with a multi-year horizon, emphasizing network fundamentals and asymmetric upside. The contrast is notable. While retail and short-term participants remain defensive, longer-term capital appears willing to step in during periods of fear. Historically , such divergence between sentiment and positioning has often emerged near transitional phases in the market cycle. Bitmine Expands Ethereum Exposure Amid Market Fear On-chain data from Arkham confirms that Bitmine has added another 13,412 ETH to its holdings, an acquisition valued at approximately $40.61 million at current market prices. The purchase comes at a time when Ethereum sentiment remains deeply bearish, reinforcing the contrast between short-term market fear and long-term capital positioning. Following this latest accumulation, Bitmine’s total Ethereum holdings now stand at roughly 3.769 million ETH, with an estimated market value of around $11.45 billion. This places Bitmine among the largest known Ethereum holders globally, highlighting the scale and conviction behind its strategy. Such positioning is not consistent with short-term speculation. Instead, it reflects a deliberate approach centered on long-duration exposure to Ethereum’s network value and future role within the digital asset ecosystem. Bitmine’s accumulation behavior suggests confidence in Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals despite near-term volatility and widespread pessimism. Historically, large-scale purchases during periods of extreme fear have often occurred when prices trade below perceived intrinsic value. While this activity does not eliminate the risk of further downside in the coming months, it signals that structurally patient capital continues to deploy. The growing divergence between bearish sentiment and aggressive accumulation underscores a market environment where positioning, rather than headlines, may offer clearer insight into longer-term expectations. Some investors are using current pessimism as an opportunity to build exposure, reinforcing the idea that fear-driven environments can also attract structurally patient buyers. Ethereum Price Struggles to Rebuild Bullish Structure Ethereum is currently trading just above the $3,000 level, attempting to stabilize after a prolonged corrective phase. The chart shows that ETH remains below its key medium-term moving averages, with the 50-day and 100-day MAs still acting as dynamic resistance overhead. Each recent attempt to push higher has been met with selling pressure, highlighting the market’s difficulty in reclaiming bullish momentum. Structurally, the price action since the October peak reflects a clear sequence of lower highs and lower lows, confirming that ETH is still operating within a bearish trend on the daily timeframe. Although the recent bounce from the $2,800–$2,900 zone suggests the presence of demand, volume remains muted compared to earlier expansion phases, indicating a lack of conviction from buyers. This supports the view that the current move is corrective rather than the start of a new impulsive rally. From a support perspective, the $2,900 area is now critical. A sustained loss of this level would expose ETH to a deeper retracement toward the $2,600–$2,700 region, where prior consolidation occurred. On the upside, bulls would need a decisive daily close above the descending moving averages near $3,300 to invalidate the bearish structure. Overall, the chart points to consolidation under resistance rather than trend reversal. Until ETH reclaims key moving averages with expanding volume, price action suggests ongoing distribution and elevated risk of further downside.

A crypto analyst has identified a critical support level at $0.128, which could change Dogecoin’s bullish outlook if it continues to hold above it. According to the analysis, holding above this key level could create the ideal conditions for investors seeking long positions. Analyst Identifies $0.128 As Critical Support For Dogecoin The Dogecoin price is above a make-or-break zone that could define its next significant price move and signal how investors position themselves in the long term. Market expert Crypto Tony has shared an updated outlook on Dogecoin, focusing on the importance of reclaiming the key support zone around $0.128 before considering long positions. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Crashes To April Levels, Here’s What Happened Last Time Notably, Crypto Tony has stated that a long setup could become more favorable and appealing if DOGE’s price can hold steadily above the $0.128 level. The support zone also emerges as Dogecoin’s price action shows early signs of stabilization after a sustained downside pressure. For the past few months, the meme coin has been in a decline, mirroring the broader market downturn and sustained risk-off sentiment. The analyst’s chart shows Dogecoin recently selling off sharply before finding temporary stability slightly above $0.128 a few days ago. The meme coin’s price is also trading below the highlighted horizontal line on the chart, which aligns closely with the support area. Visual projections on the chart further suggest a period of sideways movement between $0.128 and $0.130, followed by a potential breakout to the upside. Crypto Tony pinpoints a bullish target near $0.135, representing a more than 2.2% surge from Dogecoin’s price of $.0132, as of writing. Dogecoin Weekly Chart Signals Extended Correction Before Price Explosion Pseudonymous crypto analyst Cantonese Cat has also delivered a weekly analysis of Dogecoin, highlighting a prolonged corrective phase in its market structure. According to him, DOGE has already endured roughly 13 months of bearish price action, which aligns with a potential Wave 2 correction. The analyst stated that this downturn stage would precede an explosive Wave 3, which could see the meme coin’s price jump to new highs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Squeeze Maps Out Two Possible Scenarios From Here Cantonese Cat revealed in his analysis that his Dogecoin bullish setup may feel unlikely to many traders at the moment. This is especially true given that Dogecoin has been trending downwards for most of the year, failing to break out of its bearish position. Despite this, the analyst notes that the skepticism is precisely why the scenario remains plausible. The analyst’s chart shows that Dogecoin’s first wave has already completed, followed by a declining Wave 2. Price action is also interacting with multiple Fibonacci retracement levels while respecting a long-term downward trendline.

While traditional safe havens and AI-related equities capture investor capital, Bitcoin briefly touched $90,000 before retreating to the $88,000 range , failing to keep pace with the market’s clear winners. Market Divergence: Precious Metals and AI Ascend The divergence reflects a capital rotation where the ‘digital gold’ narrative is being tested. Silver also posted a record high, nearing $70 an ounce. Analysts at ByteTree noted that silver’s recent performance is beginning to rival Bitcoin’s returns over the long term, a major shift for precious metals advocates. “Bitcoiners can’t ignore the bull market in precious metals, which continues to roar,” a recent ByteTree analysis stated. “I suspect that when the rally runs out of steam, Bitcoin will step in.” Capital is also flowing aggressively into AI infrastructure. Alphabet’s announced $4.75 billion acquisition of energy infrastructure firm Intersect shows the intense demand for data center capacity. This trend is directly benefiting publicly traded crypto miners that have pivoted to high-performance computing (HPC). Hut 8 (HUT) stock, for example, gained over 17% following an upgraded price target and a major data center lease agreement. Alphabet Buys Clean Energy Startup For AI Data Centers In $4.75 Billion Deal https://t.co/CgAxr46YMf pic.twitter.com/W08jouCoxc — Forbes (@Forbes) December 22, 2025 Adding to the headwinds, record options expiries are approaching. Approximately $27.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ether options are set to expire this week on the Deribit exchange, creating caution among traders. Bitcoin’s Headwinds and Institutional Reallocation The current market action indicates a clear preference for tangible assets and dominant growth narratives over crypto. Institutional capital is not rotating out of risk entirely; it is reallocating to the perceived safety of the ‘debasement trade’ in precious metals and the high-conviction growth of AI. Bitcoin is caught in the middle, lacking a strong, immediate catalyst. The shift by miners like Hut 8 into AI infrastructure is a key sign. It suggests that management sees a more reliable and perhaps more lucrative application for their high-performance computing assets outside of the crypto market. This challenges the investment thesis for pure-play mining operations and may force a broader re-evaluation of the sector.

The Council of the European Union has officially approved the European Central Bank’s design proposal for a digital euro . This isn’t just another cryptocurrency story—it’s a carefully planned move to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that works both online and, uniquely, offline. For anyone following the future of money, this approval marks a pivotal moment with profound implications for privacy, security, and everyday spending across the bloc. What Exactly Did the EU Council Approve? The green light from the EU Council gives the European Central Bank (ECB) the mandate to proceed with a two-tiered digital euro system. The approved design features two distinct versions: one for online use and one for offline transactions. This dual approach aims to combine the convenience of digital payments with the fundamental need for financial inclusion and privacy. The offline version, in particular, is a standout feature designed to let users exchange value directly between devices, like smartphones or cards, without an internet connection. This approval is the culmination of years of research and places the Eurozone at the forefront of the global CBDC race. How Will the Offline Digital Euro Protect Your Privacy? Privacy stands as the cornerstone of the offline digital euro proposal. Here’s how it intends to work: Peer-to-Peer Transactions: When you use the offline version, the transaction data is exchanged directly between the payer and payee’s devices. No Third-Party Intermediaries: Unlike online bank transfers or card payments, these offline transactions would not be instantly visible to banks, payment processors, or the ECB during the exchange. Enhanced Confidentiality: This design mimics the privacy of cash, giving users more control over their payment information. However, it’s crucial to understand that complete anonymity is not the goal. Authorities would likely have access to transaction data for legal purposes, such as combating money laundering, but the offline feature significantly reduces routine surveillance. What Are the Security Risks of an Offline Digital Currency? While the privacy benefits are clear, security experts have raised valid concerns. Introducing an offline payment system for a sovereign currency creates new attack vectors that must be addressed. The primary worry centers on a threat known as a “relay attack.” In this scenario, a malicious actor could potentially intercept or duplicate the communication between two devices during a transaction, leading to theft or double-spending. The ECB and EU lawmakers now face the critical challenge of engineering robust safeguards, such as advanced encryption and secure hardware elements, to make the offline digital euro as secure as the physical cash it aims to complement. When Can We Expect to Use the Digital Euro? The Council’s approval is a major regulatory milestone, but it’s not the finish line. The journey toward a live digital euro involves several more phases. Next, the ECB will enter a “preparation phase,” which involves developing the necessary infrastructure, conducting extensive testing, and finalizing the legal framework. A formal decision on whether to actually issue the currency will come later, likely after a pilot program. Therefore, while the design is approved, Europeans should not expect to see a digital euro in their digital wallets for at least a few more years. Why Does This Matter for the Future of Finance? This move is about more than just modernizing payments. The digital euro represents a strategic effort by European institutions to maintain monetary sovereignty in an increasingly digital world. It aims to: Provide a secure, public alternative to private payment systems and stablecoins. Ensure the euro remains relevant and competitive globally. Promote financial inclusion by offering a payment method accessible to all citizens. The offline capability is a masterstroke for inclusivity, ensuring people in areas with poor connectivity or those who prefer not to use online banking can still participate in the digital economy. Conclusion: A Cautious Step Into a Digital Monetary Future The EU Council’s approval of the digital euro design is a landmark decision that balances innovation with caution. By championing an offline version, Europe is prioritizing user privacy and accessibility in a way few other CBDC projects have. However, the path forward is laden with technical and security hurdles that must be overcome to earn public trust. This isn’t just a new payment app; it’s a foundational shift in how one of the world’s largest economies conceptualizes money. The success of the digital euro will depend on its ability to be as private as cash, as secure as a vault, and as easy to use as a tap. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is the digital euro a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin? No, it is fundamentally different. The digital euro is a central bank digital currency (CBDC), meaning it is a digital form of existing euro banknotes issued and backed by the European Central Bank. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, its value is stable and it is centrally regulated. Will the digital euro replace physical cash? The ECB has repeatedly stated that the digital euro is intended to complement, not replace, physical cash. Both forms of currency will coexist, giving people more choice in how they pay. How private will my transactions really be? The offline version offers a higher degree of privacy for individual transactions, as data isn’t immediately shared with intermediaries. However, for anti-money laundering purposes, authorities will have mechanisms to access data under specific legal conditions. It offers more privacy than a credit card but likely less than anonymous cash. What stops someone from hacking the offline digital euro? This is the core security challenge. The ECB plans to use state-of-the-art encryption and secure hardware (like specialized chips in phones or cards) to protect against attacks. The system’s design and ongoing security audits will be critical to preventing theft and fraud. Can I use the digital euro outside the Eurozone? Initial designs focus on use within the Eurozone. For cross-border payments, the system would need to interoperate with other countries’ payment infrastructures, which is a complex challenge for future development. Will there be limits on how much digital euro I can hold? Most likely, yes. To prevent large-scale shifts of deposits from commercial banks to the central bank (which could destabilize the financial system), policymakers are considering holding limits for individuals, such as a few thousand euros.

Midnight Price Prediction: 4-Hour Chart Shows Strong Bullish Continuation NIGHT/USDT on the 4-hour chart displays a clear bullish continuation setup following prolonged consolidation. Price successfully breached former resistance around $0.07 and has now converted this level into support, confirming a structural shift favoring buyers. The market trades above rising 20, 50, and 100 EMAs, which are beginning to fan out, a classic indication that trend momentum is strengthening rather than stalling. RSI has advanced into overbought territory near the low-70s, reflecting strong buying pressure. Source: TradingView While this can precede short-term pullbacks, it more often signals trend strength in early expansion phases. The brief consolidation just below $0.11 suggests price is digesting gains rather than distributing, especially as pullbacks are being defended above the $0.09–$0.10 zone. If the $0.09 support maintains, the technical structure favors continuation toward the $0.14–$0.16 region initially, with extended upside projection toward the $0.19–$0.22 area if momentum persists.

56204457,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=250809,1766446211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Spot Gold Price Soars: Record High Above $4,450 Signals Market Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/spot-gold-price-record-high/,"BitcoinWorld Spot Gold Price Soars: Record High Above $4,450 Signals Market Shift In a stunning market move, the spot gold price has shattered records, blasting past the $4,450 per ounce barrier. This isn’t just another incremental gain; it’s a powerful statement that has investors and analysts worldwide taking immediate notice. What forces are propelling this historic rally, and more importantly, what does this mean for your portfolio? Let’s break down the surge behind the shine. What’s Driving the Record Spot Gold Price? The recent leap in the spot gold price to over $4,450 is not a random event. It’s the result of several converging economic pressures. Primarily, gold thrives in environments of uncertainty. Therefore, when central banks signal potential interest rate cuts or geopolitical tensions flare, investors instinctively seek safety. Gold’s traditional role as a reliable store of value comes sharply into focus during these times. Moreover, significant buying from global central banks has provided a solid foundation for this rally. Countries are diversifying their reserves away from traditional currencies, adding substantial physical gold to their holdings. This institutional demand creates a powerful tailwind that supports higher price levels. How Does This High Price Impact Investors? For the average investor, a record spot gold price presents both opportunities and considerations. On one hand, existing holders see the value of their assets climb. On the other, new buyers face a higher entry point. The key question becomes: is this a peak or a plateau on a longer journey upward? Understanding the difference between physical gold, ETFs, and mining stocks is crucial now. Each offers exposure to the spot gold price but with varying levels of risk and direct correlation. Physical Gold (Bullion/Coins): Direct ownership, but requires secure storage. Gold ETFs (like GLD): Easy to trade, tracks the price closely without handling physical metal. Gold Mining Stocks: Offers leverage to the gold price but adds company-specific operational risks. Is This Sustainable? Challenges and the Road Ahead While the momentum is undeniable, sustaining a spot gold price at these historic levels faces challenges. A sudden shift toward stronger economic data or a more hawkish stance from major central banks could strengthen the US dollar, typically applying downward pressure on gold. Furthermore, if risk appetite returns strongly to stock markets, some capital may rotate out of safe havens like gold. However, the long-term case remains compelling. The fundamental drivers of monetary debasement, geopolitical strife, and strategic asset diversification by nations are not disappearing overnight. This suggests that while volatility is guaranteed, the underlying support for gold is structurally stronger than in previous cycles. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Gold Rally So, what should you do in the face of this record-breaking spot gold price ? First, avoid emotional decisions. Do not chase the price out of fear of missing out. Instead, consider a disciplined approach. Review Your Allocation: Ensure your gold exposure aligns with your long-term investment strategy and risk tolerance. Dollar-Cost Average: If adding exposure, consider smaller, regular purchases to smooth out entry points. Look Beyond the Headline Price: Analyze the macroeconomic trends (inflation, real yields, currency strength) that will dictate the next major move. In conclusion, the surge past $4,450 is a landmark moment that underscores gold’s enduring relevance. It acts as a barometer for global anxiety and a hedge against systemic risk. While the path forward will include dips and corrections, the breach of this ceiling confirms a powerful bullish narrative. For astute investors, the record spot gold price is less a signal to buy or sell and more a command to pay close attention to the shifting economic landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the ‘spot price’ of gold? The spot price is the current market price for immediate delivery and payment of gold. It’s the benchmark price for one ounce of gold traded on global commodities exchanges. Why does gold go up when there’s economic uncertainty? Gold is considered a ‘safe-haven’ asset. When confidence in currencies or other investments wanes due to inflation, geopolitical risk, or recession fears, investors buy gold to preserve wealth, driving up its price. Is it too late to invest in gold at this high price? Timing the market is difficult. Many analysts view gold as a long-term strategic holding for portfolio diversification, not a short-term trade. The decision should be based on your financial goals and the role gold plays in your asset allocation. How can I invest in gold without buying physical bars? You can invest through a Gold ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) that holds physical gold, purchase shares in gold mining companies, or buy gold-based mutual funds. These offer liquidity and ease compared to physical storage. Does a strong gold price mean high inflation is coming? Not necessarily. While gold is a classic hedge against inflation, its price can rise due to many factors, including low real interest rates, a weak US dollar, or strong investment demand, even if inflation is moderate. What usually happens to gold prices if interest rates rise? Typically, higher interest rates make yield-bearing assets like bonds more attractive compared to non-yielding gold. This can put downward pressure on gold prices, but the relationship is complex and depends on the reason for the rate hikes. Found this analysis of the record spot gold price insightful?

On Saturday, the U.S. seized the Panama-flagged Centuries while it was hauling sanctioned crude from Venezuela, a decision that Beijing immediately condemned. This action leans on a 2002 deal (Salas-Becker agreement) that lets U.S. authorities board Panama-flagged vessels with only two hours’ notice. Dimitris Ampatzidis, a senior compliance analyst at Kpler, said, “The most interesting part of the Centuries seizure is the suggestion of the U.S. likely relying on its prior boarding agreement with the Panama Maritime Authority.” U.S. targeting tankers that serve Chinese refineries Right now, 23 tankers are floating inside Venezuela’s exclusive economic zone. Of those, Ragnar, Balsa, and Larko carry the Panama flag and are loaded with oil. Ampatzidis said, “If the Ragnar, Balsa, and Larko attempt to depart, it places them in the higher-risk enforcement category because they are operating under the Panama flag. We can see seizures as we saw with the Centuries.” Ragnar got filled on December 16, and the others followed one day later. The U.S. isn’t just going after already-sanctioned ships. Even stateless vessels or others tied to the shadow fleet are in the crosshairs. Ampatzidis said the U.S. is “increasingly willing” to grab any ship that tries to leave Venezuela with crude. Why go this far? Aaron Roth, a former Coast Guard captain who now advises at the Chertoff Group, said, “By squeezing Venezuelan oil, you are not only putting tremendous pressure on the Maduro regime, but you are also impacting China strategically.” Roth added that without discounted Venezuelan crude, China will have to turn to Russia or the Middle East, where oil is more expensive. He said, “The longer it goes on and it may create negotiating space in U.S.-China diplomacy.” China currently takes 76% of Venezuela’s oil, while the U.S. has reduced its share to 17%, down from about 34% last year. Venezuela has pumped 900,000 barrels so far in 2025, roughly 1% of global supply. The rest of that oil goes to Cuba, Spain, and Italy. But the tankers with the most direct connection to China are the ones being stopped. Seized tankers show pattern of travel to Chinese ports Kpler tracking data shows Centuries has done this before. In April 2020, it loaded two million barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude that ended up at Yantai in Shandong Province. This time, before being seized, the tanker was using spoofed AIS signals to hide its location. It pretended to be sailing near Curaçao on December 12, but satellite images showed it was parked near Lechería, Venezuela. The loading happened at the Jose Oil Terminal on December 9. By December 18, it was seen three miles off Grenada, heading west, likely to China… again. Kpler images also showed that Centuries used a different name “Crag” while loading. Around that same time, another ship was filled with two million barrels of Merey crude at the same berth. After that, Centuries just stayed east of the port until it finally started moving. Another tanker, Bella 1, was also taken. It wasn’t even loaded, it was heading back to Venezuela. But earlier in the year, it moved Iranian oil to Qingdao in March, and in 2023 it carried Venezuelan crude to Tianjin and Qingdao. These are not new routes. They’re pipelines to Chinese ports. And both ships were part of Trump’s weekend sweep. While Trump grabs ships, he’s also clashing with China and Panama over control of the Panama Canal.Trump has said he wants the U.S. to take it back, claiming China now controls the waterway. The ports on both ends, Balboa and Cristóbal, are run by CK Hutchison, based in Hong Kong. Trump’s people say China has too much control there and that it violates the U.S.-Panama treaty. A $22.8 billion deal to sell the ports to a consortium led by BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping stalled because Beijing opposed it. China wants Cosco, a state-owned ocean carrier, to get a controlling stake. Brandon Daniels, CEO at Exiger, said if Cosco joins the deal, China gains a chokepoint in global shipping. He also confirmed the U.S. and Panama have deals like Salas-Becker to fast-track vessel boardings. “It would most likely point to cooperation,” Daniels said. He also said Panama President José Raúl Mulino “takes their sovereignty very seriously.” Daniels said the CCP already has influence over Hong Kong companies like CK Hutchison, but Cosco’s control would deepen that grip. “China may gain a chokepoint in global trade container transshipment capacity, berthing priority, yard operations, and commercial data exhaust,” he said. Still, he believes Panama will cooperate with Washington to protect its own financial backing. “Panama is very focused on being a South Asian corridor and a major flag state for vessels, but it seeks cooperation with the U.S as a strategic imperative to sustainable funding,” Daniels said.

The designs trace back to decisions made in 2016, when Elon pushed Tesla to remove traditional handles and rely on powered controls across its lineup. Those choices happened while Tesla rushed to finish the Model 3, the sedan meant to pull the company out of a niche market and into mass production, according to Bloomberg. Design and engineering teams met repeatedly in Palo Alto and Hawthorne as pressure mounted to lock down final features. Doors became a serious debate, especially as Tesla was already dealing with complaints tied to faulty sensors on the Model X SUV. Elon’s personally electric door decisions for Tesla are colliding with real-world crashes Engineers warned about safety risks tied to electric doors and argued mechanical handles would still be needed, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk allegedly rejected that view. Tesla moved forward without explicit regulatory barriers, giving the company wide freedom to redefine door hardware. At the time, Elon frequently stepped into both large and small decisions, often staying overnight at factories, and that hands-on style decided how far the door design went. Years later, and Tesla doors still depend on low-voltage batteries that can stop working during collisions. When power drops, doors may not open unless occupants find hidden manual releases. In many cases, failures blocked emergency crews and delayed rescues. Bloomberg allegedly reviewed of police, fire, and autopsy records and identified 15 deaths across 12 U.S. crashes in the past decade where door access played a role after Teslas caught fire. These incidents also led to hundreds of complaints filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is now investigating the issue. China is weighing limits on flush handles, while European regulators say electric doors are now a rulemaking priority. Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm has vowed more than once that the company takes safety incidents seriously, while design chief Franz von Holzhausen promised in 2023 that he is working on door handles that combine electric and manual releases to help people exit during panic situations. Cost savings and minimalism were what drove Tesla’s original design Internal discussions for electric doors focused on cutting parts and lowering costs so the Model 3 could sell for roughly half the price of earlier Teslas. Designers also liked placing door buttons where a driver’s hand naturally rests. After locking in electric doors, Tesla added manual releases as backups. Early Model 3 cars only had them in front seats because U.S. rules did not require rear releases. Later versions added second-row releases. Tesla planned for delivery staff to explain these features, though how often that happened remains unclear. Senior vice president Lars Moravy said , “We always say at Tesla, if you aren’t deleting so much that you have to put something back, you haven’t deleted enough. Well, maybe we deleted too much.” Tesla now says door issues affect the entire EV industry, and is testing auto-unlock features when battery power drops and says doors will unlock automatically during serious crashes, though availability depends on model and build date. Tesla is working with Chinese regulators and expects time to adapt if laws change. Questions over door systems popped back up before the Model Y launch in 2020, which kept electric controls, but Elon has said very little about the matter since a 2013 earnings call, when he said door sensors sometimes failed and admitted that:- “Obviously, it’s quite vexing for a customer.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

His assessment does not center on short-term price movements or technical indicators. Instead, Scott focuses on structural and behavioral factors that he believes are placing disproportionate strain on retail investors. Scott’s position is grounded in the idea that market dynamics have shifted in ways that favor large, well-capitalized players while leaving individual investors increasingly exposed. He suggests that these pressures have intensified over recent months, contributing to widespread uncertainty and frustration among XRP holders. This is the worst time period for XRP holders Why? All these investment firms are trying to squeeze retail for every penny to cover their own 4th qtr shortfall after this horrible year That is why you are seeing all the propaganda flying around. Remember to these people?… — VincentScott (@VincentSco72192) December 21, 2025 Institutional Dynamics and Market Pressure According to Scott, much of the current stress can be traced to actions taken by major investment entities following a disappointing fourth quarter. He argues that some institutions are attempting to offset previous underperformance by drawing liquidity from the broader market, including retail participants. In his view, this approach limits genuine price discovery and amplifies downward pressure during already fragile conditions. Scott believes this environment has also led to a noticeable increase in aggressive narratives surrounding XRP and other digital assets. He contends that these narratives are often designed to influence sentiment rather than reflect underlying market realities, further complicating decision-making for individual investors. Speculation, Forecasts, and Accountability Scott is particularly critical of the volume of optimistic price predictions circulating online. He maintains that many of these forecasts rely heavily on selective chart analysis while ignoring the broader regulatory and structural constraints affecting the crypto sector. In his assessment, advanced blockchain systems are still operating within a market framework that lacks consistent legal oversight. This absence of uniform enforcement, he argues, allows influential market participants to promote ambitious projections without facing consequences when those expectations are not met. Scott sees this as a key reason misleading narratives continue to gain traction, despite repeated inaccuracies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recurrent Patterns in Market Commentary Another concern raised by Scott involves the aftermath of failed price predictions. He observes that bold targets are often followed by revised explanations or reassurance-focused content rather than transparent evaluations of what went wrong. According to him, this pattern persists because many retail investors continue to place trust in prominent market voices, even when past forecasts have proven unreliable. Scott emphasizes that the deeper issue is not price volatility itself, but the way investor anxiety is leveraged for engagement and monetization. He argues that this dynamic discourages candid discussions about risk and uncertainty, as such conversations may undermine profitable content strategies. Regulatory Uncertainty and Long-Term Implications From Scott’s perspective, lasting improvement in market conditions will depend on the introduction of clear and consistently enforced regulations. He believes that XRP, along with the broader crypto market, will remain vulnerable until legal standards are applied evenly across all participants. He points to ongoing legislative efforts in the United States, including work toward the proposed Clarity Act expected in 2026, as a potential step toward reducing uncertainty. Until such measures are implemented, Scott expects retail investors to remain exposed during periods of instability. Reactions to Scott’s views have varied within the XRP community. Some investors agreed, noting that they have reduced their exposure to crypto-related discussions to avoid emotional decision-making. Others emphasized personal responsibility, highlighting diversification and disciplined risk management as essential principles. Overall, Scott’s commentary has reignited debate about transparency, influence, and fairness in the current crypto market landscape.

Despite several short-lived relief rallies, momentum has failed to follow through, reinforcing growing concerns that the broader market structure is weakening. As volatility persists and upside attempts stall, an increasing number of analysts are beginning to openly discuss the possibility that Bitcoin may be transitioning into a bear market phase. Sentiment across derivatives and spot markets has turned noticeably more cautious, with risk appetite continuing to fade. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Lags Network Utility: A Valuation Reset Is Underway In this context, a recent report by Darkfost draws attention to a familiar but controversial narrative: capital rotation from gold into Bitcoin. With gold setting a new all-time high above $4,420 per ounce, the idea that investors may soon shift capital toward Bitcoin is resurfacing across the market. Historically, this narrative has gained traction during periods when traditional safe-haven assets outperform, fueling speculation that Bitcoin could follow as an alternative store of value. However, Darkfost cautions that this assumption is far from well-grounded. While the rotation thesis has been widely repeated throughout this cycle, empirical evidence linking gold outperformance directly to sustained Bitcoin inflows remains weak. Rather than signaling an imminent bullish turn, the current setup suggests that Bitcoin remains vulnerable, caught between macro-driven narratives and deteriorating internal market structure. Testing the Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Thesis Darkfost emphasizes that the popular narrative of capital rotating from gold into Bitcoin lacks direct, verifiable evidence. To address this, he constructed a comparative framework to identify periods where such rotations may have occurred. He did this without assuming a causal relationship. The core issue, as he notes, is that on-chain and market data cannot conclusively prove that capital exiting gold is the same capital entering Bitcoin. To approximate potential rotation phases, Darkfost applied a simple but disciplined signal structure. A positive signal appears when Bitcoin is trading above its 180-day moving average while gold is trading below its own 180-day moving average. In theory, this configuration suggests relative strength shifting toward Bitcoin. Conversely, a negative signal is triggered when both Bitcoin and gold trade below their respective 180-day moving averages. Indicating a broad risk-off environment rather than a rotation. This methodology allows historical comparison across cycles, highlighting moments where relative performance diverged. However, the results challenge the simplicity of the narrative. As shown on the chart, these signals do not produce consistent or reliable outcomes. In several instances, supposed rotation periods failed to generate sustained upside for Bitcoin. At other times, Bitcoin rallied independently of gold’s trend. The takeaway is clear: capital rotation between gold and Bitcoin is not an absolute or mechanical process. Market behavior appears far more nuanced. Driven by broader macro conditions, liquidity dynamics, and investor positioning rather than a straightforward asset-to-asset rotation. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Chase Upside With Historic Leverage – Breakout Fuel Or Fragile Setup? Price Struggles Below Key Moving Averages Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize after a sharp corrective phase, but the chart highlights that price action remains structurally fragile. BTC is currently trading just below the $90,000 level, an area that has flipped from support into near-term resistance following the recent breakdown. While the latest bounce shows short-term buying interest, it has not yet altered the broader bearish structure that formed after the October highs. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin is now trading below the 50-3D moving average (blue), which has started to slope downward, signaling weakening momentum. The failure to reclaim this level suggests that recent upside moves are corrective rather than impulsive. Related Reading: Legendary Bitcoin OG Deepens Ethereum Bet Despite Losses Exceeding $70 Million Below the current price, the 100-3D moving average (green) sits near the $85,000–$86,000 zone and has acted as interim support during the rebound. A sustained loss of this area would likely expose BTC to a deeper retracement toward the 200-3D moving average (red), currently rising near the low $80,000 region. The sell-off was accompanied by elevated volume. While the rebound has occurred on comparatively lighter participation, pointing to a lack of conviction from buyers. Structurally, Bitcoin is consolidating in a lower range. With lower highs and compressed volatility suggesting a pause rather than a trend reversal. For bulls, reclaiming and holding above $90,000 and the declining 50-3D moving average is critical to invalidate the bearish bias. Until then, price action favors range-bound trading with downside risk still present.

Some investors say the threat is close enough to affect price. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole, warned that Bitcoin could fall below $50,000 by 2028 if the network is not made quantum-ready. Developers Urge Caution Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin Core developer and co-founder of custody firm Casa, has argued that migration to post-quantum cryptography will not be quick. Lopp told followers on X that while quantum machines are not an immediate danger, moving the protocol and users’ funds to new signature schemes could “easily take five to 10 years.” He agreed with Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, who has also said the threat is not near-term but should be watched. No, quantum computers won’t break Bitcoin in the near future. We’ll keep observing their evolution. Yet, making thoughtful changes to the protocol (and an unprecedented migration of funds) could easily take 5 to 10 years. We should hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 21, 2025 Community Split Over Timing Reports have disclosed a widening gap in how the community views the timeline. Some venture capitalists and investment firms say quantum risk is imminent and should be priced now. On the other side, long-time Bitcoin advocates question the urgency. Pierre Rochard argued that quantum-resistant fixes can be paid for by non-profits or VC funding, and he suggested an attack would be so costly it would require government-level support. Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, pushed back with a plainspoken line about current machines, saying they “can’t factor the number 21 — not 21 million — 21,” to make a point about how far current quantum hardware still is from breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography. Andreas M. Antonopoulos has also weighed in, noting that upgrades are possible ahead of any real threat. What Upgrading Bitcoin Means Changing Bitcoin’s cryptography is not the same as updating ordinary software. According to developers, the distributed nature of the network, the variety of wallet software in use, and the many holders who do not actively manage keys make a broad migration difficult. BIP 360, a proposal that would add a quantum-ready signature method for BTC, has been pushed by some figures. Charles Edwards has called for node operators to enforce BIP 360 to speed adoption, while others say enforcement and coordination would be tricky and could take years. Calls For Protocol Change Market watchers should note the difference between theory and proof. The technical camp says there is time to plan and roll out changes carefully. The investment camp warns that market confidence could wobble if measures are not taken quickly. Calls for action include funding research, testing signature replacements, and building migration tools that exchanges and wallets can use.

This vision just moved closer to reality. BC Card, a major South Korean payment processor, has successfully completed a groundbreaking pilot project. The initiative allows foreigners to use stablecoin payments at domestic merchants, potentially revolutionizing travel finance. How Do These Stablecoin Payments Actually Work? The system cleverly bridges the new world of crypto with existing infrastructure. Instead of asking merchants to accept crypto directly, BC Card uses a digital prepaid card as a middle layer. A foreign visitor converts their stablecoins into value on this digital card. Then, they can use it anywhere that accepts standard card payments. Therefore, the experience feels identical to using a regular credit or debit card for both the customer and the shop. What Are the Key Benefits of This New System? This pilot isn’t just a tech demo; it solves real problems. For foreign visitors, it offers a familiar and potentially cheaper way to pay without constant currency exchange. For South Korean merchants, it opens the door to a new customer segment without requiring them to change their point-of-sale systems. Let’s break down the main advantages: Seamless User Experience: Transactions look and feel like normal card payments, removing the complexity often associated with crypto. Merchant Familiarity: Shops receive settlement in their local currency through existing channels, avoiding volatility risk. Financial Inclusion: It provides an efficient payment rail for tourists who may prefer using global stablecoins over traditional forex services. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Widespread Adoption? While the pilot is promising, the path to full-scale implementation has hurdles. Regulatory clarity around stablecoins and cross-border crypto transactions is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including South Korea. Furthermore, ensuring robust security and fraud prevention for these hybrid digital-card transactions will be paramount. Consumer education is another critical step, as users need to trust and understand the new stablecoin payments mechanism. Why Is This Pilot a Significant Step Forward? This project by BC Card is significant because it demonstrates a practical, non-disruptive path for crypto adoption. It doesn’t try to replace the current card network; instead, it enhances it. This approach could serve as a blueprint for other countries looking to integrate digital assets into their mainstream economies. The success of such stablecoin payments pilots could accelerate the global movement toward more efficient and inclusive financial systems. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Travel Payments BC Card’s completed pilot is more than a test—it’s a compelling preview of a frictionless financial future. By enabling stablecoin payments for foreigners through familiar card infrastructure, South Korea is positioning itself at the forefront of payment innovation. This model, if scaled, could transform how tourists interact with local economies worldwide, making cross-border spending as simple as a tap or a swipe. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to have a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. This makes them suitable for everyday transactions unlike more volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Which stablecoins were used in the BC Card pilot? The specific report from E-Daily did not name the stablecoins used. However, globally popular options like USDT (Tether) or USDC (USD Coin) are likely candidates for such a pilot focused on foreign users. Can South Korean citizens use this stablecoin payment system? The pilot specifically targeted foreigners in South Korea. Local regulations currently restrict South Korean residents from using certain crypto-based payment services, making this an initial solution for the tourist market. Is this service available to all tourists now? No, this was a completed pilot project. It demonstrates technical feasibility and a working model. A full public launch would require further regulatory approvals and commercial decisions by BC Card and its partners. How does this differ from just using a travel card or credit card? For the user, the point-of-sale experience is similar. The key difference is the funding source. Instead of loading the card with traditional currency, a user funds it with stablecoins, which they may already hold in a digital wallet, potentially offering faster and cheaper cross-border value transfer. What does this mean for the future of crypto payments? It signals a major trend: integrating cryptocurrencies into existing, trusted payment rails (like card networks) rather than building entirely separate systems. This “hybrid approach” is seen as a faster route to mainstream adoption. Found this insight into the future of travel and crypto fascinating?

The international agency said that discussions with regards to the country’s Bitcoin project continue, centered on enhancing transparency, safeguarding public resources, and eliminating risks. “Close engagement with the Salvadoran authorities is expected to continue in the period ahead with the objective of reaching a staff level agreement on all policies and reforms needed to complete the second review of the EFF program,” the statement read. The statement, issued by Mission Chief Mr. Torres, outlines the progress of the second review of the country’s 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). What’s the IMF’s assessment of El Salvador? The statement follows in person and virtual discussions that have occurred over the past months with the Salvadoran authorities on the second review of the 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement. According to the statement, El Salvador has enjoyed strong economic growth, growing faster than expected with a GDP that is expected to reach around 4% this year and with great prospects for next year. The IMF acknowledged the strong commitment of the country’s authorities to fiscal consolidation claiming the “end-2025 primary balance target is well on track to be met, and the recently approved 2026 Budget is consistent with a further reduction in the deficit along with an expansion in social spending.” It claims these efforts are supporting reserve accumulation and a reduction in domestic borrowing in line with program targets. There was also talk about the country’s advancing structural agenda which has seen several major reforms recently completed or approved. Some of those reforms include, an actuarial pension study and a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework; New financial stability laws regarding bank resolution and crisis management; The adoption of “Basel III” regulations to make the banking system safer; and A new Anti-Money Laundering (AML/CFT) law, which aligns the legal framework with international standards. Is El Salvador still buying Bitcoin? El Salvador was one of the first countries to start accumulating Bitcoin. However, that has not sat well with the IMF, and it has consistently expressed concerns about financial risks, volatility, and public sector exposure. Its back-and-forth with El Salvador regarding its Bitcoin policies has been ongoing since the country made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021. In March, the International Monetary Fund published a new Staff Country Report related to El Salvador, in which it demanded that El Salvador stop its Bitcoin accumulation through both purchasing and mining. It also demanded that the country should liquidate the fund created to buy more BTC, among other essential changes, beyond the Bitcoin Law amendments passed by the national congress at the end of January. The country’s President, Nayib Bukele, has shifted his stance on the IMF. In the past, he mocked the fund’s position on the Bitcoin Law, but has now reportedly made adjustments to the law and agreed to cease all public Bitcoin involvement. That agreement was announced in 2024, but doubts lingered about the implementation of the changes. The updated report specified that El Salvador must fully comply by December 2025 and detail what the changes will look like. While the initial changes to the Bitcoin Law primarily concerned its legal tender status, the IMF has emphasized that the public sector must cease its “voluntary accumulation of BTC.” As far as the IMF is concerned, El Salvador has complied; Bukele has shifted his stance, and a full phase-out of the Chivo e-wallet is underway. However, there are some contradictions regarding the country’s Bitcoin holdings. The government’s Bitcoin Office has claimed it is still stacking sats, with the latest purchase announced on December 22 when the country claimed it increased its holdings to 7509 BTC. It claims the milestone has only been possible via the purchase of one BTC per day. Despite the public announcements of the Bitcoin buying, an official IMF report from November alleged no accumulation is happening anymore and that increases in Bitcoin holdings in the reserve fund reflect the consolidation of Bitcoin across various government-owned wallets, rather than new purchases. The head of the Bitcoin Office, Stacy Herbert, has also previously stated that El Salvador has continued to buy Bitcoin in defiance of the IMF deal. “Some ‘bitcoiners’ trust the words of the IMF over the stacking actions of El Salvador recorded for eternity onto the Bitcoin blockchain,” Herbert wrote in March.

The Singaporean AI company has managed become the largest Southeast Asian buyer of Nvidia hardware in less than 3 years, which placed it squarely inside Washington’s long-running fight to stop advanced chips from slipping into China. The US is currently investigating centers on whether Megaspeed moved Nvidia chips into China without licenses or whether the company is Chinese in practice despite its Singapore registration. Such findings would breach US curbs designed to limit China’s AI and military capabilities. Singapore police confirmed they are checking for violations of local laws but did not name them. In Malaysia, which hosts most of the company’s operations, a government spokesperson allegedly said compliance monitoring is ongoing. The company rejects the allegations.In a statement, Megaspeed said it operates from Singapore and follows all applicable regulations, including US export controls. An Nvidia spokesperson allegedly said the chipmaker found no evidence of diversion and confirmed the company is fully owned and operated outside China with no Chinese shareholders. The spokesperson added that the services offered fall within permitted cloud activity. The business model involved is a neocloud structure, meaning it rents high-performance hardware for AI work. At many Southeast Asian sites, Megaspeed leases Nvidia capacity to Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant already under US national security review. Megaspeed’s trade records are consistently showing gaps between AI chip imports and deployed hardware From its 2023 launch through November this year, Megaspeed imported at least $4.6 billion in Nvidia hardware, covering 136,000 GPUs, based on Malaysian and Indonesian customs records compiled by Big Trade Data More than half came from Nvidia’s Blackwell line, chips Trump has said he will not approve for export to China even after easing limits on older models. Most Blackwell units arrived over six months ago, with another batch last month. When Nvidia teams visited company data centers, they saw only a few thousand Blackwell GPUs, inventory details shared with US officials show. An Nvidia official said the company also inspected separate warehouses and confirmed the hardware had not gone to China, but declined to say whether the stored totals matched the outstanding volumes. Nvidia said it conducts routine site checks worldwide and stated in mid-November, “Our visits confirmed that the GPUs shipped to Megaspeed by our partners are where they are supposed to be.” A later comment in mid-December said Nvidia had identified “substantially” all products sent and would visit again. The data center footprint Nvidia described to Washington differs from Megaspeed’s own public account of its facilities, and how Megaspeed has privately described its operations. The biggest question is the location of the “specific area” project touted in the investor presentation Megaspeed circulated in 2024. The slide deck, translated from its original Mandarin, said simply: “As of now, the largest NCP (Nvidia Cloud Partner) computing power cluster has been built in a specific area.” But then investigators identified a Chinese company using the same branding and claiming Southeast Asia staff, while posting job ads near the Shanghai site for work on restricted Nvidia GPUs. Naturally, that drew the attention of the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, though as of press time, America has not placed Megaspeed on any trade restriction list or ordered Nvidia to halt business. Malaysia’s investment and trade ministry said there is no clear evidence of violations so far and welcomed additional credible information. Singapore police earlier detained founder Huang Le for questioning and restricted her travel, but she is no longer in custody and is assisting investigators. Megaspeed completed most purchases of Nvidia processors in the six weeks before May 15, 2025, just before a Biden-era permit system for Southeast Asia was set to start and was later scrapped by Trump.

The latest reading from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index confirms it, holding firmly in the “extreme fear” zone at a score of 24. This crucial sentiment gauge has become a beacon for investors trying to navigate the stormy seas of digital assets. But what does this persistent fear actually signal, and more importantly, how should you respond? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by Alternative.me, is more than just a number. It’s a composite snapshot of market psychology. Currently sitting at 24, it has dropped a point from the previous day, reinforcing a prolonged period of investor anxiety. The scale runs from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). Therefore, a score of 24 is deep in pessimistic territory. This metric is calculated using a specific recipe of market data: Volatility (25%) : Heightened price swings feed directly into fear. Market Volume (25%) : Trading activity, or lack thereof, indicates participation levels. Social Media (15%) : The tone of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%) : Direct polling of market participant sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Shifts in BTC’s market share relative to altcoins. Trends (10%) : Search volume data for crypto-related terms. Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear? A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading is often viewed through two lenses. For some, it signals danger and a reason to exit. For seasoned investors, however, it can present a contrarian opportunity. Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have sometimes preceded market recoveries. This is because when sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, it often means weak hands have sold, potentially setting the stage for a rebound. However, this is not a guaranteed signal to buy; it’s a context tool. It tells you the emotional state of the market, which is a powerful force that can override fundamentals in the short term. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market So, what can you do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index screams caution? First, avoid making emotional decisions. Fear leads to panic selling, often at the worst possible time. Instead, use this period for research and strategy. Consider these steps: Review Your Portfolio : Ensure your asset allocation still matches your risk tolerance. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA) : If you believe in the long-term thesis, systematic buying during fear can lower your average entry cost. Secure Your Assets : Double-check the security of your holdings, using hardware wallets for long-term storage. Monitor Fundamentals : Look beyond price. Are development activity, network usage, and adoption trends still strong for your chosen assets? The Historical Context of the Fear & Greed Index It’s helpful to remember that markets are cyclical. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has visited these depths before, such as during the bear markets of 2018 and 2022. Each time, it eventually climbed out. While past performance doesn’t predict the future, it shows that extreme sentiment is a phase, not a permanent state. The key is patience and discipline. This index is a tool for gauging the market’s temperature, not a crystal ball. It should inform your decisions, not dictate them. Conclusion: Navigating the Sentiment Storm The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 24 is a clear sign that investor anxiety is the dominant force. This creates a challenging but potentially opportunistic environment. By understanding what the index measures and maintaining a disciplined approach, you can avoid the pitfalls of crowd psychology. Remember, the most profitable decisions are often made when they feel the most uncomfortable. Use data, not emotion, as your guide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 24 mean? A: A score of 24 falls into the “Extreme Fear” category (0-25). It indicates that market sentiment is overwhelmingly negative based on factors like volatility, social media buzz, and trading volume. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a good buying signal? A: It can be a useful contrarian indicator. Historically, extreme fear has sometimes marked potential buying opportunities, but it is not a standalone signal. Always conduct your own research and consider your financial goals. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on market sentiment. Q: Does the index only measure Bitcoin sentiment? A> While Bitcoin dominance is a 10% factor in its calculation, the index is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market, as influenced by social media, surveys, and overall trading activity. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me, which is its primary source. Q: Should I sell my crypto when the index shows extreme fear? A> Not necessarily. Selling during extreme fear often means selling at a loss. It may be a time to hold, reassess your strategy, or consider disciplined buying (like DCA) if your long-term outlook remains positive.

This transaction, worth approximately $5.15 million, was executed at an average price of $157.78 per token. Following this purchase, the wallet’s total holdings now stand at 84,033 AAVE. However, the portfolio currently shows an unrealized loss of around $2.29 million, highlighting the recent price pressure on the token. This substantial acquisition by the project’s creator is a classic ‘skin in the game’ move, often interpreted as a strong vote of confidence. Why Is This Happening During an Aave Governance Conflict? The timing of this purchase is perhaps its most intriguing aspect. Reports indicate significant internal discussions within the Aave community regarding two key areas: Governance Control: Debates over the direction and decision-making power within the Aave decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Revenue-Sharing: Discussions on how protocol fees should be distributed to AAVE token holders and stakeholders. Such conflicts are not uncommon in decentralized projects but can create short-term uncertainty. Therefore, the decision by the Aave founder to buy AAVE amidst this turbulence is a strategic signal intended to stabilize community sentiment. How Is the AAVE Token Price Reacting? Market data provides crucial context. At the time of the purchase, AAVE was trading significantly higher than its current price. According to CoinMarketCap, AAVE is now trading at approximately $149.92, reflecting an 8.11% decline over the past 24 hours. This dip suggests the market is weighing the positive signal of the founder’s purchase against the negative news of internal strife. The transaction shows a founder buying into weakness, a tactic often employed by executives who believe their asset is undervalued. What Are the Potential Outcomes for Aave? The founder’s bold move sets the stage for several possible futures for the Aave protocol. A positive resolution to the governance debates could unlock new value and innovation. Conversely, prolonged conflict might hinder development and erode user confidence. The Aave founder buys AAVE action is a high-stakes gamble that the community will navigate its challenges successfully. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether this vote of confidence pays off for all token holders. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence in Decentralized Finance The Aave founder’s purchase of AAVE tokens is a defining moment for the protocol. It demonstrates a deep belief in the project’s long-term fundamentals, even when faced with internal governance challenges. For investors and DeFi enthusiasts, this event underscores the complex, human-driven nature of decentralized organizations. While price volatility may continue in the short term, the founder’s substantial financial commitment provides a compelling narrative of resilience and long-term vision for the Aave ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Stani Kulechov? Stani Kulechov is the founder and a leading figure behind the Aave protocol, a major decentralized lending platform in the cryptocurrency space. Why would a founder buy their own token? Founders often purchase their project’s token to demonstrate confidence in its future, especially during periods of doubt or price decline. It aligns their financial interests with those of the community. What is the Aave governance conflict about? Reports suggest the conflict revolves around control of the Aave DAO’s decision-making process and how to best share the protocol’s generated revenue with AAVE token holders. Does the founder’s purchase guarantee the AAVE price will go up? No. While it is a strong positive signal, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by many factors, including broader market trends, adoption, and technological developments. It is not a guarantee of future performance. What is an unrealized loss? An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an investment that has not yet been sold. The loss only becomes “realized” if the asset is sold at the lower price. Where can I track such onchain transactions? Transactions like this are tracked by onchain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers, which allow anyone to view wallet activity and token movements on public ledgers like Ethereum.

The company, known for its substantial Bitcoin treasury, has been added to the widely followed Russell 2000 index. This move signals growing institutional acceptance and provides a fascinating case study at the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. What Does It Mean for a Bitcoin Fintech Firm to Join the Russell 2000? The inclusion of Fold Holdings in the Russell 2000 is more than just a line item. The Russell 2000 is a benchmark index tracking 2,000 small-cap U.S. companies. Therefore, this event marks a pivotal moment for a Bitcoin fintech firm to be recognized within the traditional financial ecosystem. It grants the company increased visibility among institutional investors, fund managers, and analysts who use the index as a guide for investment decisions. This development is a powerful validation. It suggests that companies built around Bitcoin and blockchain technology are being evaluated not just as speculative crypto plays, but as legitimate financial services businesses with measurable growth potential. The move can potentially lead to greater liquidity for Fold’s stock and attract a new class of investors who may have previously overlooked the crypto space. Why Is Fold Holdings a Standout Bitcoin Fintech Firm? Fold isn’t just another crypto startup. The company has strategically positioned itself with a unique proposition. Reports indicate that Fold holds a treasury of over 1,500 BTC. This substantial Bitcoin reserve acts as a powerful differentiator and aligns the company’s success directly with the performance of the leading cryptocurrency. Here are key aspects that make this Bitcoin fintech firm noteworthy: Dual-Strategy Model: Fold operates at the intersection of fintech services and Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Institutional Confidence: Its index inclusion reflects a level of corporate governance and transparency that meets traditional market standards. Market Signal: It acts as a bridge, making Bitcoin exposure accessible through a regulated equity. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Adoption? The journey of this Bitcoin fintech firm into a mainstream index is a landmark event with ripple effects. Firstly, it provides a regulated, familiar pathway for traditional investors to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s ecosystem without buying the cryptocurrency directly. This can reduce perceived barriers to entry. Secondly, it sets a precedent. Other crypto-native companies may now view public listings and index eligibility as viable strategic goals, further blurring the lines between digital and traditional asset classes. However, challenges remain, including regulatory scrutiny and the inherent volatility associated with Bitcoin’s price, which can impact the firm’s valuation. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin and Finance The inclusion of Fold Holdings in the Russell 2000 is a compelling story of convergence. It demonstrates that a Bitcoin fintech firm can meet the rigorous criteria of traditional finance while staying true to its crypto roots. This event is less about a single company’s stock and more about a symbolic opening of doors. It represents a step toward a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into the global financial framework, offering new opportunities for investors and legitimizing the entire sector. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the Russell 2000 index? A: The Russell 2000 is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 2,000 small-capitalization companies in the United States. It is a key benchmark for small-cap stocks. Q: Why is Fold’s inclusion in the Russell 2000 significant? A: It signifies that a company whose business and treasury are heavily tied to Bitcoin is being recognized as a legitimate player by traditional financial institutions and index providers, marking a milestone for crypto adoption. Q: Does this mean I’m investing in Bitcoin if I buy Fold stock? A: Not directly. You are investing in the company Fold Holdings. However, because the company holds a large Bitcoin treasury, its stock price may be correlated with Bitcoin’s price performance, offering indirect exposure.

FanDuel launched its prediction markets app “FanDuel Predicts” in five states and in partnership with CME Group, days after rival DraftKings released a similar product in 38 states. More companies are launching prediction market platforms following the substantial success of Kalshi and Polymarket. Flutter Entertainment launches FanDuel Predicts FanDuel, the U.S. online gambling division of Flutter Entertainment Plc, has entered the prediction markets space with the launch of FanDuel Predicts in five states. Cryptopolitan reported recently that its primary competitor, DraftKings Inc., rolled out its own prediction markets platform across 38 states. Prediction markets operate under federal regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that allows betting-style activities in states that have not legalized online gambling. FanDuel’s new app initially launched in Alabama, Alaska, South Carolina, North Dakota, and South Dakota, with plans for a phased national expansion throughout 2026. FanDuel Predicts will allow users to place wagers on the outcomes of sports events, cultural happenings, and financial indicators through a prediction markets exchange. “This launch in five states will provide valuable insights into customer engagement with this new platform, enabling us to refine our approach as we expand to additional states in 2026,” James Cooper, the senior vice president at FanDuel, said . The surge of interest in prediction markets is due to the rapid growth of startups like Kalshi Inc. and Polymarket, which have become new ways for users to wager on event outcomes. These platforms gained substantial market share in recent months, creating anxiety among established gambling companies about losing customers to less regulated competitors. Between August and November, shares of both DraftKings and Flutter Entertainment declined as investors began to grow concerned about the competitive threat of prediction market startups. However, Flutter’s stock price has risen since it announced the launch of FanDuel Predicts. The company’s shares climbed as much as 1.7% on Friday following the announcement. What is FanDuel Predicts doing differently? FanDuel is launching its prediction markets app in partnership with CME Group Inc., in order to provide the regulatory infrastructure needed to offer prediction market contracts legally. DraftKings also announced it will route trades through CME Group, but the company has acquired its own derivatives exchange that it plans to use for trading in the future. FanDuel plans to offer contracts on economic data, commodity prices, and stock indexes in all 50 states. However, sports-related contracts will only be available in states where online sports betting remains illegal. Some state gambling authorities have warned that sports betting companies could lose their licenses if they offer prediction markets tied to sports in jurisdictions where they already hold sports betting licenses.

Reports confirm his frozen World Liberty Financial (WLFI) holdings have lost a staggering $60 million in value. This dramatic loss highlights the intense risks and regulatory scrutiny within the cryptocurrency market. What Happened to Justin Sun’s Frozen WLFI Holdings? The crisis began when the World Liberty Financial team froze Justin Sun’s assets in September. This action came after he transferred approximately $9 million worth of WLFI tokens to another address. The team cited suspicions of market price manipulation as their primary reason for the freeze. Consequently, the value of his initial $75 million investment, made between November 2024 and January 2025, has now cratered. Why Won’t World Liberty Financial Unfreeze the Assets? The stance from World Liberty Financial is firm and clear. They have stated they will not release Justin Sun’s frozen WLFI holdings. Their decision stems from a commitment to protect their ecosystem and other investors. They believe unfreezing the assets could undermine market integrity. This situation raises critical questions about governance and power within decentralized projects. Key points from their position include: Suspected Manipulation: The team alleges actions intended to artificially influence the WLFI token price. Protocol Enforcement: They are enforcing their own rules to maintain project stability. Precedent Setting: This move signals a tough stance against perceived market abuse by large holders, or ‘whales’. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? This incident is not just about one investor’s loss. It serves as a cautionary tale for the entire cryptocurrency sector. It underscores the complex relationship between project teams and large-scale investors. Furthermore, it shows how quickly value can evaporate when assets are locked and sentiment sours. The fallout from Justin Sun’s frozen WLFI holdings may lead to: Increased scrutiny of whale activity and token vesting schedules. More robust clauses in project whitepapers regarding asset freezes. A reassessment of risk by large investors when engaging with new crypto projects. What Can Investors Learn From This Saga? For everyday crypto investors, this drama offers vital lessons. First, it emphasizes that even prominent figures like Justin Sun are not immune to severe losses. Second, it highlights the importance of understanding a project’s governance rules before investing. The power a development team holds can be substantial. Actionable insights include: Research Governance: Always review a project’s terms regarding asset locking and team authority. Diversify Risk: Avoid concentrating too much capital in a single, speculative asset. Monitor Whale Activity: Large transactions can signal both opportunity and impending volatility. Conclusion: A $60 Million Warning to the Crypto World The tale of Justin Sun’s frozen WLFI holdings is a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency’s volatile and unpredictable nature. It demonstrates that market rules are still being written and enforced, often in real-time. While Sun’s loss is monumental, the broader lesson on regulatory risk, project autonomy, and investment due diligence resonates for all market participants. The market watches closely to see if this establishes a new precedent for handling disputes between projects and their largest backers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why were Justin Sun’s WLFI holdings frozen? A1: The World Liberty Financial team froze the assets in September after Sun transferred $9 million worth of tokens. They suspected these moves were an attempt to manipulate the WLFI token’s price. Q2: How much did Justin Sun initially invest in WLFI? A2: Justin Sun purchased a total of $75 million worth of WLFI tokens between November 2024 and January 2025. Q3: What is the current status of the frozen holdings? A3: The holdings remain frozen, and the World Liberty Financial team has stated they will not unfreeze them. Their value has dropped by approximately $60 million since the freeze. Q4: What does ‘price manipulation’ mean in this context? A4: It typically refers to actions designed to artificially inflate or deflate a token’s market price for personal gain, misleading other investors about its true supply, demand, or value. Q5: Can Justin Sun legally challenge the freeze? A5: This depends on the legal jurisdiction, the terms of service of the WLFI project, and the specifics of the purchase. Such challenges in the decentralized crypto space are often complex and unprecedented. Q6: How does this affect other WLFI investors? A6: The event has likely caused significant price volatility and shaken investor confidence. It also sets a governance precedent for how the project team handles disputes with large stakeholders.

They usually are created in quiet phases when the pooling is underway. Most investors fail to catch such situations as they come before headlines become loud. At the moment, one of the Ethereum based DeFi cryptos seems to be making its way through that slit-range. It is getting attention, big buyers are getting very active, and the price structure is aimed at a switch. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Creating Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a two-sided lending protocol to be used in practice. The site promotes P2P lending and the P2P market. In the P2C model, assets are provided by users in common liquidity pools. They are given in turn mtTokens which reflect their deposit in addition to the interest they earned. As an illustration, a user providing ETH will be issued with mtETH that will increase with consumer borrowers repaying interests on the pool. The P2P side provides lending amongst users. Borrowers have the option of fixed rates or variable rates whereas lenders have their risk level of choice. The system is designed with loan to value limits and liquidations to cushion the protocol when the market is swinging. The involvement has continued to increase in addition to the product design. Mutuum Finance is a company that has attracted approximately 19.4M and has grown to over 18,600 holders. These numbers are important as they demonstrate that they are adopted prior to the launch of the platform. As of official updates, V1 will be integrated into the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, which will be the transition point between the development phase and the execution phase. The Token Price and Stage Evolution MUTM has a current price of $0.035 and it is at Phase 6. The maximum number of token supply is 4B MUTM. Of this, 45.5% is to be distributed early, or an equivalent of 1.82B tokens. Approximately 820M tokens have already been sold. The token has grown 2.5x since the beginning of the first phase up to the present price of $0.01, which is also known as a token. This model of staged pricing implies the introduction of an increased fixed price at every stage. The phase 1 participants are set at a 500% MUTM appreciation at the official price of launching at $0.06. With improved events in the project, the MUTM price should increase by almost 20%. This is important to early entrants since subsequent entrants trap a greater cost and initial phases have a better price-making timeline. Security Assessment Mutuum Finance has its focus on security. The token has a CertiK token scan award of 90 out of 100 that indicates contract structure and risk checks. Halbon Security is also performing a complete audit of the lending and borrowing contracts. The code is completed and is in the official examination. As another strategy to reinforce its systems, Mutuum Finance has introduced a $50K bug bounty. This would motivate independent researchers to debug the system and report vulnerability issues prior to V1. In the case of a DeFi crypto protocol that can be used with lending and liquidations, these layers can be very critical in trust and long term stability. Phase 6 is nearly at full allocation, and it is quickly tightening supply. The recent whale activities have been on the rise with large single allocations attracting focus. The level of competition in the 24 hour leaderboard has been increased with the best contributors receiving the MUTM rewards. Entry friction has also reduced and a wider range of users can take part now because of the card payments. Being a new crypto that runs on Ethereum, Mutuum Finance is placing itself ahead of Q1 2026, the infrastructure is almost complete, security stanzas are ready, and its supply is nearing its cap. To most traders observing what is turning out to be the potential best crypto to buy or the lowest priced crypto with practical use, it is a step that can be the transition point behavior and repricing.

56206994,647750,1766451609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56206994.jpeg,Bitcoin Futures Structure Favors Bulls as Short Liquidations Accelerate,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-futures-structure-bulls-short-liquidations/,"Bitcoin is once again attempting to reclaim the $90,000 level, as bulls cautiously rebuild a recovery narrative after weeks of volatility and heavy selling pressure. While sentiment remains fragile and many investors are still positioned defensively, recent price stabilization has opened the door for a short-term upside scenario. Rather than relying on optimism alone, analysts are increasingly pointing to structural indicators that suggest the balance of risk may be shifting. According to a report by on-chain analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s current setup shows tactical upside potential when viewed through the combined lens of market regime indicators and derivatives liquidation dynamics. Adler highlights that Bitcoin’s Regime Score has recently transitioned into the +15 to +30 zone, a range that has historically delivered positive average returns. This zone represents an early recovery phase, where downside momentum has faded but euphoria has not yet returned, often creating favorable conditions for asymmetric upside. At the same time, derivatives data show a clear dominance of short liquidations, meaning that recent price moves have forced bearish positions to close. This creates mechanical buying pressure, which can amplify upward moves even in the absence of strong spot demand. Together, these signals suggest that Bitcoin’s current attempt to reclaim $90,000 is not purely speculative but supported by an improving internal market structure. Regime Score and Liquidations Point to Tactical Upside Adler explains that Bitcoin’s composite Regime Score aggregates multiple market dimensions into a single framework, including taker imbalance, open interest pressure, funding rates, ETF flows, exchange flows, and price trend. The result is a unified indicator ranging from −100 to +100, designed to capture shifts in market structure rather than short-term noise. Currently, the Regime Score stands at +16.3, placing Bitcoin in the upper part of the neutral zone, defined between +15 and +30. Backtesting data for 2025 shows that this specific subzone has historically delivered average returns of around +3.8% over a 30-day horizon. This contrasts sharply with the −15 to 0 zone, where expected returns were negative, averaging -1.5% over seven days. Importantly, the indicator has recently rebounded from a bearish extreme, after dropping to −27 just a week ago, signaling a structural recovery rather than a random bounce. Adler highlights a critical nuance: transitions into the formal bull regime above +30 have historically coincided with local tops, often followed by negative short-term returns. This makes the current +15–30 range more attractive for tactical positioning, while aggressive accumulation above +30 may carry elevated risk. This view is reinforced by derivatives data. The long/short liquidation dominance oscillator has turned negative at −11%, indicating a surge in forced short closures, while its 30-day average remains positive. With long liquidation dominance at just 44%, short liquidations are clearly prevailing, providing additional mechanical fuel for upside. Bitcoin Tests Key Support as Volatility Compresses Bitcoin is currently trading around the $90,000 area after a sharp corrective move from recent highs, and the chart highlights a market at an important inflection point. Following the breakdown from the $105,000–$110,000 range, BTC experienced a swift decline that pushed the price below the short- and medium-term moving averages. The blue and green moving averages have rolled over, confirming a loss of upside momentum and signaling a shift toward a more defensive market structure. However, price is now stabilizing just above the psychologically critical $88,000–$90,000 zone, which has acted as a reaction level over recent sessions. This area aligns closely with prior consolidation and represents a short-term support cluster where buyers are attempting to regain control. Notably, selling pressure appears to be moderating, as the most aggressive downside move has already occurred, and recent candles suggest consolidation rather than continuation. The red long-term moving average remains well below the current price, indicating that Bitcoin is still structurally above its broader trend support. This reduces immediate downside risk, unless the $88,000 region fails decisively. Volume has also tapered off compared to the sell-off peak, suggesting that panic-driven liquidation may be subsiding. In this context, Bitcoin appears to be transitioning from an impulsive downside into a stabilization phase. A sustained hold above $90,000 would strengthen the case for a relief rally, while a breakdown below support would reopen the door to deeper retracements.

If you’ve been watching the crypto markets lately, you might have noticed something interesting: Bitcoin is back in the driver’s seat. The latest data from CoinMarketCap reveals a crucial shift—the Altcoin Season Index has dropped to just 16. This single number tells a powerful story about where investor money is flowing right now. But what does this mean for your portfolio, and should you be concerned about your altcoin holdings? What Is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? The Altcoin Season Index isn’t just another random metric. It’s a calculated gauge of market sentiment that compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The index excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give us a pure view of speculative momentum. When this index climbs above 75, it signals an ‘altcoin season’ where most alternative coins are outperforming Bitcoin. However, the current reading of 16 sends a clear, opposite message. This low score indicates we are firmly in what analysts call a ‘Bitcoin season.’ During such periods, capital tends to consolidate into the market leader, Bitcoin, often seen as a safer haven during uncertain times. The drop from 17 to 16 might seem small, but it reinforces a prevailing trend of Bitcoin dominance. Why Does the Altcoin Season Index Matter for Investors? Understanding this index is vital for making informed decisions. It helps you gauge overall market risk appetite. A high Altcoin Season Index suggests investors are confident and chasing higher returns in smaller, riskier assets. A low index, like we see now, suggests a flight to safety and quality. Here are the key implications of the current reading: Capital Rotation: Money is likely flowing out of altcoins and into Bitcoin. Risk-Off Sentiment: The market may be anticipating volatility or seeking stability. Timing Opportunities: Historically, deep ‘Bitcoin seasons’ have preceded major altcoin rallies. Is This the End for Altcoins? Not So Fast. While the Altcoin Season Index paints a bleak picture for altcoins in the short term, seasoned crypto investors know this is part of a natural cycle. Crypto markets are notoriously cyclical. Bitcoin often leads a bull market, with capital eventually trickling down to altcoins in a phenomenon known as ‘altseason.’ The current index of 16 is far from the 75 threshold needed to declare an altcoin season. However, this consolidation phase can be a healthy reset. It allows weaker projects to fade and strengthens the fundamental case for high-quality altcoins with real utility. For patient investors, this period can be an opportunity to research and accumulate promising assets at lower prices. Actionable Insights from the Current Market Data So, what should you do with this information? First, don’t panic. Market cycles are normal. Use this time to review your portfolio. Consider if your altcoin investments are based on strong fundamentals or mere speculation. Diversification remains key, but the Altcoin Season Index suggests tilting your allocation towards Bitcoin might be prudent in the immediate term. Secondly, set up alerts. Watch for when the index begins to climb steadily. A sustained move above 50 could be an early signal that sentiment is shifting back towards risk-on assets. Finally, stay informed. Indexes like this are tools, not crystal balls. They provide context but must be combined with other analysis. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin-Dominant Landscape The drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 16 is a significant data point confirming Bitcoin’s current supremacy. It reflects a cautious market prioritizing the original cryptocurrency. While this may disappoint altcoin enthusiasts in the short run, it underscores the importance of understanding market cycles. The path to potential altcoin gains often runs through periods of Bitcoin strength first. By monitoring this index and maintaining a disciplined strategy, you can navigate these shifts with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that measures whether the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day window. A score above 75 indicates an ‘altcoin season.’ Why did the index drop to 16? The index dropped due to Bitcoin outperforming the majority of altcoins over the past three months. This signals that investor capital and confidence are currently concentrated in Bitcoin. Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is this low? Not necessarily. A low index indicates a market phase, not a permanent state. It may be a time for strategic review and rebalancing rather than a wholesale sell-off, especially for projects with strong long-term fundamentals. How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data, allowing investors to track gradual shifts in market sentiment. Can the index predict the exact start of an altcoin season? No single metric can predict exact market turns. The index is a strong indicator of trend, but it should be used alongside other technical and fundamental analysis tools. Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? You can find the index on the CoinMarketCap website, usually within their market analysis or research sections.

Institutional players are increasingly positioning in silence, favoring strategic accumulation over public signaling. This phase is rarely loud or obvious, and it’s defined by patience, regulatory awareness, and long-term infrastructure planning rather than short-term speculation. While the broader crypto market debates short-term price swings, a quieter story is unfolding behind the scenes. According to skipper_xrp’s post on X, institutions and banks are methodically positioning themselves, and the word on the street is that they’re betting big on XRP. Why Institutions Accumulate XRP In Silence Many analysts believe that the asset is entering a phase where price discovery could accelerate beyond the $100 mark, and this sudden price increase will come as a shock to investors. At the same time, the XRP Ledger is expanding beyond its traditional role in cross-border payment into decentralized media in the US. Related Reading: ‘Think Again’ Before Selling Your XRP; Expert Tells Investors Adding to the momentum, BXE is set to list on a major US exchange on January 21st, following its partnership with a leading node provider. The increased network activity means higher usage of the XRP Ledger with more XRP being burned. Despite BXE trading at $0.06 and a fixed supply of 500 million, many investors view it as undervalued. An investor and crypto trader known as Xaif Crypto has mentioned that from 2019 to 2021, MoneyGram actively integrated Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, by leveraging XRP as the bridge asset for real-time foreign exchange settlement. However, when the US SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple in late 2020, regulatory uncertainty forced MoneyGram to suspend the partnership despite XRP proving its effectiveness as a liquidity bridge. Currently, with Ripple largely moved past its regulatory overhang and gaining clearer legal standing, the industry is revisiting questions that were left unresolved: Will banks and payment institutions return to an XRP-based liquidity solution? Nonetheless, if institutions prioritize speed, capital efficiency, and regulatory clarity, history suggests that XRP already demonstrated all of the benefits and can work at scale before it was paused. The only variable missing at the time was regulatory certainty. How Institutional-Grade Yield Comes To XRP Holders Crypto trader Xaif Crypto has also revealed upcoming features for the XRP Ledger. According to Xaif, the XRPL lending protocol, a protocol-native framework that underwrites credit built directly into the Ledger, enabling fixed-term and fixed-rate loans, is on the horizon.

From its July peak of $3.66, XRP has fallen consistently, dipping below $2 and hitting a low of $1.77 before showing attempts at recovery. The persistent downturn has prompted market experts to adjust their earlier forecasts for the cryptocurrency. XRP’s Path to $10 Changelly Exchange researchers now anticipate that XRP could reach the $10 mark by approximately August 2029. This outlook corresponds with prior estimates from Bitwise, which indicated that under a bullish scenario, XRP could reach $10.20 by the same year. In an extremely optimistic scenario, Bitwise projected a potential price of $13 by 2028. The Ripple/XRP/XRPL ""plan"" was supposed to start a year earlier. Thanks to an appeal and late ruling, here we are. Now the plan is still on track, albeit starting later. I must admit I will be first to admit I thought XRP price would be much higher by end of 2025, but hey, I… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 18, 2025 Telegaon analysts offer a slightly more aggressive timeline, suggesting XRP may achieve an average price of $10.29 by 2028. Considering the current price of roughly $1.92, this represents an approximate 421% increase over the next several years. XRP’s Path to $50 Forecasts for XRP reaching $50 are considerably longer-term. Changelly’s research indicates a possible timeline extending to 2034, with the coin potentially attaining $51 by January of that year. This would represent an upside of nearly 2,500% from current levels. Telegaon’s analysts project that XRP may reach the $50 threshold between 2035 and 2040. Their range estimates a minimum value of $40.29 by 2035 and a maximum of $59 by 2040. Bitwise, however, does not project a $50 milestone, instead placing its highest anticipated price at $29.32 by 2030. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Path to $100 Community figure Zach Rector has revised his projection for XRP reaching $100, now suggesting 2030 as the expected year, down from his earlier 2025 prediction. His prior forecast generated attention for its optimism, but the updated timeline reflects more conservative expectations amid the extended market downturn. Changelly’s long-term analysis estimates that XRP could reach $134 by 2040, while Telegaon projects a $106 price point by 2050. From the current price, a $100 XRP represents a more than 50-fold increase, indicating that achieving this level would likely require several decades. Under such a scenario, investors holding 10,000 XRP would see their positions surpass the million-dollar mark. These updated projections reflect broad reassessments in the market following XRP’s underperformance relative to previous expectations. Analysts are balancing historical volatility with macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions, emphasizing that significant growth milestones are unlikely to occur in the short term. The revisions underscore the extended timelines required for substantial price appreciation, highlighting the importance of long-term holding strategies for investors considering high targets like $50 and $100 . Overall, while optimism remains, the market consensus now indicates that these price points will likely be achieved gradually rather than rapidly.

A compelling new analysis from asset manager VanEck suggests that the current Bitcoin hashrate decline could be the precursor to a significant price rebound. This insight turns conventional worry on its head, offering a hopeful perspective for investors watching the market’s every move. What Does the Bitcoin Hashrate Drop Really Mean? The Bitcoin hashrate measures the total computational power securing the network. Recently, this metric has faced downward pressure. Analysts Matt Sigel and Patrick Bush from VanEck argue this isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm. Instead, they see it as a potential sign of miner capitulation—a point where less efficient miners are forced to shut down operations. Historically, such phases have often cleared the way for stronger price rallies. How Does Miner Capitulation Lead to a Price Rebound? The connection between hashrate and price isn’t direct, but it’s powerful. Here’s the virtuous cycle VanEck describes: Hashrate Decline: Falling Bitcoin prices squeeze miner profits, forcing inefficient operations offline. Reduced Selling Pressure: Struggling miners typically sell their earned BTC to cover costs. Their exit reduces this constant sell-side pressure. Network Adjustment: The Bitcoin protocol automatically lowers mining difficulty after a hashrate drop, making it cheaper for remaining miners to operate. Profitability Returns: If the BTC price then rises, miner profitability soars, encouraging reactivation of idle rigs and reinforcing network security. Therefore, a falling Bitcoin hashrate can be a cleansing mechanism, setting the stage for a healthier, more sustainable advance. What Triggered the Recent Hashrate Decline? The report points to a specific, major event. According to data referenced from Cointelegraph, the recent drop followed the shutdown of approximately 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of mining capacity in China. This sudden removal of a massive amount of computing power from the network is a primary driver of the observed hashrate metric decrease. It serves as a clear example of how regional policy and energy dynamics can create ripples across the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Why Should Investors Pay Attention to the Hashrate? Monitoring the Bitcoin hashrate offers more than just a technical snapshot. It provides a window into the economic health of the miners who secure the blockchain. For investors, it can be a valuable, albeit indirect, sentiment indicator. A sustained hashrate recovery often coincides with growing miner confidence, which can be a foundational element for a prolonged price uptrend. However, it’s crucial to remember that hashrate is just one piece of a much larger puzzle that includes macroeconomic factors and broader adoption trends. Conclusion: A Beacon of Hope in the Data The VanEck analysis provides a hopeful narrative grounded in historical patterns. While past performance never guarantees future results, the cyclical relationship between miner activity, network difficulty, and price offers a compelling framework. The current Bitcoin hashrate contraction may not be a symptom of weakness, but rather the necessary prelude to strength, potentially marking a moment of opportunity for astute observers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitcoin hashrate? The Bitcoin hashrate is the total combined computational power used by miners to process transactions and secure the Bitcoin network. It’s a key indicator of network health and security. Why does a dropping hashrate suggest a price rebound? A decline often signals miner capitulation, where unprofitable miners shut down. This reduces the selling pressure from miners needing to cover costs and allows the network to reset its mining difficulty, creating better conditions for a price recovery when demand returns. Is the hashrate a guaranteed predictor of Bitcoin price? No, it is not a guarantee. The hashrate is one of many indicators. While it has shown a historical correlation, Bitcoin’s price is influenced by a wide array of factors including macroeconomic conditions, regulation, and institutional adoption. How often does Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjust? The Bitcoin network automatically adjusts its mining difficulty approximately every two weeks (every 2016 blocks) to ensure a consistent block time of about 10 minutes, regardless of the total hashrate. What was the main cause of the recent hashrate drop mentioned by VanEck? VanEck’s report highlighted the shutdown of around 1.3 GW of mining capacity in China as a significant contributor to the recent decline in the overall Bitcoin hashrate. Where can I check the current Bitcoin hashrate? You can monitor the live Bitcoin hashrate on several major cryptocurrency data websites like Blockchain.com, CoinMetrics, or CoinWarz.

This PUMP whale deposit of 3.8 billion tokens to the institutional platform FalconX represents not just a large transfer but a multi-million dollar realized loss. Let’s dive into the details of what happened and why it matters for the market. What Exactly Happened with This PUMP Whale Deposit? According to data from Onchain Lens, an anonymous wallet transferred a massive 3.8 billion PUMP tokens to FalconX. This PUMP whale deposit was valued at approximately $7.57 million at the time of the transaction. However, the story behind this move reveals a significant financial hit. The same address had initially acquired these tokens from Binance three months prior for a total investment of $19.53 million. Therefore, by depositing them now, the whale has locked in an estimated loss of $12.22 million. Why Would a Whale Take Such a Massive Loss? Seeing a PUMP whale deposit of this magnitude at a loss raises immediate questions. Whales are typically savvy investors, so such actions are closely analyzed. Several reasons could explain this decision: Portfolio Rebalancing: The investor may be cutting losses on PUMP to reallocate capital into more promising assets. Tax-Loss Harvesting: Realizing a loss can be used to offset capital gains taxes in certain jurisdictions, providing a strategic financial benefit. Liquidity Needs: The whale might require immediate cash, forcing the sale of assets regardless of current price. Loss of Confidence: A fundamental shift in outlook on the PUMP project could prompt an exit, even at a steep cost. Moving tokens to FalconX, an institutional-grade platform, suggests this was a calculated move, not a panic sell on a retail exchange. What Does This Mean for the PUMP Token and Retail Investors? A PUMP whale deposit of this scale can influence market sentiment. Large sell-offs, even at a loss, can create downward pressure on the token’s price in the short term as the market absorbs the volume. For retail investors, this event serves as a crucial reminder of the market’s volatility. It highlights key lessons: Whale Watching is Key: Tracking large wallet movements can provide early signals of market shifts. Risk Management is Paramount: Even large, presumably informed investors incur substantial losses. Understand the Context: A single transaction doesn’t define a project’s long-term value, but it is an important data point. Could This PUMP Whale Deposit Signal a Larger Trend? While one transaction is a single data point, it’s worth considering if this PUMP whale deposit is an isolated event or part of a broader pattern. Analysts will now watch for similar movements from other large holders. Furthermore, monitoring the wallet’s future activity may reveal its next strategic play. Does the whale move into stablecoins, or pivot to another altcoin? The answer could offer further clues about smart money sentiment in the current market cycle. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale and a Learning Opportunity The recent PUMP whale deposit resulting in a $12.2 million loss is a powerful narrative in the cryptocurrency world. It underscores the high-stakes reality of crypto investing, where even major players are not immune to significant downturns. For the broader community, it reinforces the importance of diligent research, robust risk management strategies, and a long-term perspective beyond the noise of single transactions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘crypto whale’? A: A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a specific cryptocurrency that their trades can potentially influence the market price. Q2: Why is depositing to FalconX significant? A: FalconX is an institutional trading platform. A deposit there often indicates an intent to sell or use the tokens for institutional purposes like collateral, rather than simply holding them in a private wallet. Q3: How can I track whale movements like this? A: You can use blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens) or dedicated on-chain analytics platforms and social media accounts that report large transactions. Q4: Does a whale selling at a loss mean the project is failing? A: Not necessarily. A single investor’s exit can be due to personal strategy, liquidity needs, or tax planning. It’s one signal to consider alongside project fundamentals, development activity, and overall market conditions. Q5: What is ‘tax-loss harvesting’ mentioned in the article? A: It’s an investment strategy where you sell an asset at a loss to offset capital gains taxes you owe from other profitable investments, potentially lowering your overall tax bill. Q6: Should I sell my PUMP tokens because of this news? A: This article provides analysis, not financial advice. Your decision should be based on your own research, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on a single event.

Selig as the new Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Selig, a crypto-friendly lawyer with deep experience in both the public and private sectors, was sworn in on December 22, 2025. Selig takes the Helm at CFTC amid push for comprehensive crypto rules According to a Monday X post , David Sacks noted the US was at a “critical juncture” for crypto regulation, and that Selig and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins made up a “dream team to define clear regulatory guidelines.” Sacks’ comments followed Selig’s statement that the US Congress was preparing to complete work on a bill regarding the crypto market structure. Selig on X that they were at a unique moment as a wide range of novel technologies, products, and platforms are emerging, retail participation in the commodity markets is at an all-time high, and Congress is poised to send digital asset market structure legislation that will cement the US as the Crypto Capital of the World to the president’s desk. Congress eyes landmark market structure bill to cement US crypto leadership The market structure bill, known as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act in the Senate and building on the CLARITY Act passed by the House in July, remains under consideration but has been temporarily paused during the congressional recess. The legislation aims to create a comprehensive framework for regulating digital assets, clarifying the roles of the SEC and CFTC, and addressing emerging technologies and DeFi platforms. The Senate Banking Committee is expected to hold a markup in early January, paving the way for a potential floor vote as lawmakers seek to finalize rules that could position the US as a global leader in the cryptocurrency market. The Senate confirmed Selig last week in a 53-43 vote as part of a package of nominees. It’s unclear when he will take over for acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham, who is expected to leave the commission and join crypto company MoonPay following Selig’s confirmation. Reporters reached out to the CFTC and MoonPay for details on Pham’s departure, but had not received a response at the time of publication. Even though the final text of the Senate’s market structure bill had yet to be finalized for a floor vote, drafts to date indicated that the legislation would give the CFTC more authority to regulate digital assets, a role previously held by the SEC. Although some Republican leaders have stated that they are moving forward with the bill, other senators have raised concerns over DeFi, which could potentially slow progress.

Matador Technologies, listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange, has approved a strategy to raise 80 million Canadian dollars, approximately $58.2 million, with a clear primary goal: significant Bitcoin purchases . This decision highlights a growing trend of public companies strategically allocating capital to digital assets as a core part of their treasury strategy. What Is the Plan Behind These Major Bitcoin Purchases? Matador Technologies’ board has greenlit a new share issuance to secure the necessary capital. The company intends to use the proceeds for two main purposes. First, a substantial portion will fund additional Bitcoin purchases to aggressively expand its crypto reserves. Second, the remaining funds will cover general corporate operating expenses. This structured approach shows a balance between ambitious growth in digital assets and sustaining day-to-day business operations. Currently, Matador holds 175 BTC. However, its new strategy outlines a dramatically larger ambition. The firm aims to grow its Bitcoin treasury to 1,000 BTC by the end of 2026. This target represents a nearly six-fold increase from its current position, marking a profound commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Therefore, this isn’t a speculative dabble but a calculated, multi-year accumulation plan. Why Are Companies Like Matador Making Big Bitcoin Moves? Matador’s announcement is part of a broader narrative of institutional adoption. Companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin not just as an investment, but as a strategic treasury asset. Here are some key reasons driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many see Bitcoin as a digital counterpart to gold, a potential safeguard against currency devaluation. Portfolio Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk. Future-Oriented Strategy: It positions the company within the growing digital economy and blockchain ecosystem. For a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange, this move also sends a powerful signal to shareholders and the market. It demonstrates forward-thinking leadership and a willingness to embrace innovative financial strategies. Moreover, it can attract investors who are specifically interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through traditional equity markets. What Are the Challenges and Considerations? While the plan is ambitious, executing large-scale Bitcoin purchases comes with its own set of challenges. Market volatility is the most obvious factor; the value of the purchased Bitcoin can fluctuate significantly between acquisition dates. Furthermore, the company must establish secure and compliant custody solutions for storing a growing digital asset treasury. Regulatory clarity in Canada, while progressive, also requires careful navigation to ensure all activities remain above board. Despite these considerations, the approval of this $58.2 million raise indicates that Matador’s leadership has weighed the risks and sees a compelling long-term value proposition. Their phased approach, aiming for a 2026 target, suggests they may employ dollar-cost averaging or strategic timing to mitigate some market volatility during their accumulation phase. Conclusion: A Confident Step Into the Digital Asset Future Matador Technologies’ plan to secure $58.2 million for expanding its Bitcoin holdings is a clear testament to the maturing institutional narrative around cryptocurrency. It moves beyond hype into the realm of concrete corporate finance and treasury management. By setting a public target of 1,000 BTC, Matador is not just making an investment; it is making a statement about its belief in the enduring value of Bitcoin. This strategic move could inspire other small and mid-cap public companies to consider similar allocations, further bridging the worlds of traditional finance and digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How much Bitcoin does Matador Technologies currently own? A1: Matador Technologies currently holds 175 Bitcoin (BTC) in its treasury. Q2: What is Matador’s goal for its Bitcoin holdings? A2: The company aims to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 1,000 BTC by the end of 2026. Q3: How is Matador raising the $58.2 million?

Q4: Will all the raised money be used for buying Bitcoin? A4: No, the proceeds are allocated for two purposes: additional Bitcoin purchases and general corporate operating expenses. Q5: Why would a public company buy Bitcoin? A5: Companies often buy Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve to hedge against inflation, diversify their assets, and gain exposure to the potential long-term growth of the digital asset class. Q6: Is this a common strategy for Canadian firms? A6: While not universal, several Canadian companies have begun adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, following a trend started by larger firms like MicroStrategy in the United States.

56208447,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=882846,1766454698,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56208447.jpeg,China races to dethrone Europe’s weather data with homegrown AI dataset,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-races-to-dethrone-europes-weather-data/,"China is ramping up efforts to wean itself off European weather data as it seeks to become a leader in the global field of meteorology and climate science. Officials are promoting a homegrown data set designed for the era of artificial intelligence, part of Beijing’s comprehensive effort to secure data and achieve technological independence. Europe’s ERA5 dataset is the global standard for climate and weather data, providing measurements of variables such as rainfall, temperature, and wind spread over more than 80 years. It has also become the foundation of AI-powered weather forecasting, with many cutting-edge models, including those developed in China by companies like Huawei, trained on its data. However, depending on a foreign system, projects may conflict with China’s national strategy. For Chinese policymakers, meteorological data is increasingly seen as strategic infrastructure rather than just scientific input. That view has become more urgent as AI models require increasingly larger and more detailed datasets. “Weather forecasting is national security,” said Andreas Prein, a professor at ETH Zurich and an expert in weather and climate modeling. “If you solely depend on external data sources, you make yourself vulnerable.” China advances in-house data in bid to boost AI forecasting ERA5 is created through climate reanalysis, a sophisticated method that combines millions of global observations into a consistent picture of past weather. Created by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the dataset is continually updated and heavily relied upon by governments, insurers, and researchers globally. Public agencies utilize ERA5 to mitigate risks from floods, droughts, and wildfires, as well as for insurers to model catastrophe exposure. The European Union calculates that the data set is delivering savings worth hundreds of millions of dollars every year, underscoring its central role in public policymaking and private markets. Now, China sees that dominance as a strategic weakness. Months earlier, the National Data Administration stated that it is Beijing’s goal for China to shift from overdependence on European and American reanalysis products. At the same time, the China Meteorological Administration also released a new global dataset (CMA-RA V1) over this period in June. 5, which it launched for a global download. The agency had said earlier that some Chinese AI weather models were now being trained on the new data. Officials also described the release as part of a broader effort to disseminate “high-value data” — information that can be used to support innovation — while also enhancing national capabilities. Global researchers test China’s reanalysis as alternatives expand Already, researchers and companies are starting to examine how the Chinese dataset works in practice. Hui Su, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, is using the data in her startup, Stellerus, to train AI models at regional scales and evaluate traditional numerical forecasts. One big plus, Su said, is the higher spatial and temporal resolution of the dataset. The smaller grid, compared to the ERA5, enables the system to produce higher-resolution data, which can be useful for both AI model training and regional investigation. This particular aspect is very useful for local prediction studies. Beyond the scope of forecasting, more readily available Chinese reanalysis data could open up global markets for weather risk hedging. Far more developed in the US and Europe, where rich data supports financial products linked to climate and weather extremes, such markets are still developing elsewhere. David Whitehead, head of weather risk management at Vaisala, a Finnish company, stated that greater access to Chinese weather data would likely attract significant interest from many companies in international markets. He added that the company has already begun analyzing how the Chinese dataset could underpin financial hedging products. China’s meteorological authority says its reanalysis is more accurate for wind speeds at 100 meters above ground level, which are of key importance to the world’s largest wind power market . However, experts caution that in the near term, the dataset is still unlikely to displace ERA5. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

XRP has faced persistent downward pressure over the last three months. Following a brief recovery to $3.10 on October 2, the token experienced a correction intensified by the October 10 market downturn and subsequent selling through December. Currently trading at $1.93, the asset is positioned to close 2025 with an annual loss of approximately 8.07%, marking its first negative yearly performance since 2022. This outcome has disappointed investors anticipating significant gains, especially given developments such as XRP ETFs and the resolution of the SEC lawsuit. Projected XRP Price Ranges for 2026 Market observers, including Zach Rector, attribute this year’s underperformance to the delayed impact of positive developments. Rector and analyst Alex Cobb both suggest that these factors could support a stronger performance for XRP in 2026. AI-assisted analysis from Google Gemini estimates that, under favorable conditions, XRP could trade between $5.80 and $8.60 during 2026. These projections consider sustained inflows from XRP ETFs, which have reportedly exceeded $1 billion. Achieving this range would require an increase of approximately 203% to 350% from current levels. Projected XRP Price Ranges for 2027 For 2027, Gemini anticipates XRP could reach between $10.00 and $12.50, assuming continued momentum from a bullish 2026 environment. From the current price, this represents a potential gain of 426% to 554%. While these figures are not guaranteed, they suggest considerable upside potential over two years compared with current market conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Value of 1,000 XRP Holdings To contextualize these projections, a 1,000 XRP investment currently valued at $1,930 could increase substantially if these price targets are met. Should the asset reach $5.80 to $8.60 in 2026, the investment could grow to $5,800 to $8,600, providing potential gains of $3,890 to $6,690. Holding through 2027, the same 1,000 XRP could be worth between $10,000 and $12,500, yielding profits of $8,090 to $10,590. Data from the XRP rich list shows that 255,877 addresses hold between 500 and 1,000 XRP, while 602,727 addresses hold between 1,000 and 5,000 tokens. This highlights the significance of mid-sized retail holdings in the market and the potential impact of price movements on a broad investor base. Despite these projections, market participants should exercise caution. There is no certainty that XRP will reach these hypothetical price ranges, and investors should not interpret these figures as financial advice.

Tron Stablecoin Volume Is Significantly Higher Than XRP Activity In a new post on X, Glassnode lead research analyst CryptoVizArt.₿ has discussed how stablecoin settlement on the Tron network compares against the transaction activity of XRP. Stablecoins are digital assets that have their value pegged to a fiat currency. The vast majority of this space is currently dominated by two tokens tied to the US dollar: USDT and USDC. These cryptocurrencies are available on several blockchains, with a major one being Tron. Below is the chart shared by CryptoVizArt.₿ that shows the trend in the 90-day simple moving average (SMA) of the combined transfer volume of USDT and USDC on the network over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, USDT and USDC have seen their Tron volume follow a rapid uptrend during the last year, suggesting that users have increasingly been using the network for stablecoin settlements. The 90-day SMA value of the metric is currently sitting at $24.2 billion. In the same chart, the analyst has also attached the data for the transfer volume of the XRP blockchain and from its graph, it’s apparent that the network’s transaction activity pales in comparison to the stablecoin settlement that occurs on Tron. More specifically, XRP observes just $2.2 billion in transfers every day, a tenth of the Tron stablecoin transactions. “This reinforces Tron’s role as a core settlement layer for stablecoin liquidity,” noted CryptoVizArt.₿. Glassnode’s official X handle has also made a post about how stablecoins compare against the major cryptocurrencies in terms of the metric. As is apparent in the above chart, USDC is currently the most dominant asset in transaction activity out of the major assets with a volume of $124 billion. Bitcoin is second at $81 billion, while USDT is third at $68 billion. Among the rest, Solana and Ethereum both beat XRP to the fourth and fifth spots with transaction volumes of $9.6 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively. BNB is just behind XRP at $1.6 billion. The top two stablecoins combined are pulling $192 billion in transaction activity every day, which is almost twice the transfer volume that the top five non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies are witnessing. “Stablecoins have become the primary liquidity rails, while native asset transfers remain comparatively subdued,” said Glassnode. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.93, down nearly 2% over the last week.",XRP|stablecoin|tron|TRON stablecoins|USDC|USDT|XRP volume|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|USDT|XRP|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-23 02:00:22

Bitcoin Realized Cap Has Witnessed A Slowdown Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has talked about how on-chain capital inflows have been weakening for Bitcoin recently. “After about 2.5 years of growth, realized cap has stalled over the past month,” noted Young Ju. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an on-chain capitalization model for Bitcoin that calculates its total value by assuming the value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge: Longs Dominate BTC, While ETH Shorts Rise Since the last transaction of any coin is likely to represent the last instance of it changing hands, the price at that time can be considered as its current cost basis. Therefore, the Realized Cap is just a sum of the cost basis of the entire BTC supply. In other words, it tracks the capital that the investors used to purchase their tokens. Realized Cap had been enjoying growth for the last couple of years, but as the CryptoQuant founder has revealed, capital inflows have dropped off. This suggests a decline in sentiment around Bitcoin. The turnaround in sentiment is also visible through the analytics firm’s PnL Index, which incorporates key on-chain indicators to build a single valuation metric for BTC. The indicators in question are the MVRV Ratio, NUPL, and STH/LTH SOPR. The first two both deal with the amount of unrealized profit or loss held by the investors as a whole, while the latter provides a look into investor profit-taking. Below is the chart shared by Young Ju that shows the trend in the 365-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin PnL Index over the history of the asset. From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin PnL Index saw its 365-day MA reach a high earlier in the year, implying that the coin had potentially become overvalued. Since then, the metric has seen a reversal to the downside. Currently, its value is still notably positive, so the cryptocurrency may be considered to be in a bullish phase, but historically, drawdowns have tended to lead into bear markets. Though there were a couple of instances where this pattern didn’t hold. One being the aftermath of the COVID crash and the other the decline that occurred in the early months of 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Outflows Soar To $978M: Sign Of Dip Buying? So far, the indicator hasn’t shown signs of any turnaround back to the upside, although it should be noted that it’s an average over the past year, so there is some delay attached. Based on the on-chain trend, Young Ju has said, “Sentiment recovery might take a few months.” BTC Price Bitcoin has made recovery from last week’s plunge as its price is now back at $89,800.

That’s precisely what happened when a solo Bitcoin miner successfully mined block 928,985 on December 22nd, earning a staggering reward of 3.128 BTC, worth approximately $281,000. This remarkable event, reported by Cointelegraph, highlights the enduring dream and immense challenge of independent Bitcoin mining. What Does It Mean to Be a Solo Bitcoin Miner? In the world of Bitcoin, most mining power is pooled together in large collectives called mining pools. These pools combine the computational power of thousands of participants to increase the chances of finding a block, sharing the rewards proportionally. A solo Bitcoin miner , however, goes it alone. They use their own hardware to compete directly against these massive pools for the right to add the next block to the blockchain and claim the entire reward for themselves. This approach is akin to an individual prospector searching for a gold nugget in a river dominated by industrial dredging companies. The odds are astronomically low, but the potential payoff is undiluted and monumental. Why Is This Solo Miner’s Success So Significant? The success of this solo Bitcoin miner is a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s foundational principles. It demonstrates that the network remains permissionless and accessible. Furthermore, it reinforces decentralization by proving that individuals, not just large corporations or pools, can still participate meaningfully in network security. Proof of Decentralization: It counters the narrative that mining is entirely centralized. Inspiration for Individuals: It keeps the dream of a solo win alive for hobbyist miners. Network Security: Every solo miner adds to the overall hash rate and security of Bitcoin. What Are the Real Challenges of Solo Mining Bitcoin? While the recent win is inspiring, the path for a solo Bitcoin miner is fraught with difficulty. The primary challenge is the sheer computational competition. The Bitcoin network’s hash rate—the total combined mining power—is phenomenally high, making the probability of a single machine finding a block incredibly slim. Other significant hurdles include: High Hardware Costs: Competitive mining requires expensive, specialized ASIC miners. Enormous Energy Consumption: These machines consume vast amounts of electricity, leading to high operational costs. Technical Expertise: Setting up and maintaining a mining rig requires technical knowledge. Volatile Rewards: Unlike pool mining, there is no steady stream of small payments; income is all or nothing. Therefore, this miner’s victory is a testament to both incredible luck and substantial perseverance. Can You Become a Successful Solo Bitcoin Miner? The story of this fortunate solo Bitcoin miner naturally sparks curiosity. Is it a viable path for newcomers? For most people, joining a reputable mining pool is the practical choice, providing more predictable, though smaller, returns. However, for those with technical skill, access to cheap electricity, and a high-risk tolerance, solo mining remains a captivating, if lottery-like, endeavor. Before starting, you must carefully calculate your potential return on investment (ROI), considering hardware depreciation and energy prices. Tools like mining profitability calculators are essential for this research. Conclusion: A Celebration of Bitcoin’s Core Ideals The story of the solo Bitcoin miner who earned 3.128 BTC is more than just a news headline about a lucky break. It is a vibrant celebration of the decentralized ethos at the heart of Bitcoin. It proves that the network’s security and reward mechanism still have room for the individual, against all odds. This event serves as a powerful symbol of possibility, reminding everyone that in the vast, competitive landscape of Bitcoin mining, fortune can still favor the brave solo participant. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How much did the solo Bitcoin miner earn? The miner earned a block reward of 3.128 BTC, which was worth approximately $281,000 at the time of the discovery. What is the difference between solo mining and pool mining? Solo mining means competing alone to solve a block and claim the full reward. Pool mining involves combining computational power with others to find blocks more frequently, sharing smaller, proportional rewards. Is solo mining profitable? For the vast majority, solo mining is not consistently profitable due to high costs and extremely low odds. It is considered a high-risk, high-reward activity similar to a lottery. What do you need to start solo mining? You need specialized ASIC mining hardware, reliable and cheap electricity, cooling solutions, technical knowledge for setup, and mining software configured for solo work. Why is a solo miner’s success important for Bitcoin? It reinforces network decentralization by proving individuals can still participate in and secure the network, upholding a key principle of Bitcoin’s design. How often do solo miners find blocks? It is a very rare event. Given the current network hash rate, a single modern miner might expect to find a block once every several hundred years on average, making each success newsworthy.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn After a volatile year that included sharp rallies, extended pullbacks, and growing institutional participation, the token is now hovering near levels that have repeatedly defined sentiment. Price action around the $1.8–$2.0 zone has become the focal point, as traders assess the long-term prospects. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP’s Technical Structure Tests Trader Conviction From a technical perspective, XRP remains under pressure despite holding above its key support level. The $1.87 level has been tested multiple times in recent weeks, with each bounce showing reduced momentum. Analysts note that repeated defenses of the same zone often weaken its reliability. A confirmed daily close below $1.6 is widely viewed as a critical downside trigger. Below that area, the chart structure offers limited historical support, opening the door to faster declines toward $1.2 or even the psychological $1.0 level. Similarly, Momentum indicators are mixed rather than decisively bearish. Short-term optimism has been fueled by a TD Sequential buy signal within the current $1.9 area, a pattern that has historically preceded relief rallies. However, XRP continues to trade below major moving averages, keeping the broader trend tilted to the downside unless resistance near $2.5 is reclaimed. Fundamentals and Institutional Signals Offer Contrast While price action remains fragile, developments around Ripple continue to shape longer-term narratives. Institutional exposure through U.S. spot XRP exchange-traded products has grown steadily, with assets under management exceeding $1 billion. Ripple’s regulatory positioning has also evolved. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has publicly dismissed claims of price manipulation, pointing to XRP’s deep liquidity and broad market participation. The company’s move to seek approval for a federally regulated national trust bank further signals a strategy focused on operating within established financial frameworks, rather than operating outside of them. Cross-Chain Speculation and Market Sentiment Speculation has added another layer of intrigue. Comments from Charles Hoskinson have reignited discussions about potential collaboration between XRP-related ecosystems and Cardano, particularly in the areas of decentralized finance and privacy-focused infrastructure. While no formal partnership has been confirmed, the dialogue reflects growing interest in interoperability beyond the XRP Ledger itself, highlighting broader discussions around XRP’s potential role within global financial infrastructure.

56210332,647820,1766458831,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56210332.jpeg,"Institutional Crypto Trading On JPMorgan’s Radar, Report Suggests",https://bitcoinist.com/institutional-crypto-trading-on-jpmorgans-radar/,"In the midst of a transforming crypto landscape in the US following the return of President Donald Trump to the White House, top Wall Street institutions are increasingly seeking to provide investors with opportunities in the digital asset market. In line with this growing trend, Bloomberg reported on Monday that JPMorgan — led by the Bitcoin-sceptical CEO, Jamie Dimon — is now considering introducing cryptocurrency trading for institutional clients. JPMorgan’s Potential Crypto Move Sources familiar with the bank’s plans revealed that JPMorgan’s markets division is evaluating potential products and services to enhance its presence in the cryptocurrency sector. Notably, this exploration could encompass both spot and derivatives trading, although concrete details remain under wraps as discussions are still in preliminary stages. The impetus for these efforts appears to be rising client interest, particularly in light of recent regulatory changes surrounding digital assets in the US. As these regulatory frameworks become more defined, JPMorgan aims to assess the demand for specific products while also evaluating the associated risks and opportunities. Bloomberg’s report underscores that while JPMorgan has maintained an active role in blockchain initiatives, a move into crypto trading would mark a significant shift. Trump’s administration has appointed regulatory officials friendly to the crypto industry in both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Furthermore, the country’s first stablecoin bill has passed under the GENIUS Act. However, the anticipated crypto market structure bill (CLARITY Act) is not expected to be passed this year, despite bipartisan negotiations, as it is scheduled for January markups. JPMorgan’s move also comes as, earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a new guidance permitting national banks to act as intermediaries in crypto transactions. Dimon’s Turnaround For JPMorgan and its CEO, which once saw the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, as a mere “pet rock,” this strategic pivot signifies a broader adaptation to the evolving investment landscape. Dimon’s recent comments suggest a more pragmatic approach. He acknowledged individuals’ rights to invest in Bitcoin, stating, “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin. Go at it,” during an investor conference held in May. JPMorgan has been proactive in exploring digital asset opportunities, including their recent facilitation of the creation, distribution, and settlement of a short-term bond for Galaxy Digital Holdings LP on the Solana (SOL) blockchain. Scott Lucas, who heads the Markets Digital Assets division at JPMorgan, expressed confidence in the growing demand for such innovation, indicating plans to expand the bank’s role in this area. “In the first half of next year, we intend to build on this momentum,” Lucas noted . Bitcoin was trading at $89,508 at the time of writing, up 1.5% over the previous 24 hours and 7 days. While trading in a limited range, BTC still has a 29% difference between current trading prices and all-time highs set earlier this year, around $126,000.

According to on-chain analytics, these Bitmain wallets withdrew a staggering 29,463 ETH, valued at approximately $88.2 million, from major exchanges. This transaction isn’t just a number on a screen; it represents a significant shift in digital asset holdings for one of the industry’s most influential players. Let’s unpack what this means. What Does the Massive Bitmain Ethereum Withdrawal Signal? The reported withdrawal from BitGo and Kraken is more than a simple transfer. Onchain data suggests Bitmain’s associated entities, often labeled BMNR, now hold an estimated 4.06 million ETH. The critical detail? Their average entry price is around $2,991. This massive Ethereum movement raises immediate questions about intent. Is this a strategic consolidation, a precursor to other actions, or simply routine treasury management? For market watchers, large movements from known entities like Bitmain often serve as a bellwether for broader sentiment. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Move? When a titan like Bitmain moves, the market often feels the ripple. Their actions can influence perceptions of asset strength and future price trajectories. Here’s why this withdrawal matters: Supply Shock Potential: Moving such a large amount of ETH off exchanges reduces the immediately sellable supply, which can impact liquidity and price stability. Long-Term Confidence: Holding assets in private wallets versus exchange custodial accounts is typically viewed as a longer-term, less speculative stance. Market Sentiment Indicator: Major players’ accumulation or distribution patterns are closely watched as signals of institutional confidence. Therefore, this isn’t just about Bitmain wallets moving funds; it’s a data point in the larger narrative of institutional Ethereum adoption and strategy. Decoding Bitmain’s Broader Ethereum Strategy Bitmain, primarily known for its Bitcoin mining hardware, has built a substantial Ethereum position. An average cost basis of $2,991 per ETH is a crucial piece of context. With current prices, this suggests their holdings are significantly profitable. This strategic accumulation could be driven by several factors: Diversification: Spreading risk beyond Bitcoin mining revenue. Staking Participation: Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model offers yield opportunities for large holders. Strategic Treasury Reserve: Holding a top-tier, liquid crypto asset as part of corporate reserves. Understanding this context helps explain why a withdrawal of this scale occurs. It’s likely a calculated decision within a larger, long-term financial plan. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights For the everyday crypto enthusiast, what can you learn from this event? First, monitor on-chain activity from major holders. Tools that track whale wallets can provide early signals. Second, consider the difference between exchange holdings and cold storage. Large withdrawals often precede reduced selling pressure. Finally, remember that entities like Bitmain operate on a different scale and timeline than retail investors. Their moves are strategic, not reactive. In summary, the movement of $88.2 million in Ethereum by suspected Bitmain wallets is a powerful reminder of the forces shaping the crypto market. It highlights the ongoing institutionalization of digital assets and the strategic depth major players employ. While not a direct trading signal, it underscores the importance of Ethereum as a core holding in the digital age and the need to watch the custodial habits of industry giants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitmain, and why is it important? Bitmain is a leading manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware. Its actions are significant because it is a major player with substantial resources, and its investment moves can influence market perception. Why would Bitmain withdraw Ethereum from exchanges? Common reasons include securing assets in more controlled private wallets for long-term holding, preparing for staking, or simply managing corporate treasury outside of third-party custodial risk. Does this large withdrawal mean the price of Ethereum will go up? Not necessarily. While reducing exchange supply can be a supportive factor, price is influenced by countless variables. This is one data point among many. How does Onchain Lens know these are Bitmain wallets? On-chain analysts use clustering techniques, tracing historical transactions, and identifying patterns linked to known entity addresses (labeled BMNR). It’s an educated presumption based on public blockchain data. What is an “average entry price”? It’s the estimated average price at which an entity purchased its holdings. Bitmain’s $2,991 average suggests it accumulated much of its ETH at lower price points. Should I follow what Bitmain does with my own investments? You can use it as one of many research tools, but blind copying is not advised. Institutional strategies, risk profiles, and timelines differ greatly from those of individual investors.

This is the ambitious vision driving Kakao, South Korea’s internet giant, as it announces plans to build a comprehensive KRW stablecoin ecosystem . With a strategy centered on a new ‘super wallet’ via Kakao Pay, the company is positioning itself at the forefront of a financial transformation. But what does this mean for everyday users and the broader crypto market? Let’s dive in. What is Kakao’s Plan for a KRW Stablecoin Ecosystem? Kakao isn’t just dipping its toes in the water; it’s preparing for a full-scale dive into digital finance. The company plans to develop a KRW stablecoin ecosystem that integrates deeply with its existing Kakao Pay service, which boasts millions of users. According to Financial News, CEO Shin Won-keun revealed this strategy at a symposium focused on transforming South Korean finance with a won-denominated stablecoin. The core idea is to create a seamless value chain where the Korean Won is digitized, making transactions faster, cheaper, and more accessible. However, Kakao is playing a strategic waiting game. The company has stated it will build initial use cases and infrastructure only after the necessary legal and institutional frameworks are established by South Korean regulators. This cautious approach demonstrates a commitment to compliance and long-term stability, which is crucial for building trust in a new KRW stablecoin ecosystem . Why is a “Super Wallet” the Key to This Strategy? Think of the proposed ‘super wallet’ as the command center for Kakao’s financial universe. It won’t just hold the new KRW stablecoin. Instead, Kakao Pay’s super wallet aims to be an all-in-one platform. This move is strategic for several reasons: User Convenience: It leverages Kakao’s massive, engaged user base who are already familiar with its apps for messaging, ride-hailing, and payments. Network Effect: Integrating a stablecoin into daily life through a trusted app can drive rapid adoption, much faster than launching a standalone crypto wallet. Financial Hub: The wallet could eventually manage various assets, from loyalty points and traditional bank funds to other cryptocurrencies, all anchored by the reliable KRW stablecoin. Therefore, the super wallet is less about a new product and more about creating a familiar gateway into the new KRW stablecoin ecosystem . What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges Ahead? Kakao’s vision promises significant advantages. For users, a well-integrated KRW stablecoin ecosystem means instant, low-cost remittances and a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. For South Korea, it could modernize the financial infrastructure and strengthen the won’s presence in the global digital economy. Nevertheless, the path is not without hurdles. The primary challenge is regulatory clarity. South Korea’s government is still crafting detailed rules for stablecoins and crypto assets. Kakao’s success hinges on these policies being favorable and clearly defined. Furthermore, the company must ensure robust security and convince a sometimes skeptical public of the safety of holding digital currency in a super wallet. How Could This Reshape Finance in South Korea and Beyond? If successful, Kakao’s project could be a game-changer. Domestically, it could set the standard for how major tech firms integrate blockchain technology, pushing competitors to innovate. Internationally, a reputable, large-scale KRW stablecoin ecosystem backed by a company like Kakao could make the Korean Won a more prominent currency in cross-border trade and finance, especially within Asia. This initiative is more than a tech upgrade; it’s a strategic move to future-proof Kakao’s business and influence. By building the rails for digital won transactions, Kakao positions itself not just as a service provider, but as a fundamental pillar of South Korea’s next-generation economy. Conclusion: A Cautious Step Toward a Digital Financial Future Kakao’s announcement to build a KRW stablecoin ecosystem with a super wallet is a landmark moment. It signals a major corporation’s serious commitment to merging traditional finance with blockchain innovation. While the timeline depends on regulators, the direction is clear. Kakao is laying the groundwork to make digital won transactions a simple, everyday reality for millions, potentially reshaping the financial landscape in South Korea and inspiring similar movements worldwide. The journey has just begun, but the destination could redefine convenience and efficiency in our digital lives. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a KRW stablecoin? A: A KRW stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won (KRW). It combines the stability of traditional currency with the digital, programmable benefits of blockchain technology. Q2: When will Kakao’s super wallet and stablecoin launch? A: Kakao has not announced a specific launch date. The company has stated it will develop the ecosystem once the necessary legal and institutional frameworks are established by South Korean authorities. Q3: How is this different from Kakao Pay’s current service? A: Currently, Kakao Pay facilitates transactions using traditional won in bank accounts. The new system would involve a digital version of the won (a stablecoin) on a blockchain, enabling faster settlement, new programmable features, and deeper integration with other crypto assets. Q4: Will this affect the value of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? A: Not directly. A KRW stablecoin is designed to be stable, not speculative. However, by providing a safe, easy on-ramp, it could increase overall cryptocurrency adoption and activity in South Korea, which may indirectly influence the broader market. Q5: Is my money safe in a Kakao super wallet? A: Safety will be Kakao’s top priority. The company will need to implement enterprise-grade security measures, likely including insurance and rigorous compliance, similar to traditional finance. However, as with any digital asset, users should educate themselves on best security practices. Q6: Can people outside South Korea use this? A: The initial focus is domestic, but Kakao mentioned international expansion as part of its strategy. Global accessibility will depend on cross-border regulations and Kakao’s licensing in other jurisdictions. Share This Insight! Did you find this deep dive into Kakao’s financial future enlightening?

Recent data reveals a startling trend: the cryptocurrency trading volume on the nation’s two largest exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb, nosedived by approximately 60% in December. This dramatic slump signals a potential year-end cool-down and raises critical questions about market sentiment. Let’s unpack the numbers and explore what’s behind this significant pullback. What Does the Cryptocurrency Trading Volume Data Show? According to a Bizwatch report, the figures from December 1st to 22nd paint a clear picture of declining activity. The total cryptocurrency trading volume across both platforms fell sharply compared to November. Specifically, Upbit’s volume for the period was $25.91 billion. This represents a staggering 60.6% decrease from November’s $65.86 billion. Similarly, Bithumb saw its volume drop 60.4% to $12.45 billion from $31.49 billion. This synchronized decline points to a broader market phenomenon rather than an issue isolated to a single exchange. Why Did Trading Volume Crash in December? Several factors likely contributed to this steep decline in cryptocurrency trading volume . First, the broader crypto market has been relatively sluggish, lacking the major bullish catalysts seen earlier in the year. Second, the year-end period often sees reduced trading activity as institutions close their books and retail investors take holidays. Furthermore, increased regulatory scrutiny in South Korea may have prompted a more cautious approach from traders. The combination of these elements created a perfect storm for reduced liquidity and participation. Is This a Cause for Alarm for Crypto Investors? While a 60% drop sounds alarming, context is crucial. Market cycles are inherent to cryptocurrency. Periods of high volatility and volume are often followed by consolidation. This decline in cryptocurrency trading volume could indicate a market catching its breath. However, it also highlights the importance of understanding exchange-specific liquidity, especially during quieter periods when large trades can have a more pronounced impact on prices. Key Takeaways from the Market Slowdown This event offers valuable insights for anyone involved in crypto. Here are the main points to consider: Market Cycles are Real: Dramatic swings in cryptocurrency trading volume are a standard feature, not a bug, of the digital asset space. Liquidity Matters: Trading on major exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb is generally safer, but even their liquidity can thin out, affecting trade execution. External Factors Play a Role: Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and seasonal trends all influence trader behavior and volume. Patience is a Strategy: For long-term investors, low-volume periods can be times for research and strategic planning rather than panic. What’s Next for South Korea’s Crypto Market? The sharp contraction in December’s cryptocurrency trading volume serves as a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. However, South Korea remains a crucial hub for digital asset innovation and adoption. The focus may now shift to how the market responds in the new year. Will January bring a resurgence of activity, or is this the beginning of a longer consolidation phase? Monitoring volume trends will be key to gauging the market’s next move. In conclusion, the 60% plunge in trading volume on Upbit and Bithumb is a significant market signal. It reflects a combination of seasonal trends, broader market sentiment, and perhaps investor caution. For the astute observer, this isn’t just a story of decline but a lesson in market dynamics and a checkpoint before the next potential phase of the crypto journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does a drop in trading volume mean cryptocurrency prices will fall? A: Not necessarily. While low volume can sometimes lead to increased price volatility, it doesn’t automatically dictate a downward trend. It often signifies a period of indecision or consolidation before the next major price move. Q2: Is it safe to trade on Upbit and Bithumb during low-volume periods? A: Yes, they remain reputable, regulated exchanges. However, traders should be aware that with lower liquidity, their market orders might get filled at less favorable prices, and price slippage could be higher. Q3: Could this volume drop be specific to South Korea? A> The data is from South Korean exchanges, but similar volume contractions are often observed globally during holiday periods and market lulls, suggesting a correlated trend. Q4: What should I do as an investor during low market volume? A> It can be a good time to conduct research, dollar-cost average into positions cautiously, and set strategic limit orders. Avoid making large, impulsive trades based on thin market activity. Q5: Will trading volume recover in January? A> Historically, cryptocurrency trading volume often picks up after the new year as participants return to the market. However, recovery depends on broader market catalysts and global economic conditions. Q6: Are other major global exchanges seeing similar volume declines? A> While this article focuses on South Korean data, many global exchanges typically experience reduced activity in late December due to holidays, though the magnitude can vary.
