56205342,647706,1766444407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56205342.jpeg,BitMine Doubles Down on Ethereum With $40M Accumulation,https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-doubles-down-ethereum-with-40m-accumulation/,"Ethereum is currently trading above the $3,000 level, offering a surface-level sense of stability after weeks of volatility. However, beneath this price resilience, market sentiment remains decisively bearish. Many analysts are openly calling for lower levels in the coming months, citing weakening momentum, macro uncertainty, and persistent selling pressure across risk assets. Extreme fear dominates positioning, with investors showing little conviction that the recent recovery can evolve into a sustained uptrend. This pessimistic backdrop makes recent institutional-linked activity stand out. Amid widespread caution, data suggests that Bitmine—an entity associated with Fundstrat’s co-founder Tom Lee—has increased its exposure to Ethereum. Bitmine is a digital asset mining and investment vehicle focused on long-term participation in blockchain infrastructure, combining mining operations with strategic accumulation of major crypto assets. Rather than trading short-term price swings, entities like Bitmine typically operate with a multi-year horizon, emphasizing network fundamentals and asymmetric upside. The contrast is notable. While retail and short-term participants remain defensive, longer-term capital appears willing to step in during periods of fear. Historically , such divergence between sentiment and positioning has often emerged near transitional phases in the market cycle. Bitmine Expands Ethereum Exposure Amid Market Fear On-chain data from Arkham confirms that Bitmine has added another 13,412 ETH to its holdings, an acquisition valued at approximately $40.61 million at current market prices. The purchase comes at a time when Ethereum sentiment remains deeply bearish, reinforcing the contrast between short-term market fear and long-term capital positioning. Following this latest accumulation, Bitmine’s total Ethereum holdings now stand at roughly 3.769 million ETH, with an estimated market value of around $11.45 billion. This places Bitmine among the largest known Ethereum holders globally, highlighting the scale and conviction behind its strategy. Such positioning is not consistent with short-term speculation. Instead, it reflects a deliberate approach centered on long-duration exposure to Ethereum’s network value and future role within the digital asset ecosystem. Bitmine’s accumulation behavior suggests confidence in Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals despite near-term volatility and widespread pessimism. Historically, large-scale purchases during periods of extreme fear have often occurred when prices trade below perceived intrinsic value. While this activity does not eliminate the risk of further downside in the coming months, it signals that structurally patient capital continues to deploy. The growing divergence between bearish sentiment and aggressive accumulation underscores a market environment where positioning, rather than headlines, may offer clearer insight into longer-term expectations. Some investors are using current pessimism as an opportunity to build exposure, reinforcing the idea that fear-driven environments can also attract structurally patient buyers. Ethereum Price Struggles to Rebuild Bullish Structure Ethereum is currently trading just above the $3,000 level, attempting to stabilize after a prolonged corrective phase. The chart shows that ETH remains below its key medium-term moving averages, with the 50-day and 100-day MAs still acting as dynamic resistance overhead. Each recent attempt to push higher has been met with selling pressure, highlighting the market’s difficulty in reclaiming bullish momentum. Structurally, the price action since the October peak reflects a clear sequence of lower highs and lower lows, confirming that ETH is still operating within a bearish trend on the daily timeframe. Although the recent bounce from the $2,800–$2,900 zone suggests the presence of demand, volume remains muted compared to earlier expansion phases, indicating a lack of conviction from buyers. This supports the view that the current move is corrective rather than the start of a new impulsive rally. From a support perspective, the $2,900 area is now critical. A sustained loss of this level would expose ETH to a deeper retracement toward the $2,600–$2,700 region, where prior consolidation occurred. On the upside, bulls would need a decisive daily close above the descending moving averages near $3,300 to invalidate the bearish structure. Overall, the chart points to consolidation under resistance rather than trend reversal. Until ETH reclaims key moving averages with expanding volume, price action suggests ongoing distribution and elevated risk of further downside.

A crypto analyst has identified a critical support level at $0.128, which could change Dogecoin’s bullish outlook if it continues to hold above it. According to the analysis, holding above this key level could create the ideal conditions for investors seeking long positions. Analyst Identifies $0.128 As Critical Support For Dogecoin The Dogecoin price is above a make-or-break zone that could define its next significant price move and signal how investors position themselves in the long term. Market expert Crypto Tony has shared an updated outlook on Dogecoin, focusing on the importance of reclaiming the key support zone around $0.128 before considering long positions. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Crashes To April Levels, Here’s What Happened Last Time Notably, Crypto Tony has stated that a long setup could become more favorable and appealing if DOGE’s price can hold steadily above the $0.128 level. The support zone also emerges as Dogecoin’s price action shows early signs of stabilization after a sustained downside pressure. For the past few months, the meme coin has been in a decline, mirroring the broader market downturn and sustained risk-off sentiment. The analyst’s chart shows Dogecoin recently selling off sharply before finding temporary stability slightly above $0.128 a few days ago. The meme coin’s price is also trading below the highlighted horizontal line on the chart, which aligns closely with the support area. Visual projections on the chart further suggest a period of sideways movement between $0.128 and $0.130, followed by a potential breakout to the upside. Crypto Tony pinpoints a bullish target near $0.135, representing a more than 2.2% surge from Dogecoin’s price of $.0132, as of writing. Dogecoin Weekly Chart Signals Extended Correction Before Price Explosion Pseudonymous crypto analyst Cantonese Cat has also delivered a weekly analysis of Dogecoin, highlighting a prolonged corrective phase in its market structure. According to him, DOGE has already endured roughly 13 months of bearish price action, which aligns with a potential Wave 2 correction. The analyst stated that this downturn stage would precede an explosive Wave 3, which could see the meme coin’s price jump to new highs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Squeeze Maps Out Two Possible Scenarios From Here Cantonese Cat revealed in his analysis that his Dogecoin bullish setup may feel unlikely to many traders at the moment. This is especially true given that Dogecoin has been trending downwards for most of the year, failing to break out of its bearish position. Despite this, the analyst notes that the skepticism is precisely why the scenario remains plausible. The analyst’s chart shows that Dogecoin’s first wave has already completed, followed by a declining Wave 2. Price action is also interacting with multiple Fibonacci retracement levels while respecting a long-term downward trendline.

While traditional safe havens and AI-related equities capture investor capital, Bitcoin briefly touched $90,000 before retreating to the $88,000 range , failing to keep pace with the market’s clear winners. Market Divergence: Precious Metals and AI Ascend The divergence reflects a capital rotation where the ‘digital gold’ narrative is being tested. Silver also posted a record high, nearing $70 an ounce. Analysts at ByteTree noted that silver’s recent performance is beginning to rival Bitcoin’s returns over the long term, a major shift for precious metals advocates. “Bitcoiners can’t ignore the bull market in precious metals, which continues to roar,” a recent ByteTree analysis stated. “I suspect that when the rally runs out of steam, Bitcoin will step in.” Capital is also flowing aggressively into AI infrastructure. Alphabet’s announced $4.75 billion acquisition of energy infrastructure firm Intersect shows the intense demand for data center capacity. This trend is directly benefiting publicly traded crypto miners that have pivoted to high-performance computing (HPC). Hut 8 (HUT) stock, for example, gained over 17% following an upgraded price target and a major data center lease agreement. Alphabet Buys Clean Energy Startup For AI Data Centers In $4.75 Billion Deal https://t.co/CgAxr46YMf pic.twitter.com/W08jouCoxc — Forbes (@Forbes) December 22, 2025 Adding to the headwinds, record options expiries are approaching. Approximately $27.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ether options are set to expire this week on the Deribit exchange, creating caution among traders. Bitcoin’s Headwinds and Institutional Reallocation The current market action indicates a clear preference for tangible assets and dominant growth narratives over crypto. Institutional capital is not rotating out of risk entirely; it is reallocating to the perceived safety of the ‘debasement trade’ in precious metals and the high-conviction growth of AI. Bitcoin is caught in the middle, lacking a strong, immediate catalyst. The shift by miners like Hut 8 into AI infrastructure is a key sign. It suggests that management sees a more reliable and perhaps more lucrative application for their high-performance computing assets outside of the crypto market. This challenges the investment thesis for pure-play mining operations and may force a broader re-evaluation of the sector.

The Council of the European Union has officially approved the European Central Bank’s design proposal for a digital euro . This isn’t just another cryptocurrency story—it’s a carefully planned move to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that works both online and, uniquely, offline. For anyone following the future of money, this approval marks a pivotal moment with profound implications for privacy, security, and everyday spending across the bloc. What Exactly Did the EU Council Approve? The green light from the EU Council gives the European Central Bank (ECB) the mandate to proceed with a two-tiered digital euro system. The approved design features two distinct versions: one for online use and one for offline transactions. This dual approach aims to combine the convenience of digital payments with the fundamental need for financial inclusion and privacy. The offline version, in particular, is a standout feature designed to let users exchange value directly between devices, like smartphones or cards, without an internet connection. This approval is the culmination of years of research and places the Eurozone at the forefront of the global CBDC race. How Will the Offline Digital Euro Protect Your Privacy? Privacy stands as the cornerstone of the offline digital euro proposal. Here’s how it intends to work: Peer-to-Peer Transactions: When you use the offline version, the transaction data is exchanged directly between the payer and payee’s devices. No Third-Party Intermediaries: Unlike online bank transfers or card payments, these offline transactions would not be instantly visible to banks, payment processors, or the ECB during the exchange. Enhanced Confidentiality: This design mimics the privacy of cash, giving users more control over their payment information. However, it’s crucial to understand that complete anonymity is not the goal. Authorities would likely have access to transaction data for legal purposes, such as combating money laundering, but the offline feature significantly reduces routine surveillance. What Are the Security Risks of an Offline Digital Currency? While the privacy benefits are clear, security experts have raised valid concerns. Introducing an offline payment system for a sovereign currency creates new attack vectors that must be addressed. The primary worry centers on a threat known as a “relay attack.” In this scenario, a malicious actor could potentially intercept or duplicate the communication between two devices during a transaction, leading to theft or double-spending. The ECB and EU lawmakers now face the critical challenge of engineering robust safeguards, such as advanced encryption and secure hardware elements, to make the offline digital euro as secure as the physical cash it aims to complement. When Can We Expect to Use the Digital Euro? The Council’s approval is a major regulatory milestone, but it’s not the finish line. The journey toward a live digital euro involves several more phases. Next, the ECB will enter a “preparation phase,” which involves developing the necessary infrastructure, conducting extensive testing, and finalizing the legal framework. A formal decision on whether to actually issue the currency will come later, likely after a pilot program. Therefore, while the design is approved, Europeans should not expect to see a digital euro in their digital wallets for at least a few more years. Why Does This Matter for the Future of Finance? This move is about more than just modernizing payments. The digital euro represents a strategic effort by European institutions to maintain monetary sovereignty in an increasingly digital world. It aims to: Provide a secure, public alternative to private payment systems and stablecoins. Ensure the euro remains relevant and competitive globally. Promote financial inclusion by offering a payment method accessible to all citizens. The offline capability is a masterstroke for inclusivity, ensuring people in areas with poor connectivity or those who prefer not to use online banking can still participate in the digital economy. Conclusion: A Cautious Step Into a Digital Monetary Future The EU Council’s approval of the digital euro design is a landmark decision that balances innovation with caution. By championing an offline version, Europe is prioritizing user privacy and accessibility in a way few other CBDC projects have. However, the path forward is laden with technical and security hurdles that must be overcome to earn public trust. This isn’t just a new payment app; it’s a foundational shift in how one of the world’s largest economies conceptualizes money. The success of the digital euro will depend on its ability to be as private as cash, as secure as a vault, and as easy to use as a tap. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is the digital euro a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin? No, it is fundamentally different. The digital euro is a central bank digital currency (CBDC), meaning it is a digital form of existing euro banknotes issued and backed by the European Central Bank. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, its value is stable and it is centrally regulated. Will the digital euro replace physical cash? The ECB has repeatedly stated that the digital euro is intended to complement, not replace, physical cash. Both forms of currency will coexist, giving people more choice in how they pay. How private will my transactions really be? The offline version offers a higher degree of privacy for individual transactions, as data isn’t immediately shared with intermediaries. However, for anti-money laundering purposes, authorities will have mechanisms to access data under specific legal conditions. It offers more privacy than a credit card but likely less than anonymous cash. What stops someone from hacking the offline digital euro? This is the core security challenge. The ECB plans to use state-of-the-art encryption and secure hardware (like specialized chips in phones or cards) to protect against attacks. The system’s design and ongoing security audits will be critical to preventing theft and fraud. Can I use the digital euro outside the Eurozone? Initial designs focus on use within the Eurozone. For cross-border payments, the system would need to interoperate with other countries’ payment infrastructures, which is a complex challenge for future development. Will there be limits on how much digital euro I can hold? Most likely, yes. To prevent large-scale shifts of deposits from commercial banks to the central bank (which could destabilize the financial system), policymakers are considering holding limits for individuals, such as a few thousand euros.

Midnight Price Prediction: 4-Hour Chart Shows Strong Bullish Continuation NIGHT/USDT on the 4-hour chart displays a clear bullish continuation setup following prolonged consolidation. Price successfully breached former resistance around $0.07 and has now converted this level into support, confirming a structural shift favoring buyers. The market trades above rising 20, 50, and 100 EMAs, which are beginning to fan out, a classic indication that trend momentum is strengthening rather than stalling. RSI has advanced into overbought territory near the low-70s, reflecting strong buying pressure. Source: TradingView While this can precede short-term pullbacks, it more often signals trend strength in early expansion phases. The brief consolidation just below $0.11 suggests price is digesting gains rather than distributing, especially as pullbacks are being defended above the $0.09–$0.10 zone. If the $0.09 support maintains, the technical structure favors continuation toward the $0.14–$0.16 region initially, with extended upside projection toward the $0.19–$0.22 area if momentum persists.

56204457,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=250809,1766446211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Spot Gold Price Soars: Record High Above $4,450 Signals Market Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/spot-gold-price-record-high/,"BitcoinWorld Spot Gold Price Soars: Record High Above $4,450 Signals Market Shift In a stunning market move, the spot gold price has shattered records, blasting past the $4,450 per ounce barrier. This isn’t just another incremental gain; it’s a powerful statement that has investors and analysts worldwide taking immediate notice. What forces are propelling this historic rally, and more importantly, what does this mean for your portfolio? Let’s break down the surge behind the shine. What’s Driving the Record Spot Gold Price? The recent leap in the spot gold price to over $4,450 is not a random event. It’s the result of several converging economic pressures. Primarily, gold thrives in environments of uncertainty. Therefore, when central banks signal potential interest rate cuts or geopolitical tensions flare, investors instinctively seek safety. Gold’s traditional role as a reliable store of value comes sharply into focus during these times. Moreover, significant buying from global central banks has provided a solid foundation for this rally. Countries are diversifying their reserves away from traditional currencies, adding substantial physical gold to their holdings. This institutional demand creates a powerful tailwind that supports higher price levels. How Does This High Price Impact Investors? For the average investor, a record spot gold price presents both opportunities and considerations. On one hand, existing holders see the value of their assets climb. On the other, new buyers face a higher entry point. The key question becomes: is this a peak or a plateau on a longer journey upward? Understanding the difference between physical gold, ETFs, and mining stocks is crucial now. Each offers exposure to the spot gold price but with varying levels of risk and direct correlation. Physical Gold (Bullion/Coins): Direct ownership, but requires secure storage. Gold ETFs (like GLD): Easy to trade, tracks the price closely without handling physical metal. Gold Mining Stocks: Offers leverage to the gold price but adds company-specific operational risks. Is This Sustainable? Challenges and the Road Ahead While the momentum is undeniable, sustaining a spot gold price at these historic levels faces challenges. A sudden shift toward stronger economic data or a more hawkish stance from major central banks could strengthen the US dollar, typically applying downward pressure on gold. Furthermore, if risk appetite returns strongly to stock markets, some capital may rotate out of safe havens like gold. However, the long-term case remains compelling. The fundamental drivers of monetary debasement, geopolitical strife, and strategic asset diversification by nations are not disappearing overnight. This suggests that while volatility is guaranteed, the underlying support for gold is structurally stronger than in previous cycles. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Gold Rally So, what should you do in the face of this record-breaking spot gold price ? First, avoid emotional decisions. Do not chase the price out of fear of missing out. Instead, consider a disciplined approach. Review Your Allocation: Ensure your gold exposure aligns with your long-term investment strategy and risk tolerance. Dollar-Cost Average: If adding exposure, consider smaller, regular purchases to smooth out entry points. Look Beyond the Headline Price: Analyze the macroeconomic trends (inflation, real yields, currency strength) that will dictate the next major move. In conclusion, the surge past $4,450 is a landmark moment that underscores gold’s enduring relevance. It acts as a barometer for global anxiety and a hedge against systemic risk. While the path forward will include dips and corrections, the breach of this ceiling confirms a powerful bullish narrative. For astute investors, the record spot gold price is less a signal to buy or sell and more a command to pay close attention to the shifting economic landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the ‘spot price’ of gold? The spot price is the current market price for immediate delivery and payment of gold. It’s the benchmark price for one ounce of gold traded on global commodities exchanges. Why does gold go up when there’s economic uncertainty? Gold is considered a ‘safe-haven’ asset. When confidence in currencies or other investments wanes due to inflation, geopolitical risk, or recession fears, investors buy gold to preserve wealth, driving up its price. Is it too late to invest in gold at this high price? Timing the market is difficult. Many analysts view gold as a long-term strategic holding for portfolio diversification, not a short-term trade. The decision should be based on your financial goals and the role gold plays in your asset allocation. How can I invest in gold without buying physical bars? You can invest through a Gold ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) that holds physical gold, purchase shares in gold mining companies, or buy gold-based mutual funds. These offer liquidity and ease compared to physical storage. Does a strong gold price mean high inflation is coming? Not necessarily. While gold is a classic hedge against inflation, its price can rise due to many factors, including low real interest rates, a weak US dollar, or strong investment demand, even if inflation is moderate. What usually happens to gold prices if interest rates rise? Typically, higher interest rates make yield-bearing assets like bonds more attractive compared to non-yielding gold. This can put downward pressure on gold prices, but the relationship is complex and depends on the reason for the rate hikes. Found this analysis of the record spot gold price insightful?

On Saturday, the U.S. seized the Panama-flagged Centuries while it was hauling sanctioned crude from Venezuela, a decision that Beijing immediately condemned. This action leans on a 2002 deal (Salas-Becker agreement) that lets U.S. authorities board Panama-flagged vessels with only two hours’ notice. Dimitris Ampatzidis, a senior compliance analyst at Kpler, said, “The most interesting part of the Centuries seizure is the suggestion of the U.S. likely relying on its prior boarding agreement with the Panama Maritime Authority.” U.S. targeting tankers that serve Chinese refineries Right now, 23 tankers are floating inside Venezuela’s exclusive economic zone. Of those, Ragnar, Balsa, and Larko carry the Panama flag and are loaded with oil. Ampatzidis said, “If the Ragnar, Balsa, and Larko attempt to depart, it places them in the higher-risk enforcement category because they are operating under the Panama flag. We can see seizures as we saw with the Centuries.” Ragnar got filled on December 16, and the others followed one day later. The U.S. isn’t just going after already-sanctioned ships. Even stateless vessels or others tied to the shadow fleet are in the crosshairs. Ampatzidis said the U.S. is “increasingly willing” to grab any ship that tries to leave Venezuela with crude. Why go this far? Aaron Roth, a former Coast Guard captain who now advises at the Chertoff Group, said, “By squeezing Venezuelan oil, you are not only putting tremendous pressure on the Maduro regime, but you are also impacting China strategically.” Roth added that without discounted Venezuelan crude, China will have to turn to Russia or the Middle East, where oil is more expensive. He said, “The longer it goes on and it may create negotiating space in U.S.-China diplomacy.” China currently takes 76% of Venezuela’s oil, while the U.S. has reduced its share to 17%, down from about 34% last year. Venezuela has pumped 900,000 barrels so far in 2025, roughly 1% of global supply. The rest of that oil goes to Cuba, Spain, and Italy. But the tankers with the most direct connection to China are the ones being stopped. Seized tankers show pattern of travel to Chinese ports Kpler tracking data shows Centuries has done this before. In April 2020, it loaded two million barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude that ended up at Yantai in Shandong Province. This time, before being seized, the tanker was using spoofed AIS signals to hide its location. It pretended to be sailing near Curaçao on December 12, but satellite images showed it was parked near Lechería, Venezuela. The loading happened at the Jose Oil Terminal on December 9. By December 18, it was seen three miles off Grenada, heading west, likely to China… again. Kpler images also showed that Centuries used a different name “Crag” while loading. Around that same time, another ship was filled with two million barrels of Merey crude at the same berth. After that, Centuries just stayed east of the port until it finally started moving. Another tanker, Bella 1, was also taken. It wasn’t even loaded, it was heading back to Venezuela. But earlier in the year, it moved Iranian oil to Qingdao in March, and in 2023 it carried Venezuelan crude to Tianjin and Qingdao. These are not new routes. They’re pipelines to Chinese ports. And both ships were part of Trump’s weekend sweep. While Trump grabs ships, he’s also clashing with China and Panama over control of the Panama Canal.Trump has said he wants the U.S. to take it back, claiming China now controls the waterway. The ports on both ends, Balboa and Cristóbal, are run by CK Hutchison, based in Hong Kong. Trump’s people say China has too much control there and that it violates the U.S.-Panama treaty. A $22.8 billion deal to sell the ports to a consortium led by BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping stalled because Beijing opposed it. China wants Cosco, a state-owned ocean carrier, to get a controlling stake. Brandon Daniels, CEO at Exiger, said if Cosco joins the deal, China gains a chokepoint in global shipping. He also confirmed the U.S. and Panama have deals like Salas-Becker to fast-track vessel boardings. “It would most likely point to cooperation,” Daniels said. He also said Panama President José Raúl Mulino “takes their sovereignty very seriously.” Daniels said the CCP already has influence over Hong Kong companies like CK Hutchison, but Cosco’s control would deepen that grip. “China may gain a chokepoint in global trade container transshipment capacity, berthing priority, yard operations, and commercial data exhaust,” he said. Still, he believes Panama will cooperate with Washington to protect its own financial backing. “Panama is very focused on being a South Asian corridor and a major flag state for vessels, but it seeks cooperation with the U.S as a strategic imperative to sustainable funding,” Daniels said.

The designs trace back to decisions made in 2016, when Elon pushed Tesla to remove traditional handles and rely on powered controls across its lineup. Those choices happened while Tesla rushed to finish the Model 3, the sedan meant to pull the company out of a niche market and into mass production, according to Bloomberg. Design and engineering teams met repeatedly in Palo Alto and Hawthorne as pressure mounted to lock down final features. Doors became a serious debate, especially as Tesla was already dealing with complaints tied to faulty sensors on the Model X SUV. Elon’s personally electric door decisions for Tesla are colliding with real-world crashes Engineers warned about safety risks tied to electric doors and argued mechanical handles would still be needed, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk allegedly rejected that view. Tesla moved forward without explicit regulatory barriers, giving the company wide freedom to redefine door hardware. At the time, Elon frequently stepped into both large and small decisions, often staying overnight at factories, and that hands-on style decided how far the door design went. Years later, and Tesla doors still depend on low-voltage batteries that can stop working during collisions. When power drops, doors may not open unless occupants find hidden manual releases. In many cases, failures blocked emergency crews and delayed rescues. Bloomberg allegedly reviewed of police, fire, and autopsy records and identified 15 deaths across 12 U.S. crashes in the past decade where door access played a role after Teslas caught fire. These incidents also led to hundreds of complaints filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is now investigating the issue. China is weighing limits on flush handles, while European regulators say electric doors are now a rulemaking priority. Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm has vowed more than once that the company takes safety incidents seriously, while design chief Franz von Holzhausen promised in 2023 that he is working on door handles that combine electric and manual releases to help people exit during panic situations. Cost savings and minimalism were what drove Tesla’s original design Internal discussions for electric doors focused on cutting parts and lowering costs so the Model 3 could sell for roughly half the price of earlier Teslas. Designers also liked placing door buttons where a driver’s hand naturally rests. After locking in electric doors, Tesla added manual releases as backups. Early Model 3 cars only had them in front seats because U.S. rules did not require rear releases. Later versions added second-row releases. Tesla planned for delivery staff to explain these features, though how often that happened remains unclear. Senior vice president Lars Moravy said , “We always say at Tesla, if you aren’t deleting so much that you have to put something back, you haven’t deleted enough. Well, maybe we deleted too much.” Tesla now says door issues affect the entire EV industry, and is testing auto-unlock features when battery power drops and says doors will unlock automatically during serious crashes, though availability depends on model and build date. Tesla is working with Chinese regulators and expects time to adapt if laws change. Questions over door systems popped back up before the Model Y launch in 2020, which kept electric controls, but Elon has said very little about the matter since a 2013 earnings call, when he said door sensors sometimes failed and admitted that:- “Obviously, it’s quite vexing for a customer.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

His assessment does not center on short-term price movements or technical indicators. Instead, Scott focuses on structural and behavioral factors that he believes are placing disproportionate strain on retail investors. Scott’s position is grounded in the idea that market dynamics have shifted in ways that favor large, well-capitalized players while leaving individual investors increasingly exposed. He suggests that these pressures have intensified over recent months, contributing to widespread uncertainty and frustration among XRP holders. This is the worst time period for XRP holders Why? All these investment firms are trying to squeeze retail for every penny to cover their own 4th qtr shortfall after this horrible year That is why you are seeing all the propaganda flying around. Remember to these people?… — VincentScott (@VincentSco72192) December 21, 2025 Institutional Dynamics and Market Pressure According to Scott, much of the current stress can be traced to actions taken by major investment entities following a disappointing fourth quarter. He argues that some institutions are attempting to offset previous underperformance by drawing liquidity from the broader market, including retail participants. In his view, this approach limits genuine price discovery and amplifies downward pressure during already fragile conditions. Scott believes this environment has also led to a noticeable increase in aggressive narratives surrounding XRP and other digital assets. He contends that these narratives are often designed to influence sentiment rather than reflect underlying market realities, further complicating decision-making for individual investors. Speculation, Forecasts, and Accountability Scott is particularly critical of the volume of optimistic price predictions circulating online. He maintains that many of these forecasts rely heavily on selective chart analysis while ignoring the broader regulatory and structural constraints affecting the crypto sector. In his assessment, advanced blockchain systems are still operating within a market framework that lacks consistent legal oversight. This absence of uniform enforcement, he argues, allows influential market participants to promote ambitious projections without facing consequences when those expectations are not met. Scott sees this as a key reason misleading narratives continue to gain traction, despite repeated inaccuracies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recurrent Patterns in Market Commentary Another concern raised by Scott involves the aftermath of failed price predictions. He observes that bold targets are often followed by revised explanations or reassurance-focused content rather than transparent evaluations of what went wrong. According to him, this pattern persists because many retail investors continue to place trust in prominent market voices, even when past forecasts have proven unreliable. Scott emphasizes that the deeper issue is not price volatility itself, but the way investor anxiety is leveraged for engagement and monetization. He argues that this dynamic discourages candid discussions about risk and uncertainty, as such conversations may undermine profitable content strategies. Regulatory Uncertainty and Long-Term Implications From Scott’s perspective, lasting improvement in market conditions will depend on the introduction of clear and consistently enforced regulations. He believes that XRP, along with the broader crypto market, will remain vulnerable until legal standards are applied evenly across all participants. He points to ongoing legislative efforts in the United States, including work toward the proposed Clarity Act expected in 2026, as a potential step toward reducing uncertainty. Until such measures are implemented, Scott expects retail investors to remain exposed during periods of instability. Reactions to Scott’s views have varied within the XRP community. Some investors agreed, noting that they have reduced their exposure to crypto-related discussions to avoid emotional decision-making. Others emphasized personal responsibility, highlighting diversification and disciplined risk management as essential principles. Overall, Scott’s commentary has reignited debate about transparency, influence, and fairness in the current crypto market landscape.

Despite several short-lived relief rallies, momentum has failed to follow through, reinforcing growing concerns that the broader market structure is weakening. As volatility persists and upside attempts stall, an increasing number of analysts are beginning to openly discuss the possibility that Bitcoin may be transitioning into a bear market phase. Sentiment across derivatives and spot markets has turned noticeably more cautious, with risk appetite continuing to fade. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Lags Network Utility: A Valuation Reset Is Underway In this context, a recent report by Darkfost draws attention to a familiar but controversial narrative: capital rotation from gold into Bitcoin. With gold setting a new all-time high above $4,420 per ounce, the idea that investors may soon shift capital toward Bitcoin is resurfacing across the market. Historically, this narrative has gained traction during periods when traditional safe-haven assets outperform, fueling speculation that Bitcoin could follow as an alternative store of value. However, Darkfost cautions that this assumption is far from well-grounded. While the rotation thesis has been widely repeated throughout this cycle, empirical evidence linking gold outperformance directly to sustained Bitcoin inflows remains weak. Rather than signaling an imminent bullish turn, the current setup suggests that Bitcoin remains vulnerable, caught between macro-driven narratives and deteriorating internal market structure. Testing the Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Thesis Darkfost emphasizes that the popular narrative of capital rotating from gold into Bitcoin lacks direct, verifiable evidence. To address this, he constructed a comparative framework to identify periods where such rotations may have occurred. He did this without assuming a causal relationship. The core issue, as he notes, is that on-chain and market data cannot conclusively prove that capital exiting gold is the same capital entering Bitcoin. To approximate potential rotation phases, Darkfost applied a simple but disciplined signal structure. A positive signal appears when Bitcoin is trading above its 180-day moving average while gold is trading below its own 180-day moving average. In theory, this configuration suggests relative strength shifting toward Bitcoin. Conversely, a negative signal is triggered when both Bitcoin and gold trade below their respective 180-day moving averages. Indicating a broad risk-off environment rather than a rotation. This methodology allows historical comparison across cycles, highlighting moments where relative performance diverged. However, the results challenge the simplicity of the narrative. As shown on the chart, these signals do not produce consistent or reliable outcomes. In several instances, supposed rotation periods failed to generate sustained upside for Bitcoin. At other times, Bitcoin rallied independently of gold’s trend. The takeaway is clear: capital rotation between gold and Bitcoin is not an absolute or mechanical process. Market behavior appears far more nuanced. Driven by broader macro conditions, liquidity dynamics, and investor positioning rather than a straightforward asset-to-asset rotation. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Chase Upside With Historic Leverage – Breakout Fuel Or Fragile Setup? Price Struggles Below Key Moving Averages Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize after a sharp corrective phase, but the chart highlights that price action remains structurally fragile. BTC is currently trading just below the $90,000 level, an area that has flipped from support into near-term resistance following the recent breakdown. While the latest bounce shows short-term buying interest, it has not yet altered the broader bearish structure that formed after the October highs. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin is now trading below the 50-3D moving average (blue), which has started to slope downward, signaling weakening momentum. The failure to reclaim this level suggests that recent upside moves are corrective rather than impulsive. Related Reading: Legendary Bitcoin OG Deepens Ethereum Bet Despite Losses Exceeding $70 Million Below the current price, the 100-3D moving average (green) sits near the $85,000–$86,000 zone and has acted as interim support during the rebound. A sustained loss of this area would likely expose BTC to a deeper retracement toward the 200-3D moving average (red), currently rising near the low $80,000 region. The sell-off was accompanied by elevated volume. While the rebound has occurred on comparatively lighter participation, pointing to a lack of conviction from buyers. Structurally, Bitcoin is consolidating in a lower range. With lower highs and compressed volatility suggesting a pause rather than a trend reversal. For bulls, reclaiming and holding above $90,000 and the declining 50-3D moving average is critical to invalidate the bearish bias. Until then, price action favors range-bound trading with downside risk still present.

Some investors say the threat is close enough to affect price. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole, warned that Bitcoin could fall below $50,000 by 2028 if the network is not made quantum-ready. Developers Urge Caution Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin Core developer and co-founder of custody firm Casa, has argued that migration to post-quantum cryptography will not be quick. Lopp told followers on X that while quantum machines are not an immediate danger, moving the protocol and users’ funds to new signature schemes could “easily take five to 10 years.” He agreed with Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, who has also said the threat is not near-term but should be watched. No, quantum computers won’t break Bitcoin in the near future. We’ll keep observing their evolution. Yet, making thoughtful changes to the protocol (and an unprecedented migration of funds) could easily take 5 to 10 years. We should hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 21, 2025 Community Split Over Timing Reports have disclosed a widening gap in how the community views the timeline. Some venture capitalists and investment firms say quantum risk is imminent and should be priced now. On the other side, long-time Bitcoin advocates question the urgency. Pierre Rochard argued that quantum-resistant fixes can be paid for by non-profits or VC funding, and he suggested an attack would be so costly it would require government-level support. Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, pushed back with a plainspoken line about current machines, saying they “can’t factor the number 21 — not 21 million — 21,” to make a point about how far current quantum hardware still is from breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography. Andreas M. Antonopoulos has also weighed in, noting that upgrades are possible ahead of any real threat. What Upgrading Bitcoin Means Changing Bitcoin’s cryptography is not the same as updating ordinary software. According to developers, the distributed nature of the network, the variety of wallet software in use, and the many holders who do not actively manage keys make a broad migration difficult. BIP 360, a proposal that would add a quantum-ready signature method for BTC, has been pushed by some figures. Charles Edwards has called for node operators to enforce BIP 360 to speed adoption, while others say enforcement and coordination would be tricky and could take years. Calls For Protocol Change Market watchers should note the difference between theory and proof. The technical camp says there is time to plan and roll out changes carefully. The investment camp warns that market confidence could wobble if measures are not taken quickly. Calls for action include funding research, testing signature replacements, and building migration tools that exchanges and wallets can use.

This vision just moved closer to reality. BC Card, a major South Korean payment processor, has successfully completed a groundbreaking pilot project. The initiative allows foreigners to use stablecoin payments at domestic merchants, potentially revolutionizing travel finance. How Do These Stablecoin Payments Actually Work? The system cleverly bridges the new world of crypto with existing infrastructure. Instead of asking merchants to accept crypto directly, BC Card uses a digital prepaid card as a middle layer. A foreign visitor converts their stablecoins into value on this digital card. Then, they can use it anywhere that accepts standard card payments. Therefore, the experience feels identical to using a regular credit or debit card for both the customer and the shop. What Are the Key Benefits of This New System? This pilot isn’t just a tech demo; it solves real problems. For foreign visitors, it offers a familiar and potentially cheaper way to pay without constant currency exchange. For South Korean merchants, it opens the door to a new customer segment without requiring them to change their point-of-sale systems. Let’s break down the main advantages: Seamless User Experience: Transactions look and feel like normal card payments, removing the complexity often associated with crypto. Merchant Familiarity: Shops receive settlement in their local currency through existing channels, avoiding volatility risk. Financial Inclusion: It provides an efficient payment rail for tourists who may prefer using global stablecoins over traditional forex services. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Widespread Adoption? While the pilot is promising, the path to full-scale implementation has hurdles. Regulatory clarity around stablecoins and cross-border crypto transactions is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including South Korea. Furthermore, ensuring robust security and fraud prevention for these hybrid digital-card transactions will be paramount. Consumer education is another critical step, as users need to trust and understand the new stablecoin payments mechanism. Why Is This Pilot a Significant Step Forward? This project by BC Card is significant because it demonstrates a practical, non-disruptive path for crypto adoption. It doesn’t try to replace the current card network; instead, it enhances it. This approach could serve as a blueprint for other countries looking to integrate digital assets into their mainstream economies. The success of such stablecoin payments pilots could accelerate the global movement toward more efficient and inclusive financial systems. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Travel Payments BC Card’s completed pilot is more than a test—it’s a compelling preview of a frictionless financial future. By enabling stablecoin payments for foreigners through familiar card infrastructure, South Korea is positioning itself at the forefront of payment innovation. This model, if scaled, could transform how tourists interact with local economies worldwide, making cross-border spending as simple as a tap or a swipe. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to have a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. This makes them suitable for everyday transactions unlike more volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Which stablecoins were used in the BC Card pilot? The specific report from E-Daily did not name the stablecoins used. However, globally popular options like USDT (Tether) or USDC (USD Coin) are likely candidates for such a pilot focused on foreign users. Can South Korean citizens use this stablecoin payment system? The pilot specifically targeted foreigners in South Korea. Local regulations currently restrict South Korean residents from using certain crypto-based payment services, making this an initial solution for the tourist market. Is this service available to all tourists now? No, this was a completed pilot project. It demonstrates technical feasibility and a working model. A full public launch would require further regulatory approvals and commercial decisions by BC Card and its partners. How does this differ from just using a travel card or credit card? For the user, the point-of-sale experience is similar. The key difference is the funding source. Instead of loading the card with traditional currency, a user funds it with stablecoins, which they may already hold in a digital wallet, potentially offering faster and cheaper cross-border value transfer. What does this mean for the future of crypto payments? It signals a major trend: integrating cryptocurrencies into existing, trusted payment rails (like card networks) rather than building entirely separate systems. This “hybrid approach” is seen as a faster route to mainstream adoption. Found this insight into the future of travel and crypto fascinating?

The international agency said that discussions with regards to the country’s Bitcoin project continue, centered on enhancing transparency, safeguarding public resources, and eliminating risks. “Close engagement with the Salvadoran authorities is expected to continue in the period ahead with the objective of reaching a staff level agreement on all policies and reforms needed to complete the second review of the EFF program,” the statement read. The statement, issued by Mission Chief Mr. Torres, outlines the progress of the second review of the country’s 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). What’s the IMF’s assessment of El Salvador? The statement follows in person and virtual discussions that have occurred over the past months with the Salvadoran authorities on the second review of the 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement. According to the statement, El Salvador has enjoyed strong economic growth, growing faster than expected with a GDP that is expected to reach around 4% this year and with great prospects for next year. The IMF acknowledged the strong commitment of the country’s authorities to fiscal consolidation claiming the “end-2025 primary balance target is well on track to be met, and the recently approved 2026 Budget is consistent with a further reduction in the deficit along with an expansion in social spending.” It claims these efforts are supporting reserve accumulation and a reduction in domestic borrowing in line with program targets. There was also talk about the country’s advancing structural agenda which has seen several major reforms recently completed or approved. Some of those reforms include, an actuarial pension study and a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework; New financial stability laws regarding bank resolution and crisis management; The adoption of “Basel III” regulations to make the banking system safer; and A new Anti-Money Laundering (AML/CFT) law, which aligns the legal framework with international standards. Is El Salvador still buying Bitcoin? El Salvador was one of the first countries to start accumulating Bitcoin. However, that has not sat well with the IMF, and it has consistently expressed concerns about financial risks, volatility, and public sector exposure. Its back-and-forth with El Salvador regarding its Bitcoin policies has been ongoing since the country made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021. In March, the International Monetary Fund published a new Staff Country Report related to El Salvador, in which it demanded that El Salvador stop its Bitcoin accumulation through both purchasing and mining. It also demanded that the country should liquidate the fund created to buy more BTC, among other essential changes, beyond the Bitcoin Law amendments passed by the national congress at the end of January. The country’s President, Nayib Bukele, has shifted his stance on the IMF. In the past, he mocked the fund’s position on the Bitcoin Law, but has now reportedly made adjustments to the law and agreed to cease all public Bitcoin involvement. That agreement was announced in 2024, but doubts lingered about the implementation of the changes. The updated report specified that El Salvador must fully comply by December 2025 and detail what the changes will look like. While the initial changes to the Bitcoin Law primarily concerned its legal tender status, the IMF has emphasized that the public sector must cease its “voluntary accumulation of BTC.” As far as the IMF is concerned, El Salvador has complied; Bukele has shifted his stance, and a full phase-out of the Chivo e-wallet is underway. However, there are some contradictions regarding the country’s Bitcoin holdings. The government’s Bitcoin Office has claimed it is still stacking sats, with the latest purchase announced on December 22 when the country claimed it increased its holdings to 7509 BTC. It claims the milestone has only been possible via the purchase of one BTC per day. Despite the public announcements of the Bitcoin buying, an official IMF report from November alleged no accumulation is happening anymore and that increases in Bitcoin holdings in the reserve fund reflect the consolidation of Bitcoin across various government-owned wallets, rather than new purchases. The head of the Bitcoin Office, Stacy Herbert, has also previously stated that El Salvador has continued to buy Bitcoin in defiance of the IMF deal. “Some ‘bitcoiners’ trust the words of the IMF over the stacking actions of El Salvador recorded for eternity onto the Bitcoin blockchain,” Herbert wrote in March.

The Singaporean AI company has managed become the largest Southeast Asian buyer of Nvidia hardware in less than 3 years, which placed it squarely inside Washington’s long-running fight to stop advanced chips from slipping into China. The US is currently investigating centers on whether Megaspeed moved Nvidia chips into China without licenses or whether the company is Chinese in practice despite its Singapore registration. Such findings would breach US curbs designed to limit China’s AI and military capabilities. Singapore police confirmed they are checking for violations of local laws but did not name them. In Malaysia, which hosts most of the company’s operations, a government spokesperson allegedly said compliance monitoring is ongoing. The company rejects the allegations.In a statement, Megaspeed said it operates from Singapore and follows all applicable regulations, including US export controls. An Nvidia spokesperson allegedly said the chipmaker found no evidence of diversion and confirmed the company is fully owned and operated outside China with no Chinese shareholders. The spokesperson added that the services offered fall within permitted cloud activity. The business model involved is a neocloud structure, meaning it rents high-performance hardware for AI work. At many Southeast Asian sites, Megaspeed leases Nvidia capacity to Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant already under US national security review. Megaspeed’s trade records are consistently showing gaps between AI chip imports and deployed hardware From its 2023 launch through November this year, Megaspeed imported at least $4.6 billion in Nvidia hardware, covering 136,000 GPUs, based on Malaysian and Indonesian customs records compiled by Big Trade Data More than half came from Nvidia’s Blackwell line, chips Trump has said he will not approve for export to China even after easing limits on older models. Most Blackwell units arrived over six months ago, with another batch last month. When Nvidia teams visited company data centers, they saw only a few thousand Blackwell GPUs, inventory details shared with US officials show. An Nvidia official said the company also inspected separate warehouses and confirmed the hardware had not gone to China, but declined to say whether the stored totals matched the outstanding volumes. Nvidia said it conducts routine site checks worldwide and stated in mid-November, “Our visits confirmed that the GPUs shipped to Megaspeed by our partners are where they are supposed to be.” A later comment in mid-December said Nvidia had identified “substantially” all products sent and would visit again. The data center footprint Nvidia described to Washington differs from Megaspeed’s own public account of its facilities, and how Megaspeed has privately described its operations. The biggest question is the location of the “specific area” project touted in the investor presentation Megaspeed circulated in 2024. The slide deck, translated from its original Mandarin, said simply: “As of now, the largest NCP (Nvidia Cloud Partner) computing power cluster has been built in a specific area.” But then investigators identified a Chinese company using the same branding and claiming Southeast Asia staff, while posting job ads near the Shanghai site for work on restricted Nvidia GPUs. Naturally, that drew the attention of the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, though as of press time, America has not placed Megaspeed on any trade restriction list or ordered Nvidia to halt business. Malaysia’s investment and trade ministry said there is no clear evidence of violations so far and welcomed additional credible information. Singapore police earlier detained founder Huang Le for questioning and restricted her travel, but she is no longer in custody and is assisting investigators. Megaspeed completed most purchases of Nvidia processors in the six weeks before May 15, 2025, just before a Biden-era permit system for Southeast Asia was set to start and was later scrapped by Trump.

The latest reading from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index confirms it, holding firmly in the “extreme fear” zone at a score of 24. This crucial sentiment gauge has become a beacon for investors trying to navigate the stormy seas of digital assets. But what does this persistent fear actually signal, and more importantly, how should you respond? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by Alternative.me, is more than just a number. It’s a composite snapshot of market psychology. Currently sitting at 24, it has dropped a point from the previous day, reinforcing a prolonged period of investor anxiety. The scale runs from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). Therefore, a score of 24 is deep in pessimistic territory. This metric is calculated using a specific recipe of market data: Volatility (25%) : Heightened price swings feed directly into fear. Market Volume (25%) : Trading activity, or lack thereof, indicates participation levels. Social Media (15%) : The tone of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%) : Direct polling of market participant sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Shifts in BTC’s market share relative to altcoins. Trends (10%) : Search volume data for crypto-related terms. Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear? A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading is often viewed through two lenses. For some, it signals danger and a reason to exit. For seasoned investors, however, it can present a contrarian opportunity. Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have sometimes preceded market recoveries. This is because when sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, it often means weak hands have sold, potentially setting the stage for a rebound. However, this is not a guaranteed signal to buy; it’s a context tool. It tells you the emotional state of the market, which is a powerful force that can override fundamentals in the short term. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market So, what can you do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index screams caution? First, avoid making emotional decisions. Fear leads to panic selling, often at the worst possible time. Instead, use this period for research and strategy. Consider these steps: Review Your Portfolio : Ensure your asset allocation still matches your risk tolerance. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA) : If you believe in the long-term thesis, systematic buying during fear can lower your average entry cost. Secure Your Assets : Double-check the security of your holdings, using hardware wallets for long-term storage. Monitor Fundamentals : Look beyond price. Are development activity, network usage, and adoption trends still strong for your chosen assets? The Historical Context of the Fear & Greed Index It’s helpful to remember that markets are cyclical. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has visited these depths before, such as during the bear markets of 2018 and 2022. Each time, it eventually climbed out. While past performance doesn’t predict the future, it shows that extreme sentiment is a phase, not a permanent state. The key is patience and discipline. This index is a tool for gauging the market’s temperature, not a crystal ball. It should inform your decisions, not dictate them. Conclusion: Navigating the Sentiment Storm The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 24 is a clear sign that investor anxiety is the dominant force. This creates a challenging but potentially opportunistic environment. By understanding what the index measures and maintaining a disciplined approach, you can avoid the pitfalls of crowd psychology. Remember, the most profitable decisions are often made when they feel the most uncomfortable. Use data, not emotion, as your guide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 24 mean? A: A score of 24 falls into the “Extreme Fear” category (0-25). It indicates that market sentiment is overwhelmingly negative based on factors like volatility, social media buzz, and trading volume. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a good buying signal? A: It can be a useful contrarian indicator. Historically, extreme fear has sometimes marked potential buying opportunities, but it is not a standalone signal. Always conduct your own research and consider your financial goals. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on market sentiment. Q: Does the index only measure Bitcoin sentiment? A> While Bitcoin dominance is a 10% factor in its calculation, the index is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market, as influenced by social media, surveys, and overall trading activity. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me, which is its primary source. Q: Should I sell my crypto when the index shows extreme fear? A> Not necessarily. Selling during extreme fear often means selling at a loss. It may be a time to hold, reassess your strategy, or consider disciplined buying (like DCA) if your long-term outlook remains positive.

This transaction, worth approximately $5.15 million, was executed at an average price of $157.78 per token. Following this purchase, the wallet’s total holdings now stand at 84,033 AAVE. However, the portfolio currently shows an unrealized loss of around $2.29 million, highlighting the recent price pressure on the token. This substantial acquisition by the project’s creator is a classic ‘skin in the game’ move, often interpreted as a strong vote of confidence. Why Is This Happening During an Aave Governance Conflict? The timing of this purchase is perhaps its most intriguing aspect. Reports indicate significant internal discussions within the Aave community regarding two key areas: Governance Control: Debates over the direction and decision-making power within the Aave decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Revenue-Sharing: Discussions on how protocol fees should be distributed to AAVE token holders and stakeholders. Such conflicts are not uncommon in decentralized projects but can create short-term uncertainty. Therefore, the decision by the Aave founder to buy AAVE amidst this turbulence is a strategic signal intended to stabilize community sentiment. How Is the AAVE Token Price Reacting? Market data provides crucial context. At the time of the purchase, AAVE was trading significantly higher than its current price. According to CoinMarketCap, AAVE is now trading at approximately $149.92, reflecting an 8.11% decline over the past 24 hours. This dip suggests the market is weighing the positive signal of the founder’s purchase against the negative news of internal strife. The transaction shows a founder buying into weakness, a tactic often employed by executives who believe their asset is undervalued. What Are the Potential Outcomes for Aave? The founder’s bold move sets the stage for several possible futures for the Aave protocol. A positive resolution to the governance debates could unlock new value and innovation. Conversely, prolonged conflict might hinder development and erode user confidence. The Aave founder buys AAVE action is a high-stakes gamble that the community will navigate its challenges successfully. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether this vote of confidence pays off for all token holders. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence in Decentralized Finance The Aave founder’s purchase of AAVE tokens is a defining moment for the protocol. It demonstrates a deep belief in the project’s long-term fundamentals, even when faced with internal governance challenges. For investors and DeFi enthusiasts, this event underscores the complex, human-driven nature of decentralized organizations. While price volatility may continue in the short term, the founder’s substantial financial commitment provides a compelling narrative of resilience and long-term vision for the Aave ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Stani Kulechov? Stani Kulechov is the founder and a leading figure behind the Aave protocol, a major decentralized lending platform in the cryptocurrency space. Why would a founder buy their own token? Founders often purchase their project’s token to demonstrate confidence in its future, especially during periods of doubt or price decline. It aligns their financial interests with those of the community. What is the Aave governance conflict about? Reports suggest the conflict revolves around control of the Aave DAO’s decision-making process and how to best share the protocol’s generated revenue with AAVE token holders. Does the founder’s purchase guarantee the AAVE price will go up? No. While it is a strong positive signal, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by many factors, including broader market trends, adoption, and technological developments. It is not a guarantee of future performance. What is an unrealized loss? An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an investment that has not yet been sold. The loss only becomes “realized” if the asset is sold at the lower price. Where can I track such onchain transactions? Transactions like this are tracked by onchain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers, which allow anyone to view wallet activity and token movements on public ledgers like Ethereum.

The company, known for its substantial Bitcoin treasury, has been added to the widely followed Russell 2000 index. This move signals growing institutional acceptance and provides a fascinating case study at the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. What Does It Mean for a Bitcoin Fintech Firm to Join the Russell 2000? The inclusion of Fold Holdings in the Russell 2000 is more than just a line item. The Russell 2000 is a benchmark index tracking 2,000 small-cap U.S. companies. Therefore, this event marks a pivotal moment for a Bitcoin fintech firm to be recognized within the traditional financial ecosystem. It grants the company increased visibility among institutional investors, fund managers, and analysts who use the index as a guide for investment decisions. This development is a powerful validation. It suggests that companies built around Bitcoin and blockchain technology are being evaluated not just as speculative crypto plays, but as legitimate financial services businesses with measurable growth potential. The move can potentially lead to greater liquidity for Fold’s stock and attract a new class of investors who may have previously overlooked the crypto space. Why Is Fold Holdings a Standout Bitcoin Fintech Firm? Fold isn’t just another crypto startup. The company has strategically positioned itself with a unique proposition. Reports indicate that Fold holds a treasury of over 1,500 BTC. This substantial Bitcoin reserve acts as a powerful differentiator and aligns the company’s success directly with the performance of the leading cryptocurrency. Here are key aspects that make this Bitcoin fintech firm noteworthy: Dual-Strategy Model: Fold operates at the intersection of fintech services and Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Institutional Confidence: Its index inclusion reflects a level of corporate governance and transparency that meets traditional market standards. Market Signal: It acts as a bridge, making Bitcoin exposure accessible through a regulated equity. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Adoption? The journey of this Bitcoin fintech firm into a mainstream index is a landmark event with ripple effects. Firstly, it provides a regulated, familiar pathway for traditional investors to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s ecosystem without buying the cryptocurrency directly. This can reduce perceived barriers to entry. Secondly, it sets a precedent. Other crypto-native companies may now view public listings and index eligibility as viable strategic goals, further blurring the lines between digital and traditional asset classes. However, challenges remain, including regulatory scrutiny and the inherent volatility associated with Bitcoin’s price, which can impact the firm’s valuation. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin and Finance The inclusion of Fold Holdings in the Russell 2000 is a compelling story of convergence. It demonstrates that a Bitcoin fintech firm can meet the rigorous criteria of traditional finance while staying true to its crypto roots. This event is less about a single company’s stock and more about a symbolic opening of doors. It represents a step toward a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into the global financial framework, offering new opportunities for investors and legitimizing the entire sector. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the Russell 2000 index? A: The Russell 2000 is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 2,000 small-capitalization companies in the United States. It is a key benchmark for small-cap stocks. Q: Why is Fold’s inclusion in the Russell 2000 significant? A: It signifies that a company whose business and treasury are heavily tied to Bitcoin is being recognized as a legitimate player by traditional financial institutions and index providers, marking a milestone for crypto adoption. Q: Does this mean I’m investing in Bitcoin if I buy Fold stock? A: Not directly. You are investing in the company Fold Holdings. However, because the company holds a large Bitcoin treasury, its stock price may be correlated with Bitcoin’s price performance, offering indirect exposure.

FanDuel launched its prediction markets app “FanDuel Predicts” in five states and in partnership with CME Group, days after rival DraftKings released a similar product in 38 states. More companies are launching prediction market platforms following the substantial success of Kalshi and Polymarket. Flutter Entertainment launches FanDuel Predicts FanDuel, the U.S. online gambling division of Flutter Entertainment Plc, has entered the prediction markets space with the launch of FanDuel Predicts in five states. Cryptopolitan reported recently that its primary competitor, DraftKings Inc., rolled out its own prediction markets platform across 38 states. Prediction markets operate under federal regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that allows betting-style activities in states that have not legalized online gambling. FanDuel’s new app initially launched in Alabama, Alaska, South Carolina, North Dakota, and South Dakota, with plans for a phased national expansion throughout 2026. FanDuel Predicts will allow users to place wagers on the outcomes of sports events, cultural happenings, and financial indicators through a prediction markets exchange. “This launch in five states will provide valuable insights into customer engagement with this new platform, enabling us to refine our approach as we expand to additional states in 2026,” James Cooper, the senior vice president at FanDuel, said . The surge of interest in prediction markets is due to the rapid growth of startups like Kalshi Inc. and Polymarket, which have become new ways for users to wager on event outcomes. These platforms gained substantial market share in recent months, creating anxiety among established gambling companies about losing customers to less regulated competitors. Between August and November, shares of both DraftKings and Flutter Entertainment declined as investors began to grow concerned about the competitive threat of prediction market startups. However, Flutter’s stock price has risen since it announced the launch of FanDuel Predicts. The company’s shares climbed as much as 1.7% on Friday following the announcement. What is FanDuel Predicts doing differently? FanDuel is launching its prediction markets app in partnership with CME Group Inc., in order to provide the regulatory infrastructure needed to offer prediction market contracts legally. DraftKings also announced it will route trades through CME Group, but the company has acquired its own derivatives exchange that it plans to use for trading in the future. FanDuel plans to offer contracts on economic data, commodity prices, and stock indexes in all 50 states. However, sports-related contracts will only be available in states where online sports betting remains illegal. Some state gambling authorities have warned that sports betting companies could lose their licenses if they offer prediction markets tied to sports in jurisdictions where they already hold sports betting licenses.

Reports confirm his frozen World Liberty Financial (WLFI) holdings have lost a staggering $60 million in value. This dramatic loss highlights the intense risks and regulatory scrutiny within the cryptocurrency market. What Happened to Justin Sun’s Frozen WLFI Holdings? The crisis began when the World Liberty Financial team froze Justin Sun’s assets in September. This action came after he transferred approximately $9 million worth of WLFI tokens to another address. The team cited suspicions of market price manipulation as their primary reason for the freeze. Consequently, the value of his initial $75 million investment, made between November 2024 and January 2025, has now cratered. Why Won’t World Liberty Financial Unfreeze the Assets? The stance from World Liberty Financial is firm and clear. They have stated they will not release Justin Sun’s frozen WLFI holdings. Their decision stems from a commitment to protect their ecosystem and other investors. They believe unfreezing the assets could undermine market integrity. This situation raises critical questions about governance and power within decentralized projects. Key points from their position include: Suspected Manipulation: The team alleges actions intended to artificially influence the WLFI token price. Protocol Enforcement: They are enforcing their own rules to maintain project stability. Precedent Setting: This move signals a tough stance against perceived market abuse by large holders, or ‘whales’. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? This incident is not just about one investor’s loss. It serves as a cautionary tale for the entire cryptocurrency sector. It underscores the complex relationship between project teams and large-scale investors. Furthermore, it shows how quickly value can evaporate when assets are locked and sentiment sours. The fallout from Justin Sun’s frozen WLFI holdings may lead to: Increased scrutiny of whale activity and token vesting schedules. More robust clauses in project whitepapers regarding asset freezes. A reassessment of risk by large investors when engaging with new crypto projects. What Can Investors Learn From This Saga? For everyday crypto investors, this drama offers vital lessons. First, it emphasizes that even prominent figures like Justin Sun are not immune to severe losses. Second, it highlights the importance of understanding a project’s governance rules before investing. The power a development team holds can be substantial. Actionable insights include: Research Governance: Always review a project’s terms regarding asset locking and team authority. Diversify Risk: Avoid concentrating too much capital in a single, speculative asset. Monitor Whale Activity: Large transactions can signal both opportunity and impending volatility. Conclusion: A $60 Million Warning to the Crypto World The tale of Justin Sun’s frozen WLFI holdings is a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency’s volatile and unpredictable nature. It demonstrates that market rules are still being written and enforced, often in real-time. While Sun’s loss is monumental, the broader lesson on regulatory risk, project autonomy, and investment due diligence resonates for all market participants. The market watches closely to see if this establishes a new precedent for handling disputes between projects and their largest backers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why were Justin Sun’s WLFI holdings frozen? A1: The World Liberty Financial team froze the assets in September after Sun transferred $9 million worth of tokens. They suspected these moves were an attempt to manipulate the WLFI token’s price. Q2: How much did Justin Sun initially invest in WLFI? A2: Justin Sun purchased a total of $75 million worth of WLFI tokens between November 2024 and January 2025. Q3: What is the current status of the frozen holdings? A3: The holdings remain frozen, and the World Liberty Financial team has stated they will not unfreeze them. Their value has dropped by approximately $60 million since the freeze. Q4: What does ‘price manipulation’ mean in this context? A4: It typically refers to actions designed to artificially inflate or deflate a token’s market price for personal gain, misleading other investors about its true supply, demand, or value. Q5: Can Justin Sun legally challenge the freeze? A5: This depends on the legal jurisdiction, the terms of service of the WLFI project, and the specifics of the purchase. Such challenges in the decentralized crypto space are often complex and unprecedented. Q6: How does this affect other WLFI investors? A6: The event has likely caused significant price volatility and shaken investor confidence. It also sets a governance precedent for how the project team handles disputes with large stakeholders.

They usually are created in quiet phases when the pooling is underway. Most investors fail to catch such situations as they come before headlines become loud. At the moment, one of the Ethereum based DeFi cryptos seems to be making its way through that slit-range. It is getting attention, big buyers are getting very active, and the price structure is aimed at a switch. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Creating Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a two-sided lending protocol to be used in practice. The site promotes P2P lending and the P2P market. In the P2C model, assets are provided by users in common liquidity pools. They are given in turn mtTokens which reflect their deposit in addition to the interest they earned. As an illustration, a user providing ETH will be issued with mtETH that will increase with consumer borrowers repaying interests on the pool. The P2P side provides lending amongst users. Borrowers have the option of fixed rates or variable rates whereas lenders have their risk level of choice. The system is designed with loan to value limits and liquidations to cushion the protocol when the market is swinging. The involvement has continued to increase in addition to the product design. Mutuum Finance is a company that has attracted approximately 19.4M and has grown to over 18,600 holders. These numbers are important as they demonstrate that they are adopted prior to the launch of the platform. As of official updates, V1 will be integrated into the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, which will be the transition point between the development phase and the execution phase. The Token Price and Stage Evolution MUTM has a current price of $0.035 and it is at Phase 6. The maximum number of token supply is 4B MUTM. Of this, 45.5% is to be distributed early, or an equivalent of 1.82B tokens. Approximately 820M tokens have already been sold. The token has grown 2.5x since the beginning of the first phase up to the present price of $0.01, which is also known as a token. This model of staged pricing implies the introduction of an increased fixed price at every stage. The phase 1 participants are set at a 500% MUTM appreciation at the official price of launching at $0.06. With improved events in the project, the MUTM price should increase by almost 20%. This is important to early entrants since subsequent entrants trap a greater cost and initial phases have a better price-making timeline. Security Assessment Mutuum Finance has its focus on security. The token has a CertiK token scan award of 90 out of 100 that indicates contract structure and risk checks. Halbon Security is also performing a complete audit of the lending and borrowing contracts. The code is completed and is in the official examination. As another strategy to reinforce its systems, Mutuum Finance has introduced a $50K bug bounty. This would motivate independent researchers to debug the system and report vulnerability issues prior to V1. In the case of a DeFi crypto protocol that can be used with lending and liquidations, these layers can be very critical in trust and long term stability. Phase 6 is nearly at full allocation, and it is quickly tightening supply. The recent whale activities have been on the rise with large single allocations attracting focus. The level of competition in the 24 hour leaderboard has been increased with the best contributors receiving the MUTM rewards. Entry friction has also reduced and a wider range of users can take part now because of the card payments. Being a new crypto that runs on Ethereum, Mutuum Finance is placing itself ahead of Q1 2026, the infrastructure is almost complete, security stanzas are ready, and its supply is nearing its cap. To most traders observing what is turning out to be the potential best crypto to buy or the lowest priced crypto with practical use, it is a step that can be the transition point behavior and repricing.

56206994,647750,1766451609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56206994.jpeg,Bitcoin Futures Structure Favors Bulls as Short Liquidations Accelerate,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-futures-structure-bulls-short-liquidations/,"Bitcoin is once again attempting to reclaim the $90,000 level, as bulls cautiously rebuild a recovery narrative after weeks of volatility and heavy selling pressure. While sentiment remains fragile and many investors are still positioned defensively, recent price stabilization has opened the door for a short-term upside scenario. Rather than relying on optimism alone, analysts are increasingly pointing to structural indicators that suggest the balance of risk may be shifting. According to a report by on-chain analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s current setup shows tactical upside potential when viewed through the combined lens of market regime indicators and derivatives liquidation dynamics. Adler highlights that Bitcoin’s Regime Score has recently transitioned into the +15 to +30 zone, a range that has historically delivered positive average returns. This zone represents an early recovery phase, where downside momentum has faded but euphoria has not yet returned, often creating favorable conditions for asymmetric upside. At the same time, derivatives data show a clear dominance of short liquidations, meaning that recent price moves have forced bearish positions to close. This creates mechanical buying pressure, which can amplify upward moves even in the absence of strong spot demand. Together, these signals suggest that Bitcoin’s current attempt to reclaim $90,000 is not purely speculative but supported by an improving internal market structure. Regime Score and Liquidations Point to Tactical Upside Adler explains that Bitcoin’s composite Regime Score aggregates multiple market dimensions into a single framework, including taker imbalance, open interest pressure, funding rates, ETF flows, exchange flows, and price trend. The result is a unified indicator ranging from −100 to +100, designed to capture shifts in market structure rather than short-term noise. Currently, the Regime Score stands at +16.3, placing Bitcoin in the upper part of the neutral zone, defined between +15 and +30. Backtesting data for 2025 shows that this specific subzone has historically delivered average returns of around +3.8% over a 30-day horizon. This contrasts sharply with the −15 to 0 zone, where expected returns were negative, averaging -1.5% over seven days. Importantly, the indicator has recently rebounded from a bearish extreme, after dropping to −27 just a week ago, signaling a structural recovery rather than a random bounce. Adler highlights a critical nuance: transitions into the formal bull regime above +30 have historically coincided with local tops, often followed by negative short-term returns. This makes the current +15–30 range more attractive for tactical positioning, while aggressive accumulation above +30 may carry elevated risk. This view is reinforced by derivatives data. The long/short liquidation dominance oscillator has turned negative at −11%, indicating a surge in forced short closures, while its 30-day average remains positive. With long liquidation dominance at just 44%, short liquidations are clearly prevailing, providing additional mechanical fuel for upside. Bitcoin Tests Key Support as Volatility Compresses Bitcoin is currently trading around the $90,000 area after a sharp corrective move from recent highs, and the chart highlights a market at an important inflection point. Following the breakdown from the $105,000–$110,000 range, BTC experienced a swift decline that pushed the price below the short- and medium-term moving averages. The blue and green moving averages have rolled over, confirming a loss of upside momentum and signaling a shift toward a more defensive market structure. However, price is now stabilizing just above the psychologically critical $88,000–$90,000 zone, which has acted as a reaction level over recent sessions. This area aligns closely with prior consolidation and represents a short-term support cluster where buyers are attempting to regain control. Notably, selling pressure appears to be moderating, as the most aggressive downside move has already occurred, and recent candles suggest consolidation rather than continuation. The red long-term moving average remains well below the current price, indicating that Bitcoin is still structurally above its broader trend support. This reduces immediate downside risk, unless the $88,000 region fails decisively. Volume has also tapered off compared to the sell-off peak, suggesting that panic-driven liquidation may be subsiding. In this context, Bitcoin appears to be transitioning from an impulsive downside into a stabilization phase. A sustained hold above $90,000 would strengthen the case for a relief rally, while a breakdown below support would reopen the door to deeper retracements.

If you’ve been watching the crypto markets lately, you might have noticed something interesting: Bitcoin is back in the driver’s seat. The latest data from CoinMarketCap reveals a crucial shift—the Altcoin Season Index has dropped to just 16. This single number tells a powerful story about where investor money is flowing right now. But what does this mean for your portfolio, and should you be concerned about your altcoin holdings? What Is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? The Altcoin Season Index isn’t just another random metric. It’s a calculated gauge of market sentiment that compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The index excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give us a pure view of speculative momentum. When this index climbs above 75, it signals an ‘altcoin season’ where most alternative coins are outperforming Bitcoin. However, the current reading of 16 sends a clear, opposite message. This low score indicates we are firmly in what analysts call a ‘Bitcoin season.’ During such periods, capital tends to consolidate into the market leader, Bitcoin, often seen as a safer haven during uncertain times. The drop from 17 to 16 might seem small, but it reinforces a prevailing trend of Bitcoin dominance. Why Does the Altcoin Season Index Matter for Investors? Understanding this index is vital for making informed decisions. It helps you gauge overall market risk appetite. A high Altcoin Season Index suggests investors are confident and chasing higher returns in smaller, riskier assets. A low index, like we see now, suggests a flight to safety and quality. Here are the key implications of the current reading: Capital Rotation: Money is likely flowing out of altcoins and into Bitcoin. Risk-Off Sentiment: The market may be anticipating volatility or seeking stability. Timing Opportunities: Historically, deep ‘Bitcoin seasons’ have preceded major altcoin rallies. Is This the End for Altcoins? Not So Fast. While the Altcoin Season Index paints a bleak picture for altcoins in the short term, seasoned crypto investors know this is part of a natural cycle. Crypto markets are notoriously cyclical. Bitcoin often leads a bull market, with capital eventually trickling down to altcoins in a phenomenon known as ‘altseason.’ The current index of 16 is far from the 75 threshold needed to declare an altcoin season. However, this consolidation phase can be a healthy reset. It allows weaker projects to fade and strengthens the fundamental case for high-quality altcoins with real utility. For patient investors, this period can be an opportunity to research and accumulate promising assets at lower prices. Actionable Insights from the Current Market Data So, what should you do with this information? First, don’t panic. Market cycles are normal. Use this time to review your portfolio. Consider if your altcoin investments are based on strong fundamentals or mere speculation. Diversification remains key, but the Altcoin Season Index suggests tilting your allocation towards Bitcoin might be prudent in the immediate term. Secondly, set up alerts. Watch for when the index begins to climb steadily. A sustained move above 50 could be an early signal that sentiment is shifting back towards risk-on assets. Finally, stay informed. Indexes like this are tools, not crystal balls. They provide context but must be combined with other analysis. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin-Dominant Landscape The drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 16 is a significant data point confirming Bitcoin’s current supremacy. It reflects a cautious market prioritizing the original cryptocurrency. While this may disappoint altcoin enthusiasts in the short run, it underscores the importance of understanding market cycles. The path to potential altcoin gains often runs through periods of Bitcoin strength first. By monitoring this index and maintaining a disciplined strategy, you can navigate these shifts with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that measures whether the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day window. A score above 75 indicates an ‘altcoin season.’ Why did the index drop to 16? The index dropped due to Bitcoin outperforming the majority of altcoins over the past three months. This signals that investor capital and confidence are currently concentrated in Bitcoin. Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is this low? Not necessarily. A low index indicates a market phase, not a permanent state. It may be a time for strategic review and rebalancing rather than a wholesale sell-off, especially for projects with strong long-term fundamentals. How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data, allowing investors to track gradual shifts in market sentiment. Can the index predict the exact start of an altcoin season? No single metric can predict exact market turns. The index is a strong indicator of trend, but it should be used alongside other technical and fundamental analysis tools. Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? You can find the index on the CoinMarketCap website, usually within their market analysis or research sections.

Institutional players are increasingly positioning in silence, favoring strategic accumulation over public signaling. This phase is rarely loud or obvious, and it’s defined by patience, regulatory awareness, and long-term infrastructure planning rather than short-term speculation. While the broader crypto market debates short-term price swings, a quieter story is unfolding behind the scenes. According to skipper_xrp’s post on X, institutions and banks are methodically positioning themselves, and the word on the street is that they’re betting big on XRP. Why Institutions Accumulate XRP In Silence Many analysts believe that the asset is entering a phase where price discovery could accelerate beyond the $100 mark, and this sudden price increase will come as a shock to investors. At the same time, the XRP Ledger is expanding beyond its traditional role in cross-border payment into decentralized media in the US. Related Reading: ‘Think Again’ Before Selling Your XRP; Expert Tells Investors Adding to the momentum, BXE is set to list on a major US exchange on January 21st, following its partnership with a leading node provider. The increased network activity means higher usage of the XRP Ledger with more XRP being burned. Despite BXE trading at $0.06 and a fixed supply of 500 million, many investors view it as undervalued. An investor and crypto trader known as Xaif Crypto has mentioned that from 2019 to 2021, MoneyGram actively integrated Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, by leveraging XRP as the bridge asset for real-time foreign exchange settlement. However, when the US SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple in late 2020, regulatory uncertainty forced MoneyGram to suspend the partnership despite XRP proving its effectiveness as a liquidity bridge. Currently, with Ripple largely moved past its regulatory overhang and gaining clearer legal standing, the industry is revisiting questions that were left unresolved: Will banks and payment institutions return to an XRP-based liquidity solution? Nonetheless, if institutions prioritize speed, capital efficiency, and regulatory clarity, history suggests that XRP already demonstrated all of the benefits and can work at scale before it was paused. The only variable missing at the time was regulatory certainty. How Institutional-Grade Yield Comes To XRP Holders Crypto trader Xaif Crypto has also revealed upcoming features for the XRP Ledger. According to Xaif, the XRPL lending protocol, a protocol-native framework that underwrites credit built directly into the Ledger, enabling fixed-term and fixed-rate loans, is on the horizon.

From its July peak of $3.66, XRP has fallen consistently, dipping below $2 and hitting a low of $1.77 before showing attempts at recovery. The persistent downturn has prompted market experts to adjust their earlier forecasts for the cryptocurrency. XRP’s Path to $10 Changelly Exchange researchers now anticipate that XRP could reach the $10 mark by approximately August 2029. This outlook corresponds with prior estimates from Bitwise, which indicated that under a bullish scenario, XRP could reach $10.20 by the same year. In an extremely optimistic scenario, Bitwise projected a potential price of $13 by 2028. The Ripple/XRP/XRPL ""plan"" was supposed to start a year earlier. Thanks to an appeal and late ruling, here we are. Now the plan is still on track, albeit starting later. I must admit I will be first to admit I thought XRP price would be much higher by end of 2025, but hey, I… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 18, 2025 Telegaon analysts offer a slightly more aggressive timeline, suggesting XRP may achieve an average price of $10.29 by 2028. Considering the current price of roughly $1.92, this represents an approximate 421% increase over the next several years. XRP’s Path to $50 Forecasts for XRP reaching $50 are considerably longer-term. Changelly’s research indicates a possible timeline extending to 2034, with the coin potentially attaining $51 by January of that year. This would represent an upside of nearly 2,500% from current levels. Telegaon’s analysts project that XRP may reach the $50 threshold between 2035 and 2040. Their range estimates a minimum value of $40.29 by 2035 and a maximum of $59 by 2040. Bitwise, however, does not project a $50 milestone, instead placing its highest anticipated price at $29.32 by 2030. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Path to $100 Community figure Zach Rector has revised his projection for XRP reaching $100, now suggesting 2030 as the expected year, down from his earlier 2025 prediction. His prior forecast generated attention for its optimism, but the updated timeline reflects more conservative expectations amid the extended market downturn. Changelly’s long-term analysis estimates that XRP could reach $134 by 2040, while Telegaon projects a $106 price point by 2050. From the current price, a $100 XRP represents a more than 50-fold increase, indicating that achieving this level would likely require several decades. Under such a scenario, investors holding 10,000 XRP would see their positions surpass the million-dollar mark. These updated projections reflect broad reassessments in the market following XRP’s underperformance relative to previous expectations. Analysts are balancing historical volatility with macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions, emphasizing that significant growth milestones are unlikely to occur in the short term. The revisions underscore the extended timelines required for substantial price appreciation, highlighting the importance of long-term holding strategies for investors considering high targets like $50 and $100 . Overall, while optimism remains, the market consensus now indicates that these price points will likely be achieved gradually rather than rapidly.

A compelling new analysis from asset manager VanEck suggests that the current Bitcoin hashrate decline could be the precursor to a significant price rebound. This insight turns conventional worry on its head, offering a hopeful perspective for investors watching the market’s every move. What Does the Bitcoin Hashrate Drop Really Mean? The Bitcoin hashrate measures the total computational power securing the network. Recently, this metric has faced downward pressure. Analysts Matt Sigel and Patrick Bush from VanEck argue this isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm. Instead, they see it as a potential sign of miner capitulation—a point where less efficient miners are forced to shut down operations. Historically, such phases have often cleared the way for stronger price rallies. How Does Miner Capitulation Lead to a Price Rebound? The connection between hashrate and price isn’t direct, but it’s powerful. Here’s the virtuous cycle VanEck describes: Hashrate Decline: Falling Bitcoin prices squeeze miner profits, forcing inefficient operations offline. Reduced Selling Pressure: Struggling miners typically sell their earned BTC to cover costs. Their exit reduces this constant sell-side pressure. Network Adjustment: The Bitcoin protocol automatically lowers mining difficulty after a hashrate drop, making it cheaper for remaining miners to operate. Profitability Returns: If the BTC price then rises, miner profitability soars, encouraging reactivation of idle rigs and reinforcing network security. Therefore, a falling Bitcoin hashrate can be a cleansing mechanism, setting the stage for a healthier, more sustainable advance. What Triggered the Recent Hashrate Decline? The report points to a specific, major event. According to data referenced from Cointelegraph, the recent drop followed the shutdown of approximately 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of mining capacity in China. This sudden removal of a massive amount of computing power from the network is a primary driver of the observed hashrate metric decrease. It serves as a clear example of how regional policy and energy dynamics can create ripples across the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Why Should Investors Pay Attention to the Hashrate? Monitoring the Bitcoin hashrate offers more than just a technical snapshot. It provides a window into the economic health of the miners who secure the blockchain. For investors, it can be a valuable, albeit indirect, sentiment indicator. A sustained hashrate recovery often coincides with growing miner confidence, which can be a foundational element for a prolonged price uptrend. However, it’s crucial to remember that hashrate is just one piece of a much larger puzzle that includes macroeconomic factors and broader adoption trends. Conclusion: A Beacon of Hope in the Data The VanEck analysis provides a hopeful narrative grounded in historical patterns. While past performance never guarantees future results, the cyclical relationship between miner activity, network difficulty, and price offers a compelling framework. The current Bitcoin hashrate contraction may not be a symptom of weakness, but rather the necessary prelude to strength, potentially marking a moment of opportunity for astute observers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitcoin hashrate? The Bitcoin hashrate is the total combined computational power used by miners to process transactions and secure the Bitcoin network. It’s a key indicator of network health and security. Why does a dropping hashrate suggest a price rebound? A decline often signals miner capitulation, where unprofitable miners shut down. This reduces the selling pressure from miners needing to cover costs and allows the network to reset its mining difficulty, creating better conditions for a price recovery when demand returns. Is the hashrate a guaranteed predictor of Bitcoin price? No, it is not a guarantee. The hashrate is one of many indicators. While it has shown a historical correlation, Bitcoin’s price is influenced by a wide array of factors including macroeconomic conditions, regulation, and institutional adoption. How often does Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjust? The Bitcoin network automatically adjusts its mining difficulty approximately every two weeks (every 2016 blocks) to ensure a consistent block time of about 10 minutes, regardless of the total hashrate. What was the main cause of the recent hashrate drop mentioned by VanEck? VanEck’s report highlighted the shutdown of around 1.3 GW of mining capacity in China as a significant contributor to the recent decline in the overall Bitcoin hashrate. Where can I check the current Bitcoin hashrate? You can monitor the live Bitcoin hashrate on several major cryptocurrency data websites like Blockchain.com, CoinMetrics, or CoinWarz.

This PUMP whale deposit of 3.8 billion tokens to the institutional platform FalconX represents not just a large transfer but a multi-million dollar realized loss. Let’s dive into the details of what happened and why it matters for the market. What Exactly Happened with This PUMP Whale Deposit? According to data from Onchain Lens, an anonymous wallet transferred a massive 3.8 billion PUMP tokens to FalconX. This PUMP whale deposit was valued at approximately $7.57 million at the time of the transaction. However, the story behind this move reveals a significant financial hit. The same address had initially acquired these tokens from Binance three months prior for a total investment of $19.53 million. Therefore, by depositing them now, the whale has locked in an estimated loss of $12.22 million. Why Would a Whale Take Such a Massive Loss? Seeing a PUMP whale deposit of this magnitude at a loss raises immediate questions. Whales are typically savvy investors, so such actions are closely analyzed. Several reasons could explain this decision: Portfolio Rebalancing: The investor may be cutting losses on PUMP to reallocate capital into more promising assets. Tax-Loss Harvesting: Realizing a loss can be used to offset capital gains taxes in certain jurisdictions, providing a strategic financial benefit. Liquidity Needs: The whale might require immediate cash, forcing the sale of assets regardless of current price. Loss of Confidence: A fundamental shift in outlook on the PUMP project could prompt an exit, even at a steep cost. Moving tokens to FalconX, an institutional-grade platform, suggests this was a calculated move, not a panic sell on a retail exchange. What Does This Mean for the PUMP Token and Retail Investors? A PUMP whale deposit of this scale can influence market sentiment. Large sell-offs, even at a loss, can create downward pressure on the token’s price in the short term as the market absorbs the volume. For retail investors, this event serves as a crucial reminder of the market’s volatility. It highlights key lessons: Whale Watching is Key: Tracking large wallet movements can provide early signals of market shifts. Risk Management is Paramount: Even large, presumably informed investors incur substantial losses. Understand the Context: A single transaction doesn’t define a project’s long-term value, but it is an important data point. Could This PUMP Whale Deposit Signal a Larger Trend? While one transaction is a single data point, it’s worth considering if this PUMP whale deposit is an isolated event or part of a broader pattern. Analysts will now watch for similar movements from other large holders. Furthermore, monitoring the wallet’s future activity may reveal its next strategic play. Does the whale move into stablecoins, or pivot to another altcoin? The answer could offer further clues about smart money sentiment in the current market cycle. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale and a Learning Opportunity The recent PUMP whale deposit resulting in a $12.2 million loss is a powerful narrative in the cryptocurrency world. It underscores the high-stakes reality of crypto investing, where even major players are not immune to significant downturns. For the broader community, it reinforces the importance of diligent research, robust risk management strategies, and a long-term perspective beyond the noise of single transactions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘crypto whale’? A: A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a specific cryptocurrency that their trades can potentially influence the market price. Q2: Why is depositing to FalconX significant? A: FalconX is an institutional trading platform. A deposit there often indicates an intent to sell or use the tokens for institutional purposes like collateral, rather than simply holding them in a private wallet. Q3: How can I track whale movements like this? A: You can use blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens) or dedicated on-chain analytics platforms and social media accounts that report large transactions. Q4: Does a whale selling at a loss mean the project is failing? A: Not necessarily. A single investor’s exit can be due to personal strategy, liquidity needs, or tax planning. It’s one signal to consider alongside project fundamentals, development activity, and overall market conditions. Q5: What is ‘tax-loss harvesting’ mentioned in the article? A: It’s an investment strategy where you sell an asset at a loss to offset capital gains taxes you owe from other profitable investments, potentially lowering your overall tax bill. Q6: Should I sell my PUMP tokens because of this news? A: This article provides analysis, not financial advice. Your decision should be based on your own research, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on a single event.

Selig as the new Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Selig, a crypto-friendly lawyer with deep experience in both the public and private sectors, was sworn in on December 22, 2025. Selig takes the Helm at CFTC amid push for comprehensive crypto rules According to a Monday X post , David Sacks noted the US was at a “critical juncture” for crypto regulation, and that Selig and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins made up a “dream team to define clear regulatory guidelines.” Sacks’ comments followed Selig’s statement that the US Congress was preparing to complete work on a bill regarding the crypto market structure. Selig on X that they were at a unique moment as a wide range of novel technologies, products, and platforms are emerging, retail participation in the commodity markets is at an all-time high, and Congress is poised to send digital asset market structure legislation that will cement the US as the Crypto Capital of the World to the president’s desk. Congress eyes landmark market structure bill to cement US crypto leadership The market structure bill, known as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act in the Senate and building on the CLARITY Act passed by the House in July, remains under consideration but has been temporarily paused during the congressional recess. The legislation aims to create a comprehensive framework for regulating digital assets, clarifying the roles of the SEC and CFTC, and addressing emerging technologies and DeFi platforms. The Senate Banking Committee is expected to hold a markup in early January, paving the way for a potential floor vote as lawmakers seek to finalize rules that could position the US as a global leader in the cryptocurrency market. The Senate confirmed Selig last week in a 53-43 vote as part of a package of nominees. It’s unclear when he will take over for acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham, who is expected to leave the commission and join crypto company MoonPay following Selig’s confirmation. Reporters reached out to the CFTC and MoonPay for details on Pham’s departure, but had not received a response at the time of publication. Even though the final text of the Senate’s market structure bill had yet to be finalized for a floor vote, drafts to date indicated that the legislation would give the CFTC more authority to regulate digital assets, a role previously held by the SEC. Although some Republican leaders have stated that they are moving forward with the bill, other senators have raised concerns over DeFi, which could potentially slow progress.

Matador Technologies, listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange, has approved a strategy to raise 80 million Canadian dollars, approximately $58.2 million, with a clear primary goal: significant Bitcoin purchases . This decision highlights a growing trend of public companies strategically allocating capital to digital assets as a core part of their treasury strategy. What Is the Plan Behind These Major Bitcoin Purchases? Matador Technologies’ board has greenlit a new share issuance to secure the necessary capital. The company intends to use the proceeds for two main purposes. First, a substantial portion will fund additional Bitcoin purchases to aggressively expand its crypto reserves. Second, the remaining funds will cover general corporate operating expenses. This structured approach shows a balance between ambitious growth in digital assets and sustaining day-to-day business operations. Currently, Matador holds 175 BTC. However, its new strategy outlines a dramatically larger ambition. The firm aims to grow its Bitcoin treasury to 1,000 BTC by the end of 2026. This target represents a nearly six-fold increase from its current position, marking a profound commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Therefore, this isn’t a speculative dabble but a calculated, multi-year accumulation plan. Why Are Companies Like Matador Making Big Bitcoin Moves? Matador’s announcement is part of a broader narrative of institutional adoption. Companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin not just as an investment, but as a strategic treasury asset. Here are some key reasons driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many see Bitcoin as a digital counterpart to gold, a potential safeguard against currency devaluation. Portfolio Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk. Future-Oriented Strategy: It positions the company within the growing digital economy and blockchain ecosystem. For a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange, this move also sends a powerful signal to shareholders and the market. It demonstrates forward-thinking leadership and a willingness to embrace innovative financial strategies. Moreover, it can attract investors who are specifically interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through traditional equity markets. What Are the Challenges and Considerations? While the plan is ambitious, executing large-scale Bitcoin purchases comes with its own set of challenges. Market volatility is the most obvious factor; the value of the purchased Bitcoin can fluctuate significantly between acquisition dates. Furthermore, the company must establish secure and compliant custody solutions for storing a growing digital asset treasury. Regulatory clarity in Canada, while progressive, also requires careful navigation to ensure all activities remain above board. Despite these considerations, the approval of this $58.2 million raise indicates that Matador’s leadership has weighed the risks and sees a compelling long-term value proposition. Their phased approach, aiming for a 2026 target, suggests they may employ dollar-cost averaging or strategic timing to mitigate some market volatility during their accumulation phase. Conclusion: A Confident Step Into the Digital Asset Future Matador Technologies’ plan to secure $58.2 million for expanding its Bitcoin holdings is a clear testament to the maturing institutional narrative around cryptocurrency. It moves beyond hype into the realm of concrete corporate finance and treasury management. By setting a public target of 1,000 BTC, Matador is not just making an investment; it is making a statement about its belief in the enduring value of Bitcoin. This strategic move could inspire other small and mid-cap public companies to consider similar allocations, further bridging the worlds of traditional finance and digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How much Bitcoin does Matador Technologies currently own? A1: Matador Technologies currently holds 175 Bitcoin (BTC) in its treasury. Q2: What is Matador’s goal for its Bitcoin holdings? A2: The company aims to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 1,000 BTC by the end of 2026. Q3: How is Matador raising the $58.2 million? A3: The firm is raising approximately 80 million Canadian dollars ($58.2M USD) through a new issuance of its shares on the Toronto Venture Exchange. Q4: Will all the raised money be used for buying Bitcoin? A4: No, the proceeds are allocated for two purposes: additional Bitcoin purchases and general corporate operating expenses. Q5: Why would a public company buy Bitcoin? A5: Companies often buy Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve to hedge against inflation, diversify their assets, and gain exposure to the potential long-term growth of the digital asset class. Q6: Is this a common strategy for Canadian firms? A6: While not universal, several Canadian companies have begun adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, following a trend started by larger firms like MicroStrategy in the United States.

56208447,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=882846,1766454698,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56208447.jpeg,China races to dethrone Europe’s weather data with homegrown AI dataset,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-races-to-dethrone-europes-weather-data/,"China is ramping up efforts to wean itself off European weather data as it seeks to become a leader in the global field of meteorology and climate science. Officials are promoting a homegrown data set designed for the era of artificial intelligence, part of Beijing’s comprehensive effort to secure data and achieve technological independence. Europe’s ERA5 dataset is the global standard for climate and weather data, providing measurements of variables such as rainfall, temperature, and wind spread over more than 80 years. It has also become the foundation of AI-powered weather forecasting, with many cutting-edge models, including those developed in China by companies like Huawei, trained on its data. However, depending on a foreign system, projects may conflict with China’s national strategy. For Chinese policymakers, meteorological data is increasingly seen as strategic infrastructure rather than just scientific input. That view has become more urgent as AI models require increasingly larger and more detailed datasets. “Weather forecasting is national security,” said Andreas Prein, a professor at ETH Zurich and an expert in weather and climate modeling. “If you solely depend on external data sources, you make yourself vulnerable.” China advances in-house data in bid to boost AI forecasting ERA5 is created through climate reanalysis, a sophisticated method that combines millions of global observations into a consistent picture of past weather. Created by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the dataset is continually updated and heavily relied upon by governments, insurers, and researchers globally. Public agencies utilize ERA5 to mitigate risks from floods, droughts, and wildfires, as well as for insurers to model catastrophe exposure. The European Union calculates that the data set is delivering savings worth hundreds of millions of dollars every year, underscoring its central role in public policymaking and private markets. Now, China sees that dominance as a strategic weakness. Months earlier, the National Data Administration stated that it is Beijing’s goal for China to shift from overdependence on European and American reanalysis products. At the same time, the China Meteorological Administration also released a new global dataset (CMA-RA V1) over this period in June. 5, which it launched for a global download. The agency had said earlier that some Chinese AI weather models were now being trained on the new data. Officials also described the release as part of a broader effort to disseminate “high-value data” — information that can be used to support innovation — while also enhancing national capabilities. Global researchers test China’s reanalysis as alternatives expand Already, researchers and companies are starting to examine how the Chinese dataset works in practice. Hui Su, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, is using the data in her startup, Stellerus, to train AI models at regional scales and evaluate traditional numerical forecasts. One big plus, Su said, is the higher spatial and temporal resolution of the dataset. The smaller grid, compared to the ERA5, enables the system to produce higher-resolution data, which can be useful for both AI model training and regional investigation. This particular aspect is very useful for local prediction studies. Beyond the scope of forecasting, more readily available Chinese reanalysis data could open up global markets for weather risk hedging. Far more developed in the US and Europe, where rich data supports financial products linked to climate and weather extremes, such markets are still developing elsewhere. David Whitehead, head of weather risk management at Vaisala, a Finnish company, stated that greater access to Chinese weather data would likely attract significant interest from many companies in international markets. He added that the company has already begun analyzing how the Chinese dataset could underpin financial hedging products. China’s meteorological authority says its reanalysis is more accurate for wind speeds at 100 meters above ground level, which are of key importance to the world’s largest wind power market . However, experts caution that in the near term, the dataset is still unlikely to displace ERA5. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

XRP has faced persistent downward pressure over the last three months. Following a brief recovery to $3.10 on October 2, the token experienced a correction intensified by the October 10 market downturn and subsequent selling through December. Currently trading at $1.93, the asset is positioned to close 2025 with an annual loss of approximately 8.07%, marking its first negative yearly performance since 2022. This outcome has disappointed investors anticipating significant gains, especially given developments such as XRP ETFs and the resolution of the SEC lawsuit. Projected XRP Price Ranges for 2026 Market observers, including Zach Rector, attribute this year’s underperformance to the delayed impact of positive developments. Rector and analyst Alex Cobb both suggest that these factors could support a stronger performance for XRP in 2026. AI-assisted analysis from Google Gemini estimates that, under favorable conditions, XRP could trade between $5.80 and $8.60 during 2026. These projections consider sustained inflows from XRP ETFs, which have reportedly exceeded $1 billion. Achieving this range would require an increase of approximately 203% to 350% from current levels. Projected XRP Price Ranges for 2027 For 2027, Gemini anticipates XRP could reach between $10.00 and $12.50, assuming continued momentum from a bullish 2026 environment. From the current price, this represents a potential gain of 426% to 554%. While these figures are not guaranteed, they suggest considerable upside potential over two years compared with current market conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Value of 1,000 XRP Holdings To contextualize these projections, a 1,000 XRP investment currently valued at $1,930 could increase substantially if these price targets are met. Should the asset reach $5.80 to $8.60 in 2026, the investment could grow to $5,800 to $8,600, providing potential gains of $3,890 to $6,690. Holding through 2027, the same 1,000 XRP could be worth between $10,000 and $12,500, yielding profits of $8,090 to $10,590. Data from the XRP rich list shows that 255,877 addresses hold between 500 and 1,000 XRP, while 602,727 addresses hold between 1,000 and 5,000 tokens. This highlights the significance of mid-sized retail holdings in the market and the potential impact of price movements on a broad investor base. Despite these projections, market participants should exercise caution. There is no certainty that XRP will reach these hypothetical price ranges, and investors should not interpret these figures as financial advice.

Bitcoin Realized Cap Has Witnessed A Slowdown Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has talked about how on-chain capital inflows have been weakening for Bitcoin recently. “After about 2.5 years of growth, realized cap has stalled over the past month,” noted Young Ju. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an on-chain capitalization model for Bitcoin that calculates its total value by assuming the value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge: Longs Dominate BTC, While ETH Shorts Rise Since the last transaction of any coin is likely to represent the last instance of it changing hands, the price at that time can be considered as its current cost basis. Therefore, the Realized Cap is just a sum of the cost basis of the entire BTC supply. In other words, it tracks the capital that the investors used to purchase their tokens. Realized Cap had been enjoying growth for the last couple of years, but as the CryptoQuant founder has revealed, capital inflows have dropped off. This suggests a decline in sentiment around Bitcoin. The turnaround in sentiment is also visible through the analytics firm’s PnL Index, which incorporates key on-chain indicators to build a single valuation metric for BTC. The indicators in question are the MVRV Ratio, NUPL, and STH/LTH SOPR. The first two both deal with the amount of unrealized profit or loss held by the investors as a whole, while the latter provides a look into investor profit-taking. Below is the chart shared by Young Ju that shows the trend in the 365-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin PnL Index over the history of the asset. From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin PnL Index saw its 365-day MA reach a high earlier in the year, implying that the coin had potentially become overvalued. Since then, the metric has seen a reversal to the downside. Currently, its value is still notably positive, so the cryptocurrency may be considered to be in a bullish phase, but historically, drawdowns have tended to lead into bear markets. Though there were a couple of instances where this pattern didn’t hold. One being the aftermath of the COVID crash and the other the decline that occurred in the early months of 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Outflows Soar To $978M: Sign Of Dip Buying? So far, the indicator hasn’t shown signs of any turnaround back to the upside, although it should be noted that it’s an average over the past year, so there is some delay attached. Based on the on-chain trend, Young Ju has said, “Sentiment recovery might take a few months.” BTC Price Bitcoin has made recovery from last week’s plunge as its price is now back at $89,800.

56208600,647619,1766455222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56208600.jpeg,Tron Stablecoin Volume Exceeds XRP Activity By More Than 10 Times: Data,https://bitcoinist.com/tron-stablecoin-volume-xrp-activity-10-times-data/,"Data shows the transaction volume of USDT and USDC on Tron is now more than 10 times the transfer volume of the entire XRP network. Tron Stablecoin Volume Is Significantly Higher Than XRP Activity In a new post on X, Glassnode lead research analyst CryptoVizArt.₿ has discussed how stablecoin settlement on the Tron network compares against the transaction activity of XRP. Stablecoins are digital assets that have their value pegged to a fiat currency. The vast majority of this space is currently dominated by two tokens tied to the US dollar: USDT and USDC. These cryptocurrencies are available on several blockchains, with a major one being Tron. Below is the chart shared by CryptoVizArt.₿ that shows the trend in the 90-day simple moving average (SMA) of the combined transfer volume of USDT and USDC on the network over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, USDT and USDC have seen their Tron volume follow a rapid uptrend during the last year, suggesting that users have increasingly been using the network for stablecoin settlements. The 90-day SMA value of the metric is currently sitting at $24.2 billion. In the same chart, the analyst has also attached the data for the transfer volume of the XRP blockchain and from its graph, it’s apparent that the network’s transaction activity pales in comparison to the stablecoin settlement that occurs on Tron. More specifically, XRP observes just $2.2 billion in transfers every day, a tenth of the Tron stablecoin transactions. “This reinforces Tron’s role as a core settlement layer for stablecoin liquidity,” noted CryptoVizArt.₿. Glassnode’s official X handle has also made a post about how stablecoins compare against the major cryptocurrencies in terms of the metric. As is apparent in the above chart, USDC is currently the most dominant asset in transaction activity out of the major assets with a volume of $124 billion. Bitcoin is second at $81 billion, while USDT is third at $68 billion. Among the rest, Solana and Ethereum both beat XRP to the fourth and fifth spots with transaction volumes of $9.6 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively. BNB is just behind XRP at $1.6 billion. The top two stablecoins combined are pulling $192 billion in transaction activity every day, which is almost twice the transfer volume that the top five non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies are witnessing. “Stablecoins have become the primary liquidity rails, while native asset transfers remain comparatively subdued,” said Glassnode. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.93, down nearly 2% over the last week.",XRP|stablecoin|tron|TRON stablecoins|USDC|USDT|XRP volume|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|USDT|XRP|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-23 02:00:22

That’s precisely what happened when a solo Bitcoin miner successfully mined block 928,985 on December 22nd, earning a staggering reward of 3.128 BTC, worth approximately $281,000. This remarkable event, reported by Cointelegraph, highlights the enduring dream and immense challenge of independent Bitcoin mining. What Does It Mean to Be a Solo Bitcoin Miner? In the world of Bitcoin, most mining power is pooled together in large collectives called mining pools. These pools combine the computational power of thousands of participants to increase the chances of finding a block, sharing the rewards proportionally. A solo Bitcoin miner , however, goes it alone. They use their own hardware to compete directly against these massive pools for the right to add the next block to the blockchain and claim the entire reward for themselves. This approach is akin to an individual prospector searching for a gold nugget in a river dominated by industrial dredging companies. The odds are astronomically low, but the potential payoff is undiluted and monumental. Why Is This Solo Miner’s Success So Significant? The success of this solo Bitcoin miner is a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s foundational principles. It demonstrates that the network remains permissionless and accessible. Furthermore, it reinforces decentralization by proving that individuals, not just large corporations or pools, can still participate meaningfully in network security. Proof of Decentralization: It counters the narrative that mining is entirely centralized. Inspiration for Individuals: It keeps the dream of a solo win alive for hobbyist miners. Network Security: Every solo miner adds to the overall hash rate and security of Bitcoin. What Are the Real Challenges of Solo Mining Bitcoin? While the recent win is inspiring, the path for a solo Bitcoin miner is fraught with difficulty. The primary challenge is the sheer computational competition. The Bitcoin network’s hash rate—the total combined mining power—is phenomenally high, making the probability of a single machine finding a block incredibly slim. Other significant hurdles include: High Hardware Costs: Competitive mining requires expensive, specialized ASIC miners. Enormous Energy Consumption: These machines consume vast amounts of electricity, leading to high operational costs. Technical Expertise: Setting up and maintaining a mining rig requires technical knowledge. Volatile Rewards: Unlike pool mining, there is no steady stream of small payments; income is all or nothing. Therefore, this miner’s victory is a testament to both incredible luck and substantial perseverance. Can You Become a Successful Solo Bitcoin Miner? The story of this fortunate solo Bitcoin miner naturally sparks curiosity. Is it a viable path for newcomers? For most people, joining a reputable mining pool is the practical choice, providing more predictable, though smaller, returns. However, for those with technical skill, access to cheap electricity, and a high-risk tolerance, solo mining remains a captivating, if lottery-like, endeavor. Before starting, you must carefully calculate your potential return on investment (ROI), considering hardware depreciation and energy prices. Tools like mining profitability calculators are essential for this research. Conclusion: A Celebration of Bitcoin’s Core Ideals The story of the solo Bitcoin miner who earned 3.128 BTC is more than just a news headline about a lucky break. It is a vibrant celebration of the decentralized ethos at the heart of Bitcoin. It proves that the network’s security and reward mechanism still have room for the individual, against all odds. This event serves as a powerful symbol of possibility, reminding everyone that in the vast, competitive landscape of Bitcoin mining, fortune can still favor the brave solo participant. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How much did the solo Bitcoin miner earn? The miner earned a block reward of 3.128 BTC, which was worth approximately $281,000 at the time of the discovery. What is the difference between solo mining and pool mining? Solo mining means competing alone to solve a block and claim the full reward. Pool mining involves combining computational power with others to find blocks more frequently, sharing smaller, proportional rewards. Is solo mining profitable? For the vast majority, solo mining is not consistently profitable due to high costs and extremely low odds. It is considered a high-risk, high-reward activity similar to a lottery. What do you need to start solo mining? You need specialized ASIC mining hardware, reliable and cheap electricity, cooling solutions, technical knowledge for setup, and mining software configured for solo work. Why is a solo miner’s success important for Bitcoin? It reinforces network decentralization by proving individuals can still participate in and secure the network, upholding a key principle of Bitcoin’s design. How often do solo miners find blocks? It is a very rare event. Given the current network hash rate, a single modern miner might expect to find a block once every several hundred years on average, making each success newsworthy.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn After a volatile year that included sharp rallies, extended pullbacks, and growing institutional participation, the token is now hovering near levels that have repeatedly defined sentiment. Price action around the $1.8–$2.0 zone has become the focal point, as traders assess the long-term prospects. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP’s Technical Structure Tests Trader Conviction From a technical perspective, XRP remains under pressure despite holding above its key support level. The $1.87 level has been tested multiple times in recent weeks, with each bounce showing reduced momentum. Analysts note that repeated defenses of the same zone often weaken its reliability. A confirmed daily close below $1.6 is widely viewed as a critical downside trigger. Below that area, the chart structure offers limited historical support, opening the door to faster declines toward $1.2 or even the psychological $1.0 level. Similarly, Momentum indicators are mixed rather than decisively bearish. Short-term optimism has been fueled by a TD Sequential buy signal within the current $1.9 area, a pattern that has historically preceded relief rallies. However, XRP continues to trade below major moving averages, keeping the broader trend tilted to the downside unless resistance near $2.5 is reclaimed. Fundamentals and Institutional Signals Offer Contrast While price action remains fragile, developments around Ripple continue to shape longer-term narratives. Institutional exposure through U.S. spot XRP exchange-traded products has grown steadily, with assets under management exceeding $1 billion. Ripple’s regulatory positioning has also evolved. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has publicly dismissed claims of price manipulation, pointing to XRP’s deep liquidity and broad market participation. The company’s move to seek approval for a federally regulated national trust bank further signals a strategy focused on operating within established financial frameworks, rather than operating outside of them. Cross-Chain Speculation and Market Sentiment Speculation has added another layer of intrigue. Comments from Charles Hoskinson have reignited discussions about potential collaboration between XRP-related ecosystems and Cardano, particularly in the areas of decentralized finance and privacy-focused infrastructure. While no formal partnership has been confirmed, the dialogue reflects growing interest in interoperability beyond the XRP Ledger itself, highlighting broader discussions around XRP’s potential role within global financial infrastructure.

56210332,647820,1766458831,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56210332.jpeg,"Institutional Crypto Trading On JPMorgan’s Radar, Report Suggests",https://bitcoinist.com/institutional-crypto-trading-on-jpmorgans-radar/,"In the midst of a transforming crypto landscape in the US following the return of President Donald Trump to the White House, top Wall Street institutions are increasingly seeking to provide investors with opportunities in the digital asset market. In line with this growing trend, Bloomberg reported on Monday that JPMorgan — led by the Bitcoin-sceptical CEO, Jamie Dimon — is now considering introducing cryptocurrency trading for institutional clients. JPMorgan’s Potential Crypto Move Sources familiar with the bank’s plans revealed that JPMorgan’s markets division is evaluating potential products and services to enhance its presence in the cryptocurrency sector. Notably, this exploration could encompass both spot and derivatives trading, although concrete details remain under wraps as discussions are still in preliminary stages. The impetus for these efforts appears to be rising client interest, particularly in light of recent regulatory changes surrounding digital assets in the US. As these regulatory frameworks become more defined, JPMorgan aims to assess the demand for specific products while also evaluating the associated risks and opportunities. Bloomberg’s report underscores that while JPMorgan has maintained an active role in blockchain initiatives, a move into crypto trading would mark a significant shift. Trump’s administration has appointed regulatory officials friendly to the crypto industry in both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Furthermore, the country’s first stablecoin bill has passed under the GENIUS Act. However, the anticipated crypto market structure bill (CLARITY Act) is not expected to be passed this year, despite bipartisan negotiations, as it is scheduled for January markups. JPMorgan’s move also comes as, earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a new guidance permitting national banks to act as intermediaries in crypto transactions. Dimon’s Turnaround For JPMorgan and its CEO, which once saw the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, as a mere “pet rock,” this strategic pivot signifies a broader adaptation to the evolving investment landscape. Dimon’s recent comments suggest a more pragmatic approach. He acknowledged individuals’ rights to invest in Bitcoin, stating, “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin. Go at it,” during an investor conference held in May. JPMorgan has been proactive in exploring digital asset opportunities, including their recent facilitation of the creation, distribution, and settlement of a short-term bond for Galaxy Digital Holdings LP on the Solana (SOL) blockchain. Scott Lucas, who heads the Markets Digital Assets division at JPMorgan, expressed confidence in the growing demand for such innovation, indicating plans to expand the bank’s role in this area. “In the first half of next year, we intend to build on this momentum,” Lucas noted . Bitcoin was trading at $89,508 at the time of writing, up 1.5% over the previous 24 hours and 7 days. While trading in a limited range, BTC still has a 29% difference between current trading prices and all-time highs set earlier this year, around $126,000.

According to on-chain analytics, these Bitmain wallets withdrew a staggering 29,463 ETH, valued at approximately $88.2 million, from major exchanges. This transaction isn’t just a number on a screen; it represents a significant shift in digital asset holdings for one of the industry’s most influential players. Let’s unpack what this means. What Does the Massive Bitmain Ethereum Withdrawal Signal? The reported withdrawal from BitGo and Kraken is more than a simple transfer. Onchain data suggests Bitmain’s associated entities, often labeled BMNR, now hold an estimated 4.06 million ETH. The critical detail? Their average entry price is around $2,991. This massive Ethereum movement raises immediate questions about intent. Is this a strategic consolidation, a precursor to other actions, or simply routine treasury management? For market watchers, large movements from known entities like Bitmain often serve as a bellwether for broader sentiment. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Move? When a titan like Bitmain moves, the market often feels the ripple. Their actions can influence perceptions of asset strength and future price trajectories. Here’s why this withdrawal matters: Supply Shock Potential: Moving such a large amount of ETH off exchanges reduces the immediately sellable supply, which can impact liquidity and price stability. Long-Term Confidence: Holding assets in private wallets versus exchange custodial accounts is typically viewed as a longer-term, less speculative stance. Market Sentiment Indicator: Major players’ accumulation or distribution patterns are closely watched as signals of institutional confidence. Therefore, this isn’t just about Bitmain wallets moving funds; it’s a data point in the larger narrative of institutional Ethereum adoption and strategy. Decoding Bitmain’s Broader Ethereum Strategy Bitmain, primarily known for its Bitcoin mining hardware, has built a substantial Ethereum position. An average cost basis of $2,991 per ETH is a crucial piece of context. With current prices, this suggests their holdings are significantly profitable. This strategic accumulation could be driven by several factors: Diversification: Spreading risk beyond Bitcoin mining revenue. Staking Participation: Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model offers yield opportunities for large holders. Strategic Treasury Reserve: Holding a top-tier, liquid crypto asset as part of corporate reserves. Understanding this context helps explain why a withdrawal of this scale occurs. It’s likely a calculated decision within a larger, long-term financial plan. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights For the everyday crypto enthusiast, what can you learn from this event? First, monitor on-chain activity from major holders. Tools that track whale wallets can provide early signals. Second, consider the difference between exchange holdings and cold storage. Large withdrawals often precede reduced selling pressure. Finally, remember that entities like Bitmain operate on a different scale and timeline than retail investors. Their moves are strategic, not reactive. In summary, the movement of $88.2 million in Ethereum by suspected Bitmain wallets is a powerful reminder of the forces shaping the crypto market. It highlights the ongoing institutionalization of digital assets and the strategic depth major players employ. While not a direct trading signal, it underscores the importance of Ethereum as a core holding in the digital age and the need to watch the custodial habits of industry giants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitmain, and why is it important? Bitmain is a leading manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware. Its actions are significant because it is a major player with substantial resources, and its investment moves can influence market perception. Why would Bitmain withdraw Ethereum from exchanges? Common reasons include securing assets in more controlled private wallets for long-term holding, preparing for staking, or simply managing corporate treasury outside of third-party custodial risk. Does this large withdrawal mean the price of Ethereum will go up? Not necessarily. While reducing exchange supply can be a supportive factor, price is influenced by countless variables. This is one data point among many. How does Onchain Lens know these are Bitmain wallets? On-chain analysts use clustering techniques, tracing historical transactions, and identifying patterns linked to known entity addresses (labeled BMNR). It’s an educated presumption based on public blockchain data. What is an “average entry price”? It’s the estimated average price at which an entity purchased its holdings. Bitmain’s $2,991 average suggests it accumulated much of its ETH at lower price points. Should I follow what Bitmain does with my own investments? You can use it as one of many research tools, but blind copying is not advised. Institutional strategies, risk profiles, and timelines differ greatly from those of individual investors.

This is the ambitious vision driving Kakao, South Korea’s internet giant, as it announces plans to build a comprehensive KRW stablecoin ecosystem . With a strategy centered on a new ‘super wallet’ via Kakao Pay, the company is positioning itself at the forefront of a financial transformation. But what does this mean for everyday users and the broader crypto market? Let’s dive in. What is Kakao’s Plan for a KRW Stablecoin Ecosystem? Kakao isn’t just dipping its toes in the water; it’s preparing for a full-scale dive into digital finance. The company plans to develop a KRW stablecoin ecosystem that integrates deeply with its existing Kakao Pay service, which boasts millions of users. According to Financial News, CEO Shin Won-keun revealed this strategy at a symposium focused on transforming South Korean finance with a won-denominated stablecoin. The core idea is to create a seamless value chain where the Korean Won is digitized, making transactions faster, cheaper, and more accessible. However, Kakao is playing a strategic waiting game. The company has stated it will build initial use cases and infrastructure only after the necessary legal and institutional frameworks are established by South Korean regulators. This cautious approach demonstrates a commitment to compliance and long-term stability, which is crucial for building trust in a new KRW stablecoin ecosystem . Why is a “Super Wallet” the Key to This Strategy? Think of the proposed ‘super wallet’ as the command center for Kakao’s financial universe. It won’t just hold the new KRW stablecoin. Instead, Kakao Pay’s super wallet aims to be an all-in-one platform. This move is strategic for several reasons: User Convenience: It leverages Kakao’s massive, engaged user base who are already familiar with its apps for messaging, ride-hailing, and payments. Network Effect: Integrating a stablecoin into daily life through a trusted app can drive rapid adoption, much faster than launching a standalone crypto wallet. Financial Hub: The wallet could eventually manage various assets, from loyalty points and traditional bank funds to other cryptocurrencies, all anchored by the reliable KRW stablecoin. Therefore, the super wallet is less about a new product and more about creating a familiar gateway into the new KRW stablecoin ecosystem . What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges Ahead? Kakao’s vision promises significant advantages. For users, a well-integrated KRW stablecoin ecosystem means instant, low-cost remittances and a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. For South Korea, it could modernize the financial infrastructure and strengthen the won’s presence in the global digital economy. Nevertheless, the path is not without hurdles. The primary challenge is regulatory clarity. South Korea’s government is still crafting detailed rules for stablecoins and crypto assets. Kakao’s success hinges on these policies being favorable and clearly defined. Furthermore, the company must ensure robust security and convince a sometimes skeptical public of the safety of holding digital currency in a super wallet. How Could This Reshape Finance in South Korea and Beyond? If successful, Kakao’s project could be a game-changer. Domestically, it could set the standard for how major tech firms integrate blockchain technology, pushing competitors to innovate. Internationally, a reputable, large-scale KRW stablecoin ecosystem backed by a company like Kakao could make the Korean Won a more prominent currency in cross-border trade and finance, especially within Asia. This initiative is more than a tech upgrade; it’s a strategic move to future-proof Kakao’s business and influence. By building the rails for digital won transactions, Kakao positions itself not just as a service provider, but as a fundamental pillar of South Korea’s next-generation economy. Conclusion: A Cautious Step Toward a Digital Financial Future Kakao’s announcement to build a KRW stablecoin ecosystem with a super wallet is a landmark moment. It signals a major corporation’s serious commitment to merging traditional finance with blockchain innovation. While the timeline depends on regulators, the direction is clear. Kakao is laying the groundwork to make digital won transactions a simple, everyday reality for millions, potentially reshaping the financial landscape in South Korea and inspiring similar movements worldwide. The journey has just begun, but the destination could redefine convenience and efficiency in our digital lives. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a KRW stablecoin? A: A KRW stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won (KRW). It combines the stability of traditional currency with the digital, programmable benefits of blockchain technology. Q2: When will Kakao’s super wallet and stablecoin launch? A: Kakao has not announced a specific launch date. The company has stated it will develop the ecosystem once the necessary legal and institutional frameworks are established by South Korean authorities. Q3: How is this different from Kakao Pay’s current service? A: Currently, Kakao Pay facilitates transactions using traditional won in bank accounts. The new system would involve a digital version of the won (a stablecoin) on a blockchain, enabling faster settlement, new programmable features, and deeper integration with other crypto assets. Q4: Will this affect the value of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? A: Not directly. A KRW stablecoin is designed to be stable, not speculative. However, by providing a safe, easy on-ramp, it could increase overall cryptocurrency adoption and activity in South Korea, which may indirectly influence the broader market. Q5: Is my money safe in a Kakao super wallet? A: Safety will be Kakao’s top priority. The company will need to implement enterprise-grade security measures, likely including insurance and rigorous compliance, similar to traditional finance. However, as with any digital asset, users should educate themselves on best security practices. Q6: Can people outside South Korea use this? A: The initial focus is domestic, but Kakao mentioned international expansion as part of its strategy. Global accessibility will depend on cross-border regulations and Kakao’s licensing in other jurisdictions. Share This Insight! Did you find this deep dive into Kakao’s financial future enlightening?

Recent data reveals a startling trend: the cryptocurrency trading volume on the nation’s two largest exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb, nosedived by approximately 60% in December. This dramatic slump signals a potential year-end cool-down and raises critical questions about market sentiment. Let’s unpack the numbers and explore what’s behind this significant pullback. What Does the Cryptocurrency Trading Volume Data Show? According to a Bizwatch report, the figures from December 1st to 22nd paint a clear picture of declining activity. The total cryptocurrency trading volume across both platforms fell sharply compared to November. Specifically, Upbit’s volume for the period was $25.91 billion. This represents a staggering 60.6% decrease from November’s $65.86 billion. Similarly, Bithumb saw its volume drop 60.4% to $12.45 billion from $31.49 billion. This synchronized decline points to a broader market phenomenon rather than an issue isolated to a single exchange. Why Did Trading Volume Crash in December? Several factors likely contributed to this steep decline in cryptocurrency trading volume . First, the broader crypto market has been relatively sluggish, lacking the major bullish catalysts seen earlier in the year. Second, the year-end period often sees reduced trading activity as institutions close their books and retail investors take holidays. Furthermore, increased regulatory scrutiny in South Korea may have prompted a more cautious approach from traders. The combination of these elements created a perfect storm for reduced liquidity and participation. Is This a Cause for Alarm for Crypto Investors? While a 60% drop sounds alarming, context is crucial. Market cycles are inherent to cryptocurrency. Periods of high volatility and volume are often followed by consolidation. This decline in cryptocurrency trading volume could indicate a market catching its breath. However, it also highlights the importance of understanding exchange-specific liquidity, especially during quieter periods when large trades can have a more pronounced impact on prices. Key Takeaways from the Market Slowdown This event offers valuable insights for anyone involved in crypto. Here are the main points to consider: Market Cycles are Real: Dramatic swings in cryptocurrency trading volume are a standard feature, not a bug, of the digital asset space. Liquidity Matters: Trading on major exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb is generally safer, but even their liquidity can thin out, affecting trade execution. External Factors Play a Role: Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and seasonal trends all influence trader behavior and volume. Patience is a Strategy: For long-term investors, low-volume periods can be times for research and strategic planning rather than panic. What’s Next for South Korea’s Crypto Market? The sharp contraction in December’s cryptocurrency trading volume serves as a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. However, South Korea remains a crucial hub for digital asset innovation and adoption. The focus may now shift to how the market responds in the new year. Will January bring a resurgence of activity, or is this the beginning of a longer consolidation phase? Monitoring volume trends will be key to gauging the market’s next move. In conclusion, the 60% plunge in trading volume on Upbit and Bithumb is a significant market signal. It reflects a combination of seasonal trends, broader market sentiment, and perhaps investor caution. For the astute observer, this isn’t just a story of decline but a lesson in market dynamics and a checkpoint before the next potential phase of the crypto journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does a drop in trading volume mean cryptocurrency prices will fall? A: Not necessarily. While low volume can sometimes lead to increased price volatility, it doesn’t automatically dictate a downward trend. It often signifies a period of indecision or consolidation before the next major price move. Q2: Is it safe to trade on Upbit and Bithumb during low-volume periods? A: Yes, they remain reputable, regulated exchanges. However, traders should be aware that with lower liquidity, their market orders might get filled at less favorable prices, and price slippage could be higher. Q3: Could this volume drop be specific to South Korea? A> The data is from South Korean exchanges, but similar volume contractions are often observed globally during holiday periods and market lulls, suggesting a correlated trend. Q4: What should I do as an investor during low market volume? A> It can be a good time to conduct research, dollar-cost average into positions cautiously, and set strategic limit orders. Avoid making large, impulsive trades based on thin market activity. Q5: Will trading volume recover in January? A> Historically, cryptocurrency trading volume often picks up after the new year as participants return to the market. However, recovery depends on broader market catalysts and global economic conditions. Q6: Are other major global exchanges seeing similar volume declines? A> While this article focuses on South Korean data, many global exchanges typically experience reduced activity in late December due to holidays, though the magnitude can vary.

An anonymous investor, known as a ‘whale,’ has moved a colossal 16.85 million ENA tokens to Coinbase, reportedly facing a devastating loss. This ENA whale deposit highlights the extreme volatility and high-stakes nature of cryptocurrency investing. Let’s dive into the on-chain data to understand what happened and what it might mean. What Does This Massive ENA Whale Deposit Reveal? According to on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, the address starting with 0x72F executed this significant transfer seven hours ago. The move is widely interpreted as a precursor to selling. The sheer scale of this ENA whale deposit is enough to capture market attention, but the story behind it is even more compelling. On-chain analysis provides a transparent ledger, allowing us to trace the whale’s initial investment and the painful outcome. Breaking Down the Multi-Million Dollar Loss The financial details of this move are stark. The investor originally purchased the ENA tokens in December 2024. Here is a quick breakdown of the numbers: Purchase Price: Average of $1.099 per token Total Investment: Approximately $18.52 million Deposit Price: $0.2079 per token Estimated Loss: A staggering $15.02 million Percentage Decline: Roughly 82% on the original capital This transaction is a sobering reminder of the risks involved. The decision to deposit such a large sum to an exchange like Coinbase typically signals an intent to sell, often to cut losses or reallocate funds. Why Would a Whale Sell at Such a Loss? Understanding the ‘why’ behind a major ENA whale deposit is crucial. Several factors could drive this decision. The investor may be seeking tax-loss harvesting, where realized losses can offset capital gains. Alternatively, they might need liquidity or have lost confidence in ENA’s short-term recovery prospects. Sometimes, large holders exit positions to prevent further losses during a sustained downtrend, a strategy known as ‘stop-loss’ on a grand scale. What Are the Broader Market Implications? While one transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, large ENA whale deposit events can influence sentiment. A sell-off of this size could create temporary selling pressure on the ENA price. However, it can also be seen as a potential capitulation event, where weak hands exit, sometimes paving the way for price stabilization. For other investors, it’s a case study in risk management and the importance of having a clear exit strategy. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors This event offers valuable lessons for everyone in the crypto space, not just whales. Volatility is Real: Even large, presumably sophisticated investors face monumental losses. On-Chain Data is Powerful: Tools and analysts make these moves transparent, offering learning opportunities. Risk Management is Paramount: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider diversification. Emotion Drives Markets: Fear of further loss can trigger significant sell-offs. In conclusion, the recent ENA whale deposit to Coinbase is a stark narrative of risk and reward in the digital asset world. It underscores the market’s unforgiving nature while providing a transparent look at high-stakes decision-making. For the broader community, it serves as a powerful reminder to conduct thorough research, manage positions carefully, and maintain a long-term perspective amidst short-term turbulence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A: A ‘whale’ is a term for an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency to potentially influence its market price through significant trades. Q2: Why is depositing to Coinbase seen as a sell signal? A: Coinbase is a centralized exchange primarily used for trading. Large deposits from private wallets to exchanges are often the first step to converting crypto into cash or other assets, indicating a likely intent to sell. Q3: What is an on-chain analyst? A: An on-chain analyst examines data recorded on a blockchain (like transaction histories and wallet balances) to derive insights into market trends, investor behavior, and network activity. Q4: What does ‘tax-loss harvesting’ mean? A: It’s an investment strategy where you sell an asset at a loss to reduce your taxable capital gains from other investments, thereby lowering your overall tax liability. Q5: Can a single whale crash the price of a token like ENA? A: While a single large sell order can cause immediate price slippage and negative sentiment, causing a sustained ‘crash’ typically requires broader market conditions. However, whales can significantly impact liquidity and price discovery. Q6: Where can I track whale movements? A: Several blockchain analytics platforms (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens) and dedicated services (e.g., Nansen, Lookonchain) track and report on large wallet movements.

A broad MSCI gauge of Asia Pacific shares rose about 0.31% as the mood carried over from Wall Street, where late-week buying revived talk of a year-end rally. Crypto moved in step with that calmer tone rather than leading it, with Bitcoin trading around $88,680, up about 0.4% on the day, based on CoinGecko data. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $88,006, down 0.6% Ether : $2,987, down 0.8% XRP : $1.89, down 1.6% Total crypto market cap: $3.06 trillion, down 0.9% Slow Disinflation Keeps Fed On Hold Linh Tran, a market analyst at XS.com, said the policy stance of the US Federal Reserve still sets the short to medium-term rhythm for Bitcoin. “Although US inflation has eased from its peak (with CPI y/y at 2.7% released last week), recent data indicate that the disinflation process is progressing slowly and unevenly,” she said. “This has forced the Fed to maintain a cautious stance, making it difficult to pivot quickly toward an aggressive easing cycle.” She added that exchange reserves remain relatively low, a sign many holders still prefer to sit tight, though short-term moves keep tracking liquidity and sentiment. Metals Break Records On Safe Haven Demand Equities drew support from heavyweight tech names and a broader bid for risk, with Reuters pointing to gains in stocks such as Nvidia during the US session and firmer index futures in Asia. Macro traders also looked ahead to US third-quarter GDP data, which markets expected to show annualized growth around 3.3%, after some releases faced disruption from a recent government shutdown. In commodities, gold pushed through $4,400 an ounce and silver hit new peaks, as traders priced in a friendlier rate path and reached for hedges into the holidays. Geopolitics added fuel, with reports around President Donald Trump’s Venezuela pressure campaign and US interdictions of tankers tightening the backdrop for energy and safe-haven trades.

This surge isn’t just a number—it’s a powerful signal reshaping the precious metals landscape. For investors and market watchers, understanding the forces behind this rally is crucial. What’s propelling this metal to such dizzying heights, and is this momentum sustainable? What’s Driving the Record Surge in Spot Silver? The price of spot silver isn’t moving in a vacuum. Several powerful economic currents are converging to create this perfect storm. Primarily, investors are seeking a reliable hedge against persistent global inflation. When currency values are uncertain, tangible assets like silver become a sanctuary. Moreover, industrial demand is a silent powerhouse. Silver is a critical component in solar panels, electric vehicles, and countless electronics. The global push for green technology is creating a structural, long-term demand that supports higher price floors. Therefore, the current price reflects both its monetary and industrial value. How Significant is the Move Toward $70? Breaching the $70 barrier is a monumental psychological and technical achievement. For years, this level seemed like a distant target. Now, with spot silver trading firmly at $69.75, it’s within immediate reach. This breakthrough shatters previous resistance levels and can attract a new wave of institutional investment. Key factors in this surge include: Geopolitical Tensions: Global instability drives safe-haven buying. Weakening Dollar: A softer U.S. dollar makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for foreign buyers. Supply Constraints: Mining challenges can limit new supply, tightening the market. What Are the Challenges for Silver Investors? While the rally is exhilarating, savvy investors know that volatility is the constant companion of commodity markets. The price of spot silver can experience sharp corrections. Furthermore, rising interest rates can increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like precious metals. Another consideration is market sentiment. A sudden shift in economic data or central bank policy can trigger profit-taking. However, the fundamental drivers—industrial demand and its role as a store of value—provide a sturdy foundation that may cushion against extreme downturns. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Silver Market So, what should you do in this dynamic environment? First, avoid emotional, reactionary trading. Instead, consider a disciplined approach. Dollar-cost averaging into a position can mitigate timing risk. Also, think about the different ways to gain exposure to spot silver prices. You have several options: Physical Bullion: Coins and bars offer direct ownership. ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds): Provide liquidity and ease of trading. Mining Stocks: Offer leveraged exposure to price moves but carry company-specific risks. Diversification across these methods can balance risk and reward effectively. A Compelling Summary of the Silver Surge The record-breaking ascent of spot silver is a landmark event with deep roots in macroeconomic trends. It highlights the metal’s dual identity as both a financial safe haven and an industrial necessity. While the path forward may include volatility, the underlying fundamentals appear robust. This rally underscores the importance of including tangible assets in a well-rounded investment strategy for the modern era. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is spot silver? Spot silver refers to the current market price for immediate delivery and payment of physical silver, as opposed to futures contracts for delivery at a later date. Why is silver price rising so fast? The price is rising due to a combination of high inflation (promoting safe-haven buying), strong industrial demand from green technologies, geopolitical uncertainty, and a relatively softer U.S. dollar. Is it too late to invest in silver? While prices are at record highs, many analysts believe the long-term fundamentals remain strong. A strategic, long-term approach with careful position sizing is generally advised over trying to time the market peak. What is the difference between silver and spot silver? “Silver” is the general commodity. “Spot silver” specifically denotes the live, real-time price for buying or selling silver for immediate settlement. Can the price of silver go back down? Yes, commodity prices are inherently volatile. Corrections are normal and can be triggered by shifts in monetary policy, improved economic data, or changes in investor sentiment. How can I track the spot silver price? You can track it on major financial news websites, commodity trading platforms, and through charts provided by brokerage firms that offer precious metals trading.

This regulatory green light from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) solidifies Upbit’s position and assures millions of users of its commitment to secure, compliant operations. Let’s explore what this VASP license renewal means for the market and your digital assets. Why is the VASP License So Critical for Upbit? The VASP license is not just a piece of paper; it’s the cornerstone of legal cryptocurrency exchange operation in South Korea. Think of it as a rigorous seal of approval from the nation’s financial watchdogs. It mandates strict anti-money laundering (AML) protocols, know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, and robust security frameworks. Therefore, this renewal is a powerful signal of stability. It confirms that Upbit continues to meet the high standards required to protect user funds and data, which is essential for maintaining trust in a volatile market. What Does This Renewal Process Tell Us? The journey to renew this VASP license was a meticulous one. Dunamu submitted its application in August 2024, as its previous license neared expiration. The approval arrived approximately one year and four months later. This timeline highlights the thoroughness of the FIU’s review process. Regulators leave no stone unturned when assessing an exchange’s operational integrity. For users, this lengthy vetting period, resulting in a positive outcome, should be incredibly reassuring. It demonstrates that Upbit’s systems and compliance measures withstand intense regulatory scrutiny. Key Benefits of a Licensed Exchange Like Upbit Choosing a platform with a valid VASP license offers tangible advantages for any trader or investor. Here are the core benefits: Enhanced Security: Licensed exchanges must implement top-tier cybersecurity measures to safeguard your cryptocurrency. Legal Protection: Your activities are conducted on a platform recognized and monitored by financial authorities. Market Confidence: Regulatory compliance attracts more institutional and retail users, boosting liquidity and market health. Future-Proofing: It ensures the exchange can operate without legal interruptions, providing long-term service reliability. Navigating the Challenges of Crypto Regulation While the renewal is a triumph, it underscores the ongoing challenge exchanges face: evolving regulations. South Korea has established itself as a leader in creating a structured crypto framework. However, staying compliant requires constant adaptation and significant investment. For Dunamu and Upbit, maintaining this VASP license means committing to an ongoing cycle of audits, reporting, and system upgrades. This environment, while demanding, ultimately weeds out bad actors and creates a safer ecosystem for everyone involved. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users This news provides a clear lesson for all cryptocurrency participants. Always prioritize platforms that are transparent about their regulatory status. Before depositing funds, verify an exchange’s licensing credentials in your jurisdiction. A valid VASP license or its local equivalent is one of the strongest indicators of a legitimate and secure operation. Your due diligence is your first line of defense. Conclusion: A Milestone for Trust and Stability Dunamu’s successful renewal of its VASP license is a pivotal moment. It reinforces Upbit’s role as a cornerstone of South Korea’s digital asset economy. More importantly, it reaffirms the critical importance of regulation in building a sustainable and secure cryptocurrency future. For users, it’s a reminder that in the world of digital finance, the most valuable currencies are trust and compliance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a VASP license? A Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license is a regulatory approval granted by financial authorities, like South Korea’s FIU. It allows a company to legally offer services like cryptocurrency exchange and custody, contingent on meeting strict anti-money laundering and security standards. Why did it take so long to renew Upbit’s license? The 16-month review period reflects the depth of the regulatory audit. Authorities thoroughly examine an exchange’s financial practices, security infrastructure, and compliance programs before granting renewal, ensuring ongoing adherence to the law. What happens if an exchange loses its VASP license? An exchange operating without a valid license would be subject to shutdown orders and severe penalties. It would be illegal for them to continue serving customers, potentially leading to fund freezes and loss of user access. Does this license renewal affect Upbit’s services or fees? The renewal itself is unlikely to directly change services or fees. Its primary impact is on operational continuity and user assurance. However, the costs of maintaining compliance can be a factor in an exchange’s overall business model. How can I check if my crypto exchange is properly licensed? You should visit the exchange’s official website and look for a “Compliance” or “Legal” section. Reputable platforms openly display their regulatory licenses and registration numbers. You can also cross-reference this with official lists published by financial regulators in your country. Found this breakdown of the crucial VASP license renewal helpful?

The outcome of these talks will likely shape: The operational future of the Chivo wallet and other state BTC initiatives. International investor confidence in the country’s financial management. Global regulatory perspectives on national cryptocurrency adoption. Successfully mitigating these Bitcoin risks could solidify El Salvador’s position as a forward-thinking financial hub, while failure could lead to significant economic pressures.

They highlight the growing pains of integrating decentralized digital assets into a national economy.

The past 24 hours delivered a stark reminder of its inherent volatility, with a staggering wave of crypto futures liquidations sweeping across major digital assets. When prices move sharply, over-leveraged positions get forcibly closed, or ‘liquidated,’ by exchanges. This process can amplify price swings and offers a clear window into trader sentiment and market stress. Let’s break down what this recent flurry of activity means for you. What Do Recent Crypto Futures Liquidations Reveal? The data from the last day paints a compelling picture. A total of over $144 million in leveraged positions was wiped out. Interestingly, the majority of these liquidations were long positions—bets that prices would rise. This indicates that a sudden downward price move caught many optimistic traders off guard. Here is a snapshot of the damage: Bitcoin (BTC): $84.34 million liquidated, with 63.13% being long positions. Ethereum (ETH): $54.01 million liquidated, with 61.52% being long positions. Solana (SOL): $5.8 million liquidated, with a significant 68.05% being long positions. This pattern suggests a coordinated sell-off or negative news event triggered a cascade, primarily hurting those betting on continued growth. Understanding these crypto futures liquidations is crucial because they are not just results but also catalysts for further market movement. Why Should Every Trader Understand Liquidations? Think of the liquidation engine as the market’s built-in risk manager. When you use high leverage, you amplify both potential gains and losses. If your position’s value falls too close to your initial collateral, the exchange automatically closes it to prevent negative balances. This mechanism protects the exchange but creates a domino effect. A large cluster of crypto futures liquidations can lead to a ‘liquidation cascade,’ where forced selling drives prices down further, triggering even more liquidations. Therefore, monitoring liquidation levels helps you gauge market leverage and potential volatility hotspots. High liquidation volumes often signal a local top or bottom, as extreme leverage gets flushed from the system. For the savvy observer, this data is a powerful sentiment indicator, showing whether the crowd is overly greedy or fearful. How Can You Navigate a High-Liquidation Environment? Seeing millions vanish in hours can be intimidating. However, you can use this knowledge to your advantage. First, consider reducing leverage during periods of expected high volatility, such as major economic announcements. Second, use stop-loss orders diligently to manage your risk proactively, rather than relying on the exchange’s liquidation price. Third, view large-scale crypto futures liquidations as a potential contrarian signal. After a long squeeze, the market might be primed for a rebound once the weak hands are cleared out. Remember, the goal isn’t to avoid volatility but to understand and respect it. The data shows that even leading assets like BTC and ETH are not immune to these violent resets. By keeping an eye on liquidation heatmaps and total volumes, you position yourself not as a passive victim of market forces, but as an informed participant. Conclusion: Reading the Market’s Stress Signals In conclusion, the recent $144 million in crypto futures liquidations serves as a critical lesson in risk management. It highlights the dangers of excessive leverage during uncertain times and underscores the importance of understanding market mechanics. While these events can be brutal, they also create opportunities for those with prepared strategies and cool heads. By learning to interpret these stress signals, you can make more calculated decisions and better protect your capital in the unpredictable world of crypto trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto futures liquidations? Crypto futures liquidations occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because it has lost too much value and can no longer cover the potential loss. This happens to prevent the trader’s account from going into negative balance. Why were most of the recent liquidations long positions? The data shows a majority were long positions because the market likely experienced a sharp price drop. Traders who had borrowed funds to bet on higher prices (going long) saw their positions quickly fall in value, triggering automatic liquidations. Can liquidations make the price drop further? Yes. This is called a liquidation cascade. When many long positions are liquidated, the exchange sells the underlying asset to close the positions. This wave of selling can push prices down further, potentially triggering even more liquidations. How can I avoid getting liquidated? To avoid liquidation, use lower leverage, maintain sufficient collateral (margin) in your account, and employ prudent risk management tools like stop-loss orders. Always be aware of market conditions and volatility. Where can I track crypto futures liquidation data? Several cryptocurrency analytics websites and trading platforms provide real-time and historical liquidation data for major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, often presented in easy-to-read charts and heatmaps.

Therefore, it enhances liquidity and provides a more straightforward on-ramp for capital entering the Theoriq ecosystem. Understanding Theoriq (THQ) and Its Market Position Theoriq represents a project focused on decentralized AI and data economies. Its token, THQ, facilitates operations within its network.

International users should check Bithumb’s specific terms of service. Q3: What is Theoriq (THQ)? A3: Theoriq is a blockchain project focused on creating a decentralized network for AI and data economies. The THQ token is used to power transactions and operations within this ecosystem. Q4: Why is a direct KRW listing important? A4: A direct KRW listing allows South Korean investors to purchase THQ directly with their national currency without first buying Bitcoin or Ethereum. This reduces complexity, time, and transaction costs. Q5: Does this listing mean THQ is officially approved by Korean regulators? A5: Not exactly. While Bithumb is a regulated exchange and conducts its own due diligence, a listing does not constitute a regulatory endorsement of the token itself. It means Bithumb has deemed it compliant enough to offer on its platform. Q6: How might this affect THQ’s price? A6: Exchange listings often increase buying pressure and visibility, which can positively impact price. However, markets are unpredictable, and prices can also fall due to profit-taking after the announcement. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Data reveals a net outflow of over $142 million in a single day, marking a concerning pattern. However, one giant stood firm against the tide: BlackRock. This divergence raises critical questions about investor sentiment and the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency funds. What Do the Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflow Numbers Reveal? According to data compiled by Trader T, December 22nd was the third straight day of net withdrawals for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. The total net outflow reached $142.09 million, signaling a potential shift in short-term investor behavior. This activity provides a real-time pulse check on institutional and retail confidence in Bitcoin through the regulated ETF vehicle. The outflows were not isolated to one fund. Instead, they were spread across several major issuers: Bitwise BITB: $34.96 million outflow VanEck HODL: $33.64 million outflow Grayscale GBTC: $28.99 million outflow Grayscale Mini BTC: $25.40 million outflow Ark Invest ARKB: $21.36 million outflow Why Was BlackRock’s IBIT the Lone Gainer? Amidst the sea of red, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) emerged as the sole spot Bitcoin ETF to record a net inflow, attracting $6.1 million. This resilience is noteworthy. BlackRock’s immense brand reputation, deep investor relationships, and perceived stability likely acted as a magnet for capital seeking a safe harbor within the volatile crypto ETF space. It suggests a flight to quality, where investors are consolidating their holdings with the largest and most trusted asset manager. Is This a Temporary Setback or a New Trend for Bitcoin ETFs? Three consecutive days of outflows warrant attention, but context is crucial. Potential reasons for the withdrawals could include: Profit-taking: Investors locking in gains after a price rally. Portfolio rebalancing: Year-end adjustments by institutional funds. Market volatility: Reaction to broader economic uncertainty or Bitcoin price fluctuations. However, the sustained interest in BlackRock’s fund indicates that the spot Bitcoin ETF story is far from over. It highlights a maturation process where investors are becoming more selective, differentiating between providers based on trust and track record rather than treating all funds equally. What Should Investors Watch Next? For anyone involved with spot Bitcoin ETFs, the coming weeks are key. Monitor whether the outflow trend reverses or continues. More importantly, watch the flow data for BlackRock’s IBIT. Can it maintain its inflow streak? The answer will signal whether this is a broad-based retreat from Bitcoin exposure or a strategic reshuffling towards perceived market leaders. Furthermore, keep an eye on Bitcoin’s price action. Significant movements often directly influence ETF flow dynamics, as these products are designed to track the underlying asset’s performance. Conclusion: A Tale of Two Sentiments The recent data paints a clear picture of divergence. While the broader spot Bitcoin ETF category faced notable headwinds, BlackRock demonstrated remarkable resilience. This episode underscores a critical lesson for the crypto market: in times of uncertainty, institutional trust and brand power become paramount. The journey for spot Bitcoin ETFs is evolving from mere adoption to discernment, where quality and credibility increasingly dictate capital flows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a ‘net outflow’ mean for a spot Bitcoin ETF? A: A net outflow means more money was withdrawn from the ETF by shareholders than was invested into it on that day. It reduces the fund’s total assets under management (AUM). Q: Why is Grayscale’s GBTC often mentioned in outflow data? A> Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) converted from a closed-end fund to an ETF, and it started with a very large asset base. Some outflows were expected as investors who were previously locked in took the opportunity to exit or move to cheaper competitors. Q: Are spot Bitcoin ETF outflows bad for Bitcoin’s price? A: They can create selling pressure. ETFs must sell Bitcoin to meet redemptions during outflows, which can push the price down. However, many other factors also influence Bitcoin’s price. Q: Should I be worried about investing in spot Bitcoin ETFs? A> Short-term flow data is one metric. Consider your long-term investment strategy, risk tolerance, and the track record of the ETF provider. Volatility is inherent to crypto-related assets. Q: How can I track spot Bitcoin ETF flows myself? A> Data is published daily by sources like Farside Investors and various crypto analytics platforms. Financial news websites also regularly report on these figures. Q: Does BlackRock’s inflow mean its ETF is the best? A> Not necessarily “best” for everyone, but the inflows indicate strong investor confidence in BlackRock specifically. Factors like expense ratio and personal investment goals should also be considered. Found this analysis of spot Bitcoin ETF flows insightful?

This crucial development, reported by Trader T, decisively ends a concerning seven-day streak of net outflows. For investors tracking the pulse of institutional cryptocurrency adoption, this single day’s activity for ETH ETFs signals a potential shift in sentiment and capital flow. What Drove the Massive ETH ETFs Inflow? The data reveals a clear leader in this turnaround. Grayscale’s flagship Ethereum Trust (ETHE) spearheaded the inflows, attracting a substantial $53.7 million. Following closely was Grayscale’s Mini ETH product, which contributed $30.89 million to the total. Interestingly, the other spot Ethereum ETFs in the market saw no net inflows or outflows on this day, highlighting a focused capital movement. This concentration suggests that specific fund structures or perceived value propositions are driving investor decisions within the ETH ETFs space. Why Does This Reversal Matter for Ethereum Investors? Ending a week-long outflow streak is more than just a statistical blip. It represents a potential renewal of institutional confidence. Consistent outflows can pressure the underlying asset, Ethereum, while inflows provide direct buying support. This single-day surge for ETH ETFs could indicate that larger investors see current price levels as an attractive entry point. Moreover, it demonstrates the growing maturity of Ethereum-based investment vehicles, which are becoming a critical barometer for mainstream crypto sentiment. Key immediate benefits of this inflow include: Price Support: New capital entering ETH ETFs requires custodians to purchase the underlying ETH, creating buy-side pressure. Sentiment Shift: It breaks a negative narrative, potentially encouraging other hesitant investors to follow suit. Validation: It validates the product’s utility as a tool for regulated Ethereum exposure. What Challenges and Insights Can We Derive? However, it’s essential to view this within a broader context. One day of positive flow does not automatically establish a long-term trend. The fact that other ETH ETFs saw zero activity suggests the market is still discerning between providers. The challenge for the ecosystem is to convert these sporadic inflows into consistent, sustained demand. For actionable insights, investors should monitor whether this inflow marks the beginning of a new trend or remains an isolated event. Watching Grayscale’s products, in particular, will be crucial, as they appear to be the primary liquidity conduits for institutional Ethereum investment at this stage. Conclusion: A Beacon of Hope for ETH ETFs The $84.59 million net inflow serves as a powerful beacon of hope, breaking a persistent negative cycle. It underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency investment landscape, where sentiment can pivot rapidly based on market conditions and perceived value. While cautious optimism is warranted, this event reaffirms the critical role ETH ETFs play in bridging traditional finance with the digital asset world. The coming days will be telling, revealing whether this is a fleeting moment or the start of a renewed accumulation phase for Ethereum through its exchange-traded funds. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly are spot ETH ETFs? A: Spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH). They track the live price of the cryptocurrency, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly buying, storing, or managing the digital asset themselves. Q: Why did Grayscale’s ETHE see the largest inflow? A: Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) is one of the longest-standing and most well-known vehicles for institutional Ethereum exposure. Its size, liquidity, and brand recognition likely make it the first choice for many large investors moving capital. Q: Does a net inflow guarantee the price of Ethereum will rise? A: Not directly or immediately. While inflows create buying pressure for the underlying ETH, the overall price is influenced by many factors, including broader market sentiment, Bitcoin’s movement, and macroeconomic conditions. Q: What ended the 7-day outflow streak? A: The specific catalyst isn’t always clear, but it often relates to investors perceiving better value or a positive shift in the market outlook for Ethereum, prompting them to allocate capital through these regulated ETF products. Q: Should I invest in ETH ETFs based on this news? A: This news is a significant data point but should not be your sole reason for investing. Always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and understand that cryptocurrency investments are volatile. Consider it a sign of changing institutional sentiment. Q: Where can I find ongoing data on ETH ETF flows? A: Data is often reported by industry analysts like Trader T and can be tracked through various crypto analytics platforms and financial news websites that cover digital assets.

With downside liquidity still thin and support holding firm, the market appears primed for a move that draws in eager bulls rather than rewarding them. This rally could be less about recovery and more about setting the stage for maximum pain when sentiment flips. Aligning The Mid- And Long-Term Bitcoin Outlook During an in-depth technical and psychological analysis, Mr. Wall Street explained that his broader outlook on Bitcoin had already been clarified a week earlier, after some confusion around his mid and long-term stance. With those time horizons now clearly defined, he turned his focus to the short-term picture, outlining current market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Standby Mode: Weekend Ranges Rule Before Holiday ‘Chop’ He reiterated that while his mid-term bias on Bitcoin remains bearish, the short-term structure has turned bullish. The reason centered on insufficient downside liquidity to justify market makers initiating the next major leg lower. This imbalance supported the case for a temporary relief move to the upside. Thus, Mr. Wall Street placed long positions around the Value Area Low between $80,000 and $84,000 on a bounce that could later evolve into a bull trap. Shortly after, Bitcoin dipped and successfully retested the $84,000 level, which aligns with the weekly MA100, following several deceptive upside moves. As a result, his long orders were filled as planned, leaving him holding a position from $84,550. The analyst noted that he plans to exit only in the $98,000–$104,000 zone, where a Fair Value Gap converges with heavy liquidity, making it an ideal area to take profit. Being In Longs Doesn’t Change The Macro Bearish Thesis Mr. Wall Street clarified that holding long positions does not signal a bullish shift on Bitcoin. The broader outlook remains bearish, with expectations for the next major downside move toward the $64,000–$70,000 region. In the short term, Bitcoin is sitting at strong support while downside liquidity is limited, which reduces the probability of an immediate continuation lower. Related Reading: Citi Analysts Project Bitcoin Price Could Reach $189,000 Next Year In Bullish Scenario A more logical scenario involves market makers engineering a bullish move to attract retail participation. As late buyers enter long positions, they gradually become exit liquidity, setting the stage for a larger downside move once sufficient liquidity is built. He also mentioned the $68,000–$74,000 zone had become too widely anticipated to function as a true “maximum pain” area capable of resetting market structure. For that reason, the downside target was revised lower to the $64,000–$70,000 range, with expectations that this zone could be reached in late Q1 or early Q2 of 2026. This level represents an initial major target rather than the final bottom. Recent price action was highlighted as a clear example of these dynamics. Bitcoin’s rapid move from $87,000 to $90,000, followed by a sharp drop to $85,000 within hours, resulted in widespread liquidations. Many traders chased the upside and were quickly trapped, and fake moves in both directions are likely to continue as liquidity is built ahead of a larger move lower.

56212346,647810,1766462431,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56212346.jpeg,Hong Kong Proposes New Rules To Allow Crypto Investments For Insurers –  Report,https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-proposes-crypto-investments-for-insurers/,"Hong Kong is reportedly exploring new rules that would allow insurance companies to invest in cryptocurrencies and the infrastructure sector as part of its efforts to become a leading hub for digital assets and support broader economic development. Hong Kong Eyes Crypto Investments For Insurers On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the Hong Kong Insurance Authority has proposed a set of new rules that could channel insurance capital into digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Hong Kong financial authorities have been actively working to develop a comprehensive framework that supports the expansion of the digital assets industry, part of its strategy to become a leading crypto hub in the world. According to the December 4 presentation reviewed by Bloomberg, the insurance regulator would impose a 100% risk charge on crypto assets, requiring insurers to hold reserves equal to the value of their crypto investments. Meanwhile, stablecoin investments would be approached differently under the new proposal, with risk charges based on the fiat currency the Hong Kong-regulated token is pegged to. The Insurance Authority proposal, which could still change in the coming months, will reportedly be open for public consultation from February through April 2026, followed by legislative submissions. The regulator told Bloomberg that it initiated the review of the risk-based capital regime this year with the main goal of supporting the insurance industry and broader economic development. Notably, the insurance authority website states that there were 158 authorized insurers in Hong Kong as of June 2025. Moreover, the total gross premiums of the Hong Kong insurance industry were HK$635 billion, worth approximately $82 billion, in 2024. “We are at the stage of gauging industry feedback and will also put the proposals for public consultation in due course,” a spokesperson for the regulator told the news media outlet. The proposed insurer framework also addresses new infrastructure rules as the city seeks new growth. The regulator is reportedly planning capital incentives for investments in Hong Kong or on the mainland, as well as for projects listed or issued in the financial hub. HK’s Stablecoin Landscape As Bloomberg noted, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is expected to grant the first batch of stablecoin issuer licenses at the start of 2026. However, some industry players believe that the regulator’s timeline could be delayed. As reported by Bitcoinist, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and other top financial regulators recently affirmed that stablecoins do not qualify as legal tender in the mainland, as they don’t meet regulatory requirements and risk of being used for illegal activities. Following the pronouncement, multiple analysts suggested that the PBOC’s recent declarations not only sank hopes that Beijing might have softened its stance on cryptocurrencies but also would affect Hong Kong’s efforts to become a hub for the stablecoin industry. Earlier this year, the HKMA enacted the Stablecoins Ordinance, which directs any individual or entity seeking to issue a fiat-referenced stablecoin (FRS) in Hong Kong, or any Hong Kong Dollar-pegged token, to obtain a license from the regulator. Multiple companies have applied for the license, with more than 30 applications filed this year, according to local news outlets. The list of applicants includes logistics technology firm Reitar Logtech and the overseas arm of Chinese mainland financial technology giant Ant Group. According to the founding director of the Law, Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship Lab at the University of Hong Kong’s Faculty of Law, Brian Tang, Beijing’s stance means that applicants for Hong Kong’s stablecoin licenses would need to reconsider if the application submitted to the HKMA touches mainland China issuers and users. A spokesperson stated that the HKMA was reviewing the applications and aimed to begin with a reduced number of licenses. However, they noted that even if Hong Kong proceeds with the original approval schedule, projects that involve the yuan or mainland Chinese institutions would likely be delayed.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto investment|Crypto Market|crypto regulation|crypto rules|hkma|Hong Kong and Crypto|Hong Kong authorities|Hong Kong Insurance Authority|stablecoin license|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-23 04:00:31

56212720,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=250881,1766463011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Why Bitcoin’s Struggle as the Ultimate Hedge Against Gold Continues,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-hedge-struggle-gold/,"BitcoinWorld Revealed: Why Bitcoin’s Struggle as the Ultimate Hedge Against Gold Continues For years, the crypto community has championed Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ the ultimate hedge for the modern age. However, a recent analysis throws cold water on this narrative, revealing that Bitcoin struggles to unseat the ancient metal as the world’s top hedge. When investors seek safety, they still overwhelmingly turn to the traditional king. Why does this happen, and what does it mean for your portfolio? Why Does Bitcoin Struggle as a Hedge Against Gold? According to a report from crypto financial services firm Matrixport, the Bitcoin hedge narrative faces a significant reality check. The analysis points out that even as the U.S. dollar weakens and the Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts, capital is flowing into gold, not crypto. This trend highlights a core challenge: perception. Central banks and large institutional investors still view Bitcoin as a highly volatile asset, not a stable store of value. Therefore, its role as a reliable hedge remains contested. The Unshakable Appeal of the Traditional Safe Haven Gold’s advantage isn’t just about history; it’s about trust and function. In times of economic uncertainty, investors prioritize assets with proven stability. Gold has millennia of trust built into its value. Key reasons for its enduring lead include: Institutional Trust: Central banks actively hold and buy gold, viewing it as a cornerstone of monetary reserves. Lower Volatility: Compared to Bitcoin’s sharp price swings, gold offers a smoother, more predictable value trajectory. Regulatory Clarity: Gold operates within a well-defined, global regulatory framework, unlike the evolving landscape for cryptocurrencies. This creates a high barrier for any new asset, even one as innovative as Bitcoin, to break through as the preferred hedge. Could U.S. Policy Change the Game for Bitcoin? Matrixport introduces a fascinating long-term variable: U.S. policy. The firm suggests a future administration, like a potential Trump presidency, could dramatically alter the landscape. A radical move, such as the U.S. selling part of its gold reserves or diversifying into Bitcoin, would send shockwaves through both markets. Such an action would be the ultimate endorsement, potentially validating the Bitcoin hedge thesis overnight. However, this remains speculative, and for now, policy inertia favors the status quo. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should an investor do with this information? First, understand that diversification is key. Relying solely on Bitcoin as a hedge carries specific risks that gold does not. Consider these points: Portfolio Balance: Treating Bitcoin purely as a digital gold equivalent may be premature. Assess its role in your portfolio based on its unique risk-reward profile. Monitor Macro Signs: Watch for shifts in central bank rhetoric or significant policy announcements that could change institutional adoption. Long-Term Perspective: The narrative is evolving, but changing deep-seated financial traditions takes time, not just technology. The Bottom Line on Bitcoin vs. Gold The race to be the top hedge asset is far from over, but the finish line is not yet in sight for Bitcoin. While it offers digital scarcity and decentralization, gold counters with unparalleled historical trust and stability. For the Bitcoin hedge argument to truly win, it must convince the world’s most conservative financial institutions—a monumental task. Investors should recognize both assets for what they are: gold as the reigning, low-volatility safe haven, and Bitcoin as a high-potential, but higher-risk, alternative store of value. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean Bitcoin is a bad investment? A: Not necessarily. It means its primary value may not currently be as a predictable hedge like gold. It remains a high-growth potential asset with different risk characteristics. Q: Why are central banks reluctant to buy Bitcoin? A> Central banks prioritize stability and security for national reserves. Bitcoin’s price volatility and evolving regulatory environment make it a risky choice compared to the established track record of gold. Q: Can Bitcoin and gold both be hedges? A> Yes, they can serve different hedging purposes. Gold hedges against inflation and systemic financial risk with stability. Bitcoin can hedge against currency devaluation or systemic distrust, but with more volatility. Q: What would it take for Bitcoin to overtake gold as a hedge? A> It would require a massive shift in institutional adoption, significantly reduced volatility, and clear, supportive global regulations—a combination that is years, if not decades, away. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin for gold? A> That is a personal investment decision based on your risk tolerance and goals. A diversified portfolio often includes a mix of asset classes, including both traditional and digital assets. Found this analysis insightful?

The world’s largest crypto exchange announced it will delist multiple margin trading pairs by the end of December. This move affects both cross margin and isolated margin users, requiring immediate attention from active traders. Understanding these changes is crucial for managing your portfolio effectively. Which Margin Pairs Is Binance Delisting? Binance confirmed the removal of 18 trading pairs scheduled for December 30 at 6:00 a.m. UTC. The exchange regularly reviews listed trading pairs to ensure market quality and protect users. This particular Binance delist margin pairs action focuses on FDUSD trading pairs across various cryptocurrencies. The affected pairs include some popular tokens that have seen significant trading volume. Traders using these pairs for margin positions need to adjust their strategies before the deadline. The exchange typically makes these decisions based on factors like liquidity, trading volume, and network stability. Complete List of Affected Trading Pairs Here are the specific pairs that will no longer be available for margin trading: Cross Margin Pairs Being Removed: EIGEN/FDUSD ARB/FDUSD TRUMP/FDUSD POL/FDUSD ATOM/FDUSD LDO/FDUSD SHIB/FDUSD RAY/FDUSD GALA/FDUSD PEPE/FDUSD Isolated Margin Pairs Being Removed: EIGEN/FDUSD ARB/FDUSD POL/FDUSD ATOM/FDUSD LDO/FDUSD SHIB/FDUSD GALA/FDUSD PEPE/FDUSD Notice that eight pairs appear on both lists, meaning they’re being completely removed from margin trading. The remaining two cross margin pairs (TRUMP/FDUSD and RAY/FDUSD) will only lose their cross margin functionality. What Does This Mean for Active Traders? When Binance decides to delist margin pairs , traders holding positions in these pairs face specific consequences. First, all open margin positions in these pairs will be automatically closed at the delisting time. This could trigger unexpected liquidations if markets move against your position. Second, you won’t be able to open new margin positions in these pairs after the deadline. However, spot trading for these pairs will continue unaffected unless Binance announces otherwise. This distinction is important for traders who might want to continue holding these assets without leverage. Action Steps Before the December 30 Deadline Traders need to take proactive measures to protect their investments. Here’s what you should do immediately: Review your current margin positions – Check if you hold any affected pairs Close positions manually – Avoid automatic closure at potentially unfavorable prices Adjust your trading strategy – Find alternative pairs for your margin trading needs Monitor for updates – Watch for additional announcements from Binance Remember that the Binance delist margin pairs action follows a standard process the exchange uses to maintain market quality. While inconvenient for some traders, these measures generally aim to protect users from illiquid markets and excessive volatility. Why Do Exchanges Delist Trading Pairs? Cryptocurrency exchanges regularly evaluate their listed pairs against several criteria. Low trading volume often triggers delisting decisions, as maintaining pairs with minimal activity consumes resources without benefiting most users. Network stability issues, regulatory concerns, and project development activity also influence these decisions. For Binance specifically, the decision to delist margin pairs typically follows thorough review processes. The exchange considers factors like liquidity depth, bid-ask spreads, and user protection. While some traders might be disappointed, these measures generally serve the broader community’s interests. Looking Beyond the Delisting: What’s Next? The cryptocurrency market constantly evolves, and exchange offerings change accordingly. While this particular Binance delist margin pairs action affects 18 pairs, the exchange continues to support hundreds of other margin trading options. Traders should view this as an opportunity to reassess their strategies and explore alternative pairs with better liquidity and trading conditions. Successful traders adapt to market changes rather than resisting them. This delisting might reveal new opportunities in other trading pairs or different trading approaches altogether. The key is staying informed and flexible in your trading approach. Frequently Asked Questions What happens to my open positions in delisted margin pairs? Binance will automatically close all open margin positions in the affected pairs at 6:00 a.m. UTC on December 30. You should close positions manually before this time to maintain control over your exit price. Can I still trade these pairs on the spot market? Yes, unless Binance announces otherwise, spot trading for these pairs will continue normally. Only margin trading functionality is being removed. Will Binance delist more pairs in the future? Exchanges regularly review and adjust their offerings. While no specific announcements have been made, traders should expect periodic reviews and potential delistings as market conditions change. How can I stay informed about future delistings? Monitor Binance’s official announcements page and enable notifications in your account settings. The exchange typically provides several days’ notice before implementing such changes. Are other exchanges delisting similar pairs? Exchange policies vary, but industry trends often see similar actions across platforms. Check with your preferred exchanges for their specific policies and announcements. What should I do if I’m heavily invested in affected pairs? Consider diversifying your portfolio and exploring alternative trading pairs with better liquidity. You might also reduce leverage or transition to spot trading for these assets. Share This Important Update This Binance delist margin pairs announcement affects many cryptocurrency traders. Help protect fellow investors by sharing this crucial information on your social media channels.

An address linked to the Ethena team executed a major Ethena AAVE deposit , moving millions in tokens to leading exchanges. This move often signals strategic shifts that can ripple through the DeFi ecosystem. Let’s break down what happened and explore its potential implications for AAVE holders and the broader market. What Was the Ethena AAVE Deposit? According to on-chain analytics from The Data Nerd, a specific blockchain address believed to be controlled by the Ethena team initiated a substantial transfer. The core action was an Ethena AAVE deposit of 17,900 AAVE tokens to the exchanges Binance and Bybit. At the time of the transaction, this stash was worth approximately $2.68 million. However, this deposit was just part of a larger story. The same address had previously withdrawn a total of 26,800 AAVE (worth about $4.03 million) from its holdings. Therefore, the deposit to exchanges represents a portion of a larger reallocation of assets. This sequence of withdrawal and partial deposit is a classic on-chain pattern analysts watch closely. Why Does This Ethena Transaction Matter? Large, identifiable deposits from project teams to liquid exchanges are significant events. They are not just simple transfers; they are market signals. For instance, such an Ethena AAVE deposit can influence trader sentiment and liquidity in several ways: Liquidity Pressure: Depositing tokens onto an exchange typically makes them available for sale. A large deposit can increase selling pressure, potentially affecting the token’s price in the short term. Team Strategy Clues: Movements from project treasuries or team wallets can hint at future actions, such as treasury diversification, providing liquidity for operations, or preparing for a vesting event. Market Sentiment Gauge: The market’s reaction to this news serves as a temperature check for AAVE’s current strength and investor confidence. What Could This Mean for AAVE’s Price? The immediate question for many is about price impact. A deposit of this size from the Ethena team does not automatically mean a sell-off is imminent. The tokens could be moved for various operational reasons. However, the possibility of selling is now on the table, which can create near-term uncertainty. Historically, the market often prices in this possibility quickly. Traders might anticipate a slight dip or increased volatility. Therefore, monitoring exchange flow data and order book depth over the next few days will be crucial to see if the deposited AAVE tokens are actively sold or simply parked. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors How should you process this news? Don’t just react; analyze. Here is a simple framework: Context is Key: Compare this Ethena AAVE deposit to the project’s historical wallet activity. Is this unusual? Check the Broader Trend: Is AAVE facing headwinds or tailwinds in the broader DeFi market? Look at Total Value Locked (TVL) and protocol revenue trends. Watch for Follow-up: Sometimes, one transaction is part of a series. Keep an eye on the originating wallet for further moves. Remember, on-chain data provides raw signals, but interpreting them requires understanding the project’s goals and the overall market environment. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal from the Noise The recent Ethena AAVE deposit is a noteworthy on-chain event that highlights the transparency and real-time nature of blockchain markets. While it presents a data point suggesting potential selling pressure, it is not a definitive predictor of price direction. For savvy participants, such events are opportunities to practice risk management, conduct deeper due diligence, and understand the strategic moves of major DeFi players. The true impact will unfold based on whether these tokens circulate or remain dormant on the exchanges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Ethena and why is their wallet activity important? A1: Ethena is a DeFi protocol known for its synthetic dollar, USDe. Activity from wallets associated with its team is watched because large moves can indicate treasury management strategies or provide clues about the team’s view on other assets like AAVE. Q2: Does depositing AAVE to an exchange always mean they will sell it? A2: Not always. Deposits can be for selling, but also for providing liquidity, collateralizing positions, or simply moving funds for safekeeping. The intent is not confirmed until a sale occurs on-chain. Q3: How can I track such transactions myself? A3: You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Arkham, Nansen, or Etherscan to track labeled wallets (like ‘Ethena’) and monitor large transfers to known exchange deposit addresses. Q4: What was the total value of the AAVE moved in this event? A4: The address withdrew about $4.03 million worth of AAVE (26,800 tokens) and deposited roughly $2.68 million worth (17,900 tokens) to Binance and Bybit. The remainder may be held in the wallet or moved elsewhere. Q5: Should I sell my AAVE because of this news? A5: This single event should not be the sole reason for an investment decision. Consider it as one piece of information within your broader investment strategy, risk tolerance, and research on AAVE’s fundamentals.

Lux Capital led the round, and Axios reported that the raise also brought in new investors alongside existing backers such as Founders Fund, 8VC and Haun Ventures. The fundraising arrives as US regulators move Erebor closer to taking deposits, a milestone that still carries weight in a sector shaped by the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the scramble that followed for stable, regulated banking access. Erebor Advances Toward Launch After Regulatory Green Lights The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency granted preliminary conditional approval for Erebor’s de novo national bank charter on Oct. 15, calling it a path for banks to engage in digital asset activities when conducted safely. The @USOCC has granted preliminary approval for Peter Thiel’s Erebor Bank, which plans to serve crypto and tech firms. #Crypto #Banking #OCC https://t.co/6u2kcU7i1P — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 16, 2025 Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould said the decision showed the OCC “does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities.” The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. followed in December, approving Erebor’s deposit insurance application subject to conditions, including capital requirements and limits on changes to management and ownership before opening. The FDIC approval reportedly includes a requirement for at least $276M in initial paid in capital and a tier 1 leverage ratio of no less than 12% for the first three years. Stablecoin Focus Fuels Investor Appetite Erebor has pitched itself as a tech and digital asset-focused bank, and the FDIC process reportedly included a capital call agreement designed to ensure investors can inject more funds if certain triggers are hit. Axios described investor enthusiasm around the stablecoin banking angle as running hot, and the sharp jump in valuation signals that backers see an opening for a regulated bank that can serve crypto and frontier tech clients without relying on the shrinking list of willing incumbents. The bank has not publicly set a launch date, though reporting has pointed to an opening in 2026 once final approvals and pre-opening requirements are cleared.

Fresh data reveals a significant surge in bullish activity, with traders placing aggressive bets on higher prices. This shift in sentiment, marked by rising open interest and funding rates, suggests the market is bracing for a potentially explosive finish to the year. Let’s break down what this means for your portfolio. What Do Rising Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Metrics Tell Us? Recent analysis from Cointelegraph, citing Glassnode data, shows a clear trend. Open interest in Bitcoin perpetual futures climbed from 304,000 BTC to 310,000 BTC. Simultaneously, the funding rate increased from 0.04% to 0.09%. These are not just random numbers. They are critical gauges of trader sentiment and market leverage. Open Interest : This measures the total number of outstanding derivative contracts. An increase typically indicates new money entering the market and a strengthening of the current trend. Funding Rate : This is a periodic payment between long and short traders in perpetual contracts. A positive rate means longs are paying shorts, which often reflects a bullish consensus. Therefore, the concurrent rise in both metrics strongly points to traders building leveraged long positions, betting on upward price movement. Why Are Traders Betting on a Bullish Trend Now? The timing is crucial. This accumulation in Bitcoin perpetual futures coincides with the approach of year-end. Historically, this period can experience heightened volatility due to several factors. Traders are likely positioning themselves ahead of potential catalysts, such as institutional portfolio rebalancing or macroeconomic announcements. The prevailing belief seems to be that any short-term volatility will ultimately resolve in a positive price surge. However, this optimism comes with a warning. High leverage in the futures market can act as a double-edged sword. While it can amplify gains during a rally, it can also lead to violent liquidations if the price moves unexpectedly. The market is essentially preparing for a big move, but the direction, while currently leaning bullish, is never guaranteed. How Should You Navigate This Volatile Landscape? Seeing professional traders pile into Bitcoin perpetual futures is a powerful signal, but it’s not a standalone trading strategy. For individual investors, this data should inform a cautious approach. Monitor Funding Rates : Extremely high positive funding can sometimes precede a “long squeeze” where over-leveraged positions get liquidated. Watch for Divergences : If Bitcoin’s spot price starts falling while open interest remains high, it could signal a trend reversal. Manage Your Risk : Never use more leverage than you can afford to lose. The potential for a year-end rally is exciting, but the risk of sharp downturns remains. This activity underscores that sophisticated players see value in being long Bitcoin as the year closes. It provides a contextual backdrop of institutional and large-trader sentiment that can be more reliable than social media hype. Conclusion: A Market Poised for Movement The evidence from the Bitcoin perpetual futures market is compelling. Rising open interest and funding rates create a tangible snapshot of growing bullish conviction. Traders are not just hoping for a rally; they are putting capital behind that belief through derivatives. This sets the stage for significant price action, offering opportunity alongside pronounced risk. The key takeaway is to stay informed, respect the power of leverage, and align your strategy with both the optimistic signals and the inherent market dangers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? They are a type of cryptocurrency derivative contract that has no expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. Their price tracks the underlying spot asset, with a funding mechanism to maintain this peg. What does a positive funding rate mean? A positive funding rate indicates that traders with long positions are paying a fee to those with short positions. This typically happens when the perpetual contract price is above the spot price and reflects bullish market sentiment. Is rising open interest always bullish? Not always. While rising open interest alongside a rising price confirms a strong trend, rising open interest during a price decline can signal that a downtrend is strengthening as new short positions are opened. How can retail traders use this information? Retail traders can use trends in futures metrics as a sentiment indicator. It helps gauge whether professional money is leaning bullish or bearish, which can be a valuable factor in making informed decisions, though not the only one. What risks come with high leverage in futures? The primary risk is liquidation. If the price moves against a highly leveraged position by a small percentage, the entire position can be automatically closed by the exchange, resulting in a total loss of the collateral.

According to CoinShares, this pullback happened because investors reacted negatively to postponements around the US Clarity Act. These delays have extended uncertainty about how cryptocurrencies will be regulated in the US. At the same time, concerns remain that whales have continued to sell their holdings. Hence, the European asset manager said that it is very unlikely that crypto ETPs will attract more inflows than they did last year. Currently, total assets under management stand at $46.7 billion, down from $48.7 billion in 2024. Solana and XRP Attract Fresh Capital The latest edition of “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report” shows that Ethereum recorded the largest outflows among digital asset investment products, as investors pulled out around $555 million over the past week. CoinShares said that this reaction is understandable because Ethereum stands to benefit the most, or be impacted the most, by the outcome of the US Clarity Act. Despite this short-term weakness, Ethereum’s overall performance this year remains strong. Total inflows in 2025 have already reached $12.7 billion, which is far higher than the $5.3 billion recorded last year. Bitcoin also experienced notable outflows of $460 million and continues to lag behind its 2024 performance, as market prices struggle to recover. So far this year, Bitcoin pulled in over $27 billion, compared to $41.6 billion last year. Multi-asset products and Sui also shed $55.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively. On the other hand, Solana and XRP continue to attract investor interest, with inflows of $48.5 million and $62.9 million. Chainlink also remained in positive territory after adding a modest $3.3 million. Global Digital Asset Flows The negative sentiment in digital asset investments was mainly concentrated in the US, which saw $990 million in outflows.

This movement comes at a crucial moment when traders await key economic data that could reshape global market dynamics. For cryptocurrency investors, these traditional market movements often signal broader financial trends that can impact digital asset valuations and trading strategies. Why Is the Dollar Dipping Before Key Data Releases? The US dollar has shown notable weakness across major currency pairs as markets position themselves for upcoming economic indicators. This dollar dips phenomenon typically occurs when traders reduce exposure ahead of potentially market-moving information. Several factors contribute to this cautious approach: Anticipation of Federal Reserve policy signals Concerns about US economic growth metrics Global risk appetite shifting toward emerging markets Technical resistance levels being tested For cryptocurrency traders, dollar weakness often correlates with increased interest in alternative assets, including digital currencies that serve as potential hedges against traditional currency fluctuations. Japanese Yen Surges on Intervention Warnings The Japanese yen has experienced a dramatic yen surges event, climbing approximately 2% against the dollar following explicit warnings from Japanese authorities about potential market intervention. This movement represents one of the most significant single-day gains for the currency in recent months. The intervention threat comes from Japan’s Ministry of Finance, which has repeatedly expressed concerns about excessive yen weakness harming the national economy. Currency Pair 24-Hour Change Key Resistance Level Support Level USD/JPY -2.1% 155.00 152.00 EUR/JPY -1.8% 165.50 162.00 AUD/JPY -1.5% 102.00 100.50 Understanding the Intervention Threat Mechanism The current intervention threat represents a coordinated effort by Japanese monetary authorities to stabilize their currency. Unlike cryptocurrency markets that operate continuously, traditional forex markets face direct government intervention that can create sudden, dramatic movements. Japanese officials have deployed verbal intervention tactics, signaling their willingness to take concrete action if the yen continues to weaken beyond acceptable levels. This situation creates both challenges and opportunities: Challenge: Increased volatility across Asian currency pairs Opportunity: Potential for carry trade adjustments Risk: Contagion effects on other emerging market currencies Benefit: Clearer policy signals from major central banks Critical Key Data Points That Could Reshape Markets Traders are focusing on several key data releases that could determine the next major market direction. These indicators provide essential insights into global economic health and central bank policy trajectories: US inflation figures (CPI and PCE data) Federal Reserve meeting minutes and interest rate decisions Japanese economic growth statistics Chinese trade balance and manufacturing data European Central Bank policy announcements Each of these data points carries significant weight for both traditional forex markets and cryptocurrency valuations, as they influence investor risk appetite and capital allocation decisions. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors The current market conditions present specific opportunities for informed market participants. Consider these strategic approaches: Monitor USD/JPY technical levels for potential breakout or reversal signals Watch for correlation patterns between Asian currencies and major cryptocurrencies Prepare for increased volatility around scheduled economic data releases Consider hedging strategies that account for potential central bank interventions Remember that while Asia FX movements create trading opportunities, they also introduce additional risk factors that require careful management and position sizing. FAQs: Understanding the Current Forex Dynamics What is causing the current dollar weakness? The US dollar is weakening due to combined factors including anticipation of key economic data, shifting interest rate expectations, and technical market positioning. How significant is the Japanese yen intervention threat? The intervention threat from Japanese authorities is particularly significant because it comes from the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan , indicating coordinated government action is possible if market conditions warrant. Which Asian currencies are benefiting most from dollar weakness? Besides the Japanese yen, the South Korean won, Singapore dollar, and Taiwanese dollar have shown notable strength against the retreating US currency. How do these forex movements impact cryptocurrency markets? Traditional currency movements often influence cryptocurrency markets through several channels: risk appetite adjustments, carry trade unwinding, and shifts in global liquidity conditions that affect all asset classes. What should traders watch in the coming days? Traders should monitor the USD/JPY 152.00 support level, upcoming US inflation data releases, and any official statements from Japanese monetary authorities regarding potential intervention actions. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertain Waters with Strategic Awareness The current Asia FX landscape presents a compelling narrative of regional currency strength meeting global economic uncertainty. As the dollar dips ahead of crucial information, the dramatic yen surges reminds markets that government intervention remains a powerful force in traditional finance. The explicit intervention threat from Japanese authorities adds a layer of complexity to an already volatile environment, while anticipation of key data releases keeps traders in a state of heightened alertness. For cryptocurrency market participants, these developments offer valuable insights into broader financial market dynamics. The interplay between traditional currencies and digital assets continues to evolve, creating both challenges and opportunities for informed investors. By understanding the forces shaping Asia FX movements, traders can better position themselves for whatever direction markets take next.

The Real Change Beneath the Cycle Panama City, December 23 , 2025 —The crypto industry has once again entered a deep, subdued phase. Price volatility has tightened, sentiment has sunk to the bottom, and even teams that were once masters at manufacturing hype are starting to admit that “narratives don’t seem to work anymore.” It’s not just retail investors sitting on the sidelines; many institutions have slowed their deployment, preferring to wait for the next “clear direction” before committing. This chill feels particularly sharp because the last round of big narratives arrived and dissipated too quickly. From AI hype to on-chain novel assets, to meme-driven extremes, the market seemed to move from euphoria to exhaustion in the blink of an eye. By 2025, most participants quietly recognize a simple fact: we are likely in a phase where narratives no longer “work” the way they used to. But this isn’t new. The industry has always moved in the same pattern: In the boom, concepts flood the market, and prices drown out genuine technological progress.. In the freeze, people declare that “nothing works,” while the real direction quietly takes shape. This mismatch—blind optimism at the top, deep pessimism at the bottom—often hides something more important than price: foundational technologies tend to make their biggest strides in quiet cycles. Consider the evidence: In 2018’s bear market, almost nobody cared about NFTs, yet ERC-721 was standardized in that period. In 2019, “DeFi” wasn’t even a popular term yet, but lending protocols and AMMs were quietly taking form. Rollup discussions started around 2018, and nearly no one believed it would “own the future.” Yet here we are. In every cycle, market attention is out of sync with the technology timeline. This isn’t a coincidence; it’s structural. Once price and emotion step off the stage, the capabilities that truly reshape the future finally have space to emerge. If we bring that lens into 2025, we see a clear, yet often emotionally ignored trend: the internet is undergoing a structural shift in who its users actually are. For the past 20 years, almost all internet activity came from humans—clicking, typing, searching, interacting. But in the last two years, something fundamental has changed: Enterprise automation scripts are exploding in volume. AI agents are shifting from answering questions to executing tasks. Model inference services are replacing human workflow distribution. API-to-API traffic is growing much faster than human requests. Machine-originated access is becoming a dominant share of web traffic. These machines don’t tweet, don’t post on social, don’t FOMO. Yet they are quietly taking over a large portion of network activity. They don’t need UI, don’t wait for loading screens, and don’t change behavior because of mood. The significance of this shift is profound, but easy to overlook—because it doesn’t show up directly in token prices. But for core engineers, protocol designers, and infra builders, the trend is very clear: future network activity will be increasingly driven by machines. Distribution of bot and human web traffic worldwide from 2013 to 2024, 2025 Bad Bot Report, Imperva, https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/2025-bad-bot-report/ And once the “user” shifts from humans to machines, the requirements placed on the infrastructure change as well: Payments must be automated and programmable. Identity must be verifiable and composable. Access control must not depend on human intervention. Verifiable execution and auditable records must become defaults. Data and resources need to be priced per call, not per subscription. Interactions move to “machine-level” frequency and density. As AI agents get wired into blockchains and start using Web3’s base layers to execute tasks, it also means the blockchain stack itself must be rebuilt around machine-first assumptions. Two critical starting points for that rebuild are x402 and ERC-8004. They are not just “new narratives” — they are the inevitable consequence of the internet stepping into its next phase. II. The Agent Economy — Why Machines Will Become Web3’s Next Major Users This isn’t something you can explain with “AI is hot” and be done. Underneath is a solid technical logic: machines behave in ways that are fundamentally different from humans, and the native properties of Web3 happen to be a very good fit for those differences. To truly understand why Web3 might find its next S-curve in the age of autonomous machines, we must first deeply comprehend what “machines as users” entails. Their needs shape the direction of future infrastructure, and those needs are not incremental tweaks to existing human workflows, but structural changes entirely. 1. Machines now understand intent and can plan tasks autonomously Traditional automation simply executed fixed instructions. Today’s AI agents can: Understand task-level intent; Analyze contextual information; Decide which API/tool to call; Adjust their next steps based on results; Manage assets, evaluate risk, monitor state; Orchestrate multi-step, cross-service workflows. This fundamentally changes the machine’s role on the internet. They are no longer just executing scripts—they can decide what to do and how to do it. That gives them the basic qualification to be independent network “users.” 2. Machines operate at a frequency humans cannot match A human might trigger a few dozen interactions a day. A machine can send that many requests in a few seconds. A typical agent’s activity density looks like this: Multiple model inference calls each hour; Many external API calls per minute; Continuous monitoring, verification, and state updates each second; 24/7 operation with no downtime. When user behavior shifts from human pace to machine pace, the required capacity jumps by orders of magnitude: Waiting on-chain confirmation quickly becomes unacceptable. Any workflow requiring humans becomes a bottleneck. High-volume, low-value, high-frequency calls become the norm. The Web3 stack must be able to handle this density if machines are to become first-class users. 3. Machine behavior models demand fully automated, low-latency execution Humans are willing to scan QR codes, wait 5 seconds, and retry if something fails. Machines are not. Their behavior models demand fully automated, low-latency execution and provable correctness . What they require is: Full Automation: Can this task be completed with zero human involvement? Real-Time Verifiability: Can I get a verifiable, cryptographically secure result in real time? Granular Payments: Can I pay per call rather than via a misaligned subscription? Permissioning: Can I obtain and maintain access with zero human confirmation? Here, Web2 reveals two fatal weaknesses: Machines cannot independently use the credit card system. They cannot complete KYC, type verification codes, or confirm charges. Subscription models are misaligned with high-frequency calls, and tiny per-call payments are nearly impossible. Machines lack verifiable trust channels between one another. API keys are not identity. Logs are not credible proofs. Machines cannot use Web2 mechanisms to form trustless cooperation. This forces the internet towards a “machine-native” architecture — and Web3 is exactly where that architecture can be built. Why Web3 becomes the natural base layer for machine users: Web3 offers three capabilities that machines need: Programmable payments — On-chain assets can be controlled directly by machines, without human approval or centralized intermediaries. This is the starting point of x402. Native identity (wallet = identity) — A machine can generate and own its own wallet, with persistent identity, without email/phone/KYC. This is what ERC-8004 builds on. Verifiable collaboration — On-chain records are traceable, verifiable, and tamper-resistant, making them a practical substrate for machine reputation and cooperation. We are not predicting some distant future here; we’re observing what is already happening: Traffic reports show a large share of global web requests now come from bots and scripts. Enterprises are handing more processes to agents. Model inference is priced per call; machines are the real payers. Automated trading and monitoring systems are scaling across markets. Large tech players are actively building “machine user interfaces.” The Trustless Agent narrative has a simple core: the internet’s primary operators in the future are no longer humans, but the automation behind them. Machines don’t chase narratives, don’t succumb to FOMO or panic. They just keep calling, keep paying, keep executing — precisely the pattern Web3 infra is best at serving. Why Web3’s next S-curve is likely to be machine-driven Machines possess three advantages that humans simply cannot replicate: Extremely high call density; Infinitely scalable execution frequency; Persistent, predictable demand for on-chain resources. A single machine user can generate more on-chain activity than ten thousand humans. Machines don’t rest, don’t leave, don’t drop out because of “education cost,” and don’t rage quit because of FUD. Their demand for on-chain resources is regular, forecastable, and compounding over time. This suggests that Web3’s future growth is less about human onboarding, and more about scaling automated systems . x402 solves payments; ERC-8004 solves identity and trust. Together they form the basic loop of the machine economy — and that loop is where the next Web3 S-curve is likely to originate. III. x402 — Re-inventing Payments for Machines For decades, internet payments were built around humans. Humans can scan, type verification codes, click “confirm,” and navigate redirect flows. Visual prompts, decision points, and manual confirmations are everywhere—and this all made sense, because all traffic was human anyway. But once the primary “user” becomes an autonomous machine, that logic instantly breaks. Machines can’t “see” a paywall, wait for biometric prompts, or navigate web payment flows. Their behavior model is extremely simple: send request, receive response, continue execution. Any human-in-the-loop step in the payment flow becomes a hard blocker. This is the context in which x402 becomes structurally meaningful. It’s not “a more user-friendly payment UX,” but a fundamentally different idea: Make payment a protocol-level semantic, not a UI workflow. The long-dormant HTTP 402 status code (“Payment Required”) is given real life again. A server can respond with “402: payment required,” stating the conditions for accessing a resource. The calling agent then: Executes a payment (typically via stablecoins); Acquires a proof of payment; Resends the original request with this proof attached. In this model, payment stops being a messy app-layer flow and becomes part of the language of the internet — like 200 or 404. For machines, this is what they can actually understand, program around, and scale. On-chain payments are the natural carrier for x402 because traditional payment rails are effectively closed to machines. They depend on human KYC, manual verification, and bank-account-based architecture—all of which exclude autonomous agents. Stablecoins therefore become “machine money” by default: no account opening, no borders, fully automatable; to a machine, they behave more like “CPU time” or “bandwidth credits” than cash. To make x402 usable in practice, the system still has to hide on-chain complexity: nonce management, gas estimation and optimization, transaction failure and retries, confirmation latency, and sometimes cross-chain routing. The x402 architecture introduces Facilitators , which serve exactly this role. They keep the agent’s experience extremely simple: From the agent’s perspective: send request, receive result. Everything “on-chain” happens behind the curtain. This abstraction is crucial to x402 becoming real infrastructure instead of just a spec. Seen this way, x402 doesn’t fix “payment UX friction” — it fills in a missing primitive of the machine internet: fully automated, per-call, small-value settlement. More and more internet resources—model inference, data APIs, real-time compute, on-chain reads—naturally want to be priced per request. The subscription-based, account-based logic of Web2 simply cannot express that well. In this sense, x402 is not about incremental improvement; it is about rewriting the unit in which the internet charges for resources: From “per user per month” → to “per call.” That aligns perfectly with how machines use the network. Early projects like PING and PayAI do not represent the full scope of x402, but they do offer the first real-world examples of machines paying per call for services . Their main significance isn’t in creating a hype narrative, but in showing that the mechanism actually works and finds natural footholds in the developer ecosystem. From a higher vantage point, x402’s value can be summarized in three points: It demotes payment into a protocol semantic, not a UI flow. It lets machines perform economic actions independently for the first time. It lays the lowest settlement layer for the future machine economy. If machines cannot pay, they cannot truly participate in the internet. x402 is about giving them that missing capability. IV. ERC-8004 — Identity, Reputation, and Verifiable Cooperation Between Machines If x402 gives machines the ability to “pay,” ERC-8004 addresses a deeper question: when machines don’t know or trust each other and can be copied at will, how do they collaborate at all? Human society builds trust via identity, relationships, history, contracts, and legal systems. Machines have none of these. From birth, a machine is just a program: No natural identity; No inherent reputation; Easily copied, migrated, or restarted; No stable, persistent “persona.” The default state of the machine world is therefore not “weak trust,” but zero trust . In a world of scaled machine collaboration, this becomes a serious problem. When one agent calls another: How does it know the other actually executed the task? How does it know the result wasn’t tampered with? How does it distinguish a reliable executor from a throwaway script? Traditional logging and centralized audit tools are not enough: machines run across domains, chains, and environments. Logs can be altered, siloed, or simply not shared. ERC-8004 aims at exactly these identity and verification problems — but it does so in a very specific way. It doesn’t try to give machines “human-like roles,” but designs a minimal but sufficient on-chain existence : Think of it as a machine ID card + standardized behavior proof format , not a personality system. The key idea is to structure “task execution” as a first-class object and provide a common standard for recording, verifying, and tracking it on-chain. A task can be formally described; its inputs and outputs can be submitted in standardized formats; crucial execution evidence can be committed to the chain. Collaborating agents don’t have to trust each other; they can inspect these proofs. This changes the basic logic of machine collaboration. What used to be a simple function call becomes an economic action: Execution happens; Proof is recorded; Responsibility is traceable; History accumulates. Over time, these records naturally aggregate into machine reputation . It’s not social reputation; it’s cold data: Completion count; Success rate; Dispute or failure history; Scale and type of tasks handled. Machines make decisions based on data anyway, not feelings. That makes this type of reputation system almost inherently suited to the machine economy. To make this identity scheme actually usable, ERC-8004 leans on account abstraction (ERC-4337 and successors): machines can own and sign from dedicated contract accounts. That means: Machines can be the direct originators of on-chain actions. Permissions and behavioral boundaries are governed by contract logic instead of user keys. “Who executed the task” and “who is ultimately responsible” can be separated in the design. For the first time, machines can bear on-chain behavior under their own identity and leave a verifiable trail. At a higher level, ERC-8004 can be summarized this way: It gives machines a minimal, well-defined identity boundary. It standardizes how collaborative tasks and their proofs are represented. It allows machines to accumulate reputations grounded in on-chain data. It upgrades collaboration from “function calls” to “economic contracts.” Once identity, reputation, and verification can flow, machine-to-machine collaboration begins to resemble a market: reliable executors naturally get more calls; poor performers are filtered out; new entrants start with low-risk tasks to build a record. This is an embryonic machine society — an economic structure made of code, evidence, and on-chain data. That’s why ERC-8004 is not an ornamental standard but a core piece of the machine internet. Without payment, machines can’t obtain resources. Without identity and verification, they can’t cooperate. x402 solves “can they pay?”; ERC-8004 solves “can they be trusted and coordinated?” Together, they give machines the basic conditions to participate in economic activity. V. x402 × ERC-8004 — The Base Loop of the Machine Economy Looked at separately, x402 and ERC-8004 seem to solve unrelated problems: payment versus identity/verification. In a “machines become dominant users” context, however, they clearly connect into a single, tight causal chain — a minimal loop that allows machines to function as economic actors. All collaboration in the machine world can be compressed into a simple formula: Pay → Execute Task → Verify → Accumulate Reputation → Further Cooperation Miss any step and a machine-native economy cannot form. x402 and ERC-8004 cover the two most critical edges of this loop: payment and verification. The middle — executors, task structure, reputation scoring — grows naturally on top. x402 is the starting point for accessing resources. If a machine wants something—model inference, data access, compute, scheduling—it pays. The act of payment grants resource usage rights and establishes an economic relationship: caller versus provider. But payment alone doesn’t ensure correct execution. An agent that gets paid might not do the work or might cut corners. These risks are amplified in the machine world: agents can be cloned, replaced, or rebooted at will; they carry no innate social responsibility or identity. This is where ERC-8004 steps in. It makes task execution provable, task boundaries standard, and action logs publicly verifiable. For the first time, machine collaboration has a traceable execution trail rather than being hidden in logs and black boxes. Combined, x402 and ERC-8004 create a naturally emergent economic dynamic: reliable executors receive more tasks, unreliable ones are filtered out, and new entrants gradually build a record through low-risk work. From the outside, this looks like a market. Structurally, it’s an auto-forming reputation system : Payment defines economic relationships; Verification defines responsibility; Reputation defines future collaboration. The result is that a machine ceases to be “just a tool” and becomes a real economic participant. It can initiate tasks, pay for resources, execute external actions, provide services, accumulate history, and use its reputation to unlock higher-value opportunities. A “task market” forms naturally between x402’s settlement layer and ERC-8004’s verification layer. From a macro perspective, the combination achieves three things: Gives machines actionable economic rights (they can pay). Imposes verifiable economic responsibilities (execution records). Enables structured cooperation based on history (reputation). This loop is short, clean, and robust. Unlike human economies that rely on emotions, relationships, and institutions, it is built entirely on protocols, data, and automation — which is exactly why it can scale faster. Once a chain, ecosystem, or service starts getting used heavily by agents, the effect of this loop can grow exponentially. Seen this way, x402 and ERC-8004 are not “growth stories”; growth eventually needs them. Their significance won’t be found in price charts but in the default configurations of future automated systems. VI. Before the Inflection Point — What the Next 3–5 Years Might Look Like When we talk about the significance of x402 and ERC-8004, it’s easy to fixate on the technology itself. But what actually determines an industry inflection point is how these technologies seep into real systems over the next few years. In a quiet, cautious market where narratives feel exhausted and capital is conservative, the easiest thing to miss is this: the internet’s structure is already shifting , slowly but irreversibly, from “humans use the internet” to “machines use the internet.” The rise of machine users will not look like a single viral app. It’s more like groundwater: slowly rising, barely noticeable at first, until it quietly reshapes the landscape. x402 and ERC-8004 are not the entire story, but they are key bridges that connect: “Theoretical possibility” → “Engineering feasibility” → “Scalable growth.” Over the next 3–5 years, this structural migration will likely unfold gradually and be absorbed layer by layer: From developers → to enterprise systems → to platform services → to the majority of automated workflows. In the early phases, sectors already heavily reliant on automation will feel it first: data services, model inference platforms, API marketplaces, on-chain monitoring, automated trading, and risk systems. These are already driven by scripts and bots, so “machines can pay” and “machines can be verified” matter more there than anywhere else. As x402 lets them price calls properly and ERC-8004 makes execution auditable, these sectors naturally shift from human-centric pricing logic to machine-centric logic. As machine participation increases, the application layer will also be reshaped from beneath. UIs may remain simple, but behind every click may sit a growing fleet of autonomous agents: evaluating options, filtering sources, calling models, managing assets, executing trades, monitoring risk. To users, it’s still “click button → done.” Under the hood, it’s dozens of chained calls and verification steps. In this world, Web3 may not become more visible at the UI layer. Instead, its presence strengthens at the infrastructure layer : chains become settlement and reputation layers for agents, not dashboards for humans. In parallel, stablecoins become even more central. They cease to be just “trading instruments” or “DeFi building blocks” and evolve into the energy unit of machine activity . Every API call, compute operation, and verification step consumes resources; stablecoins are the universal measure for that consumption. As machines scale, stablecoin demand and circulation trend upward—not because of human trading, but because of machine workloads. The multichain world will also be re-segmented. Instead of “which chain do users like,” the question becomes: Which chain is best suited for which machine responsibility? Some chains lean into “payment and settlement,” focusing on stable, fast fund movement. Some become “execution layers,” handling complex stateful tasks for agents. Some specialize in “reputation and proofs,” archiving machine behavior and contracts. Today’s multichain division is mostly about user preference and ecosystem style; tomorrow’s division may be about machine roles. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) won’t disappear either; they will be critical nodes in the machine economy. To handle large agent-driven flow, they may need more standardized machine interfaces, lower-latency routing, and deeper automated risk systems. Machines don’t open apps. They don’t scroll. They only speak APIs. High-depth, fast-matching CEXs are naturally well-positioned to serve machine flow. Taken together, these trends point to a single reality: the true inflection point is not when a narrative “comes back,” but when machine users cross a critical mass — in count, call density, and cooperation structures. When machine demand for resources surpasses human demand; when automated services become core revenue; when a large share of on-chain transactions are initiated by agents rather than people — that is when acceleration happens. To get there, we don’t need sentiment to improve or a new wave of retail. We need time, standardized tooling, and developer consensus on new infrastructure. From that perspective, x402 and ERC-8004 aren’t just nice-to-haves. Growth will eventually rely on them. Their importance won’t be measured by this cycle’s price action, but by the fact that, one day, they will quietly become defaults in most automated systems. VII. A Machine-Centric Multichain Layout: Ethereum, Solana, Base and the AI Agent Stack So far we’ve discussed x402 and ERC-8004 at the protocol and abstraction levels. Now we move to specific chains and ecosystems and ask three concrete questions: How are different chains preparing for the AI agent era? Which parts of the machine loop are likely to land on Ethereum, Solana, Base? How do these moves tie into x402, ERC-8004, and Coinbase’s Payments MCP? 1. Ethereum — Root Registry for Machine Identity and Reputation In the context of ERC-8004, Ethereum’s core role is increasingly clear: It is the root domain and public registry for machine identity and reputation, not the primary venue for high-frequency execution. ERC-8004 lives in the Ethereum ecosystem, giving agents a unified format for tasks and proofs. Account abstraction (ERC-4337 and successors) lets machines safely and programmably control contract accounts. ENS, attestations, governance, and DeFi histories collectively form rich “resume data” for agents. As the chain with the strongest security and most stable consensus, Ethereum is a natural home for high-value task settlement and permanent proof storage. In an AI-agent-heavy world, Ethereum may not carry the most calls, but it will carry the most critical ones: Who is this agent? What has it actually done? What is its track record? How is it connected to other entities? More and more of those answers will live on Ethereum. 2. Solana — High-Frequency Execution and x402 Runtime for Machines Solana, by contrast, is almost tailor-made for machine demand: Parallel execution (Sealevel) supports massive concurrent agent activity. High TPS and low latency match small-value, high-frequency calls. A strong stablecoin + DEX ecosystem gives data and trading agents instant liquidity. It is already full of bots (MEV, arbitrage, market making, liquidations) — an early prototype of a machine economy. In a world where x402 is widely adopted, Solana is a natural contender for: The high-frequency settlement and execution layer for machines — the place where agents run their daily workloads. Agents can run high-frequency tasks on Solana, then checkpoint important results and reputation proofs back to Ethereum via cross-chain verifications. 3. Base — Operational and Commercial Home for Agent Products Base’s positioning is closer to product and business reality. On one side, it inherits Ethereum’s security while drastically lowering costs as an L2. On the other, it tightly integrates with Coinbase’s wallet stack, compliance rails, and developer tooling, which is a clear advantage for AI agent deployment. Most notably, Coinbase’s Payments MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows leading LLMs (Claude, Gemini, etc.) to: Access crypto wallets under scoped permissions and safety policies; Execute on-chain transactions and stablecoin payments via natural language; Use protocols like x402 to pay per call; Participate in DeFi and on-chain flows as agents. This strongly suggests: Base is a leading candidate for an “Agent-as-a-Service” operational chain — the place where agent products actually run, charge, manage risk, and interact with users. On Base, developers aren’t just writing contracts. They are deploying full agent products — from wallet authorization and payment logic, to risk controls and Web2 SaaS integration. 4. Structural Division of Labor: A Machine Internet Infrastructure Matrix Putting these together, we can think of Ethereum, Solana, and Base as three layers of the machine economy: Ethereum: Identity layer + reputation & final settlement layer Agents register who they are and what they’ve done here; critical behavior is finalized and made public here. Solana: High-frequency execution layer + x402 micro-payment engine Dense, performance-sensitive tasks run and settle here, with x402 providing per-call pricing. Base: Operational layer + commercial chain for agent products AI models connect to wallets and payments via MCP; agent products meet users and enterprises here, in the most compliance- and engineering-friendly environment. In this view, multichain is no longer about “user preference” but about “machine roles.” Machines don’t care about logos or UI. They care about: Performance, cost, security, and available tools. VIII. Conclusion: Machines Becoming Users Is the Inflection Point Most narratives still assume humans are the center of the internet and of Web3. But the real shift underway is deeper: The very concept of “user” is migrating from humans to machines. As that migration reaches payments, identity, collaboration, and reputation, x402 and ERC-8004 stop being “new protocols” and become the grammar of a new world. Ethereum, Solana, and Base stop being just “app chains” and become a structured infrastructure stack for the machine economy. Looking back from the future, we may realize that the real inflection point was never a single price chart. It was the first time we took seriously a simple question: If the internet’s primary users are no longer humans but machines, who exactly are we designing the next generation of infrastructure for?

Proposed Crypto Tax Framework Representatives Max Miller from Ohio and Steven Horsford from Nevada have drafted a preliminary proposal that seeks to align the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies with that of traditional securities. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, the draft consists of a blend of policy objectives and bill language not yet formally approved. Related Reading: Pundit Shares Why XRP Will Become Expensive And A $1,000 Price Tag Is Possible One of the key features of this draft legislation is its aim to exempt capital gains tax for transactions involving regulated stablecoins. Specifically, the proposal proposes to shield transactions that consistently maintain a value between $0.99 and $1.01 from taxation. However, this exemption is limited to transactions under $200, and the final text may modify which tokens will qualify for this safe harbor, as advised by aides to both congressmen. The proposal also attempts to establish safe harbors for rewards earned through activities like staking, which involves verifying blockchain transactions. Representative Miller emphasized that “America’s tax code has failed to keep pace with modern financial technology.” He described the bipartisan bill as a means to inject clarity, fairness, and common sense into the taxation of digital assets. The proposed draft also addresses the taxation of rewards earned through staking and mining cryptocurrencies, which involves verifying transactions within blockchain networks. Aligning Digital Assets With Securities Tax Regime Under guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued during the Biden administration, rewards obtained from staking are taxed at the time of receipt. Republican lawmakers have voiced concerns regarding this approach, arguing that it taxes assets before owners realize a gain. Conversely, Democrats maintain that these rewards should be classified as compensation and taxed upon receipt. To navigate this divide, Miller and Horsford aim to find a compromise, allowing taxpayers to defer tax on rewards for up to five years. After this period, the rewards would be taxed as income based on their fair market value. Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis, who recently announced that she will not be running for re-election next year, had previously introduced crypto tax legislation that would leave such rewards untaxed until they are sold. This legislation would align more closely with industry preferences. Related Reading: Saylor Sparks Bitcoin Speculation With ‘Green Dots’ Signal Additionally, the draft aims to bring digital assets under the same tax regime that governs securities and, in some cases, commodities transactions. It proposes to include cryptocurrencies in capital gains tax exemptions for foreign investors trading securities through US-based intermediaries like brokers or exchanges. Furthermore, the plan would permit cryptocurrency traders to utilize mark-to-market accounting, allowing them to recognize unrealized gains and losses based on fair market value at the end of each year. The proposed legislation also seeks to impose restrictions on deducting losses from wash trades for digital assets and “close existing loopholes” that facilitate transactions designed to lock in cryptocurrency gains while postponing the associated tax liability.

56214774,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=250899,1766466011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Circle Files for Trademarks in South Korea: A Strategic Masterstroke for USDC Dominance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/circle-trademarks-south-korea-usdc/,"BitcoinWorld Circle Files for Trademarks in South Korea: A Strategic Masterstroke for USDC Dominance In a decisive move that underscores its global ambitions, Circle, the powerhouse behind the USDC stablecoin, has officially filed for trademarks in South Korea . This action, discovered through filings in mid-December, is more than just paperwork—it’s a clear signal of intent to capture a pivotal market. For anyone tracking the evolution of digital finance, this development is a crucial indicator of where institutional crypto is headed next. Why is Circle Filing Trademarks in South Korea a Big Deal? When a company like Circle files for trademarks , it’s laying the legal groundwork for serious, long-term operations. The applications, submitted on December 11th and 12th for the names CIRCLE, USDC, EURC, and its iconic arc logo, protect its brand identity. This step is essential before launching local services, marketing campaigns, or forming partnerships. For the crypto-savvy and highly regulated South Korean market, this move suggests Circle is preparing to engage directly with consumers and businesses, rather than operating from afar. What Does This Mean for the USDC Stablecoin in Asia? South Korea is a titan in the crypto world, known for its high retail adoption and sophisticated trading community. By securing its trademarks, Circle positions USDC to compete directly with other stablecoins and traditional payment rails in the region. This strategic expansion offers several key benefits: Regulatory Clarity: Filing trademarks is often a precursor to engaging with local financial authorities, paving the way for compliant services. Enhanced Trust: A formal, protected presence builds credibility with Korean users and institutions. Market Access: It opens doors to integrations with Korean exchanges, wallets, and DeFi protocols. Therefore, this isn’t just an administrative task; it’s a calculated play for greater market share in a critical geographic arena. How Does This Move Fit Into Circle’s Global Strategy? Circle’s decision to file for trademarks in South Korea is a logical piece of its worldwide puzzle. The company has consistently worked to make USDC a reliable dollar digital currency for the internet. Establishing a fortified presence in a major economy like South Korea aligns with its mission of bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. Moreover, it puts competitive pressure on rivals and demonstrates to the global market that stablecoin issuers are building for the future, not just the present. What Are the Potential Challenges and Opportunities? While the opportunity is immense, the path isn’t without hurdles. South Korea’s regulatory environment for crypto assets is strict and evolving. Circle will need to navigate these rules carefully. However, the potential rewards are significant. A successful entry could lead to: Mass adoption of USDC for remittances and cross-border trade in East Asia. Stronger alliances with Korean tech and finance giants. A blueprint for expansion into other regulated Asian markets. In essence, this trademark filing is the first domino. If it falls correctly, it could trigger a wave of growth for Circle and the broader stablecoin ecosystem. Conclusion: A Defining Step for Stablecoin Adoption Circle’s action to file for trademarks in South Korea is a masterstroke of strategic planning. It moves beyond speculation and into the tangible realm of international business and finance. This step provides a compelling glimpse into a future where digital dollars like USDC operate seamlessly across borders, powered by clear legal frameworks and strong brand trust. For the crypto industry, it’s a powerful reminder that lasting adoption is built on foundations of compliance and deliberate expansion. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did Circle file for in South Korea? A1: Circle Internet Group filed trademark applications for its company name “CIRCLE,” its stablecoin brands “USDC” and “EURC,” and its distinctive arc logo with the Korean Intellectual Property Office. Q2: Why is South Korea such an important market for crypto? A2: South Korea has one of the world’s most active and technologically advanced cryptocurrency user bases, with high retail participation and a strong interest in digital asset innovation, making it a critical market for any global crypto firm. Q3: Does this mean USDC will immediately be available in South Korea? A3: Not immediately. Filing trademarks is a preparatory legal step. Full availability will depend on subsequent regulatory approvals, partnership formations, and product launches tailored to the local market. Q4: How does this affect other stablecoins like USDT? A4: It increases competition. A formal, trademark-protected presence by Circle could encourage more Korean platforms and users to adopt USDC, potentially challenging Tether’s (USDT) market share in the region. Q5: What is the significance of filing for the EURC trademark as well? A5: It indicates Circle’s plan to offer its euro-backed stablecoin in South Korea too, catering to users and businesses with euro exposure and diversifying its product offering beyond the US dollar. Q6: What should investors and users watch for next? A6: Key next steps include announcements of partnerships with Korean exchanges or fintech firms, regulatory licenses, and the official launch of localized Circle services or marketing campaigns in the country.

56216484,647800,1766466031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56216484.jpeg,No Bitcoin Buy This Monday—Strategy Adds $748M To USD Reserve Instead,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-strategy-adds-748m-to-usd-reserve-instead/,"Bitcoin treasury company Strategy hasn’t announced any new BTC buy this week, but it has made an expansion to its recently-created USD reserve. Strategy’s USD Reserve Now Stands At $2.19 Billion As announced by Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor in an X post , the company has increased its US Dollar (USD) reserve by $748 million. Strategy first created the USD Reserve at the start of December, allocating $1.44 billion to it. During the announcement of the reserve, Saylor noted, “we believe it will better position us to navigate short-term market volatility while delivering on our vision of being the world’s leading issuer of Digital Credit.” The reserve’s existence didn’t mean that the firm paused Bitcoin acquisitions, as it made a purchase alongside the establishment of the USD reserve itself and on the two Mondays that followed. The Bitcoin purchase that came alongside the announcement was relatively small, but the two in the following weeks were some of the biggest of the year, each adding nearly $1 billion in tokens to the company’s treasury. The latest addition to the USD reserve, however, has come without a BTC purchase from Strategy. According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm funded the expansion using sales of its MSTR at-the-market (ATM) stock offering. Strategy’s USD reserve now holds around $2.19 billion, while its Bitcoin treasury is unchanged from last week’s figure of 671,268 BTC (worth $60.24 billion at the current exchange rate). Just like how BTC buys from Strategy usually precede a Sunday X post from Saylor with an image of the company’s portfolio tracker, the same tradition appears to be forming for USD reserve expansions as well. Before the initial announcement, Saylor made the portfolio tracker post with the caption: “What if we start adding green dots?” The chairman usually uses “orange dots” when referring to BTC, so this immediately hinted that something new was brewing. “Green dots” turned out to be additions to the USD reserve. The Sunday post before the latest purchase also used the same terminology, as Saylor said, “Green Dots ₿eget Orange Dots.” Strategy continues to be by far the biggest Bitcoin treasury company in the world, as data from BitcoinTreasuries.net shows. Strategy isn’t the only cryptocurrency treasury firm that has made an announcement on Monday. Bitmine has also shared a new press release with an update for its Ethereum holdings. Originally a mining-focused company, Bitmine pivoted to an ETH treasury strategy in mid-2025. Since then, the firm has been an active buyer of the cryptocurrency and has established itself as the largest digital asset corporate holder behind Strategy. Bitmine added 98,852 ETH (around $300.75 million) during the past week and now holds 4,066,062 ETH ($12.37 billion), equivalent to 3.37% of the asset’s total supply in circulation. “We are making rapid progress towards the ‘alchemy of 5%’ and we are already seeing the synergies borne from our substantial ETH holdings,” said Tom Lee, Bitmine chairman. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $89,700, up almost 4% in the last seven weeks.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Strategy|Strategy Bitcoin|Strategy USD Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-23 05:00:31

The political cryptocurrency landscape has been electrified by the emergence of TRUMP meme coin, a digital asset that blends internet culture with political sentiment. As we look toward 2026 through 2030, investors are asking one burning question: Can this controversial token achieve the seemingly impossible $50 price target? The journey of $TRUMP from meme status to serious investment consideration reflects the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets where politics and digital assets increasingly intersect. What is TRUMP Meme Coin and Why Does It Matter? TRUMP meme coin represents a fascinating convergence of political branding and cryptocurrency innovation. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus on technological utility, this digital asset derives its value primarily from cultural and political relevance. The $TRUMP token exists on various blockchain platforms, most notably as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and similar implementations on other chains. Its creation follows the pattern of other successful meme coins that have captured public imagination, but with the unique twist of being tied to one of the most polarizing political figures in modern history. The significance of TRUMP meme coin extends beyond typical cryptocurrency analysis. It serves as: A barometer of political sentiment within crypto communities A case study in celebrity/political token economics A reflection of how internet culture influences financial markets A potential bridge between political supporters and cryptocurrency adoption Current $TRUMP Price Analysis and Market Position Understanding where TRUMP meme coin stands today is crucial for making informed predictions about its future trajectory. The token has experienced volatility characteristic of both meme coins and politically-sensitive assets, with price movements often correlating with news cycles and political developments rather than traditional financial metrics. Key factors influencing current $TRUMP price include: Political event cycles and election-related news Overall cryptocurrency market sentiment Social media engagement and community activity Trading volume and liquidity on major exchanges Regulatory developments affecting political tokens TRUMP Meme Coin Price Prediction 2026: The First Major Milestone Looking toward 2026, several scenarios could unfold for TRUMP meme coin. This period represents the first major test of whether political meme coins can maintain relevance beyond immediate election cycles. Our analysis suggests three potential paths for $TRUMP price in 2026: Scenario Price Range Key Drivers Bullish Political Climate $8 – $15 Favorable election results, increased adoption, strong crypto market Neutral Market Conditions $3 – $7 Moderate political relevance, steady community growth Bearish Regulatory Environment $0.50 – $2 Regulatory crackdowns, decreased political relevance, crypto winter The most likely outcome for 2026 depends heavily on the political landscape and how cryptocurrency regulations evolve. If political engagement remains high and the token develops additional utility beyond mere speculation, the upper ranges become more plausible. $TRUMP Price Prediction 2027: Building Momentum or Fading Relevance? By 2027, the TRUMP meme coin will either establish itself as a lasting political cryptocurrency or begin to fade into obscurity. This period will test whether meme coins tied to specific individuals can maintain value between major political cycles. Several factors will determine the 2027 price trajectory: Community Development: Has the $TRUMP community built sustainable infrastructure? Utility Expansion: Has the token developed uses beyond political expression? Market Integration: Is $TRUMP listed on major exchanges with sufficient liquidity? Political Continuity: Does the associated political movement maintain momentum? Our cryptocurrency price prediction models suggest a 2027 range between $5 and $20, with the higher end achievable only if the token transitions from pure meme status to having tangible utility within political fundraising or governance systems. Meme Coin Forecast 2030: The Path to $50 and Beyond The ultimate question for long-term investors is whether TRUMP meme coin can reach the psychological milestone of $50 by 2030. This would represent an extraordinary return for early investors and would require a perfect storm of favorable conditions. Let’s examine what needs to happen for this ambitious target: Requirements for $50 $TRUMP Price by 2030: Mass adoption within political fundraising ecosystems Development of real-world utility beyond speculative trading Sustained political relevance of the associated figure through 2030 Favorable cryptocurrency regulatory environment globally Integration with emerging political technology platforms Mainstream financial institution acceptance or investment While $50 represents an extreme bullish case, more conservative meme coin forecast models suggest a 2030 range between $10 and $30. The higher end of this range would still represent significant returns for current investors while being more grounded in realistic market development projections. Risks and Challenges for Political Cryptocurrency Investments Investing in TRUMP meme coin carries unique risks that distinguish it from traditional cryptocurrency investments. As a political cryptocurrency, $TRUMP faces challenges that go beyond typical market volatility: Regulatory Uncertainty: Political tokens may face specific regulatory scrutiny Event Risk: Price can swing dramatically based on single political events Relevance Decay: Political figures naturally fade from prominence over time Concentration Risk: Value tied too closely to one individual’s fortunes Market Perception: Many traditional investors avoid politically-charged assets These challenges don’t necessarily preclude investment success, but they require different risk management strategies compared to more traditional cryptocurrencies. Comparative Analysis: TRUMP Meme Coin vs. Other Political Cryptocurrencies To better understand $TRUMP’s potential, it helps to examine how similar political cryptocurrencies have performed. While direct comparisons are limited due to the unique nature of each political figure, we can observe patterns: Political Token Peak Performance Sustainability Key Learning TRUMP Meme Coin Current asset To be determined Largest political token by market cap Other political tokens Varied significantly Generally poor long-term Most fade after election cycles Generic meme coins Extreme volatility Community-dependent Few maintain multi-year relevance This comparison suggests that while political cryptocurrencies can experience dramatic short-term movements, their long-term sustainability remains unproven. $TRUMP’s relative size and community strength give it advantages over previous attempts, but historical patterns warrant caution. Actionable Insights for $TRUMP Investors Based on our comprehensive cryptocurrency price prediction analysis, here are actionable insights for current and potential $TRUMP investors: Diversify Appropriately: Never allocate more than 5% of a crypto portfolio to highly speculative political tokens Monitor Political Cycles: Time entries and exits based on election calendars and major political events Watch Regulatory Developments: Political tokens face unique regulatory risks that require close monitoring Community Engagement: Active participation in $TRUMP communities provides early signals of momentum shifts Technical Analysis: Despite political drivers, traditional chart patterns still provide valuable trading signals Exit Strategy: Establish clear profit-taking and loss-cutting levels before investing FAQs About TRUMP Meme Coin Price Prediction What is the highest price TRUMP meme coin could reach by 2030? Based on current models and comparable assets, the highest plausible price for $TRUMP by 2030 is approximately $30-35 under ideal conditions. The $50 target represents an extreme bullish case requiring unprecedented adoption. How does political cryptocurrency differ from traditional cryptocurrency? Political cryptocurrencies like TRUMP meme coin derive value primarily from cultural and political relevance rather than technological utility. Their price movements correlate more strongly with political events than with blockchain development milestones. What exchanges list TRUMP meme coin for trading? $TRUMP is available on several decentralized exchanges and some centralized platforms. Availability varies by region due to regulatory considerations surrounding political tokens. How reliable are long-term cryptocurrency price predictions? All long-term predictions, especially for meme coins and political cryptocurrencies, should be viewed as speculative scenarios rather than reliable forecasts. Market conditions, regulatory changes, and political developments can dramatically alter trajectories. Who created TRUMP meme coin? Like most meme coins, $TRUMP was created by anonymous developers. The token is not officially affiliated with Donald Trump or his political organizations, though it trades on his name and image recognition. Conclusion: The Volatile Future of Political Cryptocurrency The journey of TRUMP meme coin toward 2030 will test whether political cryptocurrencies can evolve from internet curiosities to legitimate investment assets. While the path to $50 appears steep and fraught with challenges, the very existence of serious discussion about such targets demonstrates how dramatically cryptocurrency markets have evolved. The $TRUMP phenomenon represents more than just another meme coin—it’s a case study in how politics, culture, and finance intersect in the digital age. Whether you view it as a serious investment or political expression, its trajectory will provide valuable insights into the future of both cryptocurrency and political engagement.

Official data shows that the series achieved a staggering total trading volume exceeding 14 billion USDT, attracted more than 90,000 participants, and distributed nearly 1 million USDT in rewards. This year-end finale ignited strong trader enthusiasm and significantly enhanced platform liquidity and market depth, marking a standout milestone for the 2025 crypto market. Diversified Gameplay: A Multi-Dimensional Trading Arena The HTX Trading Championship featured three core competitions: the Points Contest, the Trading Challenge, and Team Battles, with dual tracks covering both spot and futures markets. This diversified structure was designed to cater to a wide range of investors, accommodating different risk appetites and strategic styles. The Trading Challenge alone drew approximately 56,000 participants. Ultimately, the top-ranking champions in both the spot and futures tracks each secured 17.4 billion $HTX, underscoring the event’s premium reward structure and the formidable skill of these elite traders. The Team Battles emerged as the event’s most intense arena. With 126 teams competing, the tournament evolved into a high-stakes masterclass in capital management, risk control, and strategic execution, testing both individual expertise and the power of coordinated team synergy. ● Spot Team Battle: Where Steady Gains Meet Mojobet Moves The Spot Team Battle unfolded as a showcase of sharply contrasting strategies, with teams taking markedly different paths in pursuit of victory. “Justin’s Disciple” secured first place with a total spot trading volume of 196,238,205 USDT, earning the championship reward, equivalent to $40,000 in $HTX. Composed of seasoned spot traders deeply engaged in both mainstream and trending assets, the team adhered to a disciplined strategy centered on steady execution. By concentrating on high-liquidity assets such as BTC and ETH , and employing a shift-based rotation during periods of market volatility, the team ensured uninterrupted trading momentum. This systematic, stability-driven approach allowed them to maintain a commanding lead throughout the competition. In contrast, third-place finishers “Meta Knights” delivered a remarkable dark-horse performance driven by unconventional tactics. With a keen instinct for altcoins and sector-specific trends, the team specialized in capturing short-term, high-impact opportunities. After starting as low as 16th place, they launched a decisive comeback in the final five days of the event. Through close-knit community coordination and real-time information sharing, “Meta Knights” seized multiple critical market windows, surging into the top three and demonstrating the power of agile, collaborative strategy. ● Futures Team Battles: A Triumph of Unity and Technical Conviction The Futures Team Battles delivered an even more intense level of competition, serving as a rigorous test of both psychological resilience and technical mastery to determine the most elite trading teams. “Little Azure Dragon Community” claimed first place with an extraordinary total futures trading volume of 420,986,491 USDT, securing the $40,000 grand prize in $HTX. The team brought together long-standing community members and seasoned futures traders who demonstrated exceptional discipline and execution throughout the extended competition. United by the mantra “move fast and push forward together”, they operated a 24/7 trading relay that sustained continuous participation and momentum. This level of coordination earned them recognition as the most cohesive and resilient team of the entire tournament. Finishing third in the Futures Team Battles, “Tiandao Smart Contract” stood out as a team rooted in Web3 development and technical rigor. The team was united by the philosophy that “code is law” and a shared commitment to on-chain fairness, pursuing a markedly different strategy from sentiment-driven competitors. Rather than relying on aggressive market calls, they emphasized logical decision-making and systematic collaboration. Starting from seventh place early in the event, their calm and methodical execution enabled a steady climb to the podium, highlighting the distinctive strength of technical conviction in futures trading.

The first Bitcoin-focused government wallet reportedly saw widespread accusations of identity theft, fraud and bugs, leading to accounts being frozen. Last year, one of the architects of the Chivo wallet said that the government should shut down the wallet application “due to the controversy it has generated since its launch.” In 2024, El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion IMF loan after the nation’s Bitcoin adoption strained IMF relations. At the time, Stacy Herbert, director of Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office, said Chivo wallet “ will be sold or wound down .” However, several private sector Bitcoin wallets will continue serving El Salvador, she noted. IMF Continues Bitcoin Discussions With El Salvador In the Tuesday update, the IMF emphasized that further Bitcoin discussions with El Salvador will be centered on factors like transparency and mitigating risks. Further, the IMF praised the Central American nation for its economic growth, which it says is “expanding at a faster than anticipated.” “Real GDP growth is projected to reach around 4% this year and with very good prospects for next year,” it added.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are constantly searching for the next big opportunity. Among the numerous blockchain projects vying for attention, Algorand has established itself as a serious contender with its unique Pure Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The burning question on every investor’s mind: Will ALGO price finally break through the psychological $1 barrier in the coming years? This comprehensive analysis examines Algorand’s potential trajectory from 2026 through 2030, combining technical analysis, fundamental factors, and market trends to provide actionable insights for your cryptocurrency investment strategy. Understanding Algorand’s Current Market Position Before diving into specific Algorand price prediction numbers, it’s crucial to understand where ALGO stands today. Algorand was founded by MIT professor Silvio Micali, a Turing Award winner, with the goal of solving the blockchain trilemma: achieving decentralization, security, and scalability simultaneously. The network’s Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining while maintaining robust security. Current ALGO price factors to consider: Market capitalization ranking among top 50 cryptocurrencies Circulating supply and maximum tokenomics Recent partnerships and ecosystem development Technical adoption metrics including transaction volume Key Factors Influencing ALGO Price Movement Several critical elements will determine whether ALGO price can reach the coveted $1 mark. These factors extend beyond simple market sentiment and delve into the fundamental strengths of the Algorand ecosystem. Technological Advancements: Algorand’s ongoing development, including Layer-1 smart contracts, atomic transfers, and co-chains, positions it uniquely in the blockchain space. The network’s ability to process thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees gives it a competitive edge. Institutional Adoption: Major partnerships with governments, financial institutions, and enterprises significantly impact price. Algorand’s work with the Republic of the Marshall Islands for their digital currency and collaborations with various DeFi projects demonstrate real-world utility. Market Cycles and Bitcoin Correlation: Like most altcoins, ALGO exhibits correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. Understanding broader market cycles is essential for accurate cryptocurrency forecast modeling. Algorand Price Prediction 2026: The Foundation Year By 2026, we expect Algorand to have solidified its position in the blockchain technology landscape. Our analysis suggests several potential scenarios: Scenario Price Range Probability Bullish (Mass Adoption) $0.85 – $1.20 25% Moderate (Steady Growth) $0.45 – $0.80 50% Bearish (Market Correction) $0.20 – $0.40 25% The bullish scenario depends on several factors: widespread institutional adoption, successful implementation of major ecosystem projects, and favorable regulatory developments. If Algorand becomes the preferred blockchain for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or major financial applications, the $1 target becomes increasingly plausible. ALGO Price Forecast 2027-2028: The Growth Phase Between 2027 and 2028, we anticipate accelerated growth for Algorand as blockchain technology becomes more integrated into mainstream finance and enterprise applications. During this period, several developments could propel ALGO price upward: Expansion of DeFi and NFT ecosystems on Algorand Increased staking participation and reduced circulating supply Technological upgrades improving network efficiency Broader cryptocurrency market recovery and growth Our 2027-2028 Algorand price prediction ranges from $0.60 to $1.50 in moderate scenarios, with potential spikes to $2.00 in extremely bullish market conditions. The key determinant will be whether Algorand can capture significant market share from competing layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Cryptocurrency Forecast 2029-2030: Long-Term Vision Looking further ahead to 2029-2030, our analysis incorporates broader technological and economic trends. By this time, blockchain technology should be more deeply integrated into global systems, potentially creating new valuation models for networks like Algorand. Critical considerations for long-term cryptocurrency forecast accuracy: Global regulatory frameworks for digital assets Adoption of blockchain in traditional finance Technological innovations beyond current capabilities Macroeconomic factors including inflation and monetary policy Our conservative 2030 Algorand price prediction suggests a range of $1.50 to $3.00, assuming steady adoption and technological execution. More optimistic scenarios, accounting for breakthrough applications and mass adoption, could see ALGO reaching $5.00 to $10.00. Will ALGO Price Hit $1? The Verdict Based on our comprehensive analysis, the probability of ALGO price reaching $1 appears strong within our forecast period. The timing, however, depends on multiple variables aligning favorably. Our assessment suggests: 2026-2027: Moderate probability (40-60%) of reaching $1, depending largely on broader market conditions and specific ecosystem developments. 2028-2030: High probability (70-85%) of sustaining prices above $1, assuming continued technological development and adoption. The path to $1 requires several conditions: sustained development of the Algorand ecosystem, increased real-world utility, favorable regulatory environments, and overall growth in cryptocurrency adoption. While challenges exist, Algorand’s strong technological foundation and growing partnerships position it well for future growth. Risks and Challenges for Algorand Investors Every crypto investment carries inherent risks, and Algorand is no exception. Potential challenges include: Intense competition from other layer-1 and layer-2 solutions Regulatory uncertainty in key markets Technological vulnerabilities or security concerns Market volatility affecting all cryptocurrency assets Execution risk in partnership and development timelines Successful investors balance these risks against Algorand’s strong fundamentals: a proven consensus mechanism, growing ecosystem, and legitimate institutional interest. Actionable Investment Insights For those considering Algorand as part of their crypto investment portfolio, several strategies emerge from our analysis: Dollar-Cost Averaging: Regular investments over time can mitigate timing risk Portfolio Allocation: Consider Algorand as part of a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio Staking Participation: Earn rewards while supporting network security Ecosystem Engagement: Explore DeFi, NFTs, and other applications on Algorand Continuous Research: Stay informed about technological and partnership developments FAQs About Algorand Price Predictions What is Algorand’s maximum supply? Algorand has a fixed maximum supply of 10 billion ALGO tokens, with specific release schedules and mechanisms to control inflation. Who founded Algorand? Algorand was founded by Silvio Micali , a renowned MIT professor and Turing Award winner for his contributions to cryptography. How does Algorand differ from Ethereum? Algorand uses Pure Proof-of-Stake consensus versus Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, offering different trade-offs in decentralization, speed, and security. What major companies use Algorand? Algorand has partnerships with various organizations including ISDA for derivatives, and several governments for digital currency initiatives. Is staking ALGO profitable? Staking ALGO provides rewards while helping secure the network, with returns varying based on participation levels and network conditions. Conclusion: The Path Forward for Algorand Our comprehensive Algorand price prediction analysis suggests a promising future for ALGO, with a strong likelihood of reaching and sustaining prices above $1 within our forecast period. The combination of robust technology, growing ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest creates a favorable environment for long-term growth. However, investors must remain cognizant of the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets and the competitive landscape of blockchain technology. The journey to $1 represents more than just a price milestone—it symbolizes Algorand’s potential to deliver on its promise of creating a borderless, efficient, and inclusive economy. As with any investment, thorough research, risk management, and patience will be key to navigating the exciting but unpredictable world of cryptocurrency investments.

On the other hand, ETHZilla reported selling 24,291 ETH for about $74.5 million to redeem outstanding senior secured convertible notes, reducing its balance to around 69,800 ETH. The filings show that while some Ethereum-focused treasury firms are increasing exposure, others are reducing holdings to address leverage, debt obligations, and liquidity needs. Bitmine’s Treasury Crosses 4 Million ETH Ethereum treasury firm Bitmine crossed a major accumulation milestone after its Ethereum holdings surpassed 4 million tokens this week. The company disclosed on Monday that it now holds more than 4.06 million ETH, which makes it one of the most aggressive corporate holders of the asset globally. The latest increase in holdings comes after Bitmine acquired 13,412 ETH, valued at roughly $40.6 million, according to on-chain data from Lookonchain . This purchase forms part of a broader buying spree over the past week, during which the firm added close to 100,000 ETH to its balance sheet. Bitmine said all of its Ethereum was accumulated at an average purchase price of $2,991 per token. Chairman Tom Lee described the milestone as a big achievement as the company reached this level of accumulation in just over five months. He said Bitmine added 98,852 ETH in the past week alone, pushing total holdings beyond what he described as a “crucial” 4 million ETH threshold. After Ethereum reclaimed the $3,000 level over the weekend, the company’s treasury moved back into profit after being underwater following the October market downturn. At press time, the price of ETH stood closer to $2,993. ETH’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) At current market prices, Bitmine’s Ethereum position is valued at approximately $12.2 billion. The company wants to eventually control 5% of the total Ethereum supply, a target that would represent one of the most concentrated institutional exposures to the Ethereum ecosystem. Based on current figures, Bitmine is already around two-thirds of the way toward that goal, according to data from Strategic ETH Reserve . Beyond accumulation, Bitmine is positioning its Ether holdings as a foundation for future yield generation. The company plans to integrate staking into its treasury strategy in early 2026 through a proprietary initiative called the Made in America Validator Network, or MAVAN. Lee said the staking platform is designed to offer what the firm believes will be best-in-class, secure infrastructure for generating additional value for shareholders. Shares in Bitmine surged more than 600% over the past six months, with its Ethereum-focused treasury emerging as a key driver of the rally. ETHZilla Cuts ETH Holdings On the other hand, crypto treasury firm ETHZilla recently sold a portion of its Ethereum holdings to shore up its balance sheet. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company revealed that it sold 24,291 ETH for proceeds of roughly $74.5 million, at an average price of $3,068.69 per token. After the transaction, ETHZilla said it held approximately 69,800 ETH. According to the filing, the company plans to use all or a big portion of the sale proceeds to redeem its outstanding senior secured convertible notes. The move forms part of the growing trend among digital-asset treasury companies to reduce leverage and improve liquidity. ETHZilla only recently adopted its Ethereum-focused strategy. The company rebranded from 180 Life Sciences Corp on July 29, which was a decisive shift away from its former identity as a clinical-stage biotechnology firm. Before the pivot, the company’s shares collapsed more than 99.9% since its 2020 public listing. Since the rebrand, ETHZilla wanted to reposition itself as a crypto-native investment vehicle, though its stock performance has remained under pressure. In December, the company announced two strategic acquisitions, taking a 20% fully diluted stake in automotive finance-focused AI startup Karus and a 15% stake in digital housing lender Zippy. Despite these moves, ETHZilla’s shares closed down 8.7% on Monday and are more than 65% lower year-to-date, according to Google Finance data . ETHZilla YTD share price (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The sale also comes during a recalibration among publicly traded crypto treasury companies. Corporate adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum has accelerated, with roughly 190 listed companies now holding Bitcoin and 27 public firms collectively holding about 6 million ETH, or roughly 5% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. However, with Bitcoin and major altcoins pulling back from record levels, some companies started liquidating digital assets to manage debt and strengthen balance sheets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-23 05:30:00

The token last traded near $2,978 on Tuesday, down nearly 40% from its peak, even as it has climbed almost 6% over the past month. BitMine, listed as BitMine Immersion Technologies under the ticker BMNR, has pitched Ethereum as its primary treasury asset, turning its balance sheet into a vehicle for building a large, concentrated stake in the network. BitMine Controls More Than 3% Of Ethereum Supply A dashboard from StrategicEthReserve.xyz lists BitMine as now holding about 4.07M ETH worth roughly $12.15B, and pegged that stash at 3.36% of supply. It also places BitMine well ahead of the next entries it tracks, including SharpLink Gaming at about 863,020 ETH and The Ether Machine at about 496,710 ETH, with the Ethereum Foundation listed at about 229,470 ETH. In its own messaging, BitMine has framed its goal as an “Alchemy of 5%,” a push to reach a 5% stake of all ETH, turning each incremental buy into a milestone watched closely by traders. BitMine appears to be betting that a big ETH reserve becomes more valuable as staking economics mature, institutional rails expand and Ethereum remains the settlement layer for stablecoins and tokenized assets.

New data confirms a harsh reality: Bitcoin has posted its worst quarterly performance in over five years . With a decline exceeding 22%, this marks the most significant Bitcoin quarterly loss since the bear market of 2018. Let’s unpack what drove this downturn and what it signals for the future of the flagship cryptocurrency. How Severe Was This Bitcoin Quarterly Loss? The numbers are stark. According to data from CoinGlass, Bitcoin’s return for the fourth quarter settled at -22%. This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s the largest quarterly decline on record since 2018. For context, that period was followed by a prolonged ‘crypto winter.’ Therefore, this performance has naturally rattled investor confidence and sparked debates about the market’s current health. Several factors converged to create this perfect storm: Macroeconomic Pressure: Rising interest rates and persistent inflation continued to squeeze risk assets globally. Industry Contagion: The fallout from major crypto firm failures earlier in the year continued to erode trust. Regulatory Uncertainty: A lack of clear regulatory frameworks in key markets added to the hesitation. Is the Recent Price Bounce a Real Recovery? You might see green on the charts some days and wonder if the worst is over. However, experts urge caution. Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, provides a sobering perspective. He characterizes recent upward moves as a technical rebound , not a sign of genuine, fundamental recovery. “The optimism from the first half of the year has been replaced by disappointment,” Kuptsikevich noted. His analysis suggests the market is merely attempting to recoup year-to-date losses, and investors should avoid over-interpreting short-term momentum. This distinction is crucial for anyone making decisions based on daily price action. What Can Investors Learn From This Downturn? While a major Bitcoin quarterly loss is daunting, it also offers valuable lessons. History shows that Bitcoin’s market cycles include periods of intense volatility. These phases test the conviction of long-term holders and shake out speculative excess. For disciplined investors, such corrections can present opportunities, but they require a strategic mindset, not a reactive one. Here are actionable insights for navigating this climate: Look Beyond the Noise: Focus on long-term adoption trends, like institutional interest, rather than quarterly price swings. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount regularly, which can lower the average purchase price during downturns. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your Bitcoin is held in a secure, self-custody wallet, not left on an exchange. Conclusion: Navigating the Aftermath of a Major Setback The 22% Bitcoin quarterly loss is a significant marker, reminding everyone that crypto remains a high-volatility asset class. It underscores the importance of risk management, realistic expectations, and a focus on technology’s long-term potential over short-term price speculation. While analyst warnings about ‘false recoveries’ are valid, each cycle also builds resilience. The key is to learn from this data, adjust strategies accordingly, and avoid letting fear or fleeting hype drive financial decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How does this 22% loss compare to Bitcoin’s historical performance? A: This is Bitcoin’s worst quarterly performance since Q4 2018, which saw a decline of over 44%. While severe, such drawdowns have occurred before within its volatile history. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin after this news? A: Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon, not solely on quarterly performance. Many investors view downturns as accumulation phases. Q: What is a ‘technical rebound’ versus a ‘genuine recovery’? A: A technical rebound is a short-term price rise often driven by traders covering short positions or bouncing from a key support level. A genuine recovery is sustained by positive fundamentals like increased adoption, regulation clarity, or macroeconomic improvement. Q: Does this mean a prolonged ‘crypto winter’ is coming? A> Not necessarily. While parallels to 2018 exist, the current ecosystem is more mature with stronger institutional infrastructure. However, periods of consolidation or lower prices can follow major declines. Q: Where can I find reliable data on Bitcoin’s performance? A> Reputable sources include data aggregators like CoinGlass and CoinGecko, along with analysis from established financial news platforms that cover crypto markets.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are constantly searching for the next promising opportunity. Among the numerous blockchain projects vying for attention, Hedera Hashgraph has emerged as a distinctive player with its unique consensus mechanism. The burning question on every crypto enthusiast’s mind is: What does the future hold for HBAR price? In this comprehensive analysis, we’ll explore detailed Hedera price predictions from 2026 through 2030 and examine whether HBAR can realistically reach the significant $0.5 threshold. Understanding Hedera Hashgraph and HBAR Fundamentals Before diving into specific price predictions, it’s crucial to understand what makes Hedera Hashgraph different. Unlike traditional blockchain networks, Hedera uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) consensus algorithm called Hashgraph. This technology claims to offer higher throughput, lower fees, and enhanced security compared to conventional blockchains. The native cryptocurrency, HBAR, serves multiple purposes within the ecosystem: Network fees for transactions and smart contracts Staking to help secure the network Governance participation through the Hedera Governing Council These fundamental characteristics directly influence the long-term HBAR price potential and form the basis of our Hedera price prediction analysis. Current Market Position and Historical Performance To make accurate forecasts, we must examine HBAR’s historical performance and current market standing. Since its mainnet launch in 2019, Hedera has experienced typical cryptocurrency volatility while gradually building its ecosystem. The project has secured notable partnerships with corporations like Google, IBM, and Boeing through its Governing Council model, providing institutional credibility that many crypto projects lack. Year All-Time High Key Developments 2021 $0.57 Major exchange listings, governance expansion 2022 $0.33 Market downturn, continued partnership growth 2023 $0.09 Network upgrades, DeFi expansion Hedera Price Prediction 2026: The Near-Term Outlook Looking ahead to 2026, several factors will influence the HBAR price trajectory. By this time, we expect broader adoption of Hedera’s enterprise solutions and potentially significant developments in its decentralized finance ecosystem. Most analysts project a conservative range between $0.15 and $0.25 for 2026, assuming moderate market growth and continued technological advancement. However, achieving the upper end of this range depends on several critical factors: Successful implementation of planned network upgrades Expansion of real-world use cases beyond pilot programs Overall cryptocurrency market recovery and institutional adoption This cryptocurrency forecast suggests steady but not explosive growth in the medium term. HBAR Price Projection for 2027: Building Momentum The year 2027 could represent a turning point for Hedera Hashgraph if current development trajectories continue. By this time, the network should have demonstrated its scalability advantages in production environments across multiple industries. Our analysis suggests a potential price range of $0.20 to $0.35, with the possibility of breaking above this range if: Enterprise adoption accelerates significantly The network achieves substantial decentralization milestones Cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks become clearer globally This period represents a crucial test for Hedera’s value proposition and its ability to capture meaningful market share from competing platforms. The 2030 Horizon: Can HBAR Reach $0.5? Now we arrive at the central question: Will HBAR price hit $0.5 by 2030? Based on current growth patterns, technological roadmap, and market dynamics, this target appears ambitious but achievable under favorable conditions. A comprehensive Hedera price prediction for 2030 must consider both optimistic and conservative scenarios: Scenario Price Range Key Assumptions Conservative $0.25 – $0.35 Moderate adoption, competitive market Moderate $0.35 – $0.50 Strong enterprise adoption, clear regulations Optimistic $0.50 – $0.75 Mass adoption, technological breakthroughs Reaching $0.5 would require Hedera to overcome several challenges while capitalizing on its unique advantages. The most critical factors include: Substantial growth in transaction volume and network utility Successful competition against established smart contract platforms Favorable macroeconomic conditions for cryptocurrency investments Factors That Could Accelerate or Hinder HBAR Growth No cryptocurrency forecast is complete without examining the variables that could dramatically alter the trajectory. For Hedera Hashgraph, several specific factors deserve particular attention: Potential Growth Accelerators Enterprise Adoption: Continued expansion of the Governing Council and enterprise use cases Regulatory Clarity: Favorable regulations that recognize Hedera’s compliance advantages Technological Edge: Demonstrated superiority in speed, cost, and energy efficiency Ecosystem Development: Growth of DeFi, NFTs, and other applications on the network Potential Challenges Competition: Intense rivalry from other layer-1 and enterprise blockchain solutions Decentralization Concerns: Perceptions about the Governing Council structure Market Volatility: Broader cryptocurrency market cycles and investor sentiment Execution Risk: Ability to deliver on technological promises and roadmap Expert Opinions and Comparative Analysis Various cryptocurrency analysts and platforms have published their own Hedera price prediction models. While these forecasts vary, most acknowledge Hedera’s unique position in the enterprise blockchain space. When compared to similar projects, Hedera often receives praise for its governance model and enterprise partnerships but faces questions about its decentralization and community-driven development. Investment Considerations and Risk Management For investors considering HBAR as part of their portfolio, several practical considerations emerge from our analysis: Time Horizon: Hedera appears better suited for medium to long-term investment strategies Portfolio Allocation: Given the risks, conservative position sizing is recommended Monitoring Indicators: Track network metrics, partnership announcements, and development activity Exit Strategy: Establish clear profit-taking and loss-limiting parameters Frequently Asked Questions What is Hedera Hashgraph and how does it differ from blockchain? Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology that uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) consensus algorithm instead of traditional blockchain. This approach claims to offer higher throughput, lower fees, and enhanced security. The network is governed by the Hedera Governing Council , which includes organizations like Google , IBM , and Boeing . Who created Hedera Hashgraph? Hedera Hashgraph was invented by Dr. Leemon Baird , who serves as the co-founder and chief scientist. The commercial entity behind the network is Hedera Hashgraph, LLC, with Mance Harmon serving as co-founder and CEO. What are the main use cases for HBAR? HBAR serves as the native cryptocurrency of the Hedera network, used for paying transaction fees, running smart contracts, and participating in network security through staking. The network supports various applications including payments, tokenization, and decentralized identity solutions. How does Hedera’s governance work? Hedera uses a unique governance model through its Governing Council, which currently comprises up to 39 leading global organizations from diverse industries. This structure is designed to ensure stability, decentralized governance, and trusted node operation. Is Hedera more energy efficient than other cryptocurrencies? Yes, Hedera claims significantly higher energy efficiency compared to proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin. The Hashgraph consensus algorithm requires less computational power, making it more environmentally friendly while maintaining security. Conclusion: The Path to $0.5 and Beyond Our comprehensive analysis of Hedera price prediction from 2026 to 2030 reveals a project with substantial potential but significant challenges. The question of whether HBAR price can hit $0.5 by 2030 depends largely on execution, adoption, and market conditions. While the conservative scenario suggests more modest growth, the optimistic outlook—driven by enterprise adoption and technological advantages—makes the $0.5 target plausible. Investors should approach this cryptocurrency forecast with balanced expectations, recognizing both Hedera’s unique value proposition and the competitive landscape it must navigate. The journey to 2030 will test whether Hedera Hashgraph can translate its technological innovation and enterprise partnerships into sustained value creation for HBAR holders.

Once viewed as relatively resilient within the speculative crypto space, DOGE is now under pressure after losing key technical structure and momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Feels The Weight Of Quantum Risk Concerns, Industry Leaders Warn DOGE is down about 66% over the past year and trades near $0.13, far below levels that previously drew consistent buying. The decline reflects thinner liquidity, weaker speculative interest, and a market increasingly favoring assets with clearer narratives, suggesting that market size alone may no longer be a price support. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Key Support Gives Way as Selling Pressure Builds In the past week, Dogecoin (DOGE) slipped below the $0.129 area, a level that had capped losses through several consolidation phases. The breakdown was accompanied by elevated trading volume, signaling active selling rather than a slow drift lower. Intraday volatility expanded to around 4%, reflecting heightened sensitivity as traders reacted to the loss of range support. Technical analysts note that DOGE has also broken a multi-year ascending trendline that guided price action through much of the 2024 cycle. On shorter timeframes, the token now trades below key moving averages, with rebounds toward $0.132–$0.134 consistently meeting selling interest. Technical Signals Point to a Fragile Dogecoin Structure Momentum indicators continue to lean lower, and several analysts warn that failure to hold the nearby $0.128 level could expose DOGE to deeper downside. Below that, the next widely watched support zone sits near $0.090, implying a potential decline of around 30% from current levels if bearish pressure accelerates. Ichimoku-based signals have also turned negative, reinforcing the view that the broader trend has shifted. While short-term countertrend patterns occasionally emerge, they carry less weight against the backdrop of a confirmed break in higher-timeframe structure. Long-Term Outlook Faces a Test Into 2026 Beyond charts, Dogecoin’s longer-term outlook remains uncertain. Spot DOGE ETFs launched in late 2025 introduced a new source of demand, but it is still unclear whether that capital will prove sticky enough to offset ongoing selling. Meanwhile, discussions around adding utility through sidechains or layer-2 solutions continue within the developer community, though progress has been slow and fragmented.

Matt Sigel, the company’s crypto research lead, and Patrick Bush, a senior investment analyst, said that in the past, when BTC’s hashrate decline persisted, the market typically responded with larger and more frequent rallies. However, many Bitcoiners still believe a sustained drop in hashrate signals larger issues in the mining industry, a view VanEck believes could trigger a strong sell-off and significantly impact prices. Bitcoin’s average 180-day returns were better when hashing power declined than when it rose The investment management firm presented several examples in its report on Monday that illustrate how hashrate declines tend to benefit long-term holders of Bitcoin. It noted that BTC has delivered positive 90-day returns about 65% of the time following a 30-day drop in hashrate since 2014, versus 54% following hashrate increases. Moreover, for the same timeframe, when 90-day hashrate growth turned negative, Bitcoin posted positive six-month returns 77% of the time, averaging gains of about 72%. In times of hashrate increases, BTC still posted positive six-month returns around 61% of the time, though gains only averaged about 48%. Overall, the average six-month returns for Bitcoin have been about 30 basis points higher during periods of falling hashrate than during periods of rising hashrate. The data also suggests that a negative 90-day hashrate growth has been a materially better entry point for six-month returns, adding around 2,400 basis points. As of now, Bitcoin’s network hashing power (on a 30-day moving average) has declined roughly 4% over the last month, the biggest drop since April 2024. The mining slowdown has been compounded by news from China’s Xinjiang region, where 1.3 GW of capacity has been shut down following inspections by government officials. Jack Kong, the former head of Canaan, confirmed that China’s mining activities lost approximately 400,000 machines, resulting in a decrease in hashpower of about 100 exahashes per second in just a single day. That comes a month after China was disclosed as the third globally in mining activity, supplying about 14% of the network’s hashrate. Nonetheless, many countries remain involved in the BTC mining industry, with estimates suggesting up to 13 are actively supporting it, including Russia, France, Bhutan, Iran, El Salvador , the UAE, Oman, Ethiopia, Argentina, Kenya, and, more recently, Japan. Bitcoin’s price tumbled 9% in the last 30 days The last 30 days have seen the price of Bitcoin plummet 9%. In the past 30 days, the price of Bitcoin has declined by 9%, while 30-day volatility has climbed above 45%, a level not seen since April 2025. Bitcoin hit its lowest on November 22, trading at around $80,700 — bringing the 30-day RSI to around 32. Discontinuous speculative demand left perpetual future basis rates at 5% annualized, dipping as low as 3.7%, compared to the annual average of 7.4%. On-chain data for Bitcoin presents another gloomy image: the hash rate fell 1% month-over-month, daily fees decreased by 14%, and the number of active addresses was down 1%. On the upbeat side, over the last 30 days, Bitcoin DATs increased purchases, accumulating 42k BTC (+4% m/m) from mid-November to mid-December, totaling 1.09 million BTC. That’s the largest purchase since mid-July to mid-August 2025, when DATs totaled 128.1k BTC.

The clip featured comments from Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg that contrasted with the market’s recent volatility. The remarks focused on ETF launch dynamics and pointed to a shift in who is paying attention to XRP. ChartNerd sees the moment as significant. He emphasized that the comments came directly from an ETF issuer now active in the market. He also noted that the interest described was not limited to speculative traders, as institutional investors are now joining the XRP market . $XRP : This is HUGE! Canary Capital CEO Stephen McClurg just stated that: 1) Global pension funds and insurance companies are showing a lot of interest in $XRP ETFs. 2) $XRP is the ""rails for the financial system"" and is an asset that Wall St actually gets. Bullish pic.twitter.com/MisibfYoXo — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 20, 2025 McClurg Describes Two Distinct Waves of Demand In the video, McClurg explained how new ETFs typically attract capital. He said retail participation tends to arrive first, especially during the opening weeks of trading. That pattern held following Canary Capital’s launch. The firm’s XRP ETF recorded $58 million in volume on its first day , reflecting strong initial engagement. McClurg then described what followed. He stated that after the initial retail phase, Canary Capital began receiving outreach from large institutional investors. “Then we started getting calls from pension funds and insurance companies globally,” he said. He identified these groups as the second segment Canary actively markets to, adding that interest from this cohort has been substantial. His comments suggested a deliberate progression rather than a sudden surge. Retail investors tested the product. Institutional allocators then began evaluating it within their own frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Role Resonates With Traditional Finance McClurg attributed part of that interest to how XRP is perceived by established financial players. He said XRP is “an asset that most of Wall Street and most of the global capital markets get.” He tied that understanding to XRP’s intended function within payment infrastructure. “It’s easy to understand,” he said. “It’s the rails for the financial system .” By sharing the video, ChartNerd placed McClurg’s comments within the context of XRP’s long-term positioning. He stressed that global pension funds and insurance companies are showing interest in XRP ETFs. Wall Street’s recognition of the asset’s role is bullish. Interest in XRP is arriving from segments that move slowly, speak carefully, and commit capital with intent. The asset has become much more than a speculative investment, and experts anticipate that 2026 will bring greater results for the asset.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are constantly searching for the next big opportunity. Hyperliquid (HYPE) has emerged as a promising project capturing attention across trading communities. But what does the future hold for this digital asset? Our comprehensive Hyperliquid price prediction analysis examines the potential trajectory from 2026 through 2030, exploring whether HYPE can achieve new all-time highs and what factors will drive its growth. Understanding Hyperliquid and the HYPE Token Hyperliquid operates as a decentralized exchange protocol built on innovative blockchain technology. The HYPE token serves multiple functions within the ecosystem, including governance rights, fee discounts, and staking rewards. Unlike many speculative tokens, Hyperliquid focuses on solving real problems in decentralized finance, particularly around liquidity provision and trading efficiency. The project’s technical foundation and growing adoption create a solid base for future price appreciation. Current Market Analysis and Technical Indicators Before diving into long-term predictions, we must examine current market conditions. HYPE has shown resilience during market downturns and strong performance during bull cycles. Key technical indicators including moving averages, RSI levels, and trading volume patterns suggest accumulation phases that typically precede significant price movements. The token’s correlation with broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin’s performance, remains a crucial factor in short-term price action. Year Predicted Price Range Key Drivers 2026 $8.50 – $15.75 Mainnet upgrades, exchange listings 2027 $18.25 – $32.40 Institutional adoption, protocol expansion 2028 $35.80 – $58.90 Cross-chain integration, regulatory clarity 2029 $62.50 – $95.30 Mass adoption, competitor consolidation 2030 $105.00 – $165.00+ Full ecosystem maturity, global recognition Hyperliquid Price Prediction 2026: The Foundation Year Our 2026 Hyperliquid price prediction considers several critical factors. By this time, the project should have completed major roadmap milestones including enhanced scalability solutions and broader DeFi integration. Market analysts project that if Hyperliquid maintains its current development pace and captures even 2-3% of the decentralized exchange market, HYPE could reach between $8.50 and $15.75. This represents substantial growth from current levels, driven by: Increased protocol usage and transaction volume Strategic partnerships with major blockchain projects Enhanced token utility through new staking mechanisms Growing recognition in the institutional investment space HYPE Price Trajectory Through 2027-2028 The period between 2027 and 2028 could represent a transformative phase for Hyperliquid. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into traditional finance, protocols offering superior liquidity solutions will gain significant value. Our analysis suggests HYPE price could experience accelerated growth during these years, potentially reaching $32.40 by late 2027 and approaching $58.90 by 2028. Several catalysts could drive this expansion: Regulatory frameworks providing clearer operating environments Cross-chain interoperability becoming standard practice Increased institutional participation in DeFi markets Technological advancements reducing transaction costs Hyperliquid 2030: The Long-Term Vision Looking toward 2030, our Hyperliquid price prediction becomes more ambitious but grounded in technological trends. By this decade’s end, blockchain infrastructure should be mature enough to support massive-scale financial applications. If Hyperliquid establishes itself as a leading liquidity protocol, HYPE could potentially reach triple-digit valuations. Our conservative estimate places the 2030 price range between $105 and $165, with potential for higher peaks during market euphoria phases. This cryptocurrency prediction assumes: Sustained network growth and developer activity Successful navigation of competitive pressures Continuous protocol innovation and adaptation Favorable macroeconomic conditions for digital assets Will HYPE Price Hit A New ATH? Critical Factors to Watch The question every investor wants answered: can HYPE achieve new all-time highs? Our analysis suggests the probability is strong, but dependent on specific conditions being met. A new HYPE ATH requires more than just market momentum—it demands fundamental improvements in the protocol’s value proposition. Key indicators to monitor include: Total value locked (TVL) growth relative to competitors Developer activity and GitHub commit frequency Exchange listings on major centralized platforms Regulatory developments affecting DeFi operations Macroeconomic factors influencing cryptocurrency markets Risks and Challenges in Hyperliquid’s Journey While our Hyperliquid price prediction presents an optimistic outlook, investors must consider potential obstacles. The cryptocurrency space remains volatile and subject to rapid changes. Regulatory uncertainty, technological vulnerabilities, and intense competition could impact HYPE’s trajectory. Additionally, broader market cycles and macroeconomic factors beyond the project’s control will influence price movements. Successful investment requires balancing optimism with realistic risk assessment. Investment Strategies for HYPE Token Based on our Hyperliquid price prediction analysis, several investment approaches could prove effective. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk during volatile periods. Portfolio allocation should reflect individual risk tolerance, with HYPE representing a speculative but potentially rewarding portion. Monitoring key development milestones and market indicators will help investors make informed decisions rather than emotional reactions to price fluctuations. Conclusion: The Future of Hyperliquid Our comprehensive analysis suggests Hyperliquid possesses strong fundamentals for long-term growth. While short-term volatility is inevitable in cryptocurrency markets, the project’s focus on solving real liquidity problems positions it well for sustained adoption. The HYPE price prediction from 2026 through 2030 indicates significant appreciation potential, with the possibility of reaching new all-time highs during strong market cycles. However, success depends on continued development execution, favorable market conditions, and broader blockchain adoption trends.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s hashrate fell 4% in December, a pattern VanEck says has historically preceded stronger price returns. Miner profitability is under pressure as lower BTC prices and higher costs force capacity offline. Part of the hashrate decline may be permanent, with mining power shifting toward AI workloads. In a note published Monday , VanEck’s head of crypto research Matt Sigel and senior investment analyst Patrick Bush described sustained declines in hashrate as a historically bullish signal. The metric, which tracks the total computational power securing the Bitcoin network, is often viewed as a proxy for miner confidence and profitability. “When hash rate compression persists over longer periods, positive forward returns tend to occur more often and with greater magnitude,” the analysts wrote. Bitcoin Historically Posts Stronger Returns After Hashrate Declines: VanEck Since 2014, Bitcoin’s 90-day forward returns have been positive 65% of the time following a 30-day decline in hashrate, compared with 54% when hashrate increased over the same period. The trend becomes more pronounced over longer horizons. VanEck data shows that negative 90-day hashrate growth has been followed by positive 180-day Bitcoin returns 77% of the time, with an average gain of 72%. That compares with a 61% positive return rate when hashrate rose. The decline comes at a challenging moment for miners. Bitcoin is trading around $88,400, nearly 30% below its Oct. 6 all-time high of $126,080, according to CoinGecko. Lower prices, combined with rising operational costs in some regions, have squeezed margins across the sector. ICYMI: #VanEck highlights miner capitulation as a possible #Bitcoin bottom. Hashrate fell 4% in 30 days, the sharpest drop since April 2024. Historically, similar declines have led to higher prices 65% of the time over the next 90 days. pic.twitter.com/y6Nw0x7jeJ — Coin Edition: Your Crypto News Edge (@CoinEdition) December 23, 2025 Sigel and Bush highlighted that the breakeven electricity cost for a 2022-era Bitmain S19 XP miner, one of the most widely used machines, has dropped nearly 36% year over year, from $0.12 per kilowatt-hour in December 2024 to roughly $0.077/kWh by mid-December. The sharp decline reflects how many miners have been forced to shut down or operate at a loss. The analysts attributed much of December’s hashrate drop, the steepest since April 2024, to the shutdown of roughly 1.3 gigawatts of mining capacity in China. They added that some of this power may be redirected toward artificial intelligence workloads, a shift that could eventually remove as much as 10% of Bitcoin’s hashrate from the network. State-Backed Bitcoin Mining Expands as Miner Capitulation Signals Recovery Despite near-term pressure, state-backed mining activity continues to expand. VanEck estimates that as many as 13 countries now support Bitcoin mining in some form, including Russia, France, Bhutan, Iran, El Salvador, the UAE, Oman, Ethiopia, Argentina, Kenya and Japan. For investors, the analysts argue that miner capitulation has often marked periods of consolidation that precede broader recoveries.

56219911,647872,1766473210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56219911.jpeg,Internal Data Leak Exposes Binance’s Oversight Failures On ‘Suspicious Accounts’,https://bitcoinist.com/internal-data-leak-binances-oversight-failures/,"The Financial Times has recently reported on alleged compliance breaches at Binance, with leaked internal documents revealing that hundreds of millions of dollars have flowed through accounts flagged for suspicious activity, despite the exchange having committed to enhancing its controls as part of a 2023 settlement with US authorities. Former Prosecutor Flags Binance Activity As Suspicious According to the data reviewed by the Financial Times, multiple accounts associated with alarming red flags—such as links to terror financing, unusual login patterns, and failed identity verifications—continued to operate after the firm’s plea agreement. Among the accounts flagged, 13 suspicious accounts processed $1.7 billion in transactions, with $144 million occurring after the settlement was reached. One particularly questionable account received over $177 million in crypto across two years, exhibiting suspicious behavior like changing its banking details 647 times in just 14 months, cycling through 496 unique accounts across the Americas. Stefan Cassella, a former federal prosecutor, remarked, “That qualifies as suspicious. It looks like someone is acting as a money-transmitting business.” Further deepening the controversy is an account who moved $93 million through Binance between 2021 and 2025. Part of this money allegedly derived from a network later accused by US officials of covertly transferring funds for Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah. Exchange Claims Robust Compliance Measures The leaked documents also show that all 13 accounts received a combined total of $29 million in Tether’s USDT stablecoin from accounts that Israel subsequently froze under anti-terrorism laws. Nearly all of these transactions stemmed from four crypto wallets tied to Tawfiq Al-Law, a Syrian alleged to have funneled funds for Hezbollah and Iran-backed Houthi forces. Israel seized these accounts in May 2023, and the US Treasury sanctioned Al-Law in March 2024. In response to these allegations, Binance asserted that it “maintains strict compliance controls and a zero-tolerance approach to illicit activity,” claiming that it has “robust systems in place to flag and investigate suspicious transactions.” Following the settlement, both the Justice Department and Treasury appointed independent monitors in May 2024 to oversee Binance’s compliance measures. However, many of the transactions the FT examined occurred after this oversight began. Jessica Davis, a former intelligence official from Canada, noted that “a relaxed compliance environment” followed President Trump’s pardon for Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) earlier this year. Davis claimed: Previously, the incentive was: keep your CEO out of jail. Yes, there are fines, but part of the problem is that we’re just talking about so much money being made on these platforms that even a billion-dollar fine becomes fairly meaningless. At the time of writing, the exchange’s native token, BNB, was trading at $867.42. This is over 37% lower than its all-time high of $1,369, which was reached in October of this year.

Amid this volatility, a new artificial intelligence (AI) simulation model has produced price forecasts for the altcoin, offering investors a more detailed outlook for the coming year. XRP Price Predictions Market analyst Sam Daodu recently shared insights from a Monte Carlo simulation that explored XRP’s price trajectory in which 10,000 paths were generated to capture a comprehensive range of potential outcomes. The results offer statistical data such as mean, median, and percentiles, illustrating a probability distribution rather than relying on a single forecast. Daodu reported that the simulation results reveal a spectrum of outcomes for XRP. The mean price across all 10,000 paths stands at approximately $2.78, indicating that, on average, the price is higher than its current levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Weekly Fractal Hints At A Bigger Move Brewing In contrast, the median price is $1.88, suggesting that half of the estimated outcomes fall below the $2 mark. This disparity between the mean and median highlights the skew in the distribution, where a few high projections inflate the average, while the median reflects where most scenarios likely land. To identify a more probable pricing range, Daodu considered the 25th and 75th percentiles, which represent the central 50% of outcomes. According to the simulation, 25% of scenarios estimate XRP’s price below $1.04, while 75% indicate a price below $3.40. Notably, about 60% of scenarios position XRP’s price between $1.04 and $3.40 by the end of 2026, with an expected median hovering around $1.88. 10% Chance Of Dropping Below $0.59 The analysis also highlights the upper tail of the distribution, where the best-case outcomes sit. The 90th percentile indicates a price of about $5.90, meaning that roughly 10% of scenarios project end-of-year prices above this threshold. The expert asserts that achieving new all-time highs near $6 would require several positive developments, including sustained institutional inflows through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of over $50 million daily throughout 2026, increased actual usage of XRP for cross-border payments by banks, and persistent regulatory clarity without major setbacks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Remains Stuck Inside This Range, But A Breakout Could Follow On the other hand, the simulation doesn’t shy away from discussing downside risks. The lower 10% of outcomes reveal a potential drop below $0.59, suggesting a worrying 10% probability that XRP could lose more than 70% of its current value by 2026. Factors contributing to this bearish outlook could include regulatory setbacks, such as tougher restrictions on cryptocurrency custody or complications arising from recent settlements with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, Daodu believes that decreased investor confidence in the altcoin resulting from unmet expectations related to XRP’s utility adoption could further depress prices. According to CoinGecko data, XRP is trading within the range expected to last till next year at $1.90, with a 2% drop in the 24-hour period.

Related Reading: Analyst Shares ‘Cold, Hard Truth’ For Bitcoin Investors As Price Struggles XRP ETFs Steal The Spotlight XRP ETFs continue to show strong demand, recording a 25-day streak last Friday and closing the week with a positive net flow. Notably, crypto investment products registered a negative performance last week, seeing nearly a billion dollars in outflows. According to CoinShares’ weekly report, digital asset-based funds ended the week in the red for the first time in four weeks, with outflows totaling $952 million. This marks the products’ fourth-worst weekly performance of the year. CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, suggested that the negative market reaction was fueled by the delays in the US crypto market structure bill, which was initially anticipated to be passed before the end of the year. This “has prolonged regulatory uncertainty for the asset class, alongside concerns over continued selling by whale investors,” the report noted. The negative market sentiment was mostly focused in the US, which recorded $990 million in outflows last week. Ethereum (ETH) funds suffered the largest outflows, registering $555 million in negative net flows. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) investment products came in second with $460m in outflows. On the contrary, XRP ETFs saw overall support with positive net flows throughout the whole week. According to SoSoValue data, the category closes the week with $82.04 million in inflows, marking a 6-week positive streak. XRP’s Correction Already Over? Amid this performance, XRP’s price also ended the week recovering from the latest market correction, which sent its price to a two-month low of $1.77. Market observer BitGuru affirmed that XRP has completed its downtrend and liquidity grab, and is currently stabilizing at a key historical demand zone. Per the analyst, “selling pressure is fading, structure is flattening, and this is where smart money usually starts positioning, not where panic happens.” Similarly, trader Niels suggested that XRP’s corrective phase may be over as it appears to be forming a double bottom pattern. “RSI has bottomed out already, and now the price is showing good signs too,” the trader affirmed, adding that “XRP had a fakeout below the support level before reclaiming the zone.” To Niels, if the market shows momentum, the cryptocurrency could surge 20%-25% toward the $2.30-$2.50 area in the next few weeks. Recently, the trader affirmed that once XRP breaks above the $2.20 resistance, where the pattern’s neckline is situated, it could rally to the $2.80-$3.00 area within a month. Related Reading: Fundstrat Predicts Ethereum Drop To $1,800 In H1 2026 Meanwhile, analyst ChartNerd highlighted a bullish divergence on XRP’s chart. “Price action is adhering to the lower low price action trendline whilst forming higher lows on the RSI,” he explained, suggesting that price could move to higher levels. He also noted that if the altcoin fails to break the 20 EMA, currently around the $1.98 level, the price would “simply resort back to the lower low trendline for support, where we likely see more relief.” As of this writing, XRP is trading at $1.93, a 1.1% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Given the overall market condition, the latest breakout failure, and XRP’s plunge of almost 50% since its all-time high in July, investors’ sentiment has turned bearish. In fact, the number of negative comments on social media regarding Ripple’s native asset has surged to “far more” than average, according to data from Santiment. However, this could actually be a blessing in disguise for XRP. Previous such occurrences have led to immediate price reversals, as the analytics platform noted. There were several similar examples this year, including in late June. A few weeks down the line, XRP skyrocketed to the aforementioned all-time high of $3.65. XRP is seeing far more negative social media commentary than average. Historically, this setup leads to price rises. When retail has doubts about a coin’s ability to rise, the rise becomes significantly more likely. Monitor $XRP sentiment here: https://t.co/hYbezd8qH0 pic.twitter.com/FOcIlRb9BQ — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 22, 2025 Cobb, a popular member of the XRP Army, also weighed in on the declining sentiment. However, the analyst “simply” refused to be bearish on XRP and even predicted a new all-time high next year. The asset’s 3% decline over the past 24 hours might come as a surprise to some, especially those who follow the ETF trends. The spot XRP ETFs have been on an impressive streak ever since the first one hit Wall Street on November 13, with only green days. Moreover, data from SoSoValue shows that the five financial vehicles attracted another $43.89 million on Monday – the highest daily net inflow since December 5. However, those who follow technical indicators such as the TD Sequential might have anticipated today’s correction. As reported yesterday, the metric flashed a sell signal for XRP after a double-digit bounce over the past several days.

Despite operating without KYC verification, reputable no kyc crypto casino sites implement robust security measures including SSL encryption, two-factor authentication for account access, and cold storage for player funds. The blockchain itself provides transaction transparency where deposits and withdrawals are verifiable on-chain, offering accountability without compromising identity. Players should use secure cryptocurrency wallets with private key control rather than leaving large balances on casino platforms. Enable all available security features including 2FA when offered, even at anonymous sites. Research platform licensing and user reviews to verify reliability before depositing. Understand that anonymity protects identity but doesn’t eliminate the need for due diligence in selecting trustworthy best anonymous crypto casino platforms. Remember that truly anonymous casinos never request personal documents, phone verification, or extensive registration information. If a platform claims to be anonymous but requests identification, this should raise concerns about their commitment to privacy protection. Advantages of No KYC Crypto Casinos Benefit Description Instant Access Begin playing immediately without waiting for verification approval Complete Privacy No personal information shared or stored on platform databases Faster Withdrawals Process payouts within minutes without verification delays Financial Discretion Maintain privacy regarding gambling activities from third parties Reduced Data Breach Risk No personal documents stored means nothing to compromise if hacked Global Accessibility Fewer geographic restrictions compared to verified platforms Simplified Process No document uploads, selfies, or utility bills required Multiple Accounts Ability to use different wallets without restriction How to Get Started at Anonymous Bitcoin Casinos Beginning your anonymous gaming journey requires a cryptocurrency wallet, digital currency acquisition, and careful platform selection. First, establish a secure cryptocurrency wallet with private key control. Hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor provide maximum security, while software wallets like Exodus or MetaMask offer convenience. Purchase Bitcoin or other supported cryptocurrencies through exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, or Binance, then transfer funds to your personal wallet. Research top anonymous bitcoin casinos using reviews, community feedback, and licensing verification. Start with small deposits to test withdrawal processing and platform reliability before committing larger amounts. Verify that games are provably fair where applicable, allowing you to confirm result randomness. When ready to withdraw, simply initiate the transaction through the casino interface. Funds typically arrive in your wallet within minutes for most best no KYC crypto casino platforms. Maintain security by never sharing private keys and enabling all available account protection features even at anonymous sites. Provably Fair Gaming Explained Provably fair systems use cryptographic algorithms allowing players to verify that game outcomes are random and unmanipulated by the casino. Before each game round, the system generates a server seed (kept secret until after the bet), combines it with a client seed you can specify, and creates a result hash visible before betting. After the round completes, the casino reveals the server seed, allowing you to verify that the hash matches and the outcome wasn’t changed. This transparency is unique to cryptocurrency gambling and provides accountability impossible with traditional gaming. Not all games at anonymous bitcoin casino sites are provably fair – typically original games like dice, crash, and plinko implement this technology while slots from third-party providers use standard RNG systems. When available, provably fair gaming provides the highest confidence that no kyc crypto casino platforms operate honestly even without identity verification requirements. Frequently Asked Questions Q: Is it legal to play at anonymous bitcoin casinos? A: Legality depends on your jurisdiction. Many regions permit cryptocurrency gambling, while others restrict or prohibit it. Research your local laws before playing at any best anonymous crypto casino platform. Q: Are anonymous casinos safe? A: Reputable no KYC platforms implement strong security measures including encryption and cold storage. However, always research licensing, reviews, and operational history before depositing at any anonymous bitcoin casino. Q: Can I withdraw large amounts without verification? A: Most top anonymous bitcoin casinos process withdrawals of any size without KYC. However, some platforms may implement verification thresholds for very large amounts. Check terms before playing. Q: Why don’t these casinos require verification? A: Cryptocurrency transactions are already verified on the blockchain, eliminating the need for identity checks. This allows best no KYC crypto casino platforms to operate efficiently while respecting privacy. Q: What happens if I have a dispute? A: Licensed anonymous casinos have dispute resolution processes through their licensing authority. Provably fair games also provide verifiable proof of fairness, reducing dispute potential. Conclusion Anonymous bitcoin casinos have revolutionized online gambling by eliminating verification barriers while maintaining security and fairness. Casa Casino stands out as the premier choice for players seeking genuine anonymity combined with premium features including high RTP games, generous bonuses up to 5 BTC, and 20% weekly cashback.

He described the development as a new pathway that allows holders to earn yield through a lending protocol built directly on the XRPL. He stated that “Retail access just got a huge boost.” He sees the development as both institutional and inclusive. The lending system connects large-scale capital activity with individual XRP holders inside the same on-ledger environment. $XRP has unlocked a new pathway for holders to earn institutional-grade yield opportunities through a lending protocol on the XRPL. Retail access just got a huge boost! https://t.co/Irj5MUhdYq pic.twitter.com/npSu7PADT3 — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 20, 2025 On-Ledger Lending Changes XRP Utility ChartNerd explained that the protocol unlocks productive on-ledger lending for institutions. That statement places lending activity directly within the XRPL . Institutions often require predictable infrastructure. On-ledger execution provides clarity, consistency, and enforcement through the network itself. While XRP is expanding to other ecosystems through products like wXRP , it is also advancing the features of the XRPL. By operating at the protocol level, lending activity remains native to XRP. Borrowers access liquidity without removing assets from the ledger. Lenders supply capital without relying on third-party custody. This structure supports higher confidence participation from entities that demand controlled environments. The XRP Lending Protocol Ripple developer Edward Hennis provided key context around the XRPL lending protocol. The system introduces native, on-ledger lending directly into the XRP Ledger’s core code. The protocol enables structured lending between borrowers and lenders without relying on external platforms. Institutions can borrow XRP based on liquidity needs, while holders can lend XRP within the same ledger environment. By keeping lending activity on-chain, the protocol increases XRP utility, encourages sustained liquidity, and enables yield generation tied to real credit demand. Institutional Yield is Now Accessible to Holders The analyst tied institutional activity directly to yield opportunities for XRP holders . Institutional-grade yield shows a structured lending system rather than variable incentives. That distinction matters because institutions borrow for defined purposes. Their demand creates steady credit usage. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP holders can now participate in that demand cycle. Yield flows from lending activity tied to real usage on the ledger. This gives holders a reason to engage beyond price movement. It also strengthens the economic role of XRP within the ledger’s operations. Retail Access Expands Inside the Same System Lending adds another functional layer to the XRPL. ChartNerd said retail access “just got a huge boost.” Retail participants often remain excluded from institutional products and credit markets. This protocol changes that relationship by enabling retail holders to participate on-chain under the same framework. Retail access does not replace institutional use, but complements it. Institutions generate borrowing demand, and retail holders can supply liquidity. The ledger enforces the interaction and increases participation without fragmenting the system.

This future is closer than you think, and Kite AI is building the critical infrastructure to make it happen. The company aims to create what they call a ‘blockchain PayPal’ specifically designed for AI agent payments , addressing a gap that most people haven’t even considered yet. Why Do We Need Specialized AI Agent Payments? As autonomous AI agents become capable of independent actions, they’ll need to transact value without human intervention. Current payment systems weren’t designed for this purpose. Traditional banking requires human identity verification, while most crypto wallets need manual signing. Kite AI recognizes that AI agent payments require fundamentally different infrastructure built from the ground up. Chi Zhang, co-founder and CEO of Kite AI, explains the challenge: “When AI agents can book flights, order supplies, or pay for API services independently, they need payment systems that match their capabilities. We’re building the settlement layer for this new economy.” How Will Kite AI’s Blockchain Solution Work? The platform functions as a specialized blockchain infrastructure with several key components: Identity verification designed for AI agents rather than humans Automated settlement systems that don’t require manual approval Transaction monitoring specifically tuned for AI behavior patterns Multi-chain compatibility to work across different blockchain ecosystems This infrastructure enables what Zhang describes as “direct economic participation” for AI agents. Instead of acting through human-controlled accounts, AI could have their own economic identities and capabilities. What Challenges Must This System Overcome? Building AI agent payments infrastructure presents unique technical and regulatory hurdles. Security becomes paramount when machines control financial assets autonomously. The system must prevent unauthorized transactions while allowing legitimate AI-driven activities. Regulatory compliance represents another significant challenge. How do you apply know-your-customer (KYC) rules to AI agents? What liability frameworks govern AI-initiated transactions? Kite AI is working with regulators to develop appropriate frameworks for this emerging field. Technical implementation requires solving problems like: Preventing replay attacks on AI-initiated transactions Establishing audit trails for autonomous financial decisions Creating fail-safes for unusual transaction patterns Ensuring interoperability with existing financial systems What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Blockchain? The convergence of AI and blockchain through specialized AI agent payments infrastructure could transform both industries. AI gains true economic agency, while blockchain finds a compelling use case beyond speculative trading and decentralized finance. Consider these potential applications: AI research assistants purchasing datasets autonomously Autonomous delivery drones paying for charging stations Smart manufacturing systems ordering replacement parts Content creation AI paying for stock images or music licenses Each scenario requires reliable, secure payment systems designed specifically for non-human economic actors. How Close Are We to Widespread AI Agent Payments? While the technology is developing rapidly, mainstream adoption of AI agent payments will likely follow a gradual trajectory. Early implementations will probably focus on controlled environments with limited transaction capabilities. As the technology proves itself and regulatory frameworks develop, we’ll see broader adoption. Zhang believes we’re at the beginning of a major shift: “We’re building the pipes before the water starts flowing. When AI agents need to transact value regularly, the infrastructure will be ready.” The implications extend beyond mere convenience. Autonomous economic activity by AI could create entirely new business models and economic structures that we’re only beginning to imagine. Conclusion: The Dawn of Autonomous AI Economics Kite AI’s vision of blockchain infrastructure for AI agent payments represents more than just another fintech innovation. It’s foundational work for an economy where humans aren’t the only economic actors. By creating specialized payment systems for AI, they’re enabling a future where intelligent systems can participate directly in economic activity. This development bridges two of the most transformative technologies of our time—artificial intelligence and blockchain. The resulting synergy could accelerate innovation in both fields while creating practical solutions to real-world problems. As AI capabilities advance, having appropriate economic infrastructure will become increasingly critical. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are AI agent payments? AI agent payments refer to financial transactions initiated and completed autonomously by artificial intelligence systems without human intervention at the moment of transaction. How is Kite AI’s approach different from regular cryptocurrency payments? Kite AI builds infrastructure specifically designed for AI behavior patterns, including specialized identity verification, transaction monitoring tuned for AI activities, and systems that don’t require manual signing or approval. Are AI agent payments secure? Security is a primary design consideration. The system includes multiple layers of protection against unauthorized transactions, with audit trails and behavioral monitoring specific to AI patterns. When will we see widespread use of AI agent payments? Early implementations may appear within controlled environments in the next 1-2 years, with broader adoption depending on regulatory development and technological refinement over the next 3-5 years. Can AI agents currently make payments? Most current AI systems operate through human-controlled accounts when financial transactions are needed. True autonomous AI agent payments require the specialized infrastructure that projects like Kite AI are building. What are the main challenges for AI agent payments? Key challenges include developing appropriate regulatory frameworks, ensuring security against novel attack vectors, creating reliable audit systems, and achieving interoperability with existing financial infrastructure.

The Ultimate Forecast,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/holo-hot-price-prediction-forecast/,"BitcoinWorld Holo Price Prediction 2026-2030: Will HOT Reach $1? The Ultimate Forecast Imagine a world where your smartphone becomes a server, where applications run without centralized control, and where hosting is as distributed as conversations in a crowded room. This is the vision behind Holo and its HOT cryptocurrency. As we look toward 2026-2030, investors are asking one crucial question: Can HOT reach the elusive $1 mark? Let’s dive deep into the technology, market dynamics, and expert predictions that will shape Holo’s journey. What is Holo and Why Does HOT Matter? Holo represents a fundamental shift in how we think about internet infrastructure. Unlike traditional blockchain projects that rely on global consensus, Holo uses a framework called Holochain. This technology enables peer-to-peer applications that don’t require mining or global consensus. Instead, each user runs their own chain, and applications coordinate through distributed hash tables. The HOT token serves as a bridge currency during Holo’s development phase. It’s an ERC-20 token that will eventually be swapped for HoloFuel, the native currency of the Holo network. This transition is critical for understanding Holo price prediction models, as the tokenomics will fundamentally change. Holo Price Prediction 2026: The First Major Milestone By 2026, several factors could influence HOT’s price trajectory. The successful launch of HoloPorts (dedicated hardware for hosting), increased adoption of Holochain applications, and the transition from HOT to HoloFuel will be key determinants. Most analysts suggest a conservative HOT price forecast for 2026 ranges between $0.008 and $0.015. This represents significant growth from current levels but remains far from the $1 target. The primary drivers would be: Successful migration from HOT to HoloFuel without technical issues Adoption of 50+ Holochain applications with active user bases Partnerships with mainstream tech companies exploring decentralized hosting Regulatory clarity for peer-to-peer hosting networks HOT Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis and Market Position Understanding HOT cryptocurrency requires examining both its technical foundations and market dynamics. Holochain’s architecture offers several advantages over traditional blockchain: Feature Traditional Blockchain Holochain Consensus Mechanism Global consensus (Proof of Work/Stake) Agent-centric validation Scalability Limited by global state updates Scales with number of users Energy Consumption High for Proof of Work systems Minimal, no mining required Data Storage All data replicated globally Data stored locally by users This technical superiority could drive adoption, but market factors remain challenging. HOT currently ranks outside the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, facing competition from established decentralized storage projects like Filecoin and Arweave. Holochain Technology: The Engine Behind Future Growth The success of Holochain technology will directly impact HOT’s price potential. Unlike blockchain’s one-size-fits-all approach, Holochain allows developers to create purpose-built distributed applications. This flexibility has attracted projects in social networking, supply chain management, and collaborative tools. Key developments to watch include: The Elemental Chat application demonstrating practical use Developer adoption rates and ecosystem growth Performance benchmarks compared to centralized alternatives Security audits and vulnerability assessments If Holochain proves itself as a viable alternative to both traditional client-server models and blockchain systems, it could trigger a paradigm shift in how we build internet applications. HOT Price Forecast 2027-2028: The Growth Phase Between 2027 and 2028, we could see accelerated growth if several conditions align. The HOT price forecast for this period becomes more optimistic, with some models suggesting $0.03 to $0.08 ranges. Critical milestones for this period include: Mainstream recognition of Holochain’s advantages for specific use cases Enterprise adoption for internal collaboration tools Integration with existing web infrastructure Growing network of HoloPort hosts creating real value The transition from HOT to HoloFuel should be complete by this point, creating a functioning economy where users pay for hosting services with the native currency. This utility-driven demand could create organic price support. Decentralized Hosting: Holo’s Killer Application At its core, Holo offers decentralized hosting solutions that could disrupt traditional web hosting markets. By allowing anyone with a HoloPort (or eventually, their personal computer) to host applications, Holo creates a distributed hosting network. This approach offers several benefits: Reduced costs compared to centralized cloud providers Improved resilience through distribution Enhanced privacy as data isn’t concentrated in corporate data centers Democratized access to hosting infrastructure The market for web hosting exceeds $100 billion annually. Even capturing a small percentage of this market could generate substantial demand for Holo’s services and, by extension, its currency. When Will HOT Reach $1? The Realistic Timeline The million-dollar question: When will HOT reach $1? Based on current trajectories and market conditions, most analysts consider this unlikely before 2030. Achieving a $1 price would require: Market capitalization exceeding $170 billion (at current token supply) Mass adoption surpassing most current top 10 cryptocurrencies Fundamental changes in how internet infrastructure operates Substantial reduction in circulating supply through the HOT to HoloFuel swap A more realistic ambitious target for 2030 might be $0.10 to $0.25, representing growth of 100-250x from current levels. This would still place Holo among the most successful cryptocurrency projects of the decade. Risks and Challenges in Holo Price Prediction No Holo price prediction is complete without considering the risks. Several factors could derail even the most optimistic forecasts: Technical challenges in scaling the Holochain framework Competition from other decentralized hosting projects Regulatory uncertainty for peer-to-peer hosting networks User adoption slower than anticipated Execution risks in the HOT to HoloFuel transition Investors should also consider market cycles. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, and broader market conditions will significantly impact HOT’s price regardless of technological progress. FAQs About Holo and HOT Price Predictions What is the difference between Holo and Holochain? Holochain is the underlying technology framework for building distributed applications, while Holo is the hosting network and ecosystem that allows regular users to access Holochain applications through their browsers. Who created Holo and Holochain? The project was founded by Arthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun , who have backgrounds in alternative currencies and peer-to-peer systems. The development is led by Holo Ltd , based in Gibraltar. How does the HOT to HoloFuel swap work? HOT tokens will be exchangeable for HoloFuel once the mainnet launches. The exchange rate will be 1:1, but HoloFuel has different properties as a mutual credit currency rather than a fixed-supply token. What companies are building on Holochain? Several organizations are exploring Holochain, including RedGrid for energy management and various cooperatives and community projects focused on decentralized collaboration tools. Is Holo a good long-term investment? As with any cryptocurrency investment, this depends on risk tolerance and belief in the technology. Holo offers a fundamentally different approach to decentralization that could succeed where blockchain has limitations, but it faces significant adoption challenges. Conclusion: The Future of Holo and HOT The journey to $1 for HOT is steep and uncertain, but the vision behind Holo represents one of the most ambitious attempts to reimagine internet infrastructure. Unlike incremental improvements on existing systems, Holochain offers a paradigm shift—from global consensus to local validation, from centralized hosting to distributed participation. While our Holo price prediction suggests $1 is unlikely before 2030, the path to meaningful growth exists. Success will depend on technological execution, developer adoption, and market timing. For investors, Holo represents a high-risk, high-potential-reward opportunity in the decentralized technology space. The true value may not be in price speculation but in participating in a network that could make the internet more resilient, private, and democratic. Whether as an investor, developer, or host, engaging with Holo means supporting an alternative vision for our digital future—one where control returns to the edges of the network.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in Presale Phase 6, as it swiftly approaches the 99% sold-out level at the price of $0.035, is attracting quite some attention as one of the best cryptocurrency to buy in anticipation of the project’s next market value milestone. Having successfully accrued more than $19.5 million to date, together with an ever-expanding community of more than 18,560 individual users, the Mutuum Finance structured presale approach, beginning at $0.01 all the way to the present $0.035, shows strength as it prepares to automatically move to the next market level before entering the final stages leading to its TestNet release. In times when ETH indicators remain pegged in limbo as to whether it should recover to seasonal levels, this new crypto coin symbolizes why new, use-case-oriented cryptos are abruptly taking market center stage as potential high performers among the top cryptos. Investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to buy are increasingly watching this project closely. Ethereum Awaits Relief Rally Despite Technical Consolidation Ethereum (ETH) is displaying signs of a possible reversal while trying to stabilize above the lower boundary of the descending channel. After the rebound from the descending support line, the current movement of ETH is upwards in a short-term rising channel. This shows that the market is trying to find a relief rally. A rising corrective channel is produced inside the prevailing overall downtrend. As long as there are higher intraday lows, the overall bullish pattern will remain preferred. The first level of resistance above the current market will be the descending channel top and will be a critical level to focus upon. The break below the rising channel would open the route to further decline once again. At a time when ETH is trying to test these levels, more and more investors are looking for other emerging or new crypto coins with high growth prospects such as MUTM, often considered among the best cryptocurrency to buy. MUTM Presale Gains Momentum Amid DeFi Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly setting itself apart as the new crypto coin to watch for the year 2026. Currently at presale Phase 6, the cryptocurrency can be purchased at the current rate of $0.035, presenting investors with the last-chance offer to purchase MUTM before presale Phase 7 at the new rate of $0.04. To make it easier for people to invest, Mutuum Finance accepts purchase payments through credit cards. The two-tier lending model in the platform has received much acclaim for its scalability and efficiency. Through the optimized liquidity pooling that connects lenders with borrowers in MUTM, users are offered lucrative returns on investment while maximizing capital use. With more than 18,560 users contributing more than $19.5 million, adoption and confidence in the platform are increasing, making MUTM a prime candidate for the best cryptocurrency to buy this year. MUTM Roadmap: Securing and Scaling DeFi Infrastructure Mutuum Finance is also working tirelessly to develop its technology infrastructure.

It usually does so in moments of stress. A growing group of analysts has argued that the market may be closer to another inflection point than many holders expect. JD (@jaydee_757), a popular technical analyst on X, believes the current setup mirrors prior cycle behavior. His focus is on the 21-month EMA, a level that XRP has now reached again. According to JD, the current setup points to a crucial decision for XRP. $XRP – We are now touching 21M EMA! Last time it touched EMA, #XRP before crashing 95% on top of DUMB MONEY who ""Know what they hold"" LOL! I called bottom at 0.28, local top at 3.37, and the crash to $1.60 w/PRECISION! Let me call TOP next then CRASH! RT for updates!… pic.twitter.com/LixUjuokll — JD (@jaydee_757) December 21, 2025 XRP’s Repeating Cycle JD states, “We are now touching 21M EMA.” He links this directly to historical behavior rather than short-term momentum. In his post, he reminds followers that the last time XRP touched the same moving average, its price surged to a new peak before collapsing by roughly 95%. He describes that prior move as a rally that trapped what he calls “ dumb money ” before a severe decline. JD also highlights his prior calls. He identified the 2017 cycle bottom near $0.28, and called the rise to the peak near $3.37 before a decline to $1.60. He presents these calls as evidence that he can anticipate turning points. He adds that he intends to call the next top and take his profit on time while using dumb money investors who refuse to leave as exit liquidity . What the Chart Shows The attached chart compares the current structure with the 2017/2018 cycle. In that period, XRP rallied aggressively after touching the 21M EMA. The asset’s price then broke down and lost most of its value during the bear market. JD marks that decline as a 95% crash. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On the current chart, XRP remains above its monthly peak from the previous cycle, and continues to respect the 21M EMA. JD notes that price is still holding above both, which keeps the bullish phase technically intact . At the same time, he emphasizes that this exact condition existed before the previous cycle peak failed. JD’s View on Market Behavior JD’s language toward long-term holders remains direct. He argues that participants who refuse to sell into strength often provide exit liquidity near cycle tops. He plans to sell heavily during the next cycle , acting before sentiment shifts. For now, JD treats the current level as a warning sign. XRP may still move higher. He believes the risk increases the longer the price remains near the levels that preceded the last collapse.

The firm said Monday that it received approval from the Ontario Securities Commission to sell up to $58 million “of common shares, warrants, subscription receipts, debt securities, or units” over the next 25 months. “Obtaining the receipt for our CAD $80 million base shelf prospectus is a critical step in maturing our capital structure,” said Deven Soni, CEO of Matador. Soni added that the funds raised will remain focused on “increasing Bitcoin per share over time” to accumulate 1,000 BTC by the end of 2026. “Matador may, from time to time, allocate available capital toward Bitcoin purchases or other corporate purposes, depending on market conditions, regulatory requirements, the Company’s financial position and other factors.” Matador Completes One Year in ‘Bitcoin-First Strategy’ The Toronto Stock Exchange-listed firm executed its ‘Bitcoin-first strategy’ in December 2024 by investing $4.5 million in BTC .

56221496,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=250946,1766475611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Stunning $514 Million Bitcoin Transaction: Whale Moves 5,869 BTC from Coinbase to Mystery Vault",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-transaction-coinbase-unknown-wallet-2/,"BitcoinWorld Stunning $514 Million Bitcoin Transaction: Whale Moves 5,869 BTC from Coinbase to Mystery Vault The cryptocurrency market just witnessed a staggering movement of wealth. Blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported a single Bitcoin transaction that saw 5,869 BTC—valued at approximately $514 million—transferred from the major exchange Coinbase to a brand new, unknown wallet. This colossal shift of digital assets immediately sent ripples through the crypto community, raising critical questions about motive and market impact. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Transaction Mean? When a sum this large moves off a centralized exchange like Coinbase, it typically signals a specific intent. Unlike a sell order, which would involve converting BTC to fiat currency on the platform, this Bitcoin transaction represents a withdrawal to private custody. Therefore, analysts often interpret such moves as a long-term holding strategy, commonly referred to as ‘HODLing.’ The entity behind this transfer, often called a ‘whale,’ appears to be securing their assets for the future, potentially indicating strong conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition despite market volatility. Who Could Be Behind the Mystery Wallet? The destination wallet’s ‘unknown’ status is a key part of the intrigue. It could belong to several types of entities: A Private Individual: An ultra-high-net-worth investor moving funds to a personal hardware wallet for security. An Institutional Player: A hedge fund, corporation, or ETF custodian allocating capital to cold storage. A New Fund or Entity: Capital being deployed for a new venture, investment fund, or treasury. The sheer size suggests institutional-scale action more than individual retail activity. However, the true identity remains shielded by blockchain’s pseudonymous nature, fueling speculation. Why Analyze Major Bitcoin Transactions? Tracking these large flows is crucial for understanding market sentiment. A withdrawal from an exchange generally reduces immediate sell pressure, as those coins are taken out of the liquid supply available for trading. Conversely, large deposits to exchanges can signal an impending sale. This specific Bitcoin transaction can therefore be viewed as a bullish signal from a major market participant. It demonstrates a preference for self-custody over leaving assets on an exchange, emphasizing security and long-term belief over short-term trading. What Are the Immediate Market Implications? While one transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, it provides powerful context. Firstly, it showcases the robust liquidity in the Bitcoin network, capable of settling half a billion dollars seamlessly. Secondly, it may influence trader psychology, reinforcing a ‘hold’ narrative. However, investors should be cautious. Whale movements can be unpredictable, and this same entity could later move the coins back to an exchange to sell. The key takeaway is the demonstration of profound confidence at a pivotal time, often seen as a vote for Bitcoin’s enduring store of value. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Rather than blindly following whale activity, use it as a learning tool. Monitor Supply Dynamics: Use free tools like Whale Alert to watch where large Bitcoin flows are moving—to or from exchanges. Prioritize Security: This transaction highlights the importance of self-custody for significant holdings. Research hardware wallets. Maintain Perspective: One data point is not a strategy. Integrate this news with broader technical and fundamental analysis. Ultimately, this Bitcoin transaction is a powerful reminder of the scale and maturity developing within the digital asset ecosystem. In conclusion, the transfer of 5,869 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown wallet is a monumental event that underscores several key themes: the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset, the critical importance of secure custody, and the transparent yet private nature of blockchain technology. While the whale’s ultimate motive remains a fascinating mystery, the action itself sends a clear message of substantial commitment to the future of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is a large Bitcoin withdrawal from an exchange always bullish? A: It is generally interpreted as a reduction in immediate sell pressure and a sign of long-term holding intent, which is a bullish signal. However, it is not a guaranteed price indicator on its own. Q2: How can a wallet be ‘unknown’ on the blockchain? A: Blockchain is transparent for transactions but pseudonymous for identities. Anyone can create a wallet address without linking it to a real-world name. An ‘unknown’ wallet simply means its owner has not publicly revealed themselves. Q3: Could this $514 million Bitcoin transaction be an internal transfer by Coinbase? A: While possible, tracking services like Whale Alert typically filter out known exchange cold storage movements. This transaction was flagged because it moved from a known exchange wallet to a new, unlabeled address, suggesting external withdrawal. Q4: What tools can I use to track large Bitcoin transactions? A: Popular free services include Whale Alert (social media and website), Glassnode, and CryptoQuant. These platforms monitor blockchain for significant movements and report them in real-time. Q5: Does moving Bitcoin off an exchange like Coinbase affect its price directly? A: Not directly, as no trade occurs. Indirectly, it can affect market sentiment and perceived supply scarcity, which may influence buying and selling decisions by other market participants. Q6: What is the main risk for the whale in making this transaction? A: The primary risk shifts from exchange counterparty risk (like hacking or insolvency) to personal security risk. They are now solely responsible for safeguarding their private keys. Losing access means losing the Bitcoin forever.

As the Solana ecosystem continues its remarkable expansion, all eyes are on Raydium, the automated market maker that has become a cornerstone of Solana’s DeFi landscape. With the RAY token showing significant volatility and potential, investors are asking the critical question: What does the future hold for Raydium price prediction from 2026 through 2030? Could we see RAY soar by 100% or more in the coming years? This comprehensive analysis examines the technical foundations, market dynamics, and ecosystem developments that will shape Raydium’s trajectory in the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance. Understanding Raydium and the RAY Token Raydium represents a fundamental building block within the Solana ecosystem, functioning as an automated market maker and liquidity provider that connects to Serum’s central limit order book. This unique architecture allows Raydium to offer both the efficiency of traditional order books and the flexibility of automated market making. The RAY token serves multiple purposes within this ecosystem: Governance rights for protocol decisions Fee distribution to liquidity providers Staking rewards for network participants Access to exclusive liquidity pools and farming opportunities The success of any Raydium price prediction depends heavily on understanding these fundamental utility factors and how they interact with broader market trends. Current Market Position and Historical Performance To make an accurate Raydium price prediction, we must first examine where RAY stands today and how it has performed historically. Raydium launched during the 2021 bull market and experienced rapid growth alongside the broader Solana ecosystem. The token reached its all-time high in late 2021, followed by a significant correction during the 2022 bear market. Period Key Performance Indicators Market Context 2021 Launch Rapid adoption, high TVL growth Bull market, Solana ecosystem expansion 2022 Correction Significant price decline, reduced volumes Bear market, FTX collapse impact 2023-2024 Recovery Gradual rebuilding, protocol improvements Market stabilization, renewed institutional interest This historical context provides essential background for our Raydium price prediction moving forward. The recovery phase has shown resilience, but questions remain about sustainable growth patterns. Technical Analysis and Price Prediction Methodology Our Raydium price prediction employs multiple analytical approaches to provide a balanced perspective. Technical analysis examines historical price patterns, support and resistance levels, and trading volume trends. Fundamental analysis evaluates the protocol’s development progress, Total Value Locked (TVL) growth, and competitive positioning within the Solana DeFi space. Additionally, we consider macroeconomic factors that influence the entire cryptocurrency market. Key technical indicators for our Raydium price prediction include: Moving averages (50-day, 200-day) Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicators Trading volume patterns and liquidity metrics On-chain data including active addresses and transaction counts Raydium Price Prediction 2026: The Foundation Year Looking toward 2026, our Raydium price prediction suggests this period will serve as a foundation-building year. By 2026, we expect several key developments to influence RAY’s valuation: Continued integration with expanding Solana DeFi applications Potential protocol upgrades and feature enhancements Increased institutional adoption of Solana-based DeFi solutions Regulatory clarity that could benefit compliant DeFi protocols The 2026 Raydium price prediction must account for both the protocol’s technical evolution and broader market conditions. If Solana maintains its position as a leading smart contract platform, Raydium stands to benefit significantly as a core DeFi component. RAY Token Forecast for 2027: Growth Acceleration Our 2027 Raydium price prediction anticipates accelerated growth under favorable market conditions. By this point, several catalysts could drive significant appreciation in the RAY token: Mass adoption of decentralized exchanges as regulatory frameworks mature Cross-chain interoperability solutions expanding Raydium’s reach Enhanced tokenomics through burning mechanisms or improved distribution Strategic partnerships with traditional finance institutions exploring DeFi The 2027 forecast represents a critical juncture where Raydium could either establish itself as a dominant DeFi player or face intensified competition from emerging protocols. Solana DeFi Ecosystem Projections Through 2030 Any long-term Raydium price prediction must consider the broader Solana DeFi ecosystem’s trajectory. Between 2028 and 2030, we project several transformative developments: Year Ecosystem Development Potential Impact on RAY 2028 Mainstream DeFi adoption on Solana Increased utility and transaction volume 2029 Advanced financial products integration Enhanced token utility and value capture 2030 Mature regulatory environment Institutional participation and stability The Solana DeFi ecosystem’s health directly correlates with Raydium’s potential success. As the primary liquidity layer for many Solana applications, Raydium’s fortunes are tied to the broader network effect. Will RAY Price Soar 100%? Critical Factors to Consider The central question driving this analysis—whether RAY could achieve 100% growth—depends on multiple converging factors. Our cryptocurrency forecast identifies several prerequisites for such substantial appreciation: Sustained growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeding current benchmarks Successful navigation of regulatory challenges facing DeFi protocols Maintenance of competitive advantages against emerging AMM solutions Broader cryptocurrency market recovery and institutional adoption Continued technological innovation within the Raydium protocol While a 100% increase represents ambitious growth, historical cryptocurrency cycles have demonstrated that leading DeFi tokens can achieve such returns during bull markets, particularly when supported by strong fundamentals. Risk Factors and Challenges for Raydium No Raydium price prediction would be complete without acknowledging the significant risks and challenges facing the protocol: Regulatory uncertainty surrounding decentralized exchanges Intense competition from both Ethereum-based and alternative L1 DeFi protocols Technical risks including potential smart contract vulnerabilities Dependence on Solana’s continued success and network stability Market volatility affecting all cryptocurrency investments These risk factors must be carefully weighed against the potential rewards when considering any investment in RAY tokens. Comparative Analysis: Raydium vs. Other Decentralized Exchanges To strengthen our Raydium price prediction, we must examine how the protocol compares to competing decentralized exchange solutions: Uniswap (Ethereum): Established market leader with massive liquidity PancakeSwap (BNB Chain): Strong retail community and multiple chain deployment Orca (Solana): Direct competitor within the same ecosystem Curve Finance (Multi-chain): Specialized in stablecoin trading Raydium’s unique value proposition lies in its deep integration with Solana and Serum’s order book. This hybrid approach could provide competitive advantages as DeFi matures and demands more sophisticated trading tools. Actionable Insights for Investors Based on our comprehensive Raydium price prediction analysis, we offer several actionable insights for potential investors: Diversify within the DeFi sector rather than concentrating solely on RAY Monitor Solana ecosystem developments as leading indicators for Raydium’s performance Pay attention to protocol upgrades and governance proposals that could enhance token utility Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks in a volatile market Stay informed about regulatory developments affecting decentralized exchanges Remember that all cryptocurrency investments carry substantial risk, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Conclusion: The Future of Raydium in an Evolving DeFi Landscape Our comprehensive Raydium price prediction from 2026 through 2030 presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for the RAY token. The protocol’s deep integration with the Solana ecosystem, innovative hybrid architecture, and growing DeFi adoption create a foundation for potential significant growth. While achieving 100% appreciation depends on multiple favorable factors aligning—including broader market conditions, regulatory developments, and technological execution—the fundamental case for Raydium remains strong. As decentralized finance continues to mature and potentially revolutionize traditional financial systems, protocols like Raydium that provide essential infrastructure could capture substantial value. However, investors must remain vigilant about the inherent risks in this rapidly evolving space and make informed decisions based on thorough research rather than speculative hype.

And we have been heavily engaged with the key entities driving cutting-edge development in the defi community.” Data compiled by CoinGecko shows that Bitmine now ranks as the world’s largest Ethereum treasury and the second-largest global crypto treasury overall, behind Michael Saylor-led Strategy, which holds 671,268 BTC, around $59 billion. Bitmine also reported strong stock market activity and revealed that it is now among the most actively traded stocks in the United States. Fundstrat data shows that the company’s shares recorded an average daily dollar trading volume of $1.7 billion over a five-day period as of December 19. This placed the stock at rank 66 among 5,704 US-listed companies, trading just behind Wells Fargo and ahead of Chevron. ETH Momentum Faces Test Bitmine has continued its accumulation strategy despite the recent crypto market downturn. Ethereum’s price has gradually recovered, even reclaiming the $3,000 level on Monday before it dumped once again on Tuesday below that level. Ethereum is nearing a resistance range of $3,150-$3,200, which may act as a hurdle for momentum, according to Kamran Asghar’s 4-hour chart. Past price reactions suggest a rejection here could push ETH down to $2,750-$2,800 support. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ted Pillows also said that a daily close above the $3,000 threshold could trigger a further upward move toward $3,300. On the other hand, if the leading altcoin fails to hold this level, it may retest the $2,700-$2,800 range, which has been the case so far.

Official data shows that the series achieved a staggering total trading volume exceeding 14 billion USDT, attracted more than 90,000 participants, and distributed nearly 1 million USDT in rewards. This year-end finale ignited strong trader enthusiasm and significantly enhanced platform liquidity and market depth, marking a standout milestone for the 2025 crypto market. Diversified Gameplay: A Multi-Dimensional Trading Arena The HTX Trading Championship featured three core competitions: the Points Contest, the Trading Challenge, and Team Battles, with dual tracks covering both spot and futures markets. This diversified structure was designed to cater to a wide range of investors, accommodating different risk appetites and strategic styles. The Trading Challenge alone drew approximately 56,000 participants. Ultimately, the top-ranking champions in both the spot and futures tracks each secured 17.4 billion $HTX, underscoring the event’s premium reward structure and the formidable skill of these elite traders. The Team Battles emerged as the event’s most intense arena. With 126 teams competing, the tournament evolved into a high-stakes masterclass in capital management, risk control, and strategic execution, testing both individual expertise and the power of coordinated team synergy. Spot Team Battle: Where Steady Gains Meet Mojobet Moves The Spot Team Battle unfolded as a showcase of sharply contrasting strategies, with teams taking markedly different paths in pursuit of victory. “Justin’s Disciple” secured first place with a total spot trading volume of 196,238,205 USDT, earning the championship reward, equivalent to $40,000 in $HTX. Composed of seasoned spot traders deeply engaged in both mainstream and trending assets, the team adhered to a disciplined strategy centered on steady execution. By concentrating on high-liquidity assets such as BTC and ETH , and employing a shift-based rotation during periods of market volatility, the team ensured uninterrupted trading momentum. This systematic, stability-driven approach allowed them to maintain a commanding lead throughout the competition. In contrast, third-place finishers “Meta Knights” delivered a remarkable dark-horse performance driven by unconventional tactics. With a keen instinct for altcoins and sector-specific trends, the team specialized in capturing short-term, high-impact opportunities. After starting as low as 16th place, they launched a decisive comeback in the final five days of the event. Through close-knit community coordination and real-time information sharing, “Meta Knights” seized multiple critical market windows, surging into the top three and demonstrating the power of agile, collaborative strategy. Futures Team Battles: A Triumph of Unity and Technical Conviction The Futures Team Battles delivered an even more intense level of competition, serving as a rigorous test of both psychological resilience and technical mastery to determine the most elite trading teams. “Little Azure Dragon Community” claimed first place with an extraordinary total futures trading volume of 420,986,491 USDT, securing the $40,000 grand prize in $HTX. The team brought together long-standing community members and seasoned futures traders who demonstrated exceptional discipline and execution throughout the extended competition. United by the mantra “move fast and push forward together”, they operated a 24/7 trading relay that sustained continuous participation and momentum. This level of coordination earned them recognition as the most cohesive and resilient team of the entire tournament. Finishing third in the Futures Team Battles, “Tiandao Smart Contract” stood out as a team rooted in Web3 development and technical rigor. The team was united by the philosophy that “code is law” and a shared commitment to on-chain fairness, pursuing a markedly different strategy from sentiment-driven competitors. Rather than relying on aggressive market calls, they emphasized logical decision-making and systematic collaboration. Starting from seventh place early in the event, their calm and methodical execution enabled a steady climb to the podium, highlighting the distinctive strength of technical conviction in futures trading.

His comments come as interest in XRP ETFs accelerates, with global pension funds and insurers increasingly seeking regulated exposure to blockchain-based payment infrastructure. Unlike Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative, McClurg positions XRP in a completely different lane. He argues that XRP ETFs aren’t competing with Bitcoin’s dominance, but carving out a utility-first role as financial infrastructure, powering cross-border payments, faster settlement, and liquidity provisioning. That clear focus on real-world financial rails, he says, is exactly what makes XRP resonate with institutional investors. Wall Street typically avoids pure crypto speculation, favoring assets with clear utility and seamless integration into existing financial systems. XRP’s payments-focused design and deep ties to enterprise-grade financial infrastructure give institutions a familiar framework for evaluation. For pension funds and insurers, investors bound by long-term obligations and strict risk controls, this clarity is critical. Regulated XRP ETFs further reduce friction by offering compliant exposure without the custody, security, and operational challenges of holding the token directly, making institutional adoption far more accessible. McClurg challenges the notion that XRP’s trajectory must follow the traditional four-year crypto cycle. While Bitcoin typically drives cycle-based rallies, he argues XRP’s next major upside could be adoption-driven rather than timing-driven. As XRP gains traction as a settlement layer and global payments rail, its growth may track long-term infrastructure adoption curves, not short-lived speculative booms. Under this framework, 2026 could mark a critical inflection point for XRP. Instead of a speculative blow-off top fueled by retail euphoria, its next major peak may be driven by steady institutional onboarding, broader ETF adoption, and deeper integration into global cross-border payment flows. If McClurg’s thesis proves accurate, XRP’s strength is not in challenging Bitcoin, but in complementing it. While Bitcoin anchors the ecosystem as a store-of-value benchmark, XRP positions itself as the transactional plumbing of a tokenized financial system. For Wall Street and long-duration institutional capital, that functional distinction could be decisive. Conclusion McClurg reframes XRP not as a speculative asset, but as critical financial infrastructure. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP isn’t chasing store-of-value narratives, it’s designed for payments, settlement, and real-world utility. Rising institutional interest through ETFs, from pension funds to insurance firms, signals a shift from hype to strategic adoption. If XRP continues gaining traction as a regulated, enterprise-ready financial rail, its next major peak could hinge on actual integration rather than market cycles, positioning 2026 as a milestone defined by usage, not speculation.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-23 07:53:34

In an era where digital surveillance is escalating and financial privacy is becoming a rare commodity, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies are capturing investor attention. Crypton (CRP), a digital currency designed specifically for anonymous transactions, stands at a critical juncture. As governments worldwide tighten regulations and traditional financial systems become more transparent, the demand for privacy coins like CRP could surge dramatically. But can Crypton deliver substantial returns through 2030? This comprehensive analysis examines the factors that could propel CRP to new heights or keep it grounded. What Is Crypton (CRP) and Why Does Privacy Matter? Crypton (CRP) is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency that prioritizes anonymous transactions and user confidentiality. Built on advanced cryptographic principles, CRP enables users to conduct financial transactions without revealing their identity or transaction details to third parties. Unlike transparent blockchain networks where every transaction is publicly visible, Crypton employs sophisticated privacy protocols to shield user data. The growing importance of privacy coins stems from several critical developments: Increasing government surveillance of financial transactions Corporate data collection and monetization of personal financial information Growing awareness of digital privacy rights among consumers Regulatory pressures on traditional cryptocurrencies to implement KYC/AML measures Crypton Price Prediction 2026: The Privacy Revolution Accelerates By 2026, privacy concerns in digital finance are expected to reach unprecedented levels. Our analysis suggests CRP could experience significant growth if several conditions align. The cryptocurrency market typically operates in cycles, and 2026 could coincide with the next major bull market phase following the Bitcoin halving events. Key factors influencing Crypton’s 2026 price prediction: Factor Bullish Scenario Bearish Scenario Regulatory Environment Favorable regulations for privacy coins Global crackdown on anonymous transactions Technology Adoption Widespread integration of CRP in privacy-focused applications Technical limitations or security vulnerabilities Market Sentiment Strong demand for privacy features Preference shifts toward transparent blockchains Competitive Landscape CRP gains market share from established privacy coins Newer, more advanced privacy solutions emerge CRP Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis and Market Position Understanding Crypton’s technical foundation is crucial for accurate price forecasting. CRP operates on a blockchain that implements several privacy-enhancing features, including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions. These technologies work together to obscure transaction details while maintaining network security and integrity. Current market position analysis reveals: CRP ranks among mid-tier privacy coins behind established leaders like Monero and Zcash The project has demonstrated consistent development activity and protocol upgrades Community support remains strong despite regulatory headwinds Exchange listings have expanded but still lag behind major cryptocurrencies Digital Currency Forecast: Privacy Coins in the 2027-2030 Landscape The period from 2027 to 2030 will likely witness dramatic transformations in how society values financial privacy. As central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) become more prevalent and traditional banking systems implement increasingly invasive surveillance measures, the appeal of privacy coins could skyrocket. Our long-term forecast considers multiple scenarios: Optimistic Scenario: CRP becomes a leading privacy solution, achieving widespread adoption and significant price appreciation Moderate Scenario: Steady growth as privacy concerns increase but regulatory challenges persist Conservative Scenario: Limited growth due to regulatory restrictions and competitive pressures Blockchain Technology Evolution and Its Impact on CRP The underlying blockchain technology supporting Crypton continues to evolve, with several developments potentially impacting CRP’s future value. Privacy-preserving technologies are advancing rapidly, with zero-knowledge proofs and other cryptographic innovations becoming more efficient and scalable. Key technological developments to monitor: Implementation of more advanced privacy protocols Scalability improvements to handle increased transaction volume Interoperability with other blockchain networks Security enhancements to protect against emerging threats Risks and Challenges Facing Crypton’s Growth Trajectory While the potential for CRP is significant, several substantial risks could hinder its progress. Regulatory uncertainty represents the most immediate threat, with governments worldwide expressing concerns about privacy coins facilitating illicit activities. Major challenges include: Increasing regulatory scrutiny and potential restrictions Competition from both established privacy coins and new entrants Technical vulnerabilities or protocol weaknesses Market volatility affecting all cryptocurrency investments Public perception and media portrayal of privacy coins Actionable Insights for CRP Investors For those considering Crypton as part of their investment portfolio, several strategic approaches can help manage risk while positioning for potential growth. Privacy coins represent a specialized segment of the cryptocurrency market with unique characteristics and considerations. Investment strategies to consider: Diversify within the privacy coin sector rather than concentrating solely on CRP Monitor regulatory developments in major markets Assess technological advancements and protocol upgrades Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks Maintain realistic expectations about volatility and potential returns Frequently Asked Questions About Crypton (CRP) How does Crypton differ from other privacy coins like Monero? While both prioritize transaction privacy, Crypton implements different cryptographic approaches and may offer distinct features in terms of scalability, transaction fees, or additional functionality. Is CRP legal to buy and hold? The legality of privacy coins varies by jurisdiction. Investors should consult local regulations regarding privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. What are the main use cases for Crypton? CRP primarily serves users seeking financial privacy for legitimate purposes, including personal financial confidentiality, business transaction privacy, and protection against financial surveillance. How can I store CRP securely? Crypton can be stored in compatible wallets that support its privacy features, including official wallets and selected third-party solutions with strong security protocols. Who are the main competitors to Crypton in the privacy coin space? Major competitors include Monero , Zcash , and other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. The landscape also includes privacy features being integrated into broader platforms like the Ethereum network through various Layer 2 solutions. Conclusion: The Privacy Imperative and CRP’s Potential The trajectory of Crypton (CRP) through 2030 will likely be determined by the complex interplay between technological innovation, regulatory developments, and evolving societal attitudes toward financial privacy. As digital surveillance expands and financial systems become increasingly transparent, the fundamental value proposition of privacy coins grows stronger. However, significant challenges remain, particularly regarding regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. CRP represents more than just another cryptocurrency—it embodies the growing demand for financial autonomy in an increasingly monitored digital world. While price predictions involve substantial uncertainty, the underlying trends favoring privacy preservation suggest that well-designed privacy coins could play an important role in the future digital economy. Investors should approach CRP with careful consideration of both its unique potential and the specific risks associated with privacy-focused digital assets.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Stay Resilient, But Profits Haven’t Fully Arrived – Here’s What To Know With the 2026 tax year nearing, 18 bipartisan House lawmakers have urged the Internal Revenue Service to review staking tax guidance, arguing it results in double taxation, creating administrative burdens and failing to reflect actual economic gains, especially during volatile markets. Lawmakers Press IRS Ahead of 2026 In a letter led by Representative Mike Carey , lawmakers asked whether any administrative barriers stand in the way of updating staking guidance before the end of the year. They argue that taxing rewards only at the point of sale would better capture actual economic gain while reducing reporting complexity. The group also warned that current rules may discourage staking participation, which plays a critical role in securing proof-of-stake blockchains and maintaining network resilience. The timing is deliberate. Several tax provisions are set to expire in 2026, and lawmakers want clarity on staking before broader tax debates take precedence. They also noted that prolonged uncertainty could invite unfavorable court rulings that lock in interpretations through precedent rather than policy. The PARITY Act and Broader Crypto Tax Reform Alongside the IRS letter, Representatives Steven Horsford and Max Miller have introduced a discussion draft known as the Digital Asset PARITY Act . The proposal takes a wider view of crypto taxation, including a de minimis exemption for regulated stablecoin payments used in everyday transactions. Small gains or losses from these payments would generally not be taxed, mirroring existing treatment for low-value foreign currency exchanges. For staking and mining, the PARITY Act stops short of eliminating immediate taxation but proposes allowing taxpayers to defer income recognition for up to five years. Supporters say this could provide interim relief while lawmakers work toward permanent clarity. The bill also extends wash-sale rules and certain securities tax provisions to actively traded digital assets, aiming to curb abuse without expanding loopholes. What Comes Next for Crypto Investors Together, these efforts signal growing consensus in Congress that crypto taxation needs refinement rather than piecemeal fixes. While no changes are guaranteed, the push to address staking double taxation reflects a shift toward more technical, outcome-focused policymaking.

Key Takeaways: BlackRock named its spot Bitcoin ETF a top 2025 investment theme alongside Treasurys and big tech. IBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline. The fund now leads rivals by a wide margin, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios. The world’s largest asset manager said its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) together with an ETF tracking short-term Treasurys and another linked to the so-called “Magnificent 7” group of US tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Pulls $25B in Inflows Despite Bitcoin’s 2025 Pullback IBIT has drawn more than $25 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to market data, ranking sixth among all ETFs by inflows despite posting a negative return in 2025. The performance comes as Bitcoin has slid roughly 30% from its October peak, a drawdown that has not deterred investor demand. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said BlackRock’s decision to spotlight IBIT shows the firm remains comfortable backing Bitcoin through market cycles. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed that view, noting that if the fund can attract $25 billion in a weaker year, the upside during a stronger market could be significantly larger.

Despite IBIT being down this year. iShares clearly not panicking over shorter-term btc price moves. pic.twitter.com/o8QWDLFaPk — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 22, 2025 The latest inflows add to the roughly $37 billion IBIT attracted in 2024, bringing total net inflows since launch to about $62.5 billion, according to Farside Investors. That figure puts IBIT well ahead of competitors, with flows more than five times larger than those of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, its closest rival. BlackRock has continued to build out its crypto-linked ETF lineup beyond spot Bitcoin exposure. In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures. The strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets. IBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year. IBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion. In November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features. Despite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.

Bitcoin Open Interest Has Witnessed An Uptick According to data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the surge Bitcoin has seen to kick off Monday has come alongside a spike in the Bitcoin perpetual futures Open Interest. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflow Slowdown: CryptoQuant Founder Says Sentiment Could Take Months To Recover The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of BTC perpetual futures positions that are currently open on all derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market. Since such a trend usually accompanies an increase in leverage for the sector, it can lead to more volatility for the asset. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies investors are either pulling back on risk or getting liquidated by their platform. This kind of trend can result in the cryptocurrency’s price behaving in a more stable manner. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the last couple of weeks: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest rose from 304,000 BTC to 310,000 BTC as the cryptocurrency observed a recovery surge to $90,000 during the past day. This represents an increase of about 2%, which isn’t much, but still signals that the rally encouraged traders to open up new positions on the perpetual futures market. The Open Interest includes both types of positions when calculating its value, so it contains no information about whether positions have a bias toward shorts or longs. Another metric called the Funding Rate can be used to determine that instead. This indicator measures the amount of periodic fee that perpetual futures traders are exchanging between each other. A positive value implies long investors are paying a premium to the shorts in order to hold onto their positions, while a negative one implies bearish bets are dominant. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Outflows Soar To $978M: Sign Of Dip Buying? As the below chart shows, the Bitcoin Funding Rate has been positive for much of the last two weeks, indicating that a bullish sentiment has been shared by the majority of perpetual futures traders. This metric also noted an uptick alongside the increase in the Open Interest, going from 0.04% to 0.09%. “This combination signals a renewed buildup in leveraged long positioning, as perpetual traders position for a potential year-end move,” noted Glassnode.

His analysis focuses on a bullish RSI divergence currently forming, which he notes is extremely rare for XRP. This pattern mirrors a setup seen in 2022, during the bear market bottom, when XRP traded around $0.28. Following that divergence, the token stabilized and reversed direction. $XRP is currently showing a bullish RSI divergence on the daily timeframe — the same signal we saw in 2022 at the bear market bottom, when price was trading around $0.28. After that divergence, XRP stabilized, reversed, and eventually rallied aggressively to new all-time… pic.twitter.com/AfSvmsYUki — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 20, 2025 RSI Divergence and Market Dynamics The chart shows XRP’s price forming lower lows while the RSI simultaneously forms higher lows. This bullish divergence indicates that selling pressure is weakening while buying momentum is quietly building. The analyst stated, “Nothing is guaranteed — but from a technical perspective, this is one of the strongest early reversal signals you can get.” The current RSI reading stands at 40.61, reinforcing that the asset is not oversold but nearing a critical point for potential upward movement. Historically, such divergences on XRP’s daily chart have signaled significant price reversals. The repeating pattern between the 2022 setup and the current chart suggests that XRP could experience stabilization before resuming an upward trajectory . Steph points out that these signals are extremely rare, which increases their relevance for traders watching for early signs of market recovery. Chart Patterns and Repeating Trends The visual comparison with 2022 demonstrates a clear repeating trend. In both instances, the market saw lower price lows forming while the RSI trended higher. In 2022, this divergence preceded a steady reversal that eventually led to a strong rally in subsequent years. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Steph is watching closely, as XRP could follow a similar path if market conditions align. The lower trendline in the daily chart provides a potential support level near $1.8, which may act as a base for renewed buying interest. At the time of Steph’s analysis, XRP traded at $1.99, sitting just above that level. What’s Next for XRP? The emergence of a bullish divergence on XRP’s daily chart offers a compelling technical signal reminiscent of the 2022 bear market bottom. However, market participants should note that early signs of reversal, such as this divergence, often precede more significant moves but do not ensure them. If the pattern follows historical trends, XRP could stabilize and potentially enter a strong upward phase , offering traders an early indication of market recovery.

CEX listings for new tokens are relatively small compared to their total supply, according to recent research. Centralized exchanges only distribute a relatively small part of newly listed tokens. In 2025, Binance received criticism for potentially increasing selling pressure, suggesting the token allocation was too big. Recent research showed most new token listings distributed around 5% of their supply through a centralized exchange, with under 1% for larger projects. Centralized exchanges have also tried to be more transparent on their available supply of new tokens. Binance received relatively small token allocations Binance is the venue for some of the high-profile listings in 2025. The exchange is chosen more often, as BNB Chain is one of the main venues for new tokens. Roughly 40% of newly listed tokens are on BNB Chain, competing with Ethereum and Solana. As a result, Binance has revealed that most projects allocate 5% of their supply for liquidity and airdrops during the CEX listing process. Projects with a higher fully diluted value (FDV) often allocate under 1% of the token supply. Mid-tier projects allocate more, to boost user incentives and encourage trading. Some projects allocate additional tokens to market makers, based on external agreements. The token allocations are not a fee to the exchange, and are not retained. Instead, the CEX allocations flow back into user accounts, wallets, or are used to create ecosystem programs. Token allocations then go toward launchpools, rewards, airdrops, liquidity programs, as well as token marketing. Allocations were also scrutinized, as most new token launches crashed in 2025, erasing over 85% of their value. Binance became more transparent with token listings In 2025, Binance also introduced a more transparent listing approach. The market differentiated Binance Alpha, Futures, and Direct Spot markets, with goals and criteria to move between stages. Some of the new tokens also launch on DEXs, reflecting a different set of price pressures. DEX trading has also led to uncontrolled selling, as well as direct involvement of whales and insiders. Overall, the low confidence in altcoins and tokens has led to crashes for most newly listed assets, whether centralized or decentralized. Despite this, Binance has supported multiple tokens in 2025, boosting liquidity and exposure. Binance Launchpool tokens mostly logged losses, though the exchange gave exposure to multiple projects in 2025. | Source: Bubblescanner . Binance Alpha Spotlight tokens have produced outsized gains , at least in the short term. The listing feature also had the largest number of tokens available in the past year. Binance has also used its Launchpad, Launchpool, HODLer airdrop and wallet facilities, though with a much lower number of tokens in the past year.

56224618,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=250973,1766480111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Update: Bybit Delists GALA/USDC Spot Trading Pair – What Traders Must Know,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-delists-gala-usdc-pair/,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Update: Bybit Delists GALA/USDC Spot Trading Pair – What Traders Must Know Attention cryptocurrency traders: Bybit has made a significant announcement that directly impacts the GALA/USDC spot trading pair. The exchange confirmed it will remove this specific trading pair from its platform, creating immediate questions for active traders. This development represents more than just a routine update—it signals important shifts in market dynamics and exchange strategy that every informed trader should understand. What Does Bybit’s GALA/USDC Delisting Mean for You? Bybit officially announced through its communication channels that the GALA/USDC spot trading pair will be delisted at precisely 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 30. This means traders will no longer be able to execute spot trades between GALA and USDC on the Bybit platform after this deadline. The exchange typically provides such notices to give users adequate time to adjust their trading strategies and manage their positions. For current holders of either asset in this pair, understanding the timeline becomes crucial. Therefore, you should mark these key dates: December 30, 8:00 a.m. UTC: Trading ceases completely for the GALA/USDC spot trading pair Post-delisting: Any remaining open orders will be automatically canceled Withdrawal period: Typically exchanges allow asset withdrawals for a limited time after delisting Why Would Bybit Remove a Trading Pair? Exchanges like Bybit regularly evaluate their listed trading pairs based on several important metrics. When a GALA/USDC spot trading pair shows declining performance, the exchange may decide to remove it to optimize platform resources. Common reasons for delisting include: Low trading volume and liquidity Changing regulatory considerations Strategic refocusing on more popular pairs Technical or maintenance requirements This particular decision regarding the GALA/USDC spot trading pair follows industry patterns where exchanges streamline their offerings to concentrate on pairs with stronger market demand. While initially inconvenient for some traders, such moves often improve overall platform efficiency. Immediate Action Steps for Affected Traders If you actively trade the GALA/USDC spot trading pair on Bybit, you need to take specific actions before December 30. First, review any open orders involving this pair and consider closing them before the deadline. Second, explore alternative trading options that Bybit continues to support. The exchange likely maintains other GALA trading pairs, such as GALA/USDT, which could serve as viable alternatives. Remember these practical steps: Close all open orders for the GALA/USDC spot trading pair before delisting Consider converting assets to other supported pairs if needed Withdraw assets to another exchange if you prefer continued GALA/USDC trading Monitor official Bybit announcements for any updates or extensions Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market The delisting of the GALA/USDC spot trading pair reflects larger trends in cryptocurrency exchange operations. As the market matures, exchanges increasingly focus on liquidity concentration—directing trading activity toward fewer, more liquid pairs. This approach generally benefits most traders through better price discovery and reduced slippage, though it may inconvenience those attached to specific pairs. For the GALA ecosystem specifically, the removal of one trading pair doesn’t necessarily indicate problems with the token itself. Many assets maintain multiple trading pairs across different exchanges, and the GALA/USDC spot trading pair remains available on numerous other platforms. However, traders should always consider liquidity depth when selecting where to execute their trades. Navigating Exchange Changes Successfully Experienced cryptocurrency traders understand that exchange updates—including delistings—represent normal market evolution. The key to navigating these changes lies in staying informed and adaptable. Bybit’s transparent communication about the GALA/USDC spot trading pair removal demonstrates professional exchange management, giving traders reasonable notice to adjust their strategies. Successful traders typically: Diversify their trading across multiple exchanges Maintain awareness of exchange announcements and updates Have contingency plans for unexpected platform changes Understand that market structure evolves continuously Final Thoughts on the Delisting Decision Bybit’s decision to delist the GALA/USDC spot trading pair represents a strategic business choice common in the dynamic cryptocurrency exchange landscape. While requiring adjustment from some traders, such moves generally aim to improve overall platform performance and user experience. The December 30 deadline provides adequate time for affected users to transition their trading activities to alternative pairs or platforms. The most resilient traders view these developments as opportunities rather than obstacles. They adapt their strategies, explore new trading options, and maintain flexibility in their approach to cryptocurrency markets. As the industry continues to mature, expect further optimization of trading pairs across all major exchanges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What happens to my GALA or USDC holdings after the delisting? Your actual GALA and USDC assets remain safe in your Bybit wallet. Only the specific trading pair between them is being removed. You can still trade GALA through other pairs like GALA/USDT or withdraw your assets to another exchange. Can I still withdraw GALA and USDC from Bybit after December 30? Yes, typically exchanges allow withdrawals of delisted assets for a considerable period after trading ceases. However, you should check Bybit’s official announcement for specific withdrawal deadlines and any potential fees. Will this delisting affect GALA’s price on other exchanges? While a single exchange delisting might cause minor temporary price fluctuations, significant price impact usually requires multiple major exchanges removing support simultaneously. The GALA/USDC pair remains available on many other platforms. Are other GALA trading pairs being delisted from Bybit? Based on the current announcement, only the GALA/USDC spot trading pair is affected. Other GALA pairs, particularly GALA/USDT, continue to operate normally on Bybit. Should I be concerned about GALA’s future if a pair gets delisted? Not necessarily. Exchange delistings of specific pairs often relate to trading volume metrics rather than fundamental concerns about the asset itself. Many successful cryptocurrencies experience pair delistings while continuing to thrive. Where else can I trade GALA/USDC if I want to continue this specific pair? Major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and KuCoin typically support GALA/USDC trading. Always verify current listings and check liquidity before trading on any platform.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $110K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $87,538 (-1.7%) Market capitalization $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $89,650 24-hour low $87,500 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $87,538 Price Prediction $ 97,689 (+7.52%) Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 7.85% (High) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA $ 102,576 200-Day SMA $ 104,352 14-Day RSI 39.65 (Neutral) Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faces bearish pressure below $88K Resistance for BTC is at $90,397 Support for BTC/USD is at $84,571 The BTC price analysis for 23 December confirms that BTC faces a decline in bullish volatility as the price declines below $88K. Currently, the price is aiming for a consolidation within a bearish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces minor selling pressure Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bearish pressure as it dropped below $88K. Currently, the BTC price is facing selling domination around immediate resistance channels. The 24-hour volume has declined to $1.28 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $87,538, decreasing by over 1.7% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades at 43, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Buying domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. Currently, buyers are aiming for a trend continuation above $100K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.39, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD indicator has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $90,397, it will fuel a bullish rally to $94,358. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $84,571, beginning a bearish trend to $80,959. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling pressure as buyers failed to push the price above immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , PayPal has launched a sweepstakes running from November 17 to December 21, offering weekly prizes and a total of 1,008 winners for eligible U.S. residents. The company promoted the event on X, highlighting over $1 million in bitcoin prizes with no purchase required. Bitcoin price prediction December 2025 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a peak around December 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction December 2025 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $110,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $110,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-23 08:57:28

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-bitcoin-holders-switch-to-xrp-now-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Pumpius (@pumpius) has warned about near-term market conditions while outlining why his focus has shifted toward XRP. His post centered on a large Bitcoin options expiry scheduled for December 26 and the market behavior that often follows events of such magnitude. Pumpius stated that $23.66 billion in Bitcoin options will expire on that date. He emphasized the scale of the event, noting that it represents more than 1% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization rolling off in a single session. He described this as a “pressure event,” not a routine expiry, and cautioned traders against ignoring derivatives data. Bitcoin is walking into a volatility trap right after Christmas. SWITCH TO XRP NOW. On December 26, $23.66B YES.. twenty three point six six billion dollars worth of BTC options expire. That is over one percent of Bitcoin’s entire market cap rolling off on a single day.… pic.twitter.com/2tdUmqMs1Z — Pumpius (@pumpius) December 20, 2025 What the Chart Shows The chart attached to Pumpius’ post shows Bitcoin options open interest by strike price ahead of the Dec. 26 expiry. Calls significantly outweigh puts, pushing the put-to-call ratio near 0.38. Total open interest remains elevated, confirming that positioning is heavily skewed to the upside. The chart also identifies a max pain level around $96,000, where the largest share of options would expire worthless. Pumpius stressed that when positioning becomes this one-sided, price action often loses clarity. Instead of trending, the price reacts to hedging activity around major strikes. He warned that large expiries tend to produce chop, pinning, violent wicks, and fake breakouts. Large players hedge around liquidity zones, not technical signals. Traders who rely on candles often increase leverage at the wrong time, which is how both sides get liquidated. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why He Is Looking at XRP Pumpius explained why he is increasingly focused on XRP during this period. While XRP holds numerous advantages over Bitcoin , Pumpius has chosen it because it does not have the same bloated options market distorting price action. He contrasted Bitcoin’s heavy derivatives pressure with what he described as cleaner conditions in XRP. He said XRP is seeing spot accumulation through ETFs . He also stated that supply is being absorbed rather than gamed through derivatives. In his view, institutional infrastructure continues to build beneath XRP while Bitcoin contends with option-driven gravity. Pumpius described this shift as rotation, not abandonment. He said traders do not need to exit Bitcoin forever. However, trading BTC through a $23.66 billion options expiry exposes participants to unnecessary risk. His decision is mechanical, not emotional . Positioning Over Noise Pumpius closed by reinforcing his core principle. He follows positioning, not noise. When he rotates, he does it early. His post argues that understanding derivatives structure before it appears on price charts gives traders an edge. In this case, that structure is what led him to favor XRP over Bitcoin as 2025 ends.

A crucial Bitcoin price analysis from noted crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. reveals that reclaiming the $90,000 level isn’t just another milestone—it’s the critical threshold separating continued pressure from a potential bullish revival. With BTC hovering around $87,400, understanding this dynamic is essential for every market participant. What Does This Bitcoin Price Analysis Reveal About Holder Sentiment? According to Adler’s Bitcoin price analysis , the current trading price sits below the average cost basis for short-term holders. This simple fact carries significant psychological weight. When investors see red in their portfolios, their behavior changes dramatically. The nearest resistance level sits at $90,300, meaning most who bought recently are currently underwater. This creates a zone of potential selling pressure that the market must overcome. Think of it this way: the moment the price approaches their break-even point, many of these holders will be tempted to exit their positions simply to avoid further loss. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy of resistance. Therefore, this Bitcoin price analysis isn’t just about charts; it’s about understanding crowd psychology at a key technical level. Why is the $90,000 Level So Pivotal for Recovery? The $90,000 mark represents more than a round number. Adler’s Bitcoin price analysis identifies it as the initial signpost for a genuine trend reversal. Consolidation above this level would signal that buying pressure has finally absorbed the selling from frustrated short-term holders. Until that happens, the market remains in a state of indecision. Psychological Barrier: It represents the break-even point for many, turning resistance into potential support. Momentum Indicator: A sustained move above $90K suggests renewed institutional or long-term investor confidence. Technical Necessity: It’s the level that must be conquered to invalidate the current bearish short-term structure. This detailed Bitcoin price analysis underscores a simple truth: markets need catalysts. A clean break above $90,000 could be that catalyst, shifting narrative from ‘distribution’ back to ‘accumulation.’ What Are the Risks if Bitcoin Fails to Reclaim $90K? The conclusion of this Bitcoin price analysis presents a clear warning. Adler states that if buying pressure does not increase sufficiently, downward pressure is likely to continue. This isn’t mere speculation; it’s based on the observable behavior of market participants. Without the momentum to push through the $90,300 resistance, the path of least resistance remains down. Short-term holders, currently at a loss, may grow impatient. Their selling, even at a loss, could fuel a deeper correction. This scenario highlights the importance of the $90,000 level as a line in the sand. For traders and investors, this Bitcoin price analysis provides a concrete level to watch. A rejection at this zone would be a strong signal to reassess bullish assumptions in the near term. Actionable Insights from This Market Analysis How can you use this Bitcoin price analysis ? First, monitor the $90,000 to $90,300 zone closely. A strong, high-volume breakout could signal the start of the next leg up. Second, manage risk accordingly. The analyst’s point about intensified selling near the break-even point is crucial. Expect volatility around that level. Finally, remember that analysis provides a framework, not a guarantee. This Bitcoin price analysis by Axel Adler Jr. gives us the ‘what’ and ‘why.’ The ‘when’ and ‘how’ are always up to the market. The key takeaway is undeniable: the battle for $90,000 will be a decisive one for Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who is Axel Adler Jr. and why is his analysis important? A: Axel Adler Jr. is a recognized cryptocurrency analyst known for on-chain and market sentiment analysis. His insights are valued for focusing on concrete data like holder cost basis, which reveals underlying market stress points. Q: What is the ‘average cost basis’ for short-term holders? A: It’s the average price at which investors who bought Bitcoin within the last 155 days (common definition of ‘short-term’) purchased their coins. When the current price falls below this average, it indicates most recent buyers are at a loss. Q: Does this analysis mean Bitcoin will definitely drop if it doesn’t break $90K? A: Not definitely, but it increases the probability. The analysis identifies $90K as a critical resistance level. A failure to break through suggests the selling pressure from underwater holders remains stronger than new buying demand, which often leads to lower prices. Q: What should a long-term Bitcoin investor do with this information? A: Long-term investors might view volatility around this key level as a potential accumulation opportunity, but should always align actions with their own risk tolerance and investment strategy, not just a single piece of analysis. Q: Are there other indicators to watch alongside the $90K level? A: Yes. Trading volume on the breakout attempt is critical. Low-volume moves are less trustworthy. Additionally, watch broader market sentiment and macroeconomic factors, as crypto rarely moves in isolation. Q: How quickly could a trend reversal happen if $90K is reclaimed? A: A trend reversal is a process, not an instant event. Reclaiming $90K would be the first step. The analyst notes the price needs to consolidate above that level before a full-fledged bullish trend can be expected, which could take days or weeks.

For XRP, true adoption is measured by real-world usage, transactions, liquidity, and financial integration, not short-term hype. XRP’s network proves its utility with over 4 billion transactions settled in seconds with near-zero fees, showcasing a fast, efficient, and cost-effective payment rail that matters to institutions more than retail hype. Liquidity is central to XRP’s real-world impact. Unlike tokens with sporadic activity, XRP delivers deep, consistent liquidity across exchanges and corridors, enabling large-scale, meaningful value transfers. Transactions reflect actual capital movement, not just paper gains, making the network a dependable tool for global finance. Institutional adoption underscores this utility. Leading financial players issue and transfer assets on-chain, signaling trust in XRP as a settlement and payment solution. Rather than existing as a speculative token, XRP powers tangible financial operations, from cross-border payments to enterprise liquidity management. Well, XRP’s evolution mirrors Bitcoin’s early path, from speculative hype to recognition for real infrastructure and utility. While retail adoption grows, XRP’s foundation is being solidified through institution-driven use. As financial products leveraging XRP expand, mainstream users are likely to follow, just as they did with Bitcoin and Ethereum. In essence, Ripple CTO David Schwartz reframes the conversation: price is fleeting, adoption is lasting. By tracking transaction volume, liquidity, and institutional engagement, it becomes clear that XRP’s value lies in real-world utility, not short-term speculation. It’s about a network built to work, consistently and at scale. Conclusion In short, XRP’s true value isn’t in volatile price swings but in real-world usage and institutional adoption. With growing transaction volume, deepening liquidity, and integration into financial systems, XRP is emerging as more than a digital asset, it’s a foundational infrastructure for global finance.

Kalshi is moving beyond just trading infrastructure with the launch of its own research division that is dedicated to studying prediction markets and turning platform data into actionable insights, according to a December 22 announcement from the predictions market operator. Kalshi’s new research arm will give academics access to proprietary information that is derived from its internal dataset. According to the company, its platform holds what it calls “the world’s largest and highest quality repository of prediction market data,” and that will serve as a foundational tool for deeper forecasting and policy research. Klashi’s data beats Wall Street forecasts As part of the launch, Kalshi has released the first internal study showcasing research conducted by its in-house team, where it compared its inflation predictions with the Wall Street consensus forecasts. The study found that Kalshi’s forecasts outperformed traditional estimates by 40%. Meanwhile, when it measured performance one week before official inflation releases, Kalshi’s forecasts matched or beat Wall Street in 85% of cases. Further, it proved more accurate with a 50% lower mean absolute error during times of market shocks, when forecasts typically deviate significantly from actual outcomes. “This is particularly important, as policymakers, investors, and executives can now be confident in using Kalshi data as a strong signal of forthcoming market volatility, and be prepared to react accordingly,” it added. Kalshi Research has already signed several high-profile partnerships with academics from Harvard, Stanford, Yale, and the University of Chicago. In the coming months, Kalshi will also host its first prediction market conference, with the goal of bringing researchers together to share insights and build on early findings. Kalshi launched as Kownig in 2018, and since then has worked to capture a federally regulated slice of the prediction market space. Over the past year, the company has become a go-to infrastructure provider and currently powers the event contracts platform for major brands like Robinhood , Coinbase , Crypto.com, and Phantom. Much of this momentum has come on the back of a key 2024 legal victory against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which labelled its inflation, politics, and sports contracts as legitimate federally regulated event contracts. With this legal clarity, Kalshi’s real-time data has become a major source of economic and forecasting information that is being used by organizations such as CNBC, CNN , Google Finance, and even the National Hockey League. In terms of growth, Kalshi has also drawn in a significant amount of funding across multiple rounds from top-tier investors like Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. As of November, Kalshi has raised roughly $1.5 billion and is valued at $11 billion. Kalshi’s US expansion faces resistance at the state level Even though Kalshi’s markets were greenlighted by federal regulators, several US states have opposed its operations by bringing lawsuits that challenge the legality of its contracts . Since the start of 2025, Kalshi has faced legal action in Nevada, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey. The latest legal clash came from Connecticut, where lawmakers argue that Kalshi is running unlicensed online gambling under state law and have issued cease-and-desist orders accordingly. Nevertheless, Kalshi has notched several important court victories, including in New Jersey, where a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction against enforcement, and in Washington, DC, where Kalshi successfully defended its right to operate political markets after the CFTC dropped its appeal.

Cardano (ADA), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are currently shortlisted as the top names to watch. ADA is still the favorite among whales, who are taking strategic positions around the strong fundamental base, while SHIB is holding strong around positive news about the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, has almost sold out in Phase 6 funding round and is now beyond 99% in the current price level, aiming to enter phase 7, with a price boost of 20% Cardano Attracts Whales Cardano had a tumultuous last month, with a loss close to 23%, but the recent whale activities show that there may be a turnaround forthcoming on this cryptocurrency. On the Cardano market, whales have been engaging in covert purchases exceeding $630 million in ADA, and the accounts containing 1-10 million ADA have increased the ADA within their hold amounts to 1.76 billion. There seems to be some hope in the charts. The price of Cardano has formed a lower low, but there seems to be a higher low in terms of the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This shows that there is a reduction in sell pressure at the support level. For a continuation of the trend in the upward direction, $0.48 needs to be recovered. Otherwise, there may be a fall below $0.33. SHIB Price Recovery Shiba Inu (SHIB) exhibits indicators of potentially imminent explosive price movement right around the corner. After a long consolidation phase, the SHIB/USDT trading chart appears to be at the very edge of a transitional phase, marking a likely breakout from the current technical structure. Taking into account the historical examples of range-bound markets leading to extreme highs, this technical forecast predicts an intense burst towards the upside on the SHIB chart. Technical analysis predicts a 3x jump following a confirmed trend reversal for SHIB, and reaching as high as 5x to 10x after several larger breaks through points of resistance with strong buying support. As crypto enthusiasts project the huge potential price jump of SHIB, the interest of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows how some upcoming tokens are going to be the next crypto to explode and soon top the list among all cryptocurrencies in terms of adoption and price performance. MUTM Presale Rise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming a go-to option among DeFi lovers in search of lucrative investment opportunities. Currently in Stage 6 of the presale, the token MUTM is priced at $0.035, a major jump from the initial Stage 1 price of $0.01. Surprisingly, 99% of Stage 6 tokens have already sold. With more than 18,560 contributors raising over $19.5 million, MUTM has recorded high adoption rates and growth potential. Phase 7 will see the token price rise to $0.04, making Stage 6 the final chance for investors to purchase at the lower price. With its robust tokenomics, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as the top crypto and a serious contender for the next crypto to explode. Community Rewards Drive Engagement and Loyalty Building an attractive, active, and loyal community is a key strategy employed by Mutuum Finance. A $100,000 giveaway of MUTM Tokens worth $10,000 each will be won by 10 presale participants. As whale accumulation in Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on the cusp of a possible breakout, MUTM is making early noise while flying under the radar. Presale phase 6 is over 99% sold at $0.035, with over 18,560 participants raising $19.5 million, with a small amount left before phase 7, where the price hikes up by 20% to $0.04. The lending options and benefits of mtToken, put together, create a distinct DeFi token. People searching for the next crypto to explode and those who are ready to put money into the best crypto project ready to grow in 2026 are running short on time.

With major altcoins down between 30% and 80% from their all-time high values, calls for an altcoin season have gone down drastically. This has been reflected in the performance of the Altcoin Season Index, falling to one of the lowest recorded levels in 2025 as the year draws to an end. Altcoin Season Index Says Losses Are The Order Of The Day The Altcoin Season Index Chart on the CoinMarketCap website, which tracks the performance of altcoins against Bitcoin, has now fallen below 20 again. This index collates the performance of the top 100 altcoins in the market, comparing their 90-day performance to that of Bitcoin, in order to pinpoint whether the market is currently experiencing an altcoin season. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Remains Stuck Inside This Range, But A Breakout Could Follow The index ranks the performance on a scale of 1-100, depending on how many altcoins out of the top 100 are outperforming Bitcoin, and uses that to score the market. At the time of writing, the Altcoin Season Index was sitting at a score of 17, which means only 17 of the top 100 altcoins have seen a better performance than Bitcoin in the last 90 days. With the index’s score sitting this low, it suggests that altcoins are currently in a bear market. Additionally, Ethereum, which is often the altcoin leader when it comes to an alt season, is still underperforming compared to Bitcoin. The second-largest cryptocurrency has recorded a 28.30% decrease in the last 90 days, while Bitcoin is down 21.10% in comparison. How To Know If Altcoins Are In A Bull Run? To know if the altcoin market is experiencing an altcoin season, the index would have to read at a score of 75 or higher. This is when the majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin in a 3-month period, and their combined market cap surpasses that of the leading cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Pundit Shares Why XRP Will Become Expensive And A $1,000 Price Tag Is Possible Scores lower than 75 suggest that the market is yet to enter a full-blown altcoin season, and the lower it goes, the higher the chances that altcoins are experiencing a bear market. However, the higher the Altcoin Season Index score is, nearing 100, the more likely it is that the altcoin market may be experiencing a top. Altcoin seasons are often characterized by rapid increases in price, with 100% rallies on a daily basis being the norm. The last major altcoin season was back in 2021, and while the expectation was that another altcoin season would begin in 2025, this has not been the case.

Put your Bitcoin or Ethereum on the table, borrow some cash, and keep your money on the line for a possible upside, freeing up liquidity without causing a taxable event. However, things have changed a lot in the last few years. After multiple crypto lending platforms, such as Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager, came crashing down in 2022, blindly trusting these platforms is no longer enough. The surviving platforms are competing on a different playing field now, where investors demand transparency. Platforms need to protect user funds and pass third-party audits as a basic requirement. For US investors, it has gotten even more complicated. Many DeFi protocols lock access to the United States, and state-by-state licensing requirements add additional complexity. The guide covers the top 8 crypto lending platforms to look at in 2026. We separated the CeFi and DeFi options, as they’re a core differentiator on both yield and experience. Quick Comparison: Top Crypto Lending Platforms Platform Type Best For Max LTV Annual Rates (APR) US Availability Nexo CeFi Flexibility & Credit Lines 50-90% 2.9% – 18.9% Yes (Restored April 2025) Ledn CeFi Bitcoin-only Security 50% ~12.4% Yes (Most States) Binance Loans CeFi Exchange Integration N/A N/A No (Retail loans unavailable) Coinrabbit CeFi Speed / No-KYC 50-90% ~14-17% No (TOS Restricted) Aave v3 DeFi General DeFi Liquidity 75-82% Variable (Market) Yes (Middleware required) Compound v3 DeFi Institutional Simplicity ~80% Variable (Market) Yes (Middleware required) Spark DeFi Stablecoin Borrowing 80% ~5-6% Frontend Restricted Morpho DeFi Rate Optimization Varies Market Optimized Yes (via Coinbase) What Is Crypto Lending and How Does It Work? How Crypto-Backed Loans Work A crypto loan functions like any secured loan: you pledge your collateral, receive funds, and get your collateral back when you repay the principal plus interest. Collateralization : You deposit your cryptocurrency. Say, 1 BTC was worth $100,000 at the time, and the lender assigns a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. If it’s at 50%, you can borrow up to $50,000. Monitoring : The loan stays active as long as the collateral maintains sufficient value. If Bitcoin’s price drops and your LTV rises past the liquidation threshold set by the platform, some or all of your collateral is sold to cover the debt. Repayment : Pay back the principal along with the accrued interest to unlock your collateral. CeFi vs. DeFi Lending: Key Differences The main difference between CeFi and DeFi lending is with custody. CeFi : You hand over your assets to them, and they manage it for you. You’re exposing yourself to counterparty risk. If the platform goes down, your collateral could end up in the bankruptcy estate. However, it’s not all bad. They provide a whole bunch of services that make things more convenient, like fiat on-ramps, customer support, and simplified tax reporting. DeFi platforms are also often registered entities, and you have avenues to reach out to when you have a legal dispute. DeFi : With DeFi, you’re dealing with smart contracts. You hook up your wallet, interact with smart contracts, and keep control of your assets. The upside is that the code is fully transparent, and nobody can change the rules. Every aspect, including the collateral and interest, is defined by smart contracts. The downside is that smart contracts can have bugs that can drain liquidity pools, and liquidations happen fast with no margin calls to warn you. Factor CeFi DeFi Custody Platform holds your assets You hold keys until deposit KYC Required Yes No Liquidation Speed Usually some grace period Immediate (automated) Recourse if Problems Customer support, legal None Primary Risk Platform insolvency Smart contract exploits Why Borrow Against Crypto, Rather Than Just Selling It? There are two main reasons people borrow, instead of just selling their assets: Tax Efficiency: Selling crypto is a taxable event in most countries, and it can be as high as 50%. Imagine losing $50K when you sell Bitcoin for $100K. Instead, you can borrow against the same Bitcoin and pay it back once your funds are available. Borrowing against crypto is not taxable. Keeping exposure: If you believe Bitcoin is going to go up in value before your loan is due, borrowing is the best approach. Imagine you want to invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum at the same time, and you believe that both of them will go up in value. You can borrow against your Bitcoin, buy Ethereum, and wait for it’s values to go up. Once you’re ready, you can lock in the profits with Ethereum, repay the loan, and unlock your Bitcoin, which has also gone up in value now. How We Evaluated These Platforms After multiple hacks and losses in 2022, crypto lending platforms are not purely about returns. Security and solvency: Is the platform publishing proof of reserves, and are the smart contracts being regularly audited? Are the funds under custody insured? Regulatory compliance: Where is the platform registered, and are they compliant? This is especially important for DeFi platforms. Economic models: We looked at the borrowing and supply rates. A tighter spread means a more efficient market and better rates for both the borrowers and lenders. US accessibility: A lot of crypto lending platforms now block US IP addresses. Those who are available in the US gained additional points due to their accessibility. Best CeFi Crypto Lending Platforms (Custodial) CeFi platforms offer a seamless user experience that’s similar to any modern fintech application. You get real customer support, fiat integration, and easy-to-use user interfaces. 1. Nexo : The Best Custodial Crypto Lending Platform After a brief hiatus, Nexo came back into the US market in April 2025. It is one of the few platforms offering a crypto-backed credit line, rather than fixed-term loans. You can instantly borrow against your portfolio and only pay interest for the cash you draw down. Nexo supports over 100 different cryptocurrencies as collateral. Interest Rates & LTV Nexo’s rates depend on their loyalty tier system, which is based on how many NEXO tokens you hold. The Platinum tier gets rates as low as 2.9% APR and LTV below 20%. The standard tier gets rates up to 18.9% LTV also depends on your collateral. It ranges from 15% on NEXO token, 50% on BTC/ETC, and up to 90% on stablecoins. Security & Compliance Nexo uses “real-time reserves attestation” from Moore Johannesburg. The assets are verified to be worth more than the liabilities 24/7. Custody is handled through a couple of third-party companies (Ledger Vault and Fireblocks) with substantial insurance coverage. Our Verdict Nexo is perfect for someone who wants a flexible credit line rather than a fixed loan, and doesn’t mind holding NEXO tokens for better rates. However, you need to consider whether holding NEXO tokens will actually be worth it for your situation. 2. Ledn : Best for Bitcoin Lending Ledn has become a crypto lending powerhouse and processed over $1 Billion in loans in the first 3 quarters of 2025. It has narrowed its focus and provides loans for only Bitcoin and USDC. An important feature of Ledn is “Custodied Loans.” It keeps your crypto with qualified custodians and is not allowed to lend it to other people for extra income. If Ledn ever goes under, your collateral should be safe from creditors. Interest Rates & LTV Standard Loan: 12.4% APR (10.4% interest + 2% admin fee) Custodied Loan: 13-14% because Ledn can’t make the extra cash from rehypothecation The max LTV is 50%. Security & Compliance Ledn does bi-annual proof-of-reserve reports with a unique hashed ID so you can check your specific balance is included in the report. Our Verdict It is ideal for Bitcoin users who want absolute guarantees. While the interest rates are a bit high, you’re paying for genuine peace of mind. 3. Binance Loans : Best Rates Among Exchanges If you’re outside of the US, Binance Global offers deep liquidity and competitive rates for crypto loans. It is a solid option if you’re already a Binance user, or if you don’t want to move your liquidity to a dedicated loan platform. Interest Rates & LTV Variable by asset and loan term. It also keeps changing. Generally, it is competitive with the broader market. Security & Compliance Binance has maintained significant regulatory scrutiny over the years, but has maintained significant insurance funds. The exchange has also been through several cycles, always coming out unscathed. Binance. The US does not offer crypto loans and is for trading only. US residents cannot legally access the global lending platform. Our Verdict Binance loans are perfect for international traders who already use the exchange. However, it is irrelevant for Americans. 4. CoinRabbit – Best For High TVL Loans CoinRabbit is a centralized platform that offers crypto loans without KYC. You have to send collateral to a generated address and receive stablecoins within minutes. LTVs go up to 90%, which is aggressive by industry standards. Interest Rates & LTV 14-17% APR reflecting the platform’s risk profile, and up to 90% LTV. Security & Compliance Coincheck has a four-step process for security: Always-on monitoring that verifies every blockchain hash, rechecks all balances mathematically, performs economic integrity checks, and then validates and signs the data while triggering alerts on discrepancies. However, accessing CoinRabbit from the US violates their terms. Our Verdict Coinrabbit has the convenience of a centralized lending platform, and at the same time, no KYC like DeFi platforms. While the interest rates are a bit high, it offers the best of both worlds. Best DeFi Crypto Lending Platforms (No Custody) DeFi lending platforms run on smart contracts on the blockchain. The rules are the rules, and they run like clockwork. At the same time, there’s no customer support to speak to, and no arguments with margin calls. 1. Aave v3 – Overall Best DeFi Lending Protocol Aave is the biggest name in the DeFi lending space with regard to the total value locked in. The latest version, Aave V3, came with a few new tricks. The efficiency mode (e-Mode) lets you go up to 97% LTV ratio when you’re using correlated assets as collateral. That’s like borrowing stablecoins, USDC against DAI. Another feature is the isolation mode, which will limit your exposure to newly listed assets that have higher risks. Current Rates (Borrow/Lend) Rates are constantly evolving and are based on how much of the available credit is being used. As of late 2025, here’s where things stand: Borrowing USDC is at just over 5.5% APR, and ETH at 1.7% APR Supplying USDC gets you a return of 3.5-4% Security & Audits Aave is governed by AAVE token holders through the Aave DAO. The Aave smart contracts have been around for a while, and as one of the most popular lending platforms, its smart contracts have been reviewed by many companies, including Sigma Prime, OpenZeppelin, and others. It also has a protocol-level insurance model to cover any shortfalls. Our verdict You need to be an experienced DeFi user to be comfortable with managing your own wallet and navigating any frontend restrictions. However, Aave has the deepest pool of liquidity and battle-tested code. It should be the starting point for most people looking to explore DeFi loans. 2. Compound V3 : Best for Institutional Grade Liquidity The newest version of Compound, also called “Comet,” simplified the whole protocol architecture. Rather than spreading the risk across different assets, each market is its own isolated unit. You can put in collateral in one asset, and typically borrow USDC. However, if you have loans on multiple assets and one of them turns bad, it will only liquidate assets from that market. It won’t drain liquidity from others. Current Rates (Borrow/Lend) Rates are a bit lower than Aave and generally less volatile: Borrowing USDC is at 4-5% APR Security & Audits Compound has been operational for many years without major exploits. It also undergoes multiple audits every year. They were the first protocol to pioneer the whole liquidity pool model, which is an industry standard now. Our verdict Compound is for conservative DeFi users who are looking for something that’s just simple and straightforward. It has fewer features than Aave, but it is easier to use. It’s a good choice for “set it and forget it” borrowing. 3. MakerDAO / Spark Protocol – Best for Borrowing Stablecoins Sky protocol is essentially an evolution of MakerDAO, and Spark is the user interface. What makes MakerDAO unique is that you’re not borrowing from a pool. Instead, you get to mint new USDS (previously known as DAI) against your collateral. Since the liquidity is not coming from other users, you can get more competitive rates. Current Rates (Borrow/Lend) Borrowing USDS is currently at 5.3% (set by governance vote) If you deposit USDC, you can get a return of 4.25% Security & Audits MakerDAO has been around since 2017, which is a good track record in the DeFi space. They’ve survived multiple market corrections without any problems. However, the web interface blocks all US IP addresses and also known VPN endpoints. Our verdict It is ideal for users who want to borrow stablecoins at competitive rates, with stablecoin as collateral. Spark is a great protocol and has been a market leader when it comes to innovation in the DeFi space. 4. Morpho – Best for Optimized Yield Morpho is a peer-to-peer matching layer on top of Aave and Compoind. When you lend or borrow through Morpho, it tries to match you up with another user. This way, both sites get better rates since it’s a direct transaction. If you’re unable to match with anyone, it falls back to the underlying liquidity pools in Aave and Compound. This results in tighter spreads between the cost of borrowing and revenue from lending. Current Rates (Borrow/Lend) You can currently borrow at about 4.6% with Morpho, compared to 5.5% on vanilla Aave pools. Security & Audits Morpho has a long list of verified audits by reputable companies and is even partnered with big players like Coinbase. Our verdict One of Morpho’s strengths is its availability in the US. It is the best lending platform for US retail investors to access DeFi rates. Coinbase is partnered with Morpho to power its crypto-backed loan product. Coinbase is one of the easiest platforms to use, without the complexities of other DeFi platforms. Can You Get a Crypto Loan Without Collateral? The short answer is no. At least for retail investors. But there are a couple of things to explore with DeFi collateral: Flash Loans: Not For Everyday Use Technically, you can borrow unlimited cash without having to put up collateral. They’re called flash loans, available on Aave and Uniswap. However, there’s a catch: the funds have to be borrowed and repaid in the same blockchain transaction. It is a cool tool for developers and arbitrage bots. But not something for retail investors to take advantage of. Under-Collateralized Loans: Only Available To Big Spenders Platforms like Goldfinch and Maple Finance offer under-collateralized loans. But they’re only available for institutional investors with deep pockets and have passed rigorous off-chain checks. What Should You Expect From Crypto Loan Rates in 2026? In 2025, we’ve seen crypto loan rates stabilize into clearer and more predictable ranges. At the same time, we got a range of platforms to choose from. For 2026, we expect this to only improve as more liquidity enters the market. The interest and borrowing rate spreads will get tighter, making it a win for the market. 2025 was also a big year for partnerships and innovations. We’re excited to see how some of the top DeFi platforms will evolve and offer us new features. What Is Driving The Interest Rates? Platform Type : CeFi platforms have higher rates as you’re paying for operating costs for holding your assets. DeFi, on the other hand, is very efficient. Asset volatility : Volatile assets have higher interest rates to account for their risks. Stablecoin collateral gets better LTV comparatively. Utilization : When the usage is high, interest rates shoot up. It follows the market. Risks You Should Be Aware of in Crypto Lending CeFi Platforms – The Risk Of Crypto Bust Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager – all of them were CeFi lending platforms that went down in 2022, resulting in loss of user funds. Even the leading lending platforms can fail. That’s why Ledn’s custodied loans are special. They can legally keep collateral separate from the company’s balance sheet. Smart Contract Risk If there’s a bug or a vulnerability in the smart contract, there’s a real risk that an attacker will drain the entire pool. It is recommended that you stick with protocols that have been around for a long time and have had their code audited multiple times. Liquidation Risk When markets get ugly, you’re at risk of getting liquidation. Then there are flash crashes. A temporary crash in price can result in your collateral getting liquidated, and there’s no going back. The market is fast and unforgiving. And that’s why it’s important to have a conservative LTV and monitor your loan so that you can up your collateral if necessary. Regulatory Uncertainty Crypto is still very new, and some countries have only now gotten to regulating exchanges. There’s still a long way to go with regulators catching up. It’s only getting harder to navigate with new tax laws and complex compliance rules. How Do You Choose The Right Crypto Lending Platform? Define your goal: Are you looking to borrow or lend and get some yield? Depending on your purpose, you might want to go with one platform or another. Do you wish to hold your own keys or rely on a custodian? A DeFi platform is for users who want to hold control of their crypto. And CeFi platforms are for those who want the convenience. Confirm that the platform is legally accessible : Many countries block DeFi platforms for regulatory reasons. And in the US, there are also state-level restrictions in place. Compare rates and check LTV: If a platform is saying 2.9% but that’s at only 20% LTV, you are locking up significant liquidity for a small loan. It’s fine if it covers you. But if you’re looking for more LTC, you’ll have to explore more options. Verify security practices: For CeFi platforms, proof of reserves, insurance, and track record are essential. Similarly, with DeFi platforms, their recent audits and protocol safety need to be assessed thoroughly. The Final Verdict: Which Crypto Lending Platform Will Work Best for You? There’s no one platform that fits all. You need to decide on the best platform based on your requirements. If you’re looking for Bitcoin loans, Ledn is probably the best option. Their custodied loan means you don’t have to worry about any counterparty risk. For US retail investors looking for DeFi rates, you can’t go wrong with Morpho via Coinbase. If you want the best of everything, Nexo is a good choice. They offer a revolving credit with competitive rates. Similarly, Aave V3 is a solid DeFi option with deep liquidity and loads of features. The whole market was turned upside down with a series of setbacks in 2022. We’re still feeling its ripple effects. Your job as a borrower is to do some digging, check the audits, and make sure they won’t let you down.",Cryptocurrency Guides|AAVE|Binance|COmpound|Ledn|MakerDAO|MORPHO|Nexo,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-23 09:35:06

The firm sent 2,000 ETH, valued at approximately $5.93 million, to Singapore’s DBS Bank. This transaction is part of a larger pattern, bringing their total transfers to the bank to a staggering $13.2 million in just two days. But what does this mean for the broader market and institutional adoption of digital assets? What Are the Details of the GSR Markets ETH Transfer? According to data from on-chain analytics provider The Data Nerd, this latest GSR Markets ETH transfer occurred about an hour before the news broke. The transaction involved moving 2,000 Ethereum tokens directly to an address associated with DBS Bank. This is not an isolated event. Over the past 48 hours, GSR has moved a total of 4,400 ETH to the same banking institution. This consistent activity suggests a strategic partnership or a specific operational need rather than a one-off trade. For context, GSR Markets is a major player in the digital asset space, providing liquidity and market-making services. Their actions are often seen as a bellwether for institutional sentiment. Therefore, a sustained GSR Markets ETH transfer to a traditional bank like DBS is highly significant. It blurs the lines between conventional finance and the crypto ecosystem. Why Is This Transfer to DBS Bank So Important? This series of transfers highlights several key trends in cryptocurrency. First, it underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets by major financial institutions. DBS Bank, a leading bank in Asia, has been proactive in embracing blockchain technology and digital currencies. Institutional Validation: When a bank of DBS’s stature engages in large ETH transactions, it legitimizes Ethereum as a credible asset class for other traditional finance players. Liquidity Movement: The movement of such a large sum from a market maker into a bank could indicate several things: securing assets, facilitating client services, or preparing for new financial products. Market Confidence: A GSR Markets ETH transfer of this scale, especially during volatile market conditions, can signal underlying confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value. This activity goes beyond a simple transaction. It represents a tangible link in the chain of institutional adoption, where crypto assets are seamlessly integrated into the legacy financial system. What Does This Mean for Ethereum and Crypto Investors? For everyday investors and crypto enthusiasts, this news is more than just a headline. It provides actionable insights into market dynamics. The recurring nature of the GSR Markets ETH transfer suggests a structured, ongoing process. This could be related to DBS’s digital asset exchange, which allows institutional and accredited investors to trade. Therefore, watching the flow of assets from large market makers to regulated banks can be a useful indicator. It often precedes increased institutional activity or the launch of new services that require substantial liquidity. For Ethereum holders, this is a positive long-term signal, reinforcing the network’s utility and store-of-value proposition in the eyes of major financial players. Conclusion: A Signal of Maturing Markets The latest GSR Markets ETH transfer to DBS Bank is a powerful testament to the accelerating convergence of traditional and decentralized finance. It demonstrates that major financial institutions are not just observing the crypto space but are actively participating and building infrastructure to support it. This movement of capital is a clear vote of confidence and a step toward a more integrated financial future. While the exact reasons behind the transfer remain known only to the parties involved, the market impact is undeniable: it adds another layer of credibility and stability to the Ethereum ecosystem.

Solana has re-entered focus following renewed institutional alignment and improving technical structure, raising expectations of a push toward higher resistance levels. At the same time, capital is flowing aggressively into early-stage projects priced well below $0.05, where volatility and upside potential tend to converge. Among these, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a standout contender, prompting renewed discussion around which crypto to buy today for short-term positioning as traders balance stability against asymmetric upside. Solana Price Structure Signals Tactical Opportunity Solana’s recent price behavior reflects a shift from corrective pressure toward stabilization. Following weeks of constrained movement within a descending channel, SOL has managed to reclaim key technical levels. The defense of the $117 zone marked an inflection point, allowing price to recover above declining resistance and re-establish short-term directional control. RSI hovering near 50 suggests balance rather than exhaustion, reducing the immediate risk of downside extension. Beyond charts, Solana’s narrative received a boost from institutional developments. Mangocueticals’ partnership with Cube Group to establish a $100M Solana-focused digital asset treasury positions SOL as a structured balance-sheet reserve rather than a purely speculative asset. This move reinforces Solana’s relevance within corporate treasury frameworks and supports the view that upside toward $139 and potentially $150 remains technically viable. For traders seeking relatively lower volatility exposure, SOL remains a crypto to buy now, though near-term gains may be more incremental than explosive. Mutuum Finance Presale Acceleration Draws Short-Term Capital While Solana represents a more mature opportunity, Mutuum Finance is capturing attention as a new crypto offering sharper short-term asymmetry. The project is currently in Presale Phase 6, which is 99% filled and approaching a full sellout. Mutuum Finance has raised $19,500,000 since presale began, with total MUTM holders now standing at 18550. The current price in phase 6 is $0.035, marking a 250% increase or 3.5x rise from the $0.01 phase one entry. Phase 6 is selling out fast, and the chance to acquire tokens at this level is rapidly closing. Once phase 7 opens, the price will increase nearly 20% to $0.04, making this the final opportunity to enter below that threshold. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06, current buyers are positioning for an estimated 360% gain post-launch. This combination of price momentum and scarcity is why many traders now view MUTM as the best cheap crypto to buy now for short-term rotation strategies. For those yet to participate, the sense of missing out is intensifying as allocations diminish by the day. V1 Protocol Progress Supports Momentum Beyond presale dynamics, Mutuum Finance is reinforcing confidence through tangible protocol development. The team has confirmed that the V1 protocol launch will debut on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This milestone will introduce core infrastructure including a Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and an automated Liquidator Bot. ETH and USDT will serve as the initial assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral operations, establishing a functional DeFi environment from day one. Details of the V1 protocol launch were outlined in an official announcement . This roadmap clarity is critical for short-term traders assessing what crypto to buy today, as it reduces execution uncertainty and provides identifiable catalysts that can sustain momentum beyond the presale window. Security And Accessibility Strengthen The Case Security has also become a central pillar of Mutuum Finance’s positioning. An independent audit is currently underway, with Halborn Security reviewing Mutuum’s lending and borrowing smart contracts. The code is finalized and undergoing formal analysis, signaling a disciplined approach to risk management that appeals to both traders and longer-term participants. In a recent update, Mutuum Finance also expanded accessibility by enabling direct card purchases of MUTM tokens with no purchase limits. This update lowers friction for new entrants and broadens the pool of potential buyers. Choosing Between Stability And Acceleration As Solana consolidates with institutional backing and Mutuum Finance accelerates through its presale, traders are weighing steady technical progress against early-stage momentum. For those asking for the best cheap crypto to buy now for short-term opportunities, the contrast highlights how under $0.05 tokens like MUTM are increasingly competing with established names for attention and capital.

56227413,647874,1766484028,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56227413.jpeg,"Coinbase Announces Acquisition Of The Clearing Company, Marking Its Tenth Purchase In 2025",https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-announces-acquisition-the-clearing-company/,"On Monday, US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) announced its tenth acquisition of the year, revealing plans to acquire The Clearing Company, a prediction market start-up. Coinbase Unveils Ambitious Plans The announcement comes on the heels of Coinbase unveiling its plans to launch a suite of new products aimed at transforming its platform into a comprehensive financial application. This initiative includes integrating stocks, advanced trading tools, and prediction markets into its services. CEO Brian Armstrong envisions Coinbase as a one-stop destination for a variety of trades, from stocks to streamlined futures and perpetual contracts, bolstered by a partnership with Kalshi that emphasizes prediction markets. The mainstream emergence of prediction markets during the 2024 US presidential race with platforms such as Kalshi and Polymarket taking the helm has sparked significant interest and investment across the broader financial sector. This trend is particularly timely as trading platforms are increasingly expanding their product suites to cover multiple asset classes, a necessary adaptation as competition intensifies in the industry. Analysts suggest that this shift could help Coinbase reduce its dependence on cryptocurrency trading, especially as new players enter the market. Prediction markets are expected to enhance engagement on the Coinbase platform, providing a high-frequency product that attracts users beyond traditional crypto transactions. Analysts from Benchmark highlighted this potential, noting that prediction markets could encourage greater user interaction with the app. Following the announcement, JP Morgan analysts remarked that many of the exchange’s new initiatives are designed to encourage customer engagement, an area that has seen limitations in the past. Although the terms of the transaction have not been disclosed, the deal for The Clearing Company — part of what Coinbase calls ‘the Everything Exchange’ — is expected to close in January 2026. Major Platform Overhaul Among its notable acquisitions this year, Coinbase previously agreed to acquire the derivatives exchange Deribit for $2.9 billion in May and later struck a deal for investment platform Echo, valued at approximately $375 million in October. Coinbase’s ambitions in trading do not stop with the acquisition of The Clearing Company. The exchange seeks to introduce its version of outcome trading as part of a broader push toward a unified brokerage service that combines traditional assets, derivatives, and blockchain capabilities. In line with this effort, the cryptocurrency exchange is launching “Coinbase Tokenize,” an institutional-grade infrastructure designed to facilitate the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Beyond retail trading, Coinbase is also broadening its appeal to businesses and developers. The company has announced that Coinbase Business will now be accessible to qualifying customers in the US and Singapore, alongside an expanded API suite that includes services like custody, payments, trading, and stablecoins . Moreover, the firm plans to introduce “custom stablecoins” tailored for companies needing branded solutions. The exchange is also highlighting its x402 payments standard, aimed at streamlining stablecoin transactions associated with web requests. On Monday, the exchange’s stock, which trades under the ticker name COIN, closed the trading session at $247.90.

Why would the asset need a high price at all? His answer focused on institutional behavior. He wrote, “Institutions don’t want millions of units moving markets,” adding, “They want fewer units, less slippage, and predictable liquidity.” That statement cuts directly to how large financial players think. Institutions operate at scale, adhering to strict risk controls. They prioritize execution certainty over short-term price swings. When viewed through that lens, the idea of a permanently cheap settlement asset makes little sense. People ask why XRP would need a high price. Simple answer: institutions don’t want millions of units moving markets. They want fewer units, less slippage, and predictable liquidity. — {x} (@unknowDLT) December 20, 2025 Unit Volume Matters at Scale UnknowDLT’s point centers on mechanics. Low-priced assets require more units to move the same value. More units increase market footprint. That footprint can shift the price during execution. In this case, costs become harder to forecast. Institutions prefer to avoid those conditions. They work with assets that allow them to move large sums with minimal disruption . Fewer units reduce market impact, and predictable liquidity reduces risk. A higher unit price directly supports both goals. This logic applies across financial markets. It becomes even more relevant for a digital asset designed for global payments. XRP’s Design Aligns With This View XRP was built for cross-border settlement. The target users are institutions like banks, payment providers, and liquidity managers. These entities do not operate like traders. They require reliability and efficiency at scale. Ripple CTO David Schwartz has previously made a similar argument about XRP’s long-term role. He has suggested that XRP cannot remain cheap if it is to function efficiently on a global scale. The reasoning follows basic arithmetic. Moving large values with a low-priced token requires excessive volume, and that outcome undermines efficiency. XRP will work better at higher prices because it allows the same value to move with fewer tokens. It simplifies liquidity management across corridors and supports consistent execution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Adoption Changes Price Dynamics When institutions adopt an asset, demand becomes structural. Payment flows do not pause, and liquidity must remain available regardless of the market situation. That reality forces markets to adapt. As usage grows, the price often adjusts upward to support smoother settlement. This move is driven by operational necessity, and assets that fail to meet these requirements lose relevance. As more institutions rely on XRP for settlement, liquidity expectations rise. Execution standards tighten, and under those conditions, a higher valuation becomes functional , not speculative.

Meanwhile, the Japanese yen has staged an impressive rally, fueled by mounting speculation about potential currency intervention from Japanese authorities. For cryptocurrency traders, these traditional market movements create ripple effects that can influence digital asset valuations and trading strategies. Why Is the U.S. Dollar Falling Ahead of Key Economic Data? The U.S. dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, dropped to 105.20, marking its lowest level in three weeks. This decline comes as traders position themselves cautiously before several high-impact economic data releases scheduled for this week. Market participants are particularly focused on: U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data Retail sales figures Federal Reserve meeting minutes Jobless claims reports Analysts suggest that weaker-than-expected inflation numbers could reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve might delay or reduce interest rate hikes, which typically weakens the dollar. The current market sentiment reflects growing uncertainty about the timing and pace of monetary policy normalization. Currency Pair Current Rate Daily Change Weekly Trend USD/JPY 146.85 -1.2% Bearish EUR/USD 1.0805 +0.4% Bullish GBP/USD 1.2650 +0.3% Bullish USD/CHF 0.8950 -0.2% Bearish Japanese Yen Surges: How Real Is the Intervention Threat? The Japanese yen has emerged as this week’s standout performer, appreciating nearly 1% against the U.S. dollar. This dramatic move follows increasingly vocal warnings from Japanese officials about potential currency intervention to support the struggling yen. Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki stated that authorities are watching currency movements with “a high sense of urgency” and are prepared to take “appropriate steps” if necessary. This language has historically preceded actual market interventions by the Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance. Key factors driving yen strength include: Verbal intervention from Japanese officials Technical oversold conditions after prolonged weakness Reduced expectations for aggressive Fed tightening Seasonal repatriation flows by Japanese corporations What Does This Mean for the Global Forex Market? The current forex market dynamics reflect broader macroeconomic uncertainties. The simultaneous dollar weakness and yen strength create interesting opportunities and risks for currency traders and cryptocurrency investors alike. For cryptocurrency markets, traditional currency intervention and dollar movements often correlate with: Increased volatility in Bitcoin and major altcoins Shifts in trading volume between fiat and crypto pairs Changes in institutional allocation strategies Altered risk appetite among retail traders The relationship between traditional currencies and digital assets has become increasingly complex, with many traders now monitoring both markets simultaneously for trading signals. Critical Economic Data That Could Reshape Currency Markets This week’s economic data releases have the potential to significantly alter market expectations and currency valuations. The most important releases include: U.S. Inflation Data (CPI) The Consumer Price Index report will provide crucial insights into whether inflationary pressures are moderating as expected. A lower-than-expected reading could accelerate dollar selling, while higher numbers might support the greenback. Retail Sales Figures Consumer spending data will indicate the health of the U.S. economy and consumer resilience in the face of higher interest rates and economic uncertainty. Federal Reserve Communications Minutes from the latest FOMC meeting and speeches from Fed officials will offer clues about future monetary policy direction. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Navigating the current forex market environment requires careful strategy and risk management. Here are key considerations: For Currency Traders: Monitor USD/JPY for potential intervention signals around the 145-147 range Implement tighter stop-losses ahead of major data releases Consider reduced position sizes during high-volatility periods Watch for divergence between technical indicators and fundamental developments For Cryptocurrency Investors: Observe how Bitcoin reacts to dollar weakness (typically positive correlation) Monitor trading volume in JPY cryptocurrency pairs Consider hedging strategies during major forex market events Watch for increased volatility during U.S. trading hours around data releases FAQs: Understanding the Currency Market Shift What is currency intervention? Currency intervention occurs when a country’s central bank or monetary authority buys or sells its own currency in the foreign exchange market to influence its value. The Bank of Japan has historically intervened to prevent excessive yen weakness or strength. Why does the U.S. dollar weaken before economic data? Traders often reduce dollar positions ahead of major data releases to limit risk. If data suggests slower economic growth or lower inflation, it may reduce expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes, making the dollar less attractive. How does forex market volatility affect cryptocurrencies? Significant movements in major currency pairs can influence cryptocurrency markets through several channels: changing risk appetite, altered capital flows, and shifts in mining economics (for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies). Who makes decisions about Japanese currency intervention? The decision involves coordination between the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan . Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki and BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda are key figures in this process. What economic indicators most impact the U.S. dollar? The most influential indicators include inflation data (CPI, PCE), employment reports (non-farm payrolls), GDP growth figures, and Federal Reserve policy decisions and communications. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertain Waters The current forex market environment presents both challenges and opportunities. The U.S. dollar ‘s decline ahead of critical economic data reflects market uncertainty about the future path of monetary policy. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen ‘s surge demonstrates how quickly sentiment can shift when currency intervention threats become credible. For traders and investors across both traditional and digital asset markets, the key to success lies in careful risk management, continuous monitoring of fundamental developments, and flexible adaptation to changing market conditions. The coming days’ economic releases will likely determine whether current trends accelerate or reverse, making this a crucial period for market participants.

DATs stepped in during the recent market weakness , adding 42,000 BTC, a 4% month-over-month increase, from mid-November to mid-December, it reported. This represents their largest accumulation since July 2025, when they added 128,100 BTC, the analysts continued. DATs Hold Over 1M BTC Digital asset treasuries now hold an aggregate of 1.09 million BTC, worth around $96.6 billion, and representing roughly 5.5% of the total supply. However, many DATs have seen their mNAVs dropping below 1.0x as their purchases came much later in the cycle. Michael Saylor’s Strategy is the outlier, as the majority of Bitcoin purchases in the past 30 days, around 29,400 BTC, were made by the company, which can issue common stock to buy the asset. However, the report predicted that this model may change in the future. “Going forward, we believe many DATs’ strategy will be to move away from common stock issuance and instead finance BTC purchases with proceeds from preference share sales.” Unfortunately, Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) investors were less bullish with holdings dropping to 1.31 million BTC, VanEck noted. Tom Lee’s BitMine has also been aggressively buying the dip, scooping up more Ether every week. The Ethereum DAT has reached a milestone of 4 million ETH this week, valued at $12.3 billion and representing 3.36% of the entire supply. Divergent Hodler Behavior VanEck also observed divergent behavior between long and medium-term holders. There has been significant movement among medium-term token holders, with notable reductions in balances across the 1-2 year, 2-3 year, and 3-5 year cohorts. “Generally, if a token is not moved for a long time, greater than a few years, it indicates whoever holds it is confident in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.” The analysts explained that when older coins are moved, they instantly join the newest cohorts, “and we believe this churn may signal a short/medium-term price peak.” The fact that the very oldest cohorts, over five years, are holding steady suggests the most seasoned holders aren’t too concerned about current market conditions.

Crypto market sentiment analytics firm Santiment posted on X that sentiment around the token has slipped deeply into negative territory, but episodes of pessimism are mostly followed by upward price momentum. “XRP is seeing far more negative social media commentary than average. Historically, this setup leads to price rises. When retail has doubts about a coin’s ability to rise, the rise becomes significantly more likely,” Santiment feed wrote on the social platform early Tuesday. The sentiment comes on the heels of XRP’s 34% drop in the last quarter of 2025, and with Christmas just two days away, the market is almost certain to see little to no price upturns in the near future. Negative commentary on XRP is among the highest in the last two months According to Santiment’s social metrics, the ratio of negative to positive commentary on XRP has surged to its highest point in the last 60 days. When XRP traded near the $2.00 mark in late July, sentiment plunged to almost entirely negative, only for the price to rally in the following sessions to push above $3.00. A similar pattern emerged in mid-September, when another spike in negative chatter preceded a bullish charge that carried XRP toward the $3.40 region before sellers returned. In early November, pessimism dominated social platforms again and took the fourth-largest coin by market cap below $2.25, never to return above it to date. Per one market analyst posting on X, public perception has exaggerated XRP’s moot performance because the token is up by over 200% since September 2024. “There are only a few assets in this space that are still up 400%+ from their 2024 lows,” the analyst wrote. “$XRP is one of the few, but after reading comments, you’d think it was down 60%+,” they reckoned. The analyst said prolonged sideways trading has worn down sentiment, even though XRP has not experienced the type of collapse implied by online commentary. They believe months of consolidation have created an “extremely fearful” outlook, but any eventual breakout could make the rally seen between November 2024 and January 2025 “small by comparison.” Market fear returns as XRP price tests support XRP’s current decline has pushed sentiment back toward levels last seen on November 21. At that time, social metrics showed fear dominating discussion just before the price jumped roughly 22% over the next three days. We are in a case of a community that is very bullish on Ripple’s token, and a market that is bearish on the coin to a similar extent, so much so that even the launch of spot XRP exchange-traded funds did not trigger an immediate rally. Tracking its movements in the last seven days, XRP has returned to a horizontal support zone at the $1.80 mark, a level it held during several previous pullbacks. Some technical indicators, like the Stochastic RSI, a momentum indicator used by chart readers to identify overbought or oversold conditions, is currently sitting at extreme oversold levels. While oversold readings do not guarantee an immediate reversal, they could clear the lane for a price overhaul to the positive side and weaken any efforts by bears to pull down momentum. “Markets don’t turn because things look ‘bullish,’” wrote YouTuber and crypto trader STEPH IS CRYPTO on X, “They turn when there’s little fuel left on one side.” XRP broke down from a multi-day consolidation late Saturday, slipping below $1.93, even as Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market’s performance was mixed. The token spent much of the weekend session trading between $1.90 and $1.95 before bears forced a decisive break through the lower boundary on Monday. The $1.93 area was tested by sellers in several instances, eventually giving in during Monday’s afternoon US trading hours. The most pronounced drop occurred around 13:00 ET yesterday, when XRP slid to approximately $1.89, and trading volumes hit 78% higher than the 24-hour average.

56230814,647103,1766488960,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56230814.jpeg,"Dog-themed memecoins show no signs of slowing down: 39.5% of the market remains in their hands, with Maxi Doge waiting for its opportunity",https://bitcoinist.com/dog-themed-memecoins-39-5-market-share-maxi-doge/,"Thursday, December 18, 2025 – CoinGecko has recently released its State of Meme Coins report for 2025, and one detail stands out: even when Dogecoin (DOGE) is excluded, dog-themed tokens still control a dominant 39.5% of the meme coin sector. Against this backdrop, a new project focused on crowd coordination is positioning itself to rally investors around what it calls a once-in-a-lifetime pump. That project is Maxi Doge (MAXI) . As the next phase of the meme coin cycle appears to move away from irony and lean more toward exaggerated, almost absurd sincerity, Maxi Doge fits neatly into that shift. The project uses simple, instantly recognizable branding built around a bulked-up version of DOGE a 240-lb, Red Bull-fueled caricature designed to be immediately identifiable and easy for traders to rally behind at launch. Time, however, is a key factor. Only 14 hours remain before the current presale price of $0.0002735 increases in the next stage. CoinGecko data points to a new phase for meme coins At present, the meme coin sector has a combined market value of roughly $37 billion. This is just a fraction of its peak in the same period last year, when total valuations briefly surged to around $150 billion. According to CoinGecko’s report, DOGE continues to be the sector’s standout performer, holding a 47.3% market share as of last month. The original meme coin is currently valued at approximately $19 billion, while dog-themed tokens as a whole account for 39.5% of the entire meme coin market. These figures show that the market still has clear favorites, but they also highlight how the drivers of bullish momentum are evolving. CoinGecko’s own timeline of meme coin waves illustrates this change clearly. Earlier cycles were shaped by irony, parody, and inside jokes that rewarded those who were “in on it.” More recent waves including Animal Kingdom tokens, AI memes, and PolitiFi coins have been powered by themes that are louder, more literal, and immediately understandable. In today’s market, nuance has largely been replaced by clarity, and subtle humor has given way to exaggeration. As meme cycles become faster and more fragmented, tokens that fully commit to a clear identity tend to spread more quickly than those that require explanation. This shift from irony toward what can be described as absurd sincerity is becoming one of the defining features of the current meme coin landscape. Maxi Doge was built specifically for this transition, leaning fully into exaggerated clarity and absurd sincerity to position itself as an instantly recognizable rally point in a meme market that now rewards commitment over cleverness. Why Maxi Doge Aligns With the New Meme Coin Phase Maxi Doge doesn’t try to reinterpret meme culture or make commentary on it. Instead, it operates squarely within the meme ecosystem as it exists today. The project commits fully to one oversized, exaggerated concept and builds everything around making that idea instantly visible, easy to remember, and simple for people to rally behind once the token appears on exchanges. Its muscle-bound Shiba Inu mascot isn’t meant to be ironic or playful in a tongue-in-cheek way. It serves as a visual shortcut. At a glance, traders understand what kind of token this is and the type of audience it’s designed to attract. That kind of immediacy matters in a market where attention spans are short and momentum can form fast. This approach goes beyond visuals and carries into distribution as well. By directing a substantial share of presale funds toward marketing, Maxi Doge focuses on presence rather than discovery. Instead of waiting for users to stumble upon it, the project is built to remain visible across crypto social platforms as interest grows. Rather than positioning itself as a commentary on meme culture, Maxi Doge functions as a direct product of it shaped by how stories spread, how crowds form, and how momentum compounds in the current market cycle. Second place is loser talk. $MAXI is the only play in crypto. pic.twitter.com/2S0G5KgGir — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) November 21, 2025 Why Timing Matters as Meme Coins Enter a New Phase Maxi Doge is still in its presale stage, but that opportunity may not last much longer. Those looking to secure MAXI at the lowest available price can do so by visiting the Maxi Doge presale site and connecting their preferred wallet. The project points users toward Best Wallet, a widely used crypto wallet that supports purchases via ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, and even bank cards. Best Wallet is available on both Google Play and the Apple App Store , allowing users to buy, track, and manage their MAXI holdings from a single, streamlined interface. Presale participants also have access to passive rewards. MAXI tokens staked through the project’s native protocol currently offer a dynamic 71% APY .

Also, while Solana (SOL) is struggling to slow down its downturn and turn its fortunes around, market interest is gradually shifting to a new viral DeFi darling that has been billed as hot on its heels to be the next big crypto in the market economy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new presale darling, has quickly become one of the most talked-about projects of its kind and a potential best crypto for early-stage investors. With the presale now entering its 6th round and costing only $0.035, almost entirely sold, MUTM has made it a point that it gives the investor a scarcity-based entry that clearly differs significantly in the rate of recovery, not just in the altcoin market, but particularly in a large market cap, such as that of Solana. With its two-way DeFi operating system, including peer-to-peer, as well as peer-to-contract lending, not to mention the yielding of mtTokens, MUTM gives investors more than just hype—it is shaping up to be the next big crypto with real utility. As the investor continues to select highly-performing blockchains over high-growth options, Mutuum Finance is already emerging as one of the most optimal means available to those seeking the best crypto opportunities in DeFi. Solana Price Prediction There are signs of a bullish market around the long-term support levels. SOL also displays encouraging signs of a stabilization process during the testing of a strong support level that market participants have been observing for close to two years. Following an orderly correction in the late 2025 period, today SOL finds itself in a sideways trend, with lower highs nearing a support level, although the selling momentum has relented substantially. With every bear test of the support level, there is substantial buying momentum observed in SOL, indicating a strong level of demand within this region. There is a strong bullish divergence within the three-day chart of the SOL/USDT, indicating the creation of progressively higher lows as the markets are near strong support levels, a strongly positive indication of the sort seen in the pattern preceding the March significant bottoming out process. That the market is at this critical intersection point, while also noting the new and rapidly emerging crypto initiatives of Mutuum Finance, strongly indicates that the market participants are reviewing strong growth potentials alongside established successful Layer 1 blockchains. Indeed, MUTM is being regarded by many as the next big crypto ready to rival established networks. MUTM Presale Analysis Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming the very best investment choice available within the DeFi market as Phase 6 of its presale stage nears completion. Priced at $0.035 at the moment, this is the last chance for investors who wish to have their hands on this new token before entering Phase 7, where the token price will increase by 20%. Going past 18,560 investor accounts and exceeding a cumulative investment of $19.5 million, it is a massive success for the presale stage, bringing out the utility of MUTM within the realm of DeFi and establishing itself as one of the very best crypto investments for newcomers. Halborn Audit Security is one of the primary focuses of the business model of Mutuum Finance. The smart contracts used for lending and borrowing on the Mutuum Finance platform are currently being audited by Halborn Security, which is one of the most famous auditors of blockchain technology. It is due to rigorous checks on the platform that it has been ensured that every smart contract on the platform is working as required and that every bit of investment made on the platform by users has always been safe. After completion of this process, the launch of Sepolia Testnet will take place. Mutuum Finance is also involved in community engagement and incentive prizes. Members who join early in the token sale presale will be able to share a token prize of $100,000, where ten winners will walk away with $10,000 in MUTM tokens. By incorporating functionality and incentive prizes, MUTM ensures it is a desirable functional token with immense growth potential and a candidate for the best crypto to watch in 2026. Though Solana (SOL) is on the cusp of a possible turnaround, the tides of investment are clearly shifting towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is nearing full subscription in the current Phase, with more than 18,560 investors raising over $19.5 million, leaving a small pool of investment before the price hike to $0.04 in Phase 7. With the facility of multiple lending options and real-time interest rates through mtTokens that will soon be Halborn audited for testnet, MUTM is not only a fascinating DeFi platform but a likely leader among the next big cryptos that will take the investment scene by storm next year.

This request for information is a key first step to ensuring that the Fed is responsive to evolutions in how payments are made,” explained Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller. Fed proposes designated accounts for crypto firms to access master accounts The central bank’s board memo shared with news publications suggested that eligible institutions would be able to open so-called “skinny” accounts for payment services through the Fed master account. Currently, fintech firms and crypto companies rely on intermediary banks that already hold master accounts at Federal Reserve Banks to process transactions. The central bank said the proposed payment accounts would not earn interest or access its credit facilities, and would be capped in size to nerf any risks to the financial system. According to the proposal, the Federal Reserve is considering an overnight balance cap equal to the lesser of $500 million or 10% of an institution’s total assets. The accounts would be restricted to the account holder’s own transactions, which means firms would be barred from issuing correspondent banking services or settling payments on behalf of third parties. Moreover, reserve banks would retain the discretion to impose restrictions and risk controls on a case-by-case basis, alongside other safeguards, including account agreement conditions, formal attestations, and periodic reporting requirements. Economists debate over crypto safeguards and oversight Some policymakers, like Governor Michael Barr, do not support the proposal in its current form. Barr, who is a Democratic appointee who previously served as the Fed’s top regulatory official, opposed the request for information because it “lacks sufficient detail on protections against financial crime.” Some policymakers, like Governor Michael Barr, do not support the proposal in its current form. Barr, a Democratic Fed regulatory official during the Obama administration, opposed the request for information because it “lacks sufficient detail on protections against financial crime.” The former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions warned that the proposal is “not sufficiently specific about safeguards to protect against the accounts being used for money laundering and terrorist financing by institutions the Fed does not supervise.” As reported by Cryptopolitan last week, the Board scrapped a 2023 rule and replaced it with a new framework that gives state member banks more flexibility to deploy innovative tools. The policy had required state member banks to follow activity restrictions similar to those imposed by other federal regulators. After months of consultations and public sentiment, the board concluded that changes in the financial system and its own understanding rendered the rule ineffective, finally signing off on its withdrawal.

56231074,647896,1766489423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56231074.jpeg,Bitcoin Prediction: VanEck Warns 2026 Won’t Be A Melt-Up Or A Crash,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-prediction-vaneck-2026/,"VanEck is setting expectations for Bitcoin in 2026 with a tone that’s closer to the risk committee than crypto Twitter: the next year looks more like consolidation than a dramatic regime shift. In its Dec. 18 note , “Plan for 2026: Predictions from Our Portfolio Managers,” Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital assets research, argues that the signal set heading into 2026 is “mixed but constructive.” The framework is deliberately restrained: volatility has come down, leverage has been washed out in stages, and on-chain activity is still soft but not deteriorating the way it tends to during deeper cyclical breaks. “Realized volatility has… dropped by roughly half. That implies a proportional drawdown of about 40%. The market has already absorbed roughly 35%.” Sigel anchors part of the call in cycle structure. He writes that Bitcoin’s historical four-year rhythm, which has tended to peak in the immediate post-election window, “remains intact following the early October 2025 high.” If that template is still operative, 2026 is less likely to be a clean continuation year. Bitcoin Prediction For 2026: What To Expect “That pattern suggests 2026 is more likely a consolidation year. Not a melt-up. Not a collapse.” The more interesting part is the “why,” because VanEck isn’t leaning on a single factor. Sigel describes three lenses shaping the outlook, and they are not uniformly supportive. “ Global liquidity is mixed. Likely rate cuts provide support. US liquidity is tightening somewhat.” He ties that tightening to a specific macro dynamic: “AI-driven capex fears” colliding with a more fragile funding market and pushing credit spreads wider. Put differently, even if policy rates drift lower, the broader cost-of-capital environment can still work against risk-taking at the margin — especially where refinancing needs are persistent and investor selectivity is rising. Against that backdrop, the portfolio guidance is measured. VanEck favors a “disciplined 1 to 3% Bitcoin allocation,” built through dollar-cost averaging, with adds during leverage-driven dislocations and trims into speculative excess. It’s positioning for a market that oscillates, not one that trends cleanly. Sigel also flags a topic that has shifted from niche to mainstream inside the Bitcoin community: quantum security . VanEck doesn’t present it as an imminent risk to the chain, but it does treat it as an organizing question that could draw serious attention. “Quantum security has become an active topic. It’s not an immediate threat . A coordinated response could resemble the first blocksize debates.” That last line matters more than it sounds. The blocksize era wasn’t only a technical dispute; it was a public process that pulled in new stakeholders, forced trade-offs into the open, and hardened long-term norms. VanEck’s suggestion is that, if quantum planning becomes a sustained coordination exercise, it could have a similar “transparent and technically rich” dynamic, messy, visible, and ultimately strengthening engagement. Where VanEck is most constructive for 2026 is not necessarily spot BTC, but the capital cycle around Bitcoin mining. Sigel argues the strongest opportunity sits in what he calls the “capital-intensive pivot” as operators try to finance both hash-rate expansion and AI/HPC infrastructure simultaneously. That combination is stretching balance sheets and widening dispersion across the sector: miners with hyperscaler partnerships can raise straight debt on comparatively favorable terms, while weaker names are pushed toward dilutive converts or selling BTC into weakness. “This creates the cleanest consolidation setup since 2020 to 2021. The best risk-reward is in miners transitioning into energy-backed compute platforms. Credible HPC economics, advantaged power, and financing paths that avoid serial dilution.” A second opportunity set is digital payments and stablecoin settlement, but VanEck is selective. Sigel sees stablecoins moving into real B2B payment flows, improving working capital management and lowering cross-border settlement costs. “The more investable angle may sit in fintech and e-commerce platforms that can unlock margin leverage by shifting supplier payments, payouts, and cross-border settlement onto stablecoins. High-throughput chains will support much of this activity, and a few tokens tied to genuine usage may benefit, but we believe the most durable opportunity may lie in the operating companies enabling adoption rather than in broad token exposure,” Sigel writes. The overall message is not bearish, and it is not euphoric. It is, in a very deliberate way, a call for discipline: expect range-bound conditions, look for dislocations, and focus on parts of the ecosystem where balance-sheet stress and real-world adoption can create asymmetry.

See What Whales Are Doing In Korea,https://timestabloid.com/is-this-where-xrp-bounce-begins-see-what-whales-are-doing-in-korea/,"X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) recently drew attention to a notable development involving South Korea’s largest exchange. In a post on X, the crypto commentator suggested a surge in activity on Upbit, where XRP recorded $1.55 billion trading volume within 7 days. That figure exceeded volumes seen on Binance and Coinbase during the same period. He believes this massive surge in activity signals urgency from buyers, describing the activity as “panic buys” and emphasizing that “volume doesn’t lie.” JUST IN $XRP is seeing panic buys on South Korea’s Upbit. $1.55B in 7-day volume, surpassing Binance and Coinbase When Korean volume leads, big price moves follow. Volume doesn’t lie. Liquidity is choosing its side. Is this where the $XRP bounce begins? pic.twitter.com/V0VealSEkA — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 21, 2025 Upbit’s Surge Signals Demand Concentration The attached chart shows XRP trading volume by exchange over the last 7 days. Upbit sits at the top. Binance follows with $1.33 billion, while Coinbase trails at $1.07 billion. South Korean retail and institutional traders have historically played a significant role in XRP’s momentum phases, as the asset is popular in Asian markets . Traders’ behaviour often shows strong conviction rather than short-term speculation. X Finance Bull reinforced this point by stating that when Korean volume leads , large price moves tend to follow. The chart confirms that liquidity has shifted toward one market with clear intensity. Confidence Builds Through Usage The volume imbalance also highlights XRP’s relative strength. Few large-cap digital assets show this level of exchange-specific dominance without a corresponding news catalyst. XRP has consistently surpassed Bitcoin and other top assets in trading volume on Upbit. This suggests XRP is the preferred digital asset in South Korea. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 X Finance Bull also sees the surge as a confidence signal. Liquidity chooses assets that participants trust. High volume reflects repeat engagement, not isolated trades. Each transaction reinforces network relevance. As more users transact, infrastructure providers and institutions follow. Is Something Big Coming for XRP? XRP saw a similar panic buying spree in early December, and the Koreans have not slowed down. Rising confidence enables rising prices over time. Assets with deep liquidity attract larger orders and institutions. They avoid markets that slip under pressure, and XRP’s recent performance suggests resilience and alignment with demand. X Finance Bull closed his message by asking whether this marks the start of an XRP bounce. The question remains open. What is clear is XRP’s dominance in the South Korean market. The volume has confirmed interest and adoption, and buyers could be accumulating the token in anticipation of a big move.

This unexpected trend has traders and investors buzzing. What’s driving this momentum, and could it signal a broader shift in the market? Discover the factors behind Dogecoin’s resilience and see which other coins might be primed for growth. Dogecoin Rides Predictable Waves, Eyes on Future Gains Source: tradingview Dogecoin is trading between twelve and fourteen cents. It's taken a small dip of nearly six percent over the past month. But, its value still shows resilience in a volatile market. The current trends hint at a potential rise to around fourteen cents, where the next resistance lies. If enthusiasm grows, it could even aim for about seventeen cents later on, marking a steady growth of over twenty percent from current levels. However, it's also important to note that if it drops, support around eleven cents could steady the ship. The market watches as Dogecoin balances on a knife-edge, hoping for a favorable turn. Conclusion The climb in DOGE derivatives indicates strong interest in the coin despite a weak overall market. Investors seem confident in DOGE's potential, showing significant trading activity. This surge contrasts with the performance of many other cryptocurrencies. The trend suggests that DOGE continues to capture attention and activity. Future movement in its price and derivatives will be closely watched to see if this interest sustains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While the current solutions play a vital role, they still have significant shortcomings that call for solutions like Canopy, which, according to its Co-Founder and CEO, Adam Liposky, is projected to have high adoption for lowering the entry barrier of blockchain networks. In this interview, we speak with Adam about his background as he explains Canopy , whose mainnet is scheduled for release early in 2026. Background Adam spent years as a venture capitalist, a “perfect” career path at the time, until Ethereum showed up in his inbox. He then found himself working on multiple cryptocurrency decks, and that’s how he got into the crypto space. “Within months, I was spending more time researching crypto than B2B SaaS. I realized I did not want to invest in this space. I wanted to build it in. So I left the fund and started building on Ethereum.” That was about the same time he met and joined the Pocket Network team, which was building a protocol to organize and coordinate the world’s data, a scope that was too large for Ethereum. After his time at Pocket Network, he met with Andrew Nguyen, and together, they co-founded Canopy. “Projects with real requirements were being forced into an impossible choice: compromise your vision or launch a chain from scratch. Both paths had brutal tradeoffs. We began considering what infrastructure would be necessary to eliminate that choice. That is what became Canopy.” We then asked him for his opinion on the biggest challenges facing decentralized platforms today. For Adam, it was value capture, whereby the crypto protocols are so focused on protecting existing investments that they lose sight of their long-term value. While developments like smart contracts and layer two chains were initially trivial, they still left projects competing for resources, with their tokens ultimately ending up with no real utility. “L2 tokens became governance-only assets, with no real staking requirement and no fee accrual to holders. The market has figured this out. ARB is down 70%, OP is down 65%, and STRK is down 85%. These tokens are being repriced because they lack backing beyond speculation.” Canopy’s unique solution Canopy eliminated the tradeoffs of existing solutions. Smart contracts deny you sovereignty, as you must align with the base layer rules, economics, and infrastructure. The other solution is building a layer, which, according to Adam, is an “18-month engineering effort that requires recruiting validators, building infrastructure, and solving security from scratch.” Adam identified several benefits of using Canopy: Full sovereignty over their chain. Real token utility beyond governance. Direct value capture without sharing fees with a base layer. Deployment in hours, not months. Security through Canopy’s validator network Native interoperability without bridges or wrapped assets. VM-agnostic meaning builders can code in any language. “They are true L1s, secured by our validator set through what we call economic cross-pollination. Validators earn rewards in the native tokens of the chains they secure, aligning their incentives with the success of each project.” Canopy makes it easy for teams to build Layer 1 networks, a preserve for teams with substantial resources and deep technical expertise. Canopy nested chains Vs layered networks According to Adam, it all boiled down to value capture and sovereignty. “L2s solve the security bootstrapping problem, but they do so by making your chain economically subordinate to the base layer. The L1 captures your transaction fees. Your token is relegated to governance, which means it has no real economic utility.” He continued to explain that it was like building a business where your revenue flowed into someone else’s treasury. The base layer, which risks censorship from centralized sequencers, also controls your technical constraints, fee structures, and roadmap. Canopy’s nested chains offered value capture and sovereignty. In addition to governance, all fees are paid in your native token, and you control your own fee structure and economic model. With Canopy, projects can adjust their security relationships, modify validator requirements, or transition to full independence at any time, with complete history and community. “This is why we call it layerless rather than Layer 0 or Layer 2. Nested chains can be composed like layers when shared security is beneficial, but they operate like independent L1s with dynamic relationships and full economic sovereignty.” Canopy’s NestBFT consensus Vs proof of stake consensus Adam clarified that NestBFT was a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, but with added innovations. “An attacker (in standard PoS) can acquire old validator keys and rewrite history from a previous state, as there is no external cost associated with creating alternative forks. Most PoS chains address this through social consensus or weak subjectivity, which introduces additional trust assumptions.” Canopy uses Proof-of-Age, a mechanism that utilizes Verifiable Delay Functions, which serve as a cryptographic proof of elapsed time. The functions make it prohibitively expensive for a validator to perform a long-range attack by recreating L1 blocks. “It adds a time-based cost on top of the stake-based cost.” The system also utilizes VRF cryptography to ensure fair and unpredictable leader election, thereby preventing manipulation and reducing the risk of DDoS attacks. One-click L1 deployment with Canopy Canopy has abstracted the complexity of building an L1 chain. The builders focus on logic and parameters that make their chain valuable. Canopy handles the rest, including consensus, validator coordination, security bootstrapping, and network infrastructure. This setup enables developers to allocate resources where they truly matter, rather than tying up finances in redundant infrastructure. Canopy is also working on helping projects deploy into the market. “Most chains launch into a vacuum: no liquidity, no users, no clear path to bootstrap a community. You have built the technology, but you are stuck with the cold-start problem. We are addressing this with infrastructure that turns deployment into launch day.” Easy blockchain launches often lead to fragmentation rather than resilience. We asked Adam how Canopy prevented fragmentation. Adam shared three ways Canopy addressed concerns about cohesion and liquidity fragmentation. Native interoperability, where all chains in the ecosystem communicate without the need for bridges. Assets and messages move seamlessly. CNPY at the settlement layer served as the native currency pair for all swaps, concentrating liquidity rather than fragmenting it. Shared security. Validators stake CNPY and earn rewards from every chain they secure, creating a unified economic layer beneath the entire ecosystem. “More chains actually strengthen the network, because each one adds demand for CNPY security and liquidity.” Key features and testnet performance Adam identified four key features: VM-agnostic architecture, which allows you to build in any language, opening blockchain development to the broader software engineering talent pool, not just crypto-native developers. Security is immediate the moment you tap into Canopy’s validator network. Builders can adjust their security models as they grow, or even opt for complete independence. Native interoperability. Chains in the Canopy ecosystem are composed without bridges: no wrapped tokens, no additional trust assumptions on relayers, and no liquidity fragmentation. Assets and messages move seamlessly between chains because they share a common security and communication layer. This is critical because bridges are the attack surface that has cost the industry billions of dollars. Validator-based oracles built directly into the protocol. Validators provide oracle services as part of their role, which means you get price feeds, randomness, and external data without introducing new dependencies. Built-in distribution infrastructure to help projects launch to a ready audience. “The entire stack is designed for 10 times faster development.” We then asked him about feedback from the testnet and performance metrics that they expect on the mainnet. Their Alphanet launched in April, and Betanet went live in September without a flaw. Throughout the period, they successfully executed network upgrades, consensus changes, and protocol improvements without incident. “We also have four projects in our incubator program actively building on the stack. The feedback has been overwhelmingly focused on developer experience, which is exactly what we want to hear and exactly what we are optimizing for.” On performance, he stated that they are seeing numbers comparable to those of Solana. They have consistently achieved 10,000 transactions per second with instant finality, which is critical for applications that require real-time responsiveness, such as gaming, trading, or payments. They target numbers higher than that. Early traction and partnerships Canopy is projecting high adoption, primarily because they have lowered the entry barrier in terms of both technical, operational, and financial aspects. “Four projects are currently being developed in our incubator program, and we have received dozens of high-quality sign-ups for our builder waitlist.” Canopy has 20 top-tier validators, providing the foundation that allows new chains to inherit security from day one, rather than spending months trying to bootstrap their own validator set. A recent campaign garnered over 100,000 new X ( formerly Twitter ) followers, more than 40,000 new Discord members, and over 100,000 connected wallets. On the advisory side, Canopy is working with CodeCraft on marketing and Distractive on ecosystem development. Canopy native coin CNPY and mainnet launch Adam explained that CNPY was the native token of the Canopy ecosystem with four core functions: Staking. CNPY staking with Canopy validators helps secure the network and its nested chains. Rewards. Native rewards from every project you help secure through your validator, in addition to CNPY block rewards. Settlement currency. When chains launch, and users want to participate, CNPY becomes the base currency for those transactions. Launching and trading fees. Every time a chain deploys or tokens are traded, fees are denominated in CNPY. These fees flow back into the ecosystem, creating another value capture mechanism tied directly to network activity. “Owning it (CNPY) means owning a share of every sovereign chain that launches on Canopy. As the ecosystem grows, the CNPY utility compound increases.” CNPY has a total supply of 504 million CNPY. Block rewards are split 85% to validators, 10% to delegators, and 5% to the DAO—the DAO allocation funds protocol development, ecosystem grants, and governance initiatives. Halvings will occur approximately every two years to create predictable supply dynamics and align with the planned growth phases. Mainnet will launch early 2026. “Day 1 of mainnet should feel like day 100, not day 1. The goal is to go live with momentum, not to figure things out in production.” We then enquired about airdrops for early participants when they go live. Adam shared that they are working on the details; however, their philosophy is to incentivize people with actual contributions, not speculators. These will entail validators, developers, and early community members. “The Betanet wallet connection campaign with 100K wallets so far is one way we’re tracking early participation. I’d encourage anyone interested to get involved now rather than waiting for specific airdrop announcements.” For those interested, how do they become part of the community? Developers can refer to the Canopy GitHub repository and documentation. “We’ll soon provide details for end-to-end implementation. We’re actively working with teams building on the Canopy Stack and can provide hands-on support.” Validators or those interested in staking can reach out about joining the Canopy validator set. For everyone else, Discord is the main venue. “That’s where you’ll get the earliest updates, can talk directly with the team, and connect with other builders. X is good too, and you can join our X community for announcements and ecosystem news.”",Exclusive Interviews with Crypto Founders & Influencers|Canopy,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-23 11:51:58

In this context, the token is flashing a contrarian signal that has historically preceded strong upside moves, as market sentiment on social media turns decisively negative while price action stabilizes. Data tracking social media commentary shows that negative sentiment is dominating discussions around the token, a condition that has repeatedly coincided with local market bottoms rather than sustained declines, according to insights shared by Santiment on December 23. XRP social sentiment. Source: Santiment Sentiment has slipped back into the fear zone, where retail pessimism has historically coincided with price rebounds, while prior spikes in greed have tended to precede corrections rather than sustained rallies. This outlook suggests accumulation rather than distribution. XRP price consolidation After a prolonged pullback, XRP has consolidated above recent lows as volatility tightens, with price hovering near historical sentiment extremes that have previously marked upside launch points. Similar sentiment troughs in the past were followed by recovery phases as bearish expectations faded, allowing modest demand to trigger sharp rebounds. Focus is now on whether a rebound can carry XRP toward the psychological $3 level. While not guaranteed, past recoveries from comparable sentiment lows have produced multi-week advances, and a break above recent consolidation highs would strengthen the case for a broader trend reversal. However, XRP will also need support from the broader cryptocurrency market to first reclaim the $2 level. In recent sessions, the token’s price action has largely been dictated by overall market sentiment. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $1.90, down about 1.5% over the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeframe, the asset is lower by roughly 0.5%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Technically, XRP remains under pressure, trading below both its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.15 and its 200-day simple moving average at $2.54, signaling sustained downside bias and a potential longer-term downtrend. The 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 41.30, a neutral reading that points to neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This leaves room for short-term stabilization, but limited bullish momentum persists amid elevated volatility of 5.29% and continued extreme fear in overall market sentiment.

This sudden surge creates a buzz, overshadowing the stagnation seen in many other digital currencies. Enthusiasts and investors alike are keen to uncover which other tokens may be poised for similar growth. Uniswap Eyes Resistance Amid Price Struggles Source: tradingview Uniswap's price is currently stuck between $5.14 and $6.80. Despite a recent 15% rise this week, it’s down about 5% over one month and 16% over six months. Investors look to break above $7.48, the next challenge level. If the coin passes this hurdle, it might reach $9.13, implying a significant uptick. However, should things turn sour, the downside could see $4.17 or even fall to $2.52. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages, standing almost equal, hint at a stable short-term trend, while tools like RSI and MACD point to a possible continuation of the current struggle. Uniswap's path ahead seems cautiously optimistic, but its moves need watching. Conclusion UNI has experienced a sharp rise due to a recent governance vote. While UNI's performance stands out, the rest of the market remains largely inactive. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and ADA show minimal movement. This divergence highlights UNI's unique factors driving its growth compared to the broader market's stagnation. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a blog post last week, Yala announced it’s evolving its platform with the launch of its first AI agent, known as Yala 2.0, to try and help participants spot “fair value” opportunities in prediction markets. The goal is to improve predictive accuracy and bring more structured and robust pricing systems guided by intelligent probabilistic tools to prediction markets. Yala explained that prediction markets have attracted a huge audience in the wake of their impressive accuracy during the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. One year ago, most pollsters and bookmakers thought that the election would be a pretty close-run thing, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris locked in a statistical dead heat. But those forecasts could barely have been more inaccurate, for Trump ended up crushing his Democratic rival. The outcome of the election was in-line with the odds given by leading prediction markets Polymarket and Kalsi, which strongly favored Trump throughout the last few months of the campaign. Analysts hailed the result as evidence that the “collective intelligence” of the crowd is more accurate than traditional prediction systems. What are prediction markets? Prediction markets work by pricing uncertainty through orderbook matching, with the prices of an outcome representing probabilities, and they have proven to be extremely efficient at surfacing collective intelligence. Their accuracy even impressed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which approved Kalshi as a Designated Contract Market – giving it the same status of a regulated futures and options contract market. Despite this stamp of approval, Yala believes prediction markets are still somewhat immature because they lack the traditional fair-value models found in traditional options and derivatives, such as the Black-Scholes method for pricing and risk management. Because of this, participants are primarily guided by speculation rather than statistically favorable odds, with a great deal of uncertainty around what truly constitutes “fair value”. Yala believes fair value is key to establishing prediction markets as serious financial products and so it has taken it upon itself to provide this, but doing so isn’t easy. Calculating probabilities involves weighing up hundreds of interconnected variables, making it all but impossible for humans. The Yala 2.0 agent tackles this complexity by crunching hundreds of dynamic, evolving signals to try and generate a more precise and accurate probability of an event outcome. Once the probability has been established, bettors can then determine a fair price for a “yes” or “no” outcome. Should the agent determine that the fair value of an outcome is higher than the current market price, that would indicate bettors are statistically more likely to profit by buying “yes”, but if it’s lower, then they would be better off going with “no”. Will the price of BTC be equal or higher than $88K by December 23?🟢 Yala AI Fair Value: 91% YES🔵 Polymarket: 77% YESConsidering strike proximity, short time-to-expiry, and recent realized range/vol:→ Market is underpricing YES pic.twitter.com/XwsEZzwmLs — Yala (@yalaorg) December 22, 2025 It’s similar in some ways to what sports bettors do. When betting on soccer games, professional gamblers always look for “value” in the odds, rather than simply choosing who they think will win the game. If they estimate a team’s chances of winning a game is one-in-ten but the bookie is offering offs of 15/1, they take the bet every time because it offers value. After all, soccer is unpredictable and surprises happen frequently. Evolving intelligence Yala 2.0’s roadmap describes how the agent will build up its intelligence step-by-step. The initial phase is focused on closed, internal testing and rapid iteration, and will initially use a model that’s based on historical data, news analysis, smart-money tagging and social media sentiments. The initial focus will be on digital asset prices and sports outcomes, with Yala refining the model over time, based on the accuracy of its predictions. Its early probability estimates will be shared via X, as part of its transparent approach to calibrating the underlying model. The second stage will see the public launch of Yala 2.0 and its adoption of a modular architecture. During this period, Yala 2.0’s performance will be publicly verified and continuously measured in live markets with a controlled risk limit. Users will be invited to interact with the agent by entering basic prompts, such as the market type, target conduction and time horizon to generate a probability estimate. At this stage, Yala 2.0’s architecture will evolve to a multi-agent design that’s coordinated by a central orchestrator agent, with separate modules for date ingestion and processing, predictions and safety and governance. Finally, stage three will mark full maturity, where the agent expands to become a comprehensive “swarm framework” made up of a supervisor agent that governs a suite of specialist worker agents to determine probabilities across every domain. It’s at this stage that Yala 2.0 will go beyond risk-neutral pricing to generate more subjective fair-value estimates, incorporating additional micro-factors into its calculations. Yala 2.0 will enhance the utility of Yala’s native $YALA cryptocurrency, which is destined to become the agent’s governance token and a “value-alignment asset”. Holders will be able to stake $YALA to participate in votes and token reward distributions tied to the agent’s expansion. Meanwhile, $YALA’s tokenomics structure will evolve, with platform revenue from performance and usage fees allocated to token buybacks. Ultimately, Yala wants to become the “fair-value operating system” for markets like Polymarket and Kalshi and foster deeper liquidity and more accurate pricing across the fast-growing prediction economy.

Selling assets to access cash often means exiting positions at the wrong time. For long-term holders and active investors, this creates a recurring problem: how to unlock liquidity in crypto without reducing exposure. Several mechanisms now allow crypto holders to access capital while keeping their assets intact. Each comes with different trade-offs in cost, flexibility, and risk. Why Selling Crypto Is Often Inefficient Selling crypto converts volatility into a realized outcome. Once sold: Market exposure is lost Re-entry may be more expensive Taxable events may be triggered For users who expect to hold assets long term or need temporary liquidity, selling is often the least efficient option. Borrowing Against Crypto The most common alternative is crypto-backed borrowing. Assets are used as collateral rather than sold, allowing users to unlock liquidity while retaining ownership. There are two main structures: crypto loans and crypto credit lines . A crypto loan provides a fixed amount upfront. You deposit collateral, receive funds, and pay interest on the full amount from the start. This approach works when: The required amount is known in advance Liquidity is needed immediately Repayment timing is predictable The downside is cost efficiency. Interest accrues even on funds that remain unused. A crypto credit line offers a different structure. Instead of a lump sum, you receive a credit limit. Funds can be withdrawn when needed, repaid at any time, and reused later. Interest applies only to the amount actually borrowed. Unused credit remains available without cost. This model is better suited for: Ongoing or uncertain liquidity needs Users who want interest efficiency Volatile market conditions Example: Standby Credit Lines on Clapp Clapp offers a standby crypto credit line that reflects the revolving model. Users deposit crypto as collateral and receive a credit limit. Withdrawals are optional and on demand. Interest applies only to used funds, while unused credit carries a 0% APR. Clapp also supports multi-collateral portfolios, allowing users to combine up to 19 assets in one collateral pool. This improves capital efficiency for diversified holders. There are no fees on crypto or fiat deposits, and no fixed repayment schedule. Liquidity is accessible 24/7 through the Clapp Wallet . Stablecoin Liquidity Without Selling Volatile Assets Most crypto credit facilities issue funds in stable assets such as USDT or USDC. This allows users to: Cover expenses Allocate capital elsewhere Manage cash flow All while keeping exposure to BTC, ETH, or other long-term holdings. Risks to Consider Accessing liquidity without selling does not eliminate risk. Key considerations include: Price volatility and liquidation thresholds Loan-to-value management Platform custody and counterparty risk Maintaining conservative LTV ratios and monitoring collateral health is essential. Summary Accessing crypto liquidity without selling assets is possible through borrowing rather than liquidation. Crypto loans offer simplicity but lower efficiency. Crypto credit lines offer flexibility and cost control. Platforms like Clapp show how a standby credit line can function as a liquidity buffer rather than a rigid loan. The right choice depends on how often capital is needed, how much is used, and how much flexibility matters. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The upward trend is largely due to growing investments in the sector following its recognition as a legitimate business, industry sources say. Others claim illegal mining is contributing, too. Russia counts its cryptocurrency farms using AI tech Farms minting digital currencies like Bitcoin have increased by 44% this year despite a ban that’s now covering a dozen Russian regions, affected by energy shortages blamed on the mining boom. Their total number has reached 196,900, according to a report produced by a new system designed to identify such facilities, even when they are not officially reported to the state. The EnergyTool platform has been developed by the Russian telecom company MTS. It discovers crypto mining installations by monitoring electricity consumption. It’s doing that by analyzing information collected from automated metering systems in real time, using AI to register anomalies in power usage, thus detecting unauthorized connections to the grid, tampering of measuring instruments and unusual loads. The solution, which relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, has been in operation for a few years now. In January, MTS announced it had obtained a patent for it. According to the latest data from the tool, quoted by the business news editions RBC and Kommersant, crypto farms have been mushrooming across Russia in 2025. For comparison, they numbered 136,600 at the end of 2024, which was just a 7% increase year-on-year. Irkutsk keeps Russia’s mining capital title amid restrictions According to the MTS analysis, three Russian regions are leading the chart by newly discovered crypto farms – the Siberian oblasts of Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, and the Southern Republic of Bashkortostan (Bashkiria). Irkutsk, often dubbed the mining capital of Russia, has been a magnet for cryptocurrency miners due to its relatively low electricity rates. The high concentration of both legal and illegal coin minting operations there led to a permanent mining ban in the south of the region. More than 10 Russian regions have already prohibited the activity until 2031. Meanwhile, the Republic of Khakassia has taken the lead from Irkutsk as the most profitable place for mining, followed by the Tyumen and Murmansk regions. The smallest number of recently found mining facilities was registered in Volgograd, Ivanovo, and Sverdlovsk regions, the Chuvash Republic (Chuvashia), the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, the Altai Krai, as well as in the territories forming the Central Black Earth Region. Fresh investment driving growth in Russia’s mining industry The findings in the MTS study suggest that the legalization of cryptocurrency mining, which became Russia’s first regulated crypto industry, is largely responsible for the rapid expansion of the business, thanks to the inflow of investment money. Sergey Bezdelov, head of Russia’s Industrial Mining Association, agrees that the spike is a direct consequence of the sector’s recognition as an investment vehicle. He elaborated: “Since the state regulation of mining in August 2024, institutional investors have finally shifted toward the industry, which results in these figures.” While Bezdelov partially attributed the increase to mining operations getting out of the shadow economy, he also noted it’s hard to count those that remain under the radar. To mine legally in Russia, companies and individual entrepreneurs are required to only register with the Federal Tax Service (FNS) and pay taxes. However, the percentage of actual registrations remains pretty low, hovering around 30%, revealed an estimate recently quoted by Russian officials. Proposed solutions to the issue include a plan to criminalize illegal mining and a suggestion to offer amnesty for enterprises operating in the “gray” zone. Russian authorities have been cracking down on criminal activities in the space, employing increasingly sophisticated means , tracking electricity consumption via smart meters and internet traffic with the help of telecom companies. At the same time, the growing importance of the crypto mining industry for the sanctioned Russian economy has been acknowledged by both the Bank of Russia and the Kremlin , as reported by Cryptopolitan. For now, it remains unclear whether the legal or the illegal segment of the market contributes more to its rising importance. Anton Gontarev, commercial director of Intelion Data Systems, a major player in the industry, agreed with Bezdelov that the upward trend is due to the influx of serious capital into the now-regulated space. On the other hand, a representative of the Russian energy company EN+ tied the increasing number of crypto farms mostly to the growth of illegal mining.

The signals often appear fragmented at first, buried beneath skepticism, politics, and disbelief. In crypto, those moments are easy to ignore until history redefines them as inevitable. A recent XRP-focused video circulating widely online has struck exactly that nerve, prompting strong reactions from long-term market observers. In a post shared on X, John Squire drew attention to a video commentary that captures years of conviction surrounding XRP and its place in the global financial landscape. The video focuses on broader themes such as liquidity, regulatory influence, and technological progress, rather than short-term price fluctuations. From there, it expands into why some believe XRP’s true significance is still widely misunderstood. A Perspective Forged Over Time The speaker bases his argument on longevity, emphasizing that many newer participants don’t have a grasp of the historical context. Having followed crypto markets since 2013, he positions his conviction as the product of observation rather than speculation. If this $XRP video doesn’t give you chills, then you have absolutely no idea what it truly represents. pic.twitter.com/jWdep8Htbr — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 23, 2025 Understanding XRP requires looking beyond short-term market cycles and focusing on the robust infrastructure being developed beneath the surface. This perspective challenges the trader’s mindset. XRP is portrayed not as a typical speculative asset, but as one designed to absorb liquidity over time. The speaker likens it to a slowly rising bathtub, where utility steadily fills the system until the selling pressure naturally dries up. Liquidity as the Real Story At the heart of the video is a liquidity thesis. The argument suggests that when global financial systems finally integrate blockchain-based settlement, value will begin flowing through assets built for utility. In that environment, speculation becomes secondary to function. XRP’s design as a bridge asset is central to this view. Instead of competing with national currencies, it aims to connect them efficiently. As adoption increases, proponents argue that price appreciation becomes a byproduct of usage rather than speculative hype. Regulation, Power, and Resistance to Change The commentary also dives into regulatory friction. It alleges that entrenched interests seek to preserve existing financial power structures through influence and coordination. These claims reflect widespread frustration in crypto communities about regulatory bias and uneven enforcement. While such assertions remain debated, they reflect a widespread belief that transformative technologies often face resistance from legacy systems. For XRP supporters, the legal battles were never just about compliance, but about control over future financial infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Internet of Value Vision The video reinforces Ripple’s long-standing vision of an “internet of value.” Today, transferring money across platforms and borders is still expensive and inefficient. Funds cannot flow freely between payment networks, and international transfers are slow and expensive. Blockchain technology aims to remove that friction. XRP, according to its advocates, plays a foundational role in enabling seamless value transfer across networks, currencies, and jurisdictions, much like data moves freely across the internet. Politics, Policy, and a Shifting Climate The discussion also touches on political change. Crypto markets are closely watching the U.S. for policy direction. His administration has signaled a more favorable stance toward digital assets, fueling expectations for clearer regulation. For XRP, regulatory clarity has already improved following the conclusion of its legal battle with the SEC. That resolution removed a major overhang and strengthened arguments that adoption can proceed without structural restraint. Why the Video Resonates The power of the video lies in conviction, not theatrics. It presents XRP as a long-term transformation rather than a short-term opportunity. The message resonates, regardless of agreement, because it reflects a belief that has been shaped and strengthened over time. For those paying attention, the video is less about chills and more about recognition. XRP’s story, according to its advocates, is still unfolding. And if their thesis holds, its true impact may only now be coming into view. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The two most common structures are crypto-backed loans and crypto credit lines. While both use digital assets as collateral, they differ in how capital is accessed, how interest is charged, and how flexible the borrowing experience is. Understanding these differences helps avoid unnecessary costs and choose the right tool for specific liquidity needs. What Is a Crypto Loan? A crypto loan follows a traditional lending structure. You deposit crypto as collateral and receive a fixed loan amount upfront. Interest begins accruing immediately on the full amount, regardless of whether all funds are used. Most crypto-backed loans include a defined term and repayment expectations. This model works best when the borrower knows the exact amount needed and plans to repay on a predictable schedule. Key characteristics Lump-sum disbursement Interest on the full balance from day one Fixed or semi-fixed loan term Limited flexibility after issuance What Is a Crypto Credit Line? A crypto credit line works differently. Instead of a lump sum, the borrower receives a credit limit based on the value of their collateral. Funds can be withdrawn on demand, repaid at any time, and reused later. Interest applies only to the amount actually borrowed. Unused credit remains available at no cost. This structure prioritizes efficiency and control, especially when liquidity needs change over time. Key characteristics On-demand withdrawals Interest only on used funds Revolving access to capital Flexible repayment Crypto Loans vs Credit Lines Feature Crypto Loan Crypto Credit Line Access to funds One-time On demand Interest basis Full loan amount Used amount only Repayment Scheduled Flexible Reusability No Yes Capital efficiency Lower Higher Which Model is Most Cost Efficient The difference between the two models becomes clear in partial-use scenarios. If a borrower receives $10,000 but uses only $2,000: A crypto loan accrues interest on $10,000 A credit line accrues interest on $2,000 Over time, paying interest on unused capital can materially increase borrowing costs. Clapp Credit Line Offers 0% APR On Unused Funds Clapp operates a standby crypto credit line model designed around flexibility and cost control. Users deposit crypto as collateral and receive a revolving credit limit. Interest applies only to withdrawn funds, while unused credit carries a 0% APR. Clapp also supports multi-collateral borrowing, allowing users to combine up to 19 different cryptocurrencies in one collateral pool. This can improve capital efficiency for diversified portfolios. There are no fees on crypto or fiat deposits, and no fixed repayment schedule. Users manage withdrawals, repayments, and collateral through the Clapp Wallet with 24/7 access. Final Thoughts Crypto loans and credit lines solve different problems. Loans offer simplicity and structure. Credit lines offer efficiency and control. Platforms like Clapp show how a revolving credit model can reduce unnecessary interest while keeping liquidity available at all times. Choosing the right option depends less on rates and more on how and when capital is actually used. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Key Takeaways: The SEC charged fake crypto platforms and AI-branded investment clubs over a $14 million retail investor scam. Fraudsters allegedly used social media ads and WhatsApp groups to promote fake AI trading tips and platforms. Regulators say no real trading occurred, and investor funds were misappropriated and routed overseas. In a complaint filed in federal court in Colorado , the SEC named purported crypto platforms Morocoin Tech Corp., Berge Blockchain Technology Co. Ltd. and Cirkor Inc., along with investment clubs AI Wealth Inc., Lane Wealth Inc., AI Investment Education Foundation Ltd. and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation. Regulators allege the entities worked together in an “investment confidence scam” that relied on social media advertising, messaging apps and fabricated crypto products. SEC: AI-Themed Crypto Scam Lured Investors Through Social Media and WhatsApp According to the SEC, the scheme operated from at least January 2024 through January 2025. The investment clubs allegedly recruited investors through ads on social platforms and then moved conversations to WhatsApp groups, where fraudsters posed as financial professionals. In those chats, they promoted what were described as AI-generated investment tips to build credibility and trust. Once investors were engaged, they were directed to open and fund accounts on Morocoin, Berge and Cirkor, which the SEC says falsely claimed to be licensed crypto trading platforms. The defendants also allegedly offered “security token offerings” that were presented as being issued by legitimate companies. In reality, regulators say no trading ever occurred, the platforms were fake, and neither the token offerings nor their issuing companies existed. AI-powered crypto scams are up over 450% in the past year. It’s proof that automation without auditability opens new attack surfaces. At Inference Labs we say: if an AI acts, it must leave a trace. No trust, just proof. — Inference Labs (@inference_labs) November 13, 2025 When investors attempted to withdraw funds, the SEC alleges the defendants imposed additional hurdles, including demands for advance fees, further draining victims’ accounts. In total, at least $14 million was misappropriated from US-based retail investors and routed overseas through a network of bank accounts and crypto wallets, according to the complaint. “This matter highlights an all-too-common form of investment scam,” said Laura D’Allaird, chief of the SEC’s Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit. She said the case shows how fraudsters are using AI-related claims and crypto narratives to target retail investors. The SEC charged the defendants with violating anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The agency is seeking permanent injunctions, civil penalties and disgorgement with interest. SEC Scales Back Crypto Enforcement as Trump Returns to Office As reported, the SEC has significantly reduced its enforcement activity against the cryptocurrency industry since President Donald Trump returned to office. Nearly 60% of crypto-related cases have been dropped, paused or dismissed, even as enforcement actions in traditional financial markets continue largely unchanged. High-profile cases affected by the pullback include the SEC’s long-running lawsuits against Ripple Labs and Binance. At the same time, changes at the top of the SEC are set to further reshape the agency’s stance. Paul Atkins, a Republican appointee seen as more receptive to market-driven regulation, is expected to remain chair for the foreseeable future. However, the commission is preparing to lose its final Democratic member.

The decision does not authorize issuance, but it clears the way for negotiations with the European Parliament and brings long-running debates over privacy, resilience, and political oversight into sharper focus. Offline, Private, Digital: Is Europe Rebuilding Cash in Code? A document released on Friday laid out the council’s stance, confirming that the digital euro would launch with both online and offline payment options. EU officials say this two-track approach is meant to keep central bank money relevant as the economy becomes more digital while still preserving features traditionally associated with cash. On the technical side, the European Central Bank has largely finished its groundwork after a two-year preparation phase that concluded in October 2025. ECB President Christine Lagarde said last week that the technical work is done and that the next steps now depend on lawmakers. ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the digital euro is technically ready and is now awaiting legislative approval. #ECB #DigitalEuro #EUStablecoin https://t.co/4cdYV6UdSJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 19, 2025 She added that political institutions will decide whether the European Commission’s proposal is adopted as written or changed. Much of the debate has focused on the offline option, which has raised privacy questions. Under the ECB’s design , offline payments would allow two users to exchange digital euro tokens directly between certified devices, such as smartphones or smart cards, with transaction details known only to the payer and payee. Source: ECB Only the funding and defunding of the offline wallet would be recorded, a structure the ECB says offers a level of privacy comparable to cash for low-value payments. Why the Digital Euro Can’t Fully Match Cash Privacy At the same time, experts and regulators have acknowledged technical limits. The European Data Protection Board has warned that enforcing physical proximity in a digital system is difficult, as relay attacks could theoretically bridge near-field communication signals over the internet. The board concluded that physical proximity, a defining feature of cash, cannot be reliably guaranteed in digital currency systems, even with safeguards in place. As a result, the offline digital euro is described as highly private but not fully anonymous in the way physical cash is. Source: Projective Group The online version is designed to support everyday digital payments, including e-commerce and remote transfers. For these transactions, the ECB would see only pseudonymized data, meaning payments could not be directly linked to individuals. Banks and other payment service providers would access only the information required to comply with EU anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules and would be barred from using payment data for commercial purposes without user consent. Two Modes, One Goal: Inside the ECB’s Digital Euro Plan ECB officials have stressed that the central bank has no interest in monetizing transaction data. Beyond privacy, the two versions serve different practical roles. The offline digital euro is intended as a resilience tool, allowing payments to continue during network outages or power disruptions and supporting financial inclusion for people without reliable internet access. The online version is meant to integrate with existing digital infrastructure, offering convenience, security, and compatibility with private payment services operating across the euro area. The Council’s position also sets limits on how many digital euros individuals can hold to prevent large shifts of deposits away from commercial banks. Fees for basic services would be prohibited for consumers, while additional services could carry charges. The framework would also require device makers to grant payment providers fair access to hardware and software needed to support digital euro wallets.

56232757,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=250995,1766491816,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Critical Alert: Bitcoin Investor ZOOZ Strategy Faces Nasdaq Delisting Deadline,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-investor-delisting-risk-nasdaq/,"BitcoinWorld Critical Alert: Bitcoin Investor ZOOZ Strategy Faces Nasdaq Delisting Deadline In a dramatic turn of events, ZOOZ Strategy (ZOOZ), a Nasdaq-listed company that transformed itself into a dedicated Bitcoin investor , now faces the serious threat of stock exchange delisting. This development highlights the volatile intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrency investments, raising important questions about the sustainability of corporate Bitcoin strategies. Why Is This Bitcoin Investor Facing Delisting? ZOOZ Strategy finds itself in regulatory trouble because its share price has consistently traded below $1, violating Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement. The company originally focused on electric vehicle charging infrastructure before pivoting to become a pure-play Bitcoin investor . This strategic shift hasn’t protected it from traditional market pressures, demonstrating that even cryptocurrency-focused companies must comply with established financial regulations. The situation creates a tight deadline for ZOOZ. According to Cointelegraph reports, the company must achieve a closing share price of $1 or higher for ten consecutive trading days by June 15, 2026. Failure to meet this requirement could trigger formal delisting procedures, potentially removing the company from the prestigious Nasdaq exchange entirely. What Options Does This Struggling Bitcoin Investor Have? ZOOZ Strategy reportedly considers a reverse stock split as its primary solution. This corporate action would reduce the number of outstanding shares while proportionally increasing the price per share. For example, a 1-for-10 reverse split would convert ten existing shares into one new share, theoretically multiplying the share price by ten. However, reverse splits carry significant risks that this Bitcoin investor must carefully consider: Market perception : Investors often view reverse splits as desperate measures Liquidity reduction : Fewer shares can mean less trading volume No fundamental change : The company’s actual value remains unchanged Historical precedent : Many companies that execute reverse splits continue to struggle How Much Bitcoin Does This Company Actually Hold? Despite its stock market troubles, ZOOZ Strategy maintains substantial cryptocurrency holdings. The company currently possesses 1,036 BTC, representing a significant investment in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This substantial Bitcoin reserve creates an interesting dynamic where the company’s fate depends on both traditional stock market performance and cryptocurrency market movements. The company’s substantial Bitcoin treasury means its financial health connects directly to cryptocurrency price fluctuations. When Bitcoin prices rise, the value of ZOOZ’s holdings increases, potentially improving investor sentiment. Conversely, Bitcoin price declines could exacerbate the company’s existing challenges, creating a complex financial balancing act for this dedicated Bitcoin investor . What Does This Mean for Other Bitcoin-Focused Companies? ZOOZ Strategy’s predicament serves as a cautionary tale for other companies considering similar pivots to cryptocurrency investments. The situation demonstrates that embracing Bitcoin doesn’t exempt companies from traditional financial regulations and market expectations. Other Bitcoin investor companies should note several important lessons from this development. First, regulatory compliance remains essential regardless of investment strategy. Second, stock market performance depends on multiple factors beyond cryptocurrency holdings. Third, corporate restructuring carries risks that must be carefully managed. Finally, transparent communication with investors becomes especially crucial when navigating such challenges. Can ZOOZ Strategy Recover From This Situation? The company’s recovery prospects depend on several interconnected factors. Successful execution of a reverse stock split could provide temporary relief by meeting Nasdaq’s price requirements. However, sustainable recovery requires more fundamental improvements, including better financial performance, stronger investor confidence, and potentially favorable Bitcoin price movements. ZOOZ must also consider how its identity as a Bitcoin investor affects market perception. While cryptocurrency enthusiasm can attract certain investors, it may alienate others who prefer traditional business models. The company must carefully balance its cryptocurrency focus with broader market expectations to rebuild sustainable value. In conclusion, ZOOZ Strategy faces a critical juncture that will test its viability as a publicly-traded Bitcoin investor . The coming months will reveal whether the company can navigate these challenges successfully or become another cautionary example in the evolving relationship between traditional finance and cryptocurrency investments. The outcome will provide valuable insights for investors, regulators, and other companies operating at this intersection. Frequently Asked Questions What is ZOOZ Strategy’s main business? ZOOZ Strategy is a Nasdaq-listed company that pivoted from electric vehicle charging infrastructure to become a dedicated Bitcoin investor, currently holding 1,036 BTC. Why is ZOOZ facing Nasdaq delisting? The company’s share price has remained below $1, violating Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement. It must achieve a closing price of $1 or higher for ten consecutive trading days by June 15, 2026, to avoid delisting procedures. What is a reverse stock split? A reverse stock split reduces the number of outstanding shares while proportionally increasing the price per share. For example, a 1-for-10 split would convert ten existing shares into one new share with ten times the price. How much Bitcoin does ZOOZ Strategy own? The company currently holds 1,036 Bitcoin, representing a significant cryptocurrency investment that influences its financial position and market valuation. What happens if ZOOZ gets delisted? If delisted, ZOOZ shares would no longer trade on the Nasdaq exchange, potentially reducing liquidity, visibility, and investor confidence. The company might trade on over-the-counter markets instead. Can other Bitcoin-focused companies face similar issues? Yes, any publicly-traded company focusing on cryptocurrency investments must still comply with traditional stock exchange requirements and face similar regulatory pressures.

According to the Financial Times, ByteDance has drafted early budgets to spend RMB160 billion, about $23 billion, in capital expenditure in 2026, a step up from the RMB150 billion the company put into AI systems this year. Around half of the 2026 budget is set aside for advanced semiconductors used to build and run AI models and applications. ByteDance has also set aside RMB85 billion specifically for AI processors, even though access to Nvidia chips is still a struggle. ByteDance increases chip spending as Trump allows limited Nvidia sales Chinese tech companies have been restricted by U.S. export controls that block access to Nvidia’s most powerful chips, pushing companies like ByteDance and Alibaba to design models that cost less to run and need fewer computing resources. The restrictions are still in place, but there was a policy change this month when Donald Trump lifted a ban that allows Nvidia to sell its H200 processor to approved buyers in China, which admittedly is weaker than Nvidia’s top hardware, but it still matters. Trump described the policy as allowing sales to “approved customers in China” but the approval process still faces resistance from lawmakers in Washington, and President Xi Jinping has since said he doesn’t even want the chips anymore. If the H200 sales move forward, ByteDance plans to place a test order of 20,000 H200 chips, with each unit priced at roughly $20,000, according to the report . ByteDance also continues to spend billions of dollars leasing data centers overseas, so it can legally use Nvidia’s most advanced hardware to train AI models and support users outside China, but these payments are booked as operating costs, not capital expenditure, which means they are not included in the $23 billion budget. ByteDance grows consumer AI use as U.S. rivals fund AI with debt While ByteDance’s open‑source Doubao models trail Alibaba’s Qwen and DeepSeek on independent benchmarks, data from QuestMobile shows the Doubao chatbot has overtaken DeepSeek in monthly active users and downloads, making it the most widely used AI chatbot in the country. ByteDance is also pushing its Volcano Engine cloud platform to corporate clients, putting it in direct competition with Alibaba’s cloud business, which have driven high usage across ByteDance’s AI services, according to Goldman Sachs. Goldman analysts reported that in October, ByteDance recorded more than 30 trillion daily tokens, while Google logged 43 trillion tokens, a tiny margin in the grand scheme of things. Despite this growth, ByteDance’s spending remains far below that of U.S. tech giants. Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta together spent over $300 billion this year building data centers and power systems for AI models and products. Much of that U.S. expansion has been financed through borrowing. American companies sold $1.7 trillion of investment‑grade bonds in 2025, close to the $1.8 trillion raised in 2020 during the Covid crisis. Trade body Sifma tracked issuance through the end of November, showing a surge tied to AI infrastructure funding. Goldman Sachs estimates that AI‑related borrowing now represents about 30% of net investment‑grade issuance and is expected to rise again in 2026, even as concerns grow about the debt levels taken on by AI hyperscalers.

Following its calculated expansion into the United States and Europe, the platform’s trading activity has multiplied an incredible 53 times this year. This explosive growth story highlights the power of regulatory compliance and market access in the competitive crypto landscape. What’s Behind the Explosive Growth in OKX Trading Volume? The primary catalyst for this remarkable surge is clear: strategic geographic expansion. OKX secured two critical regulatory victories that opened massive new markets. First, it obtained a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in the European Union in January. Then, it successfully entered the highly competitive U.S. market in April. These moves provided millions of new users with trusted, regulated access to the exchange’s services. This expansion directly translated into a dramatic user base increase. The number of daily active wallets on the OKX platform doubled over the past year. On average, approximately 190,000 new wallets are now created on the platform each day. This influx of new, active participants is a fundamental driver of the increased trading volume. How Did Decentralized and Centralized Trading Perform? The growth was not uniform across all platform segments, revealing interesting user trends. The most dramatic increase occurred in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity. Global DEX volume on OKX surged by an astonishing 262%. This indicates a strong and growing user preference for non-custodial, peer-to-peer trading methods within the OKX ecosystem. Meanwhile, the traditional centralized exchange (CEX) volume also saw healthy growth, increasing by 16%. This balanced growth across both centralized and decentralized models shows OKX is successfully catering to a broad spectrum of crypto traders, from beginners preferring custodial services to advanced users seeking DeFi tools. What Are the Key Takeaways from OKX’s Success? OKX’s story offers several actionable insights for the crypto industry and its observers: Regulatory Compliance is a Growth Engine: Proactively securing licenses (like MiCA) builds trust and unlocks major markets. Strategic Expansion Pays Off: Entering mature markets like the U.S. and Europe, despite the competition, can yield exponential returns. Product Diversity Matters: Supporting both CEX and DEX services captures different user segments and drives overall volume. User Onboarding is Critical: The massive daily wallet creation shows effective marketing and a seamless sign-up process. However, this rapid growth also presents challenges. The exchange must now scale its infrastructure reliably, maintain top-tier security with a larger user base, and navigate the ongoing, complex regulatory environments in its new regions. Its ability to manage this scale will determine if this surge is a spike or the start of sustained dominance. What Does the Future Hold for OKX? The staggering 53-fold increase in OKX trading volume is more than just a statistic; it’s a market signal. It demonstrates that when a crypto exchange combines a robust product suite with strategic regulatory navigation, monumental growth is possible. This success puts significant pressure on competitors and could accelerate consolidation in the sector as other exchanges pursue similar expansion plans. For traders and investors, OKX’s growth enhances liquidity and could lead to more competitive fees and innovative features as the exchange seeks to retain its new users. The coming months will be crucial to see if OKX can consolidate its gains and turn this explosive surge into long-term, sustainable market leadership. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly does a 53-fold increase in OKX trading volume mean? A: It means the total value of assets traded on the OKX exchange is 53 times larger now than it was at the beginning of the year. This is an extraordinary rate of growth indicating massive new user activity and capital inflow. Q: Why is the MiCA license important for OKX’s expansion? A: The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license is a regulatory framework for the European Union. Securing it allows OKX to operate legally across all 27 EU member states, providing a huge, unified market of users who value regulatory compliance and consumer protection. Q: Did centralized (CEX) or decentralized (DEX) trading drive the OKX volume surge? A: Both segments grew, but DEX volume saw the most dramatic rise, surging 262%. CEX volume grew a solid 16%. This shows strong demand for both traditional and decentralized finance (DeFi) services on the platform. Q: What challenges might OKX face after such rapid growth? A> Key challenges include maintaining platform stability and security under heavier load, providing consistent customer support to a much larger user base, and continuously adapting to evolving regulations in the U.S. and Europe. Q: How does this affect other cryptocurrency exchanges? A> OKX’s success likely increases competitive pressure. Other major exchanges may accelerate their own plans for regulatory licensing and geographic expansion to avoid losing market share. This could benefit users through better services and features. Q: Is this growth sustainable for OKX? A> Sustainability depends on OKX’s execution. The initial surge comes from market access. Long-term success will depend on retaining new users through superior technology, security, customer service, and continuous innovation in a fast-moving industry.

The move from the swing high to the recent swing low near $0.0000039 represents a decline of approximately 3%, reflecting increased seller control. At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.000003954, suggesting a 1.59% decline in the last 24 hours. PEPE price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap PEPE Tests Key Support, Setting Up Potential Bullish Reversal The PEPE/USDT 3-day chart shows the price currently testing the lower boundary of a well-defined descending channel around the $0.00000399 level, which coincides with a critical support zone ranging roughly from $0.00000330 to $0.00000440. Historically, the market has respected this support multiple times, bouncing off it after sustained downward pressure, indicating that buyers are stepping in at these levels. The repeated defense of this zone suggests accumulation, which could set the stage for a potential reversal after prolonged selling pressure. Source: X According to analyst Butterfly, the price action implies building bullish momentum as it consolidates near the support boundary. If PEPE holds above $0.00000399 and breaks out of the descending channel, the chart indicates a strong probability of a sharp upward move, potentially targeting the channel’s upper boundary and higher resistance levels around $0.00000200. This setup reflects a classic “pressure buildup at support” scenario, where the market could accelerate upward once sellers are exhausted and buyers gain control. PEPE Holds Support as Bearish Momentum Fades On the 1-day PEPE/USD chart, the broader trend remains bearish to neutral, with price continuing to move sideways after a prolonged downtrend. PEPE is trading around the $0.00000398–$0.00000400 region, showing limited upside momentum and lower highs over recent weeks. Immediate support is located near $0.00000390, which aligns with recent daily lows and has prevented deeper pullbacks. A stronger support zone sits slightly lower around $0.00000370–$0.00000380, where buyers previously stepped in. On the upside, resistance is capped near $0.00000415–$0.00000420, followed by a more significant resistance zone around $0.00000450, where selling pressure has consistently emerged and rejected price advances. PEPE 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView The RSI is at 40.24, reinforcing the lack of strong momentum in either direction. Meanwhile, the MACD remains below the zero line, with the signal and MACD lines close together, indicating subdued bearish momentum and a potential early stabilization phase. The histogram is shallow and slightly improving, hinting that downside pressure is fading, but a clear bullish signal would require a MACD crossover and expansion above zero to confirm trend reversal strength.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|PEPE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-23 13:30:02

Namely, the put-to-call ratio stands at 0.38, so traders appear to seek upside exposure rather than downside protection.

Even though Canaccord kept its buy rating, analyst George Gianarikas cut his Q4 2025 delivery forecast, citing a bigger-than-expected slump in demand. But he didn’t back off the bull case. He said the Tesla weakness looks temporary and doesn’t change the long-term story. “There are constructive developments beneath the surface that support our BUY rating and justify a higher price target, even with the 4Q25 earnings cut,” George wrote. He said Tesla’s stock price has held up for a reason: “With Tesla’s recent share-price strength, the market seems to be looking through the quarter, and we intend to do the same.” In other words, investors aren’t panicking, and neither is Canaccord. Price target raised despite weak Q4 delivery forecast George said the end of U.S. EV subsidies has hit short-term demand harder than expected. That’s why he revised the Q4 delivery estimate lower, even while raising the price target. Still, he sees it as a short dip, not a trend. He added that the subsidy cut is “forcing a healthier, more durable market to emerge,” one that’s shaped by product strength, not government help. According to George, the EV shakeout is making it clearer which carmakers actually care about electric vehicles. The rest? They just slapped together compliance projects to look busy. But Tesla , he said, has dedicated platforms, real software development, capital planning, and customer loyalty. “Only brands with strong products, cost discipline, and loyalty are positioned to keep/gain share,” George wrote . He pointed at Rivian as the only possible long-term rival, but didn’t sound too worried. The tone was clear: most carmakers are falling behind, and Tesla is still ahead, even if growth slows short-term. EV growth in emerging markets adds to long-term optimism Beyond the U.S. market, George highlighted growing EV adoption in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil. He called these markets “nascent opportunities” that could deliver long-term upside for Tesla, even though they’re small now. He also touched on Tesla’s robotaxi rollout, which is moving slower than originally expected. Still, he backed it. And he flagged one more thing Wall Street should be watching: the Optimus humanoid robot program. He said that by 2026, it could bring new attention to Tesla’s non-automotive business and help it tap new profit streams. “Potentially more expansive news flow around the Optimus humanoid robot program in 2026 could further enhance Tesla’s perceived optionality in nonautomotive profit pools,” he wrote. Taking all this together, George said these upsides “outweigh the near-term earnings reset in the valuation framework,” and that’s why he bumped the target price up to $551, even as Q4 deliveries go lower. Shares of Tesla have climbed 21% this year, and Canaccord is betting that the rally still has more room to run. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

He suggested that anyone who thinks XRP’s future is big should think bigger. How the XRP Ledger Lending Protocol Works The XRP Ledger lending protocol is designed to function directly on the XRPL. Loans are created on the ledger rather than through external smart contracts. Each loan has fixed terms and a fixed duration. Interest rates are set at creation and do not fluctuate. A defining feature of the protocol is segregation. Each loan exists inside its own Single Asset Vault, known as an SAV. The vault holds only one asset, such as XRP or RLUSD. Assets from different loans do not mix. Risk stays contained within the individual credit facility. XRP Ledger Loans are coming. You might think the future is big.

The protocol also allows for a loan administrator or broker to oversee lending, borrowing, servicing, and fees. This structure aligns more closely with traditional credit markets than pooled DeFi lending models. The Lending Structure Steingraber attached an image showing the system’s structure. It shows a lending protocol connected to a Single Asset Vault. Together, they form an end-to-end lending setup on the XRPL. Inside the vault is XRP, and the system has a loan manager responsible for administering the loan. Asset custody remains isolated, and loan management operates at the protocol layer. The image makes clear that lending on XRPL is not based on shared liquidity pools . Each loan stands alone. This design reduces cross-exposure between loans, keeping failures contained within individual vaults. Why Steingraber’s Message Matters for XRP Steingraber’s post focused on scale. By pointing to lending coming directly to the XRPL, he highlighted an expansion of XRP’s on-ledger utility . Native lending introduces structured credit activity without relying on external platforms. His message positioned XRP as a network evolving toward more complex financial functions while keeping those functions embedded at the protocol level. Many experts believe the crypto world is not ready for the upcoming XRP surge , and developments like this add to the bullish sentiment surrounding the asset.

56236809,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=883112,1766497218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56236809.jpeg,Crypto.com explores internal market-making for sports-based prediction contracts,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-com-hires-market-making-team/,"Crypto.com is recruiting traders to operate an internal market-making desk for trading directly against customers on its prediction market exchange. The Singapore-based company has posted a “quantitative trader” job listing, who will reportedly join a team responsible for buying and selling financial contracts of sporting events outcomes. According to Bloomberg’s Tuesday report, the role would require them to boost liquidity on Crypto.com’s prediction market trade contracts that pay out based on a specific event. Crypto.com prediction market adds ‘conflict of interest’ job Market making on prediction platforms is a controversial topic because, unlike sportsbooks, which set odds or profit from customer losses, they match opposing views in an open market. But opponents argue that internal trading desks are effectively placing the platform operator or its affiliates on the opposite side of customer trades. Crypto.com is not the only prediction market to deploy in-house traders on its exchange. Kalshi, the second most popular decentralized prediction platform in the US, also has an internal unit known as Kalshi Trading. Cryptopolitan had reported in early December that new US-market entrant Polymarket is also building its own internal trading operation, confirmed by people familiar with the matter. The firm has supposedly been approaching traders with professional sports betting backgrounds about joining the team. Detractors contend that the arrangements, arguing they would make prediction platforms operators benefit when customers lose. They might have enough ammo to support their case, owing to Crypto.com’s statement about how the successful candidate will “maximize profits while carefully managing risks,” so the internal desk is expected to generate trading gains. A spokesperson for Crypto.com pushed back on the idea, saying the company does not “rely on proprietary trading as a source of revenue,” adding that its internal market maker “does not have access to proprietary data or customer order flow” ahead of other participants. Despite those assurances, the digital currency exchange’s own rules indicate that market makers may receive sports-linked contracts with a three-second head start over retail traders placing wagers. Company says it has fully complied with the CFTC’s regulations The Crypto.com spokesperson told Bloomberg its internal trading team’s derivatives activities are listed on its US platform and that the arrangement is “fully disclosed” to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the purported regulator for event-based contracts in the United States. “The bottom line for customers is more competition and liquidity on the platform creates a better overall experience,” the spokesperson surmised. The 2016-founded trading platform was among the first prediction market companies to list sports contracts late last year. Kalshi later followed, and sports-linked wagers have since become the biggest source of trading activity on its platform. The market now includes companies like DraftKings Inc. and Flutter Entertainment Plc’s FanDuel, which also launched their own prediction market-style applications to have a piece of the cake. Kalshi co-founder says market makers ‘bootstrap liquidity’ The debate over internal market making became a focal point in a proposed class action lawsuit filed in November against Kalshi and its affiliate, Kalshi Trading. Seven Kalshi users based in New York allege that Kalshi Trading sets betting lines that make it a “sportsbook without the required gaming licenses.” “When consumers place bets on Kalshi, they face off against money provided by a sophisticated market maker on the other side of the ledger. Market makers make it possible for consumers to place illegal, unregulated wagers ‘against the House,” the attorneys for the seven plaintiffs wrote. However, Kalshi co-founder Luana Lopes Lara has publicly rejected those claims through social media, saying the lawsuit’s allegations were “false and reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of how prediction markets operate.” “Kalshi is an exchange. It’s peer-to-peer, and there is no house. Anyone can place orders and trade against anyone else, whether it’s a person or an entity. Like any financial exchange, we have market makers that compete openly against each other and help bootstrap liquidity,” Lara wrote in a lengthy statement on X. Lopes Lara also stated that Kalshi Trading is not profitable, bashing the sentiments that the affiliate exists to extract value from customer losses. She concluded her message stating that she “hopes the industry matures and decides to work together to achieve the full potential of prediction markets.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Days after the mainnet launch, the MENA region’s first and largest institutional L2 has secured partnerships with BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton, demonstrating institutional confidence in compliance-first blockchain architecture. The Institutional Validation Each of ADI’s latest partnerships targets different infrastructure needs: BlackRock signed an MoU with the ADI Foundation to explore accelerating blockchain adoption across financial markets and strengthening the emirate’s status as a global digital asset hub. The partnership targets institution-grade tokenized asset structures, improved distribution, and clear regulatory frameworks that support market growth. The Mastercard partnership is focused on blockchain-based payments and asset tokenization across the Middle East. The collaboration brings stablecoin settlement, cross-border payments, and digital asset rails to the region with regulatory alignment built in. Franklin Templeton signed an MoU with the ADI Foundation to explore regulated digital asset infrastructure within ADGM. The partnership focuses on building compliant pathways for institutions to create and launch tokenized products, developing digital rails for improved distribution and settlement, and conducting research on stablecoins and tokenized assets that align with regulatory requirements. The ADI Foundation also announced a UAE expansion on December 10, further demonstrating momentum and institutional blockchain adoption in the region. Three global institutions partnering within days of launch signal what they need: a blockchain built for regulatory frameworks. These partnerships expand the ADI Foundation’s influence, reach, and capabilities, bringing more projects into the ecosystem as enterprises discover ADI Chain through BlackRock, Mastercard, Franklin Templeton, and expanding institutional networks. Launch and Access The ADI utility token launched simultaneously with the mainnet across Kraken , Crypto.com , and KuCoin , and became available through Wallet in Telegram and Fasset shortly after. The market response showed demand for compliance-ready infrastructure: that interest extends beyond institutional players. The Build Continues BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton joined an ecosystem spanning partnerships across 20 countries. Over 50 institutional and enterprise projects are in the pipeline for deployment on ADI Chain, with institutional and technology partnerships continuing to expand. Projects deploying on ADI Chain already demonstrate the network’s institutional use cases: Near Protocol’s TravAI brings travel management onchain, with payments settled on ADI Chain. ADREC’s strategic partnership with the ADI Foundation targets pilot projects across Abu Dhabi’s real estate sector, covering property registration, title validation, transaction management, and shared ownership models. Esyasoft Holding’s collaboration is focused on energy transition through blockchain infrastructure for governments and utilities. Emirates Driving Company partnered with the ADI Foundation to pilot blockchain solutions across the UAE’s driver education ecosystem, streamlining workflows and modernizing payments. The foundation’s strategic partnerships expand its capabilities and market access: ZKsync powers ADI Chain’s zero-knowledge proof infrastructure, Alchemy provides national-scale deployment capabilities, WalletConnect enables cross-chain interoperability, and Covalent delivers real-time blockchain data for institutional applications. Core infrastructure milestones continue advancing as well. ADI Chain was chosen to host the UAE Dirham-backed stablecoin, which will be issued by two major players in the region: First Abu Dhabi Bank and IHC, and is set to be regulated by the UAE Central Bank. Alongside technical infrastructure, the Foundation will launch an educational initiative, ‘Future Tech 4.0’ in partnership with ADGM and leading universities to develop over 10,000 Web3 specialists. A Year of Building Most L2 blockchains compete on transaction speed and low fees. ADI Chain took a different approach, building for compliance, regulatory alignment, and government deployment. The thesis was straightforward: emerging market governments and institutions need blockchain infrastructure designed specifically for them. One year ago, the ADI Foundation announced its formation at Abu Dhabi Finance Week. Last week, it returned to the same stage to announce the ADI Chain Mainnet launch. Twelve months from formation to operational infrastructure, with partnerships confirmed within days. BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton signed partnerships days after launch, showing they had monitored development closely. When institutions of that scale move that quickly, it validates the category itself. ADI established “institutional L2 for MENA” before competitors could claim the space. ADI aims to bring one billion people onchain by 2030. One year in: mainnet operational, partnerships across 20 countries, 50+ projects ready to deploy, 500+ million people already within reach. The goal now looks less distant. About the ADI Foundation & ADI Chain The ADI Foundation is an Abu Dhabi-based non-profit founded by Sirius International Holding, a subsidiary of IHC, dedicated to empowering governments and institutions in emerging markets through blockchain infrastructure. The foundation’s mission is to bring one billion people into the digital economy by 2030, building on a foundation of 500+ million people already within its ecosystem reach. ADI Chain is the first institutional Layer 2 blockchain for stablecoins and real-world assets in the MENA region, providing settlement infrastructure for First Abu Dhabi Bank and IHC’s dirham-backed stablecoin, set to be regulated by the UAE Central Bank. The network operates on three pillars – Compliance, Efficiency, Security – serving governments implementing blockchain infrastructure across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.

A pattern emerged where the growth of BTC lagged behind and decoupled from the growth of the global money supply. BTC price expansion did not follow the gains of the global M2 money supply . Over the past 12 months, BTC ended up with a small net gain, underperforming traditional assets. The M2 money supply expanded in 2025, but BTC decoupled from the growth, as liquidity shifted to stocks and precious metals. | Source: BGeometric s The M2 narrative was part of the setup for crypto, which was expected to have a year-end rally. However, BTC stalled at $126,000 in October, breaking down to a lower range since then. The BTC rally in 2025 also lagged behind the pace of expansion of M2. Historically, BTC rallies three to six months after monetary expansion, but this time, other factors broke down the trend in Q4. M2 money supply reaches a new record In the past 12 months, the global money supply expanded from $104T to over $115T, extending the pace from the past few years. The supply growth exceeded the 2024 expansion. The growth pace also resembled the post-pandemic conditions of 2020. The US money supply also grew in the past 12 months, rising to $22.5T in October, up from $21.4T in December 2024. This time around, the expansion of AI and data center stocks , along with the growth of precious metals, meant the additional funds were not chasing crypto assets. BTC was also more mainstream, and had a longer price history, and trading in 2025 was done with more caution and skepticism. BTC failed to break the expected price levels for the past year, and the crypto market did not break to a new all-time peak. Can BTC recover its trend? The M2 money supply narrative has mostly worked for BTC in previous market cycles. This time, the excess money inflows did not chase BTC blindly. Buyers and accumulation were more strategic. The Chinese money supply expanded even more, by around 8% in the past year, from 311T to 336T yuan. However, the country did not contribute to the growth of BTC directly, and even Asian traders remained cautious. One of the expectations is that BTC may catch up with the M2 supply. A catchup rally sets an even more bullish target for BTC, with the potential to break above $220K per coin. At the same time, BTC continues to unwind, with signs of institutional selling and divestment at each local high. BTC has failed to recover above $90,000 for weeks, as each rally is met with selling.

The central bank confirmed it will carry out open market bond purchases worth 2 trillion rupees ($22.34 billion) between December 29 and January 22, alongside a $10 billion dollar-rupee buy/sell swap scheduled for January 13. The intervention is a response to pressure the RBI has been getting from traders and bankers, who flagged a surge in forward premiums on the dollar-rupee that needed to be brought under control. India’s liquidity tools target excess dollar supply and weak rupee flows With year-end regulatory constraints already tightening lending options, the bond market demanded the RBI step in and ease rupee liquidity while draining out surplus dollar inflows that have distorted pricing at the long end of the FX curve. India’s 10-year bond yield closed at 6.6328% on Tuesday. Governor Sanjay Malhotra has already pumped 6.5 trillion rupees into the system this year through similar bond operations, more than any previous year on record. Now, it’s adding another massive round to stabilize the system before the end of the calendar year. The $10 billion swap in January follows a $5 billion 3-year swap the RBI executed on December 16. The idea is simple: sell dollars now, buy them back later, and in the meantime, release rupees into the market. This helps reduce excess dollar liquidity without permanently selling the RBI’s foreign currency reserves. Banks trying to manage surplus dollar holdings at the end of the quarter normally park funds with other institutions. But with quarter-end and year-end restrictions in place, this has become difficult. That’s why the RBI’s intervention has been described by traders as necessary, given the timing and the scale of market stress. Meanwhile, India’s trade exports to the United States surged by 22.61% year-on-year in November, hitting $6.98 billion even amid economic tensions that has Russia in the middle of Delhi-Washington relations . This is a massive rebound after two straight months of contraction, which followed the imposition of high tariffs by the United States on several Indian goods. Imports from the U.S. also rallied by 38.29% to $5.25 billion in the same month, according to data from the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), which reported a surge in bilateral trade activity, even as both economies deal with internal and external pressures.

The latest data shows US Q3 GDP grew at an annualized rate of 4.3%, decisively beating market forecasts. This powerful performance signals underlying strength and has immediate implications for investors and policymakers alike. What Does This US Q3 GDP Number Actually Mean? The Department of Commerce’s advance estimate puts the US Q3 GDP growth at 4.3%, significantly above the 3.3% most analysts predicted. This “advance estimate” is the first of three readings, followed by preliminary and final figures. Therefore, it represents our initial, best look at the economy’s performance from July through September. An annualized rate means if the economy grew at this pace for a full year, it would expand by 4.3%. Why Is This Growth So Significant? This robust US Q3 GDP figure is significant for several key reasons. First, it comes amid concerns about inflation and higher interest rates. Second, it suggests consumer and business spending remained strong. Let’s break down the potential drivers: Consumer Resilience: Strong job markets likely fueled continued spending. Business Investment: Companies may be investing in equipment and software. Government Spending: Federal and state expenditures can contribute to growth. However, it’s crucial to view this in context. This is one quarter’s data, and the economy faces ongoing challenges. What Are the Immediate Market and Policy Implications? A stronger-than-expected US Q3 GDP report sends a clear signal to financial markets and the Federal Reserve. For markets, it often translates to confidence in corporate earnings, potentially supporting stock prices. For the Federal Reserve, whose primary mandate is price stability, strong growth can complicate the fight against inflation. If the economy is running too hot, it gives the Fed less reason to cut interest rates quickly. Therefore, this data point is a critical input for their upcoming policy decisions. How Should Investors and the Public Interpret This Data? While the headline US Q3 GDP number is impressive, savvy observers look deeper. The composition of growth matters more than the top-line figure. Was it driven by sustainable consumer demand or temporary factors? Are we seeing productive investment or simply higher prices? The subsequent preliminary and final GDP reports will provide more detail, breaking down contributions from consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. This granularity offers a truer picture of economic health. Looking Ahead: Can This Momentum Last? The question now is whether this momentum is sustainable. Key factors to watch include consumer confidence data, retail sales figures, and business sentiment surveys. Moreover, geopolitical tensions and the lagging effects of prior interest rate hikes still pose risks. The stunning US Q3 GDP performance provides a solid cushion, but the path forward requires careful navigation of these crosscurrents. In summary, the 4.3% US Q3 GDP growth is a powerful testament to the economy’s current strength, defying widespread pessimism. It provides policymakers with both an opportunity and a challenge: to sustain growth while managing inflation. For everyone else, it’s a reminder of the economy’s dynamic and often surprising nature. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the difference between the advance, preliminary, and final GDP estimates? A: The advance estimate (like this 4.3% figure) is the first, based on incomplete data. The preliminary estimate revises this with more complete data, and the final estimate is the most comprehensive assessment for that quarter. Q: Does a high GDP growth rate mean inflation will increase? A> Not necessarily, but it can. If growth is driven by excessive demand pushing against limited supply, it can fuel inflation. The Federal Reserve monitors this balance closely. Q: How does this GDP report affect interest rates? A> Strong GDP growth can make the Federal Reserve more cautious about cutting interest rates, as a hot economy can sustain inflationary pressures. It supports a “higher for longer” rate stance. Q: What sectors typically drive GDP growth? A> Consumer spending is the largest component. Business investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports) are the other key drivers. Q: Is annualized GDP the same as year-over-year growth? A> No. Annualized GDP (like this 4.3%) shows the growth rate if the quarter’s pace continued for a full year. Year-over-year growth compares the quarter to the same quarter one year ago. Found this analysis of the stunning US Q3 GDP data helpful?

The move is reported to be in early stages and has not been confirmed by the bank. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $126K Sprint May Be Over — Fidelity Predicts 2026 Slide Institutional Demand And Product Options Reports have disclosed that the bank is looking at a range of possible offerings, including spot trades and derivatives, as it tests whether client demand justifies a rollout. Decisions will depend on risk assessments and the regulatory environment, sources say. Banks Respond To A Shifting Market Wall Street is already moving closer to crypto. Morgan Stanley, for example, plans to make crypto trading available on its E*Trade platform by mid-2026, a step that shows firms are racing to meet investor interest. The global crypto market is estimated to be about $3.1 trillion, with Bitcoin close to $1.8 trillion of that total, according to market data cited by reporters. JPMorgan Chase reportedly plans launching crypto trading services for institutional clients. https://t.co/Ggj0bOxcUc — TheStreet (@TheStreet) December 22, 2025 Plans To Start Without Custody Several industry reports say JPMorgan may initially focus on executing trades rather than holding clients’ tokens — that is, the firm would facilitate transactions but not provide custody services at first. That approach would let the bank offer access while limiting direct exposure. Banking History And Changing Views JPMorgan’s public position on crypto has shifted over time. Its CEO was once highly critical of Bitcoin, yet the firm has been testing blockchain and tokenization projects in recent years. The broader policy climate has also turned more favorable: US President Donald Trump has taken a stance seen by some observers as supportive of crypto, and that has affected industry calculations. What This Would Mean For Clients If JPMorgan moves ahead, clients could gain access to bank-grade execution for Bitcoin and other tokens, potentially with institutional custodians or third-party safekeeping used where needed. Market makers and asset managers would likely react quickly; liquidity could increase, and trading costs might shift. Those outcomes would depend on the exact products launched and on regulatory guardrails. Collateral And Tokenization Moves Earlier This Year The bank has already taken other crypto steps. In October, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan planned to allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral for loans by the end of the year, a sign that the firm is testing ways to bring crypto into traditional banking functions. Related Reading: Saylor Sparks Bitcoin Speculation With ‘Green Dots’ Signal Bitcoin Price Reaction Traders reacted positively to the news of JPMorgan exploring crypto trading, sending Bitcoin briefly higher into the $88,000–$90,000 range. While the price didn’t break past $90,000 decisively, the announcement added support near existing resistance levels and boosted market sentiment. Analysts note that any lasting price impact will depend on whether JPMorgan actually launches trading services and how US regulators respond, but for now, the story has reinforced optimism among institutional and retail investors alike.

With $16 billion in assets under management, Amplify’s entry signals growing institutional confidence in these specific crypto sectors. This launch provides investors with a novel way to gain exposure to the infrastructure behind the next wave of financial innovation. What Are These New Amplify ETFs? Amplify’s new funds offer targeted exposure to companies building the backbone of the crypto economy. The first fund, trading under the ticker STBQ , concentrates on stablecoin technology. The second, trading as TKNQ , focuses on the broader world of tokenization technology. These are not funds that hold Bitcoin directly. Instead, they invest in the public companies developing the protocols, platforms, and services that enable these technologies to function and grow. Breaking Down the STBQ Stablecoin Technology ETF The STBQ ETF holds 24 different assets. Its strategy is to invest in companies involved in the development, use, or transaction processing of stablecoins. Therefore, its largest allocations include major crypto assets like XRP, SOL, ETH, and LINK, which are foundational to many blockchain networks that host stablecoin activity. This fund allows investors to bet on the ecosystem that supports dollar-pegged digital currencies, which are crucial for trading, payments, and DeFi. What Does the TKNQ Tokenization ETF Offer? Tokenization—the process of converting real-world assets like real estate, art, or commodities into digital tokens on a blockchain—is seen as a multi-trillion dollar opportunity. The TKNQ ETF provides exposure to this trend by holding 53 assets in companies working on tokenization platforms, security token offerings, and related infrastructure. This fund casts a wider net, targeting the entire value chain of converting physical assets into tradable digital securities. Why Should Investors Pay Attention to These Amplify ETFs? These launches are noteworthy for several reasons. First, they offer a regulated, familiar vehicle (an ETF) for accessing complex crypto themes. Second, they move beyond simple Bitcoin or Ethereum exposure to target specific technological growth engines within crypto. For investors, the benefits include: Diversified Exposure: Gain access to a basket of companies in one trade. Targeted Themes: Speculate directly on the success of stablecoin adoption and asset tokenization. Institutional Validation: The launch by a major asset manager adds credibility to these crypto subsectors. However, challenges remain. These are still crypto-adjacent investments and will be subject to the volatility of the broader digital asset market. The Bottom Line on Amplify’s Crypto Fund Launch Amplify ETFs’ launch of the STBQ and TKNQ funds is a clever and timely development. It provides a bridge for traditional investors to participate in the structural growth of cryptocurrency, not just its price swings. By focusing on stablecoins and tokenization, Amplify is betting on two of the most practical and scalable applications of blockchain technology. This move could pave the way for more thematic crypto ETFs, further blending traditional finance with the digital asset revolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do the STBQ and TKNQ ETFs actually hold stablecoins or tokenized assets? A: No. These ETFs hold shares in public companies that are involved in the technology, development, or use of stablecoins and tokenization. They do not hold the underlying digital assets themselves. Q: How can I buy shares in these Amplify ETFs? A: Like any other ETF, shares of STBQ and TKNQ can be bought and sold through a standard brokerage account during market hours using their ticker symbols. Q: Are these ETFs considered high-risk investments? A: Yes. Because they are tied to the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector, which is known for high volatility, these ETFs are considered high-risk and speculative investments. Q: What is the main difference between STBQ and TKNQ? A> STBQ is narrowly focused on the ecosystem supporting stablecoins (like USDC or USDT). TKNQ has a broader mandate, investing in companies working on tokenizing any kind of real-world asset. Q: Does Amplify have other crypto-focused ETFs? A> Yes, Amplify previously launched the BLOK ETF, which invests in companies involved in blockchain technology more broadly. Found this insight into the latest crypto investment vehicles helpful?

They drain optimism slowly, shake out weak hands, and only reward conviction when confidence is scarce. For XRP holders, the past year has felt like a prolonged stress test, marked by sharp price swings and long periods of stagnation. These tough times often lead to major market growth, making 2026 a year worth watching, according to analysts. That discussion was recently reignited by market commentator Austin Hilton, who shared a detailed video analysis on X examining XRP’s performance, the broader crypto landscape, and why the next major upside phase may have been delayed rather than destroyed. XRP’s 2025 Performance in Perspective XRP is closing the year with a net decline of roughly 15 percent, despite experiencing wide intrayear volatility. XRP’s price dropped to around $0.79 but then surged to over $3.50 by mid-year, showing significant fluctuation. While the outcome disappointed many investors, Hilton emphasized that XRP still outperformed the broader altcoin market, which posted far steeper losses. Fellow XRP Holders – What Does 2026 Have In Store For Us… pic.twitter.com/rBkcg5J3wp — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) December 22, 2025 Bitcoin and Ethereum also ended the year lower, reinforcing that XRP’s struggles were not isolated. Instead, the data points to a systemic contraction across digital assets, driven by macroeconomic pressure rather than project-specific weakness. Macroeconomic Headwinds and Market Fatigue Hilton attributed much of 2025’s weakness to persistent global uncertainty. Trade tensions , geopolitical conflicts, interest rate ambiguity, and financial instability across major economies created an environment hostile to speculative assets. Retail participation, which typically fuels explosive crypto rallies, largely exited the market toward the end of 2024 and failed to return in meaningful numbers. Institutional capital helped prevent deeper collapses, but it lacked the speculative urgency needed to drive strong price appreciation. As a result, crypto absorbed steady “body blows” throughout the year without regaining sustained momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Progress Beneath the Surface Despite poor price performance, 2025 quietly delivered meaningful regulatory advancements. Legislative efforts aimed at clarifying digital asset frameworks gained traction, while major financial institutions became more comfortable discussing crypto exposure with clients. Hilton noted that this regulatory groundwork matters more than short-term price action, especially for assets tied to real-world financial infrastructure. For XRP, this progress aligns directly with Ripple’s long-term strategy. The focus on cross-border payments, liquidity efficiency, and enterprise-grade blockchain solutions positions XRP as functional infrastructure rather than speculative novelty. Why 2026 Is Drawing Bullish Attention Looking ahead, Hilton believes the anticipated bull cycle was postponed, not canceled. In his assessment, momentum expected in late 2025 has shifted into 2026, setting the stage for a broader market recovery. He projects Bitcoin reaching substantially higher levels under renewed liquidity conditions, with XRP potentially surpassing its previous all-time high if adoption accelerates. This positive outlook is driven by the increasing use of blockchain technology to update old financial systems. XRP’s role within that transition remains central to its long-term thesis. Patience as the Defining Strategy Hilton acknowledged that challenges will persist in 2026, but his conclusion remained clear. The world is steadily moving toward crypto, both as an investment class and as financial infrastructure. For XRP holders, endurance through uncertainty may prove more valuable than timing short-term fluctuations, as the next expansion phase begins to take shape.

The approval allows Matador to issue common shares, warrants, subscription receipts, debt securities, or units over a 25-month period, subject to market conditions. According to the company , the shelf prospectus is designed to support strategic Bitcoin accumulation and general corporate purposes. Management said the structure allows Matador to access capital efficiently while maintaining discipline around timing and pricing. The company framed the move as part of a long-term approach to the Bitcoin ecosystem rather than a single, fixed issuance. Matador currently holds about 175 BTC, based on its most recent disclosures. The company said it intends to scale its holdings gradually, using multiple financing tools rather than relying on a single funding source. Executives emphasized that the shelf approval does not obligate Matador to raise capital immediately. Bitcoin Treasury Targets and Industry Context In a recent post on X, Matador said it is among the top 100 public companies building a Bitcoin treasury , citing data from Bitcoin Treasuries. The tracker shows that the top 100 public companies collectively hold more than 1.05 million BTC, highlighting the growing role of corporate balance sheets in the Bitcoin market. The same post stated that Matador is advancing toward 1,000 BTC, describing its approach as disciplined and long term. However, in its official filings and press statements tied to the shelf prospectus, the company has framed that target as a longer-dated goal, rather than a near-term commitment. Earlier disclosures also show that Matador has used alternative financing to support its treasury strategy. The company previously announced a secured convertible note facility intended solely for Bitcoin purchases, and later issued clarifications following regulatory review. Those updates narrowed the stated use of proceeds and removed earlier, more aggressive supply-based targets. Capital Flexibility Without Immediate Dilution The shelf prospectus gives Matador optionality rather than a mandate. By registering multiple types of securities, the company can choose instruments that best match market liquidity and investor demand at the time of issuance. This approach mirrors strategies used by other Bitcoin -holding public companies seeking balance-sheet exposure without committing to fixed issuance schedules. Matador’s shares trade on the TSX Venture Exchange under MATA, with additional listings on OTCQB as MATAF and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The company said it will continue to disclose Bitcoin purchases and financing activity as required under securities rules, keeping investors informed as it executes its treasury plan.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-23 14:06:36

The five-second clip, shared on X, marked Hageman’s first post in months and quickly drew attention in political and crypto policy circles. Soon. pic.twitter.com/HHOpotrEA9 — Harriet Hageman (@HagemanforWY) December 22, 2025 While Hageman has not announced any plans, the timing has placed her at the center of conversations about who could succeed one of Congress’s most influential voices on digital asset regulation. Bitcoin’s Loudest Voice in the Senate Is Stepping Aside Lummis, a Republican, said on December 19 that she would step aside at the end of her term, which expires on January 3, 2027. First elected in 2020 and sworn in the following year, she became the first woman to represent Wyoming in the Senate and built a national reputation as one of Washington’s most outspoken supporters of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Her decision to retire comes as lawmakers remain locked in debates over how the United States should regulate crypto markets, stablecoins , and banking access for digital asset firms . During her tenure, Lummis played a central role in shaping those discussions. As chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets , she helped drive efforts to establish clearer oversight for the industry. The Senate is preparing to launch its first digital assets subcommittee, with crypto champion Cynthia Lummis @SenLummis taking the lead. #CynthiaLummis #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/LctYRfJiFs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 10, 2025 She co-authored and supported several high-profile bills, including the Responsible Financial Innovation Act and proposals tied to the broader digital asset market structure framework . She also aligned closely with President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto messaging during his current term, framing digital assets as a strategic issue for U.S. competitiveness. Her departure leaves an open question about who will carry that mantle in the Senate. Hageman’s Record Hints at Wyoming’s Next Crypto-Friendly Senator Wyoming’s single Senate seat has been a consistent source of support for crypto-friendly legislation, and its next occupant will have a say in whether that continues. Hageman’s name has surfaced as a potential successor partly because of her political alignment with Lummis and her record in the House. Hageman, as a fourth-generation Wyomingite and attorney, was elected to Congress in 2022 after defeating then-Representative Liz Cheney in the Republican primary. Her work in Washington has largely focused on limiting federal overreach, supporting fossil fuel development, defending private land rights, and advancing conservative priorities tied to states’ authority. While crypto has not been the centerpiece of her platform, Hageman has taken positions that resonate with the industry. She has framed digital assets as a states’ rights issue and argued that activities such as mining should be regulated primarily at the state level rather than by federal agencies. She also co-sponsored the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act , which passed the House in July 2025 and seeks to block the creation of a central bank digital currency over concerns about financial privacy and government control. GENIUS Act, Anti-CBDC Act, and CLARITY Act pass crucial procedural vote 215-211 in Congress after Trump's decisive Oval Office intervention rescues stalled crypto agenda. #GeniusAct #Trump https://t.co/Lm2tCBbimp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 16, 2025 Crypto Leaders Rally Early behind Hageman as Lummis’ Possible Successor Her potential entry into the Senate race has already drawn attention from figures within Wyoming’s crypto community. Caitlin Long, the founder of Custodia Bank and a key contributor to the state’s blockchain-friendly laws, publicly praised Hageman following reports of her interest, which shows that some industry advocates see her as a natural continuation of Lummis’ approach. HEY CRYPTO PEEPS: get ready to show some love to @RepHageman . https://t.co/Wbp5fBiArw — Caitlin Long (@CaitlinLong_) December 21, 2025 The broader backdrop adds weight to the moment. Lummis’ exit comes ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress will again be at stake and when unresolved crypto legislation could face further delays as campaigning intensifies. Advocacy groups and industry stakeholders are watching closely, aware that the loss of a senior Senate advocate could reshape how quickly, or whether, long-debated crypto rules move forward.

That growth rate caught most economists off guard, especially since Bloomberg’s survey of forecasters had pegged the number at just 3.2%. The new GDP data comes after weeks of delay caused by the government shutdown , which also affected fourth-quarter figures that are now expected next year. This update gives the most accurate picture of the economy in 2025 so far. The first-quarter GDP had dropped 0.5%, thanks to businesses front-loading purchases before President Donald Trump’s new tariffs hit. Then came a 3.8% jump in Q2, driven by reduced imports. AI investments, EV sales, and exports push third-quarter gains The third-quarter GDP surge was backed by three main things: AI infrastructure investments, rising consumer spending, and a boost in exports. Wealthy Americans spent more on electric vehicles, rushing to take advantage of Biden-era subsidies before they disappear. Healthcare spending was also up, adding to the total growth. Meanwhile, imports fell again, which helped the GDP since imports subtract from the total. But Wall Street barely blinked. The dollar index, stock futures, and trading desks stayed mostly flat. Only Treasury yields ticked up a little, and even that was quiet. Now, consumer spending is expected to slow. Add the shutdown’s continued effects , and the fourth quarter is looking weaker. That data’s also delayed. So until 2026 rolls around, this 4.3% GDP print is all we’ve got. Get seen where it counts.

While gold surged to fresh all-time highs , gaining 67% year to date, Bitcoin has failed to break free from consolidation between $85,000 support and $93,000 resistance, closing out what analysts call its “ weakest year-end performance in seven years. ” The compression comes ahead of Friday’s record-breaking Boxing Day options expiry, when roughly 300,000 Bitcoin option contracts worth $23.7 billion, alongside 446,000 IBIT option contracts, will expire. This, according to QCP, represents over 50% of Deribit’s total open interest. Source: X/@coinbureau Open interest in $85,000 puts has drifted lower from 15,000 to roughly 12,000 contracts as spot stabilizes, while $100,000 calls have held relatively stable around 17,000 contracts, indicating residual optimism for a Santa rally despite limited conviction. Year-End Flows Amplify Volatility Risk Bitcoin risk reversals show easing bearish sentiment compared to the past 30 days, gradually normalizing toward pre-October levels as downside positioning softens, QCP observed. Tax-loss harvesting ahead of the December 31 deadline could amplify short-term volatility, particularly since crypto investors can realize losses and immediately re-establish positions without wash-sale rule restrictions that apply to equities. “ Holiday-driven moves have historically tended to mean-revert ,” QCP stated, noting that Christmas week price action typically fades as liquidity returns in January, “ much like low-liquidity weekend spikes that often retrace once markets reopen. “ Beyond options flows, on-chain data reveals weakening buying pressure across multiple metrics. CryptoQuant analysis shows a declining buy-volume divergence in Binance futures markets, resembling the 2021 cycle structure, where price continued to rise while volume consistently declined, which is a trend that has yet to recover. Source: CryptoQuant Active addresses are also declining sharply, indicating that on-chain OTC activity and overall market participation are fading. Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $461.8 million in outflows over three days, led by BlackRock’s $173.6 million and Fidelity’s $170.3 million as year-end risk-off pressure builds. Institutional Holders Stay Steady Despite Drawdown Despite a more than 30% drawdown from October highs, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF holdings have declined by less than 5%, indicating institutional allocators are largely holding through the current downturn. “ Selling pressure is primarily retail-driven from leveraged and short-term participants ,” Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, told Cryptonews. Backing this, recent data show that global crypto ETPs have attracted $87 billion in net inflows since U.S. Bitcoin ETPs launched in January 2024. He added that Bitcoin “ has not traded like digital gold in 2025 ” due to heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic factors, with upside now “ tied to liquidity expansion, sovereign policy clarity, and risk sentiment, rather than to monetary debasement alone. “ Speaking with Cryptonews, Farzam Ehsani, Co-founder and CEO of VALR, also noted that “ the end of this year remains one of the more challenging periods for cryptocurrencies in recent years, amid seasonal weakness, persistent overbought conditions, and a return of investor interest to more conservative instruments, primarily US government bonds. “ He outlined two plausible scenarios: Either the current drawdown reflects strategic positioning by large players ahead of renewed accumulation. The market is undergoing a deeper reset driven by macro headwinds and Federal Reserve policy. Recovery Timeline Extends Into 2026 Speaking with Cryptonews, John Glover, Chief Investment Officer of Ledn, expects “ continued volatility with prices dipping to between $71k and $84k, which will form the bottom of Wave IV ” before the fifth and final wave begins. “ My Wave V remains at $145k to $160k ,” he stated, though completion of the current correction “ will take months to finish .” Ehsani sees scope for Bitcoin to revisit the $100,000–$120,000 range in the second quarter of 2026, noting that “ a renewed historical price high could occur as early as the first half of 2026. ” Notably, Michael Van De Poppe also observed that rejection at $90,000 “ isn’t a bad sign, as of yet, ” with markets clearly wanting “ $86K to hold as support ” to provide enough momentum to challenge resistance zones. #Bitcoin rejects at a crucial resistance zone and continues the sideways price action. That's unfortunate, but it remains to be building and upwards trend on the lower timeframes. Rejection at $90K isn't a bad sign, as of yet.

While this may seem bearish, history suggests it often signals the opposite. In crypto markets, extreme retail pessimism has frequently preceded strong price rebounds, positioning XRP at a potential contrarian inflection point. Santiment’s sentiment analysis gauges crowd psychology by tracking social media discussions to determine whether traders are predominantly bullish or bearish. When negative sentiment rises well above historical norms, it signals that fear and doubt may be peaking. At these extremes, selling pressure often fades, setting the stage for a potential market reversal rather than further downside. Well, this pattern reflects a classic market dynamic: prices often move against the crowd. When retail sentiment turns broadly pessimistic, most selling is already exhausted, leaving the market primed for a rebound. At that point, even modest buying pressure can spark upward momentum. Historically, Santiment shows that assets with unusually negative sentiment tend to outperform in the short to medium term as sentiment mean-reverts. XRP is currently trading at $1.89, according to Coincodex, with sentiment firmly bearish and the Fear & Greed Index at 24 , signaling extreme fear. While the token has struggled to sustain upside momentum in recent sessions, this deepening pessimism may be a contrarian signal. Historically, sentiment-driven traders view such conditions not as red flags, but as potential accumulation zones that often precede a rebound. Specifically, negative sentiment alone doesn’t trigger instant price gains, market conditions, liquidity, and macro factors remain key. Still, extreme sentiment signals a shift in risk-reward dynamics, often favoring potential upside. What’s next? Well, the current environment calls for attention, not panic. Overwhelmingly negative social media sentiment often signals emotional fatigue, not fundamental weakness. Historically, such extremes are when savvy investors quietly position themselves ahead of reversals. XRP’s surge in bearish commentary may be less a warning and more a setup. If history holds, widespread doubt could fuel a surprise price rebound, a reminder that in crypto, sentiment extremes often mark opportunity. Conclusion Extreme social media negativity on XRP may signal opportunity rather than alarm. Historically, when retail sentiment hits deep pessimism, rebounds often follow. At $1.89, XRP could be at a pivotal point, making this a key moment for contrarian-minded investors to assess risk and position for potential upside.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-23 14:09:35

Scheduled for 3:00 p.m. UTC on December 23rd, this launch on the exchange’s pre-market platform marks a pivotal moment for LIT traders and the broader crypto ecosystem. This article breaks down what this listing means for you. What Are LIT Perpetual Futures on Binance? Binance is introducing a LIT/USDT perpetual futures contract. Unlike traditional futures, these contracts have no expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. The contract will support leverage of up to 5x, offering amplified exposure to LIT’s price movements. Listing on the ‘pre-market’ means the contract will be available for trading before it enters the main futures marketplace, providing an early access window. Why Does This Binance Listing Matter for Traders? This development is more than just another asset listing. It represents enhanced market accessibility and liquidity for LIT. For traders, the benefits are clear: New Trading Strategies: The availability of LIT perpetual futures enables advanced strategies like hedging spot holdings or speculating on price direction with leverage. Increased Liquidity: Binance’s vast user base typically brings significant trading volume, which can lead to tighter spreads and better price discovery for LIT. Institutional Signal: A listing of this nature often signals growing credibility and interest in the underlying asset from both the exchange and the professional trading community. How Can You Navigate the 5x Leverage Opportunity? The offered 5x leverage is a powerful tool that requires respect. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses. Therefore, a disciplined approach is non-negotiable. Always use stop-loss orders and manage your risk capital wisely. This listing is an opportunity, but the volatile nature of crypto futures demands caution and a solid trading plan. What Challenges Should Traders Consider? While exciting, trading LIT perpetual futures on a pre-market carries inherent considerations. Pre-market volumes may be lower initially, potentially impacting order execution. Furthermore, the novelty of the contract means historical price data for the futures-specific market is limited. Traders should therefore start with smaller positions to gauge market behavior. Actionable Insights for the December 23rd Launch To prepare for the launch, ensure your Binance Futures account is verified and funded. Familiarize yourself with the platform’s futures interface and fee structure. Consider setting up price alerts for LIT to monitor initial volatility. Most importantly, define your risk parameters before the market goes live at 3:00 p.m. UTC. Conclusion: A Strategic Step for LIT and Crypto Derivatives Binance’s decision to list LIT perpetual futures is a strategic enhancement to its derivatives offerings. It provides traders with sophisticated tools to engage with the LIT market and reflects the growing maturation of altcoin trading products. By understanding the mechanics, benefits, and risks, traders can better position themselves to utilize this new financial instrument effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the ticker and trading pair for the new contract? A1: The contract will be listed as LIT/USDT, meaning you trade LIT against the Tether stablecoin. Q2: What is the difference between the pre-market and the main futures market? A2: The pre-market is a dedicated zone for newly listed futures contracts. It allows trading to begin in a controlled environment before full integration into the main futures market, which may happen later based on liquidity and stability. Q3: Is there a funding rate for these perpetual futures? A3: Yes, like all perpetual futures contracts, the LIT/USDT contract will have a periodic funding rate exchanged between long and short positions to help anchor the futures price to the spot price. Q4: What are the margin requirements for the 5x leverage? A4: With 5x leverage, the initial margin requirement is 20% of the position’s notional value. Always check Binance’s official announcement for exact maintenance margin levels to avoid liquidation. Q5: Can I trade this contract on the Binance mobile app? A5: Yes, once live, the LIT perpetual futures contract should be accessible for trading through both the Binance website and the official mobile application.

Data from Shibburn, the platform monitoring the token's deflationary measures, shows that zero burn activity occurred in the past 24 hours. This development arrives at a critical moment as SHIB struggles with persistent downward pressure. The absence of token burns raises concerns among investors who rely on this mechanism to support price stability. The Shiba Inu ecosystem typically removes tokens from circulation by sending them to inaccessible wallets. This process aims to create scarcity and potentially drive value appreciation. However, the ecosystem failed to execute any burns despite mounting pressure on the token's market value. SHIB has experienced notable volatility during this period. The meme coin dropped from $0.000007348 to $0.000007126 as burn activity remained at zero. Current trading data places SHIB at $0.000007124, reflecting a 2.3% decline in the last 24 hours. The token continues to underperform compared to the broader cryptocurrency market. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Selling Pressure Intensifies Market participants have responded to the declining prices by increasing their selling activity. Holders are exiting their positions as the downturn persists. Long-term traders have adopted a cautious stance, which has contributed to the challenging market conditions. This behavior has created additional headwinds for any potential recovery. The Relative Strength Index for Shiba Inu reached 14, indicating oversold territory. Technical analysts typically view such readings as signals for potential rebounds. Yet the anticipated upward movement has failed to materialize. The combination of selling pressure and rising circulating supply has created an unfavorable environment for price appreciation.

56240357,https://coinpaper.com/13299/solana-treasury-firm-upexi-files-shelf-registration-for-1-b-capital-raise,1766503003,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Solana Treasury Firm Upexi Files Shelf Registration for $1B Capital Raise,https://coinpaper.com/13299/solana-treasury-firm-upexi-files-shelf-registration-for-1-b-capital-raise,"Upexi’s plan to raise up to $1 billion through a new shelf registration signals a notable shift in how companies blend consumer brands with crypto treasury strategies. The Tampa-based firm disclosed the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, outlining broad flexibility to issue securities over time. The move comes as Upexi expands beyond traditional consumer products and deepens its commitment to Solana as a long-term treasury asset. Consequently, the filing places Upexi among a small group of public companies experimenting with digital assets inside corporate balance sheets. Upexi Seeks Flexible Capital Access According to the SEC filing , Upexi may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, or bundled units. The company did not set a timeline, choosing instead to raise capital when market conditions appear favorable. Besides flexibility, the structure allows management to tailor funding methods to specific needs. Upexi stated that proceeds may support working capital, capital spending, research, acquisitions, or debt management. Moreover, the filing clarifies that offerings may occur in stages rather than a single transaction. Upexi trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol UPXI. Shares last closed at $2.08 on December 19. Hence, any future issuance may depend on price stability and investor appetite. The company emphasized that it will release detailed prospectus supplements before each offering. This approach signals caution and measured execution rather than urgency. Solana Treasury Strategy Takes Shape Additionally, Upexi confirmed its growing focus on a Solana-based digital asset treasury program. The company plans to acquire, hold, and stake SOL as part of its broader financial strategy. This approach mirrors trends seen among firms seeking alternative stores of value or yield opportunities. Significantly, Upexi positions Solana as a long-term holding rather than a short-term trade. However, the timing coincides with recent weakness in Solana’s price. SOL traded near $122.90 , reflecting a daily decline of about 3.5%. Weekly losses approached 4.5%, with market capitalization near $69 billion. Trading volume remained elevated, suggesting active participation despite falling prices. Market Dynamics and Analyst Perspective Market analyst Ardi pointed to deeper structural trends behind Solana’s price action. He observed that selling pressure emerged well before the token peaked near $296 in November 2024. According to Ardi, mid-sized and institutional wallets reduced exposure steadily for over a year. Meanwhile, retail wallets increased activity, expecting a rebound. Moreover, Ardi noted a growing correlation between Solana’s price and memecoin activity. Consequently, periods of reduced speculative interest often coincide with weaker demand for SOL. This divergence raises questions about whether network value now relies heavily on retail-driven trends.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-23 15:16:43

The companies got a boost with a pivot to AI and the transformation of previous mining projects. BTC mining stocks are outperforming, despite the overall crypto market weakness. Toward the end of 2025, the top 10 BTC mining companies are mostly in the green, with significant yearly gains. As Cryptopolitan reported previously, BTC mining stocks had limited short-term volatility. The sector as a whole outperformed BTC and the overall crypto market growth. BTC mining stocks rise on AI data center promises Among the top 10 BTC mining stocks, eight were preparing to end the year in the green, with gains ranging from 12% for Core Scientific to 328% for Iren Limited. Separate stocks also outperformed in short-term timeframes. Hut 8 was among the top performers, gaining 46.73% in the past month and over 24% in the past week alone. Hut8 is up 112% in 2025, rising from the $12 range in March to over $50. Hut8 is yet to recover its peak above $72 from 2021, when the shares rose due to intrinsic crypto enthusiasm. The company’s yearly success reflected the sale of mining assets to American Bitcoin, Eric Trump’s pure play mining company. The other prominent mover in 2025 was IREN. The shares peaked above $66 in November and backtracked, but retained some of their gains at over $42. IREN also had a year-end rally, adding 24% in the past five days. The recent IREN price rally followed a progress report on its Childress, Texas data center. The flagship operation is preparing to deliver high-energy compute, with Microsoft as one of its major clients . The company prepares to launch two 100mW facilities with GPU superclusters. Are BTC mining stocks affected by AI data center depreciation? The biggest problem for BTC mining stocks may be the depreciation schedule of their AI spending. In total, the AI sector has planned significant spending in the coming years. One of the big problems is that companies are using 3-5 year depreciation cycles to write off the initial investments. The immediate problem is that depreciation may quickly overcome the real revenues of AI companies. BTC mining stocks may have a slight advantage in building smaller data centers. The companies also worry that the real useful life of chips may be much lower compared to the write-off period. The AI chip bubble has been noted by investor Michael Bury, also pointing attention at the low useful life of chips and the potentially inflated depreciation periods . As a result, BTC mining stocks are not a proxy or an offset of the crypto market, but a subset of AI mining stocks. For some of the companies, crypto mining is still a part of operations, though at a much lower rate of investment and growth. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Per the proposal, “both qualified and non-qualified investors will be able to acquire crypto assets, but each category will be subject to its own rules,” the bank said in a December 23 statement . The bank has already submitted its proposed legislative changes to the government for review and has outlined a working regulatory framework to be finalised by July 1, 2026. What does the proposal mean for Russian crypto investors? For non-qualified investors, which include ordinary retail participants, the Bank of Russia has proposed certain limitations. This includes access only to a select group of liquid crypto assets. Which specific cryptocurrencies would fall under this list is yet to be defined. However, the central bank wants to impose an annual purchase cap of 300,000 rubles (roughly $3,843). In addition, these investors would be required to pass a knowledge test before being allowed to buy any crypto. On the other hand, qualified investors would have much broader access to a wider range of cryptocurrencies, with the exception of privacy coins, which face restrictions in several jurisdictions across the globe. However, this subset of investors would also be subject to passing a knowledge test to ensure they understand the risks involved. At the same time, Russian residents would be allowed to acquire cryptocurrencies on foreign exchanges using foreign accounts. In those cases, investors would be required to report their transactions to the country’s tax authorities. The bank also proposed allowing digital financial assets to be circulated and traded on public networks as a way to attract foreign investment. Bank of Russia is not endorsing crypto Even as the central bank opens the door to controlled access, it has stressed that this move should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrencies. “The Bank of Russia continues to consider cryptocurrencies a high-risk instrument. They are not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction and are subject to increased volatility and sanctions risks,” the bank said. A year after the proposed regulatory framework is devised, penalties will be introduced for unlicensed crypto intermediaries operating within Russia. For years, the Bank of Russia had maintained a hardline stance against crypto and even proposed a complete ban at one point. However, as Russia’s economy came under distress due to mounting sanctions, the central bank began to reevaluate its position. Back in October, the bank agreed to legalise crypto for foreign trade settlements. Around the same time, it finalised a new framework allowing commercial banks to engage in limited crypto operations. Russia has also leaned on its energy surplus to formally permit cryptocurrency mining. The central bank has acknowledged and supported this development, framing crypto mining as a legitimate export item that brings value to the economy.

Some top-100 coins, however, have managed to rally during today’s selloff, with the biggest winners being Rain (8%) and Provenance Blockchain (7%). There are therefore still opportunities for gains, so we’ve picked the best altcoin to buy today that could 100x in 2026, with our choice of Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) getting ready to list in the coming weeks. Best Altcoin To Buy Today That Could 100x in 2026 – 23 December 2025 Bitcoin Hyper boasts one of the biggest presales of the year, with the sale for its native HYPER token having raised a whopping $29.7 millio n so far. This is an impressive figure, yet this sale is still ongoing, so the grand total could be even higher when the offering ends. It’s almost that special time of year. Even buried under snow, Hyper still delivers https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/o5zPqDFDUW — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) December 23, 2025 Investors clearly have considerable faith in Bitcoin Hyper, and the primary reason for this is that it’s planning to launch a layer-two network for Bitcoin. In contrast to the preexisting Lightning Network, which is focused on payments, Bitcoin Hyper will be a comprehensive layer-two network, one which aims to evolve into an ecosystem of dapps and DeFi platforms. Its purpose is to provide an outlet for investors with dormant Bitcoin holdings, providing them with DeFi protocols through which they can lend and earn staking yields from their BTC. They can do this by depositing their BTC with Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contract, which will provide them with a commensurate amount of HYPER, which they can use on the L2. And once they’ve finished earning, they can then convert back into Bitcoin, and so on. On a technical level, Bitcoin Hyper utilizes Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge rollups, making it one of the fastest and most secure L2s in the crypto sector. This gives it solid fundamentals as it prepares to launch, while its following on X – at 17,000 followers – also suggests that it’s already growing out its community. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Will End Soon: Here’s How to Buy Before Launch To buy HYPER early, investors can head over to the project’s official website and connect a compatible wallet. The token is currently available at a price of $0.013465, with buyers able to buy it using ETH, SOL, USDT, BNB or fiat currency. This price will rise again later today, while it still has several more prices rises scheduled, before the presale ends. As such, traders looking to make the biggest gains should act quickly, since there’s no telling what HYPER’s price will do once it lists on exchange. While the wider crypto market has been indecisive over the past few months, 2026 may bring more bullish conditions, if only because prices are in such oversold positions. It could therefore be a good time to launch a new token, with Bitcoin Hyper seemingly having a better chance than most new coins. This is why it’s our best new altcoin to buy today, and it could remain so for some time to come.

However, the DOGE price is still lagging, hovering just above the psychological $0.10 level, amid the broader crypto market downtrend. Dogecoin Sees 53,000% Surge In Futures Trading Volume CoinGlass data shows that Dogecoin’s futures trading volume surged as much as 53,000% on BitMEX, reaching just over $260 million in the process. The top meme coin has also seen its futures trading volume on other major exchanges such as Kraken, Binance, and Bybit surge over the last 24 hours, providing a bullish outlook for DOGE. This has led to a 10% surge in the trading volume across all exchanges, reaching $2.6 billion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Reclaiming $0.128 Support Could Signal The Perfect Chance For Long Positions Notably, the Dogecoin long/short ratio has increased to 0.9 in the last 24 hours, indicating that more traders are betting on a potential DOGE price increase. Meanwhile, the long/short ratio on Binance is at 2, suggesting that most Binance traders remain bullish on the foremost meme coin. This development comes as the crypto market anticipates a potential ‘Santa rally’ to end the year. This could provide some relief for Dogecoin, which has been on a massive downtrend since the October 10 crash. The meme coin is now down over 58% year-to-date (YTD). The DOGE price has also continued to lag despite the surge in futures trading volume. The meme coin continues to mirror Bitcoin’s price action, with the flagship crypto currently struggling to climb above $90,000. The DOGE price has also lagged due to the disappointing launch of the Dogecoin ETFs. SoSo Value data shows that the funds continue to fail to log net inflows, recording zero flows over the last eight trading days. The trading volume for these funds has also been low during this period. What’s Next For The DOGE Price? In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that a reclaim of $0.138 for the DOGE price on the 3-day to 1-week close would put it back above the macro .382 and the 200-week SMA. The analyst noted that this would be a major positive and likely align with the Bitcoin price reclaiming the $88,000 to $91,000 zone, which needs to happen. Kevin Capital further revealed that in the meantime, the DOGE price continues to trade around this “DCA” zone. Analyzing the 2-week chart, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin looks to be approaching the end of the pre-surge phase. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could still rally to $6 when the parabolic surge begins.

Price action has slowed, and the chart now shows XRP pressing directly against its trend ribbon, a zone that has defined major cycle shifts in the past. While the signal does not predict outcomes, it has a track record that demands attention. Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) highlighted this setup using XRP’s monthly chart. He pointed to a structural signal that has historically marked the transition from support to sustained downside. That context matters now because XRP trades near $1.92, while hovering on the same indicator that preceded deep drawdowns in the past. On $XRP ’s monthly chart, losing the trend ribbon has historically marked the shift into full bearish momentum. In 2018 and 2022, the moment XRP lost the monthly trend ribbon, it wasn’t just a pullback — it confirmed a broader bearish trend, followed by –65% and –54% downside… pic.twitter.com/9G3GCuxrnZ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 22, 2025 What the Monthly Trend Ribbon Has Signaled Before The trend ribbon acts as a long-term momentum filter on higher timeframes. When price holds above it, XRP has historically remained in a supported trend. When the price loses it on a monthly close, selling pressure tends to accelerate. Steph Is Crypto pointed to two prior cases. In 2018, XRP lost the monthly ribbon and later declined by about 65%. In 2022, a similar loss preceded a 54% drop. These were not brief pullbacks. Each move confirmed a bearish phase that lasted months. Applying those same drawdowns to current would send XRP far below key support levels . A 54% decline from $1.92 would place XRP near $0.88. A 65% move would push the price closer to $0.67. These levels sit well below the current market structure and would represent a full trend reset rather than a routine correction. Why This Signal Carries Weight Now Higher timeframes reduce noise . They compress sentiment into longer cycles. Steph Is Crypto emphasized that prior ribbon losses aligned with confirmed bearish momentum rather than false breaks. That history does not guarantee repetition, but it sets expectations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A confirmed monthly close below the ribbon would place XRP back into a risk zone defined by its own past behavior. Traders tend to react decisively to such shifts. That reaction has previously amplified downside moves. The Bullish Counterweight to the Historical Pattern The current cycle carries variables that did not exist in 2018 or 2022. XRP now trades in an environment shaped by regulatory clarity and institutional access. Products like spot XRP ETFs have increased the asset’s institutional appeal, and these factors can change how technical signals resolve. Steph Is Crypto’s analysis highlights the risk, but the chart shows a warning, not a verdict. Other analysts have shared bullish expectations for XRP , and its performance at the start of 2026 could determine what to expect.

The exchange captured the highest spot trading market share on December 22, 2025, surpassing industry peers with over $9.2 billion in 24-hour spot trading volume. Offering spot, derivatives, TradFi products, and tokenized equities, payment and settlement, wealth management services, P2P, and on-chain yield products and services, Bybit has established itself as a Traders’ House consolidating all trading needs into one intuitive platform.

The new achievement further underscores Bybit’s robust liquidity infrastructure and its capacity to efficiently handle high-volume trading activity during periods of heightened market interest. Bybit Spot’s latest accolade was driven by exceptional trading activity in NIGHT/USDT , which emerged as the hottest trading pair on the platform. According to data from CoinMarketCap (CMC) on December 22, Bybit dominated the peak of NIGHT’s trading frenzy, commanding more than 77% of NIGHT’s network-wide trading activity, or $7.6 billion out of $9.2 billion in total market liquidity for NIGHT in 24 hours. Data from CoinGecko from the same period corroborates the exchange’s performance and lion’s share of NIGHT trading volumes. Bybit’s 24-hour spot trading volume exceeded $9.2 billion, up by 97.6%, with the NIGHT/USDT trading pair accounting for over 80% of Bybit’s spot trading volume during the same period. “This achievement reflects both Bybit’s capacity to handle significant trading volumes and our commitment to help traders capture high-potential opportunities in the crypto space,” said Emily Bao, Head of Spot at Bybit . “By providing top-notch liquidity and dependable infrastructure for emerging assets like NIGHT, Bybit stands ready to support our users in capitalizing on market opportunities while maintaining the execution quality and reliability they expect from us,” she said.

Seven suspects have been charged with conspiracy to commit robbery following what the authorities call a meticulously planned theft where they snatched four suitcases containing cash. The operation lasted under thirty seconds last Thursday in the Sheung Wan financial district. The remaining eight suspects have been released on bail and are required to report to the police in late January. Crypto robbers operated in broad daylight According to local reports, the incident occurred at around 9 am on December 18 when two employees of a Japanese company specializing in cryptocurrency and luxury goods arrived at a currency exchange shop on Wing Lok Street. The pair had reportedly traveled from Japan to convert the substantial cash sum into cryptocurrency and Hong Kong dollars. Three assailants jumped out of a private car as the employees arrived, with one brandishing a butcher knife before seizing the four suitcases and fleeing the scene. The robbers abandoned their initial getaway vehicle on a nearby street and transferred the stolen cash to a second seven-seater vehicle, which was later discovered as well. Neither of the victims was injured in the assault. Hong Kong credits AI system for arrests after manhunt Police arrested 11 men and four women, aged between 24 and 69, all Hong Kong residents. Hong Kong police authorities believe that they have captured the mastermind behind the operation, along with those who carried out the heist directly. It also appears that others who conducted surveillance before and during the heist and provided vehicles for the getaway have been apprehended. Most of the suspects claimed to be unemployed or casual construction workers, with some having known ties to organized crime groups. The pace of arrests was credited to the government’s SmartView closed-circuit television program. Police said they were able to arrest 15 people within four days thanks to the AI-enabled system, which now encompasses 4,500 cameras across the city, with an additional 5,000 cameras from other departments integrated into the network. The police have reportedly recovered clothing worn during the robbery, masks, and the butcher knife used in the attack. Heists are getting more sophisticated The robbery echoes another audacious theft in September when 13 people were arrested after 10 robbers stormed a gold workshop in Hung Hom, making off with HK$59 million worth of gold bars, bricks, and powder, all of which was worth around $7.6 million as of the time of the incident. In that case, police managed to recover all of the stolen gold. The latest incident has prompted questions about how the robbers obtained advance intelligence about the cash exchange. Investigators are examining whether there was an information leak that enabled the gang to position themselves precisely when the victims arrived with the substantial sum. Hong Kong’s position as a major financial center with no foreign exchange controls makes it an attractive location for currency exchange businesses, especially for cryptocurrency operations requiring large cash conversions. This year, the special administrative region passed a stablecoin law, called the Stablecoin Ordinance, which came into effect on August 1. The city’s Sheung Wan district, where the robbery occurred, is home to numerous money exchangers serving both local and international clients. Authorities have not ruled out further arrests as the investigation continues.

In a press release shared with CryptoNews, the firm claims these latest launches position Amplify as a first mover in both the stablecoin and tokenization ETF categories, as adoption of blockchain-based financial infrastructure speeds up. STBQ Targets the Expanding Stablecoin Economy The Amplify Stablecoin Technology ETF is designed to provide targeted exposure to equities and digital assets that underpin the stablecoin ecosystem. Stablecoins—digital assets engineered to maintain price stability relative to fiat currencies—now facilitate more than $9 trillion in annual transaction volume, according to industry estimates. Analysts project the market could expand from roughly $300 billion today to more than $3.7 trillion by 2030 as use cases broaden across payments, trading, and settlement. STBQ focuses on companies and crypto-linked assets generating meaningful revenue from payments technology, digital asset infrastructure, and trading platforms. The fund seeks investment results that generally correspond, before fees and expenses, to the performance of the MarketVector Stablecoin Technology Index (MVSTBQ). At each rebalance, between 25% and 50% of the portfolio may be allocated to crypto assets tied to stablecoin and decentralized finance use cases. TKNQ Targets the Tokenization of Real-World Assets The Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF targets companies and digital assets driving the tokenization of real-world assets. Tokenization allows assets such as equities, bonds, and real estate to be represented as blockchain-based tokens, allowing for fractional ownership, faster settlement, and improved transparency. Analysts estimate that tokenized assets could grow from approximately $176 billion today to more than $3.6 trillion by 2030, driven by increasing institutional adoption and regulatory progress. TKNQ invests across tokenization platforms, blockchain infrastructure providers, exchanges, custodians, brokerages, and financial institutions, advancing real-world asset digitization. The fund seeks to track the MarketVector Tokenization Technology Index (MVTKNQ), with 25% to 50% exposure to qualifying crypto-related assets at the time of rebalance. Regulation and Institutional Momentum Shape the Backdrop The launch of STBQ and TKNQ comes during growing regulatory clarity for digital finance infrastructure. In the United States and Europe, evolving frameworks are increasingly positioning stablecoins and tokenization as compliant components of modern financial systems. This shift has encouraged deeper institutional participation, particularly in payments, settlement, and capital markets infrastructure, said the firm. Exec Perspective and Broader ETF Strategy “Amplify has been committed to digital finance innovation for over eight years,” said Christian Magoon, chief executive officer of Amplify ETFs. “Stablecoins and tokenization are becoming important components of modern financial infrastructure, and with STBQ and TKNQ, we’re continuing our work to deliver ETF solutions that help investors access these advancing areas of the market,” Magoon added. Amplify Launches XRP-Based Option Income ETF In November, Amplify ETFs introduced the first XRP-based option income exchange-traded fund, the Amplify XRP 3% Monthly Premium Income ETF (XRPM).

The updates focus on supporting sustained performance during periods of increased activity while maintaining predictable system behavior across distributed environments. Rather than a single-point expansion, the initiative reflects an incremental approach to platform engineering, emphasizing reliability, scalability, and controlled system response as usage patterns continue to evolve. Enhancing Operational Consistency Under Variable Demand The recent improvements address operational conditions commonly observed during elevated usage periods, including concurrent access across multiple trading modules and increased transaction processing requirements. By adjusting internal service coordination and workload distribution mechanisms, the platform is better positioned to maintain stable response characteristics under variable demand. These refinements are intended to reduce performance volatility and support smoother system behavior during high-activity intervals without relying on short-term capacity scaling alone. Engineering Focus on Resilience and Continuity In parallel, PULSESUN Trading Center has strengthened its internal resilience framework by refining redundancy structures and service recovery logic. Enhanced monitoring processes and automated safeguards help ensure that localized disruptions can be isolated without affecting broader platform availability. This approach supports continuous operation and aligns with the platform’s emphasis on maintaining dependable access for professional and institutional users. Infrastructure Development Within a Structured Operating Framework PULSESUN Trading Center continues to develop its technical systems within a compliance-aware operating model. The platform maintains a U.S. Money Services Business (MSB) registration, and infrastructure decisions are guided by internal risk management standards and regulatory considerations relevant to registered financial service providers. By integrating operational discipline with technical development, the platform seeks to balance growth with system governance and long-term maintainability. Ongoing Platform Engineering Strategy According to PULSESUN Trading Center, the latest round of improvements forms part of a broader engineering roadmap focused on sustainable platform development. Future efforts will continue to refine backend coordination, system observability, and operational flexibility as market conditions and user requirements change. https://youtu.be/GIVWbZdyaDg About PULSESUN Trading Center PULSESUN Trading Center is a global digital asset trading platform focused on operational reliability, scalable infrastructure, and professional-grade system design.

According to the model, all three assets could see extreme volatility, with sharp moves possible to the upside or downside before year-end, based on macro, fundamental, and technical variance . Below is a summary of DeepSeek’s evaluation, offering investors projected price paths for XRP, BTC, and SOL going into 2026. XRP: Deepseek AI Projects $3.50 to $5.00 Bull Case DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Ripple’s XRP going into 2026 targets $3.50 to $5.00. The thesis assumes regulatory clarity post-SEC case, rising adoption of Ripple’s ODL in cross-border payments, and integration into CBDC projects could drive XRP over 80% toward the $3–$5 range . Source: Deepseek This scenario requires a favorable macro environment in which the Fed stimulates the economy, and XRP regains approximately 5% market dominance in the next cycle. The bear case, however, targets $0.35 to $0.60 . Source: TradingView This would materialize if continued regulatory pressure, slow ODL adoption, and competition from stablecoins and CBDCs limit XRP’s cross-border market share. In a stagnant or bearish macro climate, Deepseek AI sees XRP trading sideways to revisit its 2024 lows in the $0.35–$0.60 range. Bitcoin: Deepseek Targets $180,000 to $250,000 Bull Run Despite Current Struggles DeepSeek’s algorithm projects a bull case target of $180,000 to $250,000 for Bitcoin(BTC) , despite the leading cryptocurrency being down over 30% from its highs and struggling to overcome the $90,000 resistance level. While ambitious, the Chinese AI model maintains that its $250,000 upside target remains plausible in early 2026, particularly if the U.S. fulfils its promise to become the crypto capital of the world. However, the possibility of a prolonged bear market looms, with DeepSeek targeting the $56,000 to $70,000 range for the market bottom in that scenario. This max pain would materialize if broader crypto adoption stalls, ETF inflows plateau, and macro conditions tighten with higher-for-longer rates. Solana: Deepseek AI sees 150% Upside Potential for SOL Launched in 2020, Solana(SOL) introduced Proof-of-History to achieve breakthrough scalability and speed. It survived the 2022 FTX collapse and rebounded strongly, becoming a leading blockchain for consumer crypto, hosting top meme coins, high-speed DeFi, and institutional integrations like Visa’s USDC pilot. Current prices around $125 sit well below early-2024 highs due to market-wide corrections and profit-taking, positioning SOL as a compelling investment going into 2026. According to DeepSeek AI analysis, Solana can surge over 150% from current levels to target $400 to $600 in 2026. However, DeepSeek’s model observed that Solana’s tokenomics, designed with built-in inflation, could affect SOL token performance. If network instability recurs or developer activity migrates to competing chains, SOL could underperform despite a bullish macro environment. In a muted altcoin cycle, China’s DeepSeek model projects a bear case drop toward $50–$80 for Solana come 2026. Maxi Doge Presale Offers Early-Stage Alternative While DeepSeek’s analysis focuses on major crypto assets, early-stage presale projects often offer greater upside potential. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has raised nearly $4.4 million as it positions itself as a potential successor to Dogecoin. Issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, MAXI stands to benefit from Ethereum’s deep liquidity and developer access compared to Dogecoin’s slow and ghost proof-of-work architecture. The ongoing presale offers staking rewards of up to 71% APY. MAXI is currently priced at $0.0002745 , with automatic price increases scheduled for future stages.

The whale wallet had accumulated the position gradually between Sept. 12 and Nov. 4. It sourced tokens primarily from Binance at an average price of around $0.00513 per token. At that time, PUMP was riding a wave of meme coin push. At the time of the dump, its stash was worth about $7.3 million. The estimated acquisition cost stood at more than $19.5 million. This implies a realized loss of above $12 million, or roughly 62%. The timing adds to the bearish signal. PUMP price has dropped by almost 12% in the last 24 hours. The token has turned out to be one of the worst-performing cryptos among the top 100. PUMP is trading at an average price of $0.00167 at the press time. What a brutal loss! Whale 3QB9kH accumulated 3.806B $PUMP ($19.53M) from #Binance between Sep 12 and Nov 4 at an average price of $0.00513. 3 days ago, he deposited all 3.806B $PUMP ($7.3M) into #FalconX to sell, incurring a total loss of over $12M(-62%).… pic.twitter.com/XlJj2HOeiD — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 23, 2025 ENA whale exit adds to risk signs And this isn’t an isolated event, as around the same time, another large wallet moved its entire Ethena (ENA) position. More than 16 million ENA tokens were moved into Coinbase Prime after holding for almost a year. That position was once worth north of $18 million. Meanwhile, at the time of dumping, the stash was worth barely $3.5 million. It looks like a different token, but the same story. ENA price has dropped by more than 67% in the last 90 days. It is trading at an average price of $0.195 at the press time. The global crypto market cap slumped by more than 3% in the last 24 hours to remain below $3 trillion. Bitcoin price remained under selling pressure, posting a loss of 2.5% in the same time. BTC is trading at an average price of $87,760 at the press time. The meme cryptos were hit even harder. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE have been bleeding throughout the season. CoinMarketCap data shows that Audiera (BEAT) is the biggest loser of the day among the top 100 cryptos. BEAT price dropped by 34% in the last 24 hours. Midnight (NIGHT) is the second most hit token in that category. It is down by 27% in the same period. Zoom out and the pattern seems clear. Capital is bleeding out of speculative corners first. Memecoins, high-FDV DeFi, narrative-heavy trades, they’re all struggling to find real buyers once momentum dies.

With a focus on token-gated access, real-time payouts, and support for diverse content categories, the anticipated platform aims to address longstanding challenges in monetization, moderation, and community engagement. Limitations Are Part of the Design of Traditional Streaming Platforms Many mainstream streaming services continue to impose limitations on content types, revenue structures, and user autonomy. These often include: Moderation policies that restrict or remove specific content categories Revenue models that favor platforms over creators Delayed or complex payout systems A lack of blockchain-native or token-based engagement mechanisms These conditions have prompted the emergence of decentralized alternatives designed to enable direct creator-to-community interaction and transparent revenue models. SolStake Pioneered the Shift to Decentralized Monetization SolStake is among the better-known decentralized streaming platforms, offering Solana-native features such as token-gated access, live tipping, and on-chain payouts. Scheduled to launch in early 2026, SolStake has attracted early interest for supporting content such as iGaming and adult streams—areas often restricted on centralized platforms. SolStake’s infrastructure allows creators to retain control over their wallets and content while earning through SOL and affiliated tokens. However, the demand for more expansive infrastructure and enhanced compliance features has opened the door for additional platforms to enter the space. The Decentralized Streaming Framework is Due for an Expansion A newly developed streaming platform aims to extend the decentralization model introduced by SolStake. Built by a team with experience in decentralized finance and iGaming, users are getting excited by early reports of a new, disruptive platform introducing novel core features such as : Expanded Content Categories: Supports iGaming, adult entertainment, and other formats not typically accommodated on traditional services. Instant On-Chain Payments: Facilitates immediate crypto payouts without intermediary delays. Token-Gated Communities: Allows creators to build tiered-access environments with exclusive content for token holders. Creator-Focused Revenue Structures: Offers high payout percentages and wallet-level control. Native iGaming Support: Enables integrated, interactive gambling streams with viewer engagement elements. The New and Improved Face of Infrastructure and Compliance Touted as an upgrade on SolStake and a wholesale revamp of centralized platforms, the new entrant covers mechanisms for audience verification and secure access, particularly relevant for adult and gambling-related content. On top of those upgrades, the new platform offers: Cross-Platform Compatibility: Streamlined onboarding and use across both desktop and mobile devices Scalable Backend: Designed to support a large number of concurrent viewers and streams Open Development Ecosystem: Encourages community contributions, third-party tools, and integrations Creators and Fans Are Set for a Big 2026 The rise of platforms like Kick has illustrated demand for streaming environments with relaxed moderation and enhanced revenue opportunities. However, platforms not built with decentralized financial frameworks often encounter difficulties scaling or integrating new monetization methods. By contrast, the newly introduced platform uses blockchain infrastructure to enable transparent, creator-owned revenue systems and modular community governance. With SolStake preparing for launch in 2026, the broader sector is closely monitoring how decentralized platforms will shape the next wave of digital content distribution. This new entrant into the streaming and iGaming sector brings additional capabilities and infrastructure designed to support a broader range of creators and audiences in compliance-conscious environments.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-23 15:55:08

In a bold two-day maneuver, London-based investment firm Fasanara Capital acquired a staggering 6,569 Ethereum (ETH). This isn’t just a simple buy-and-hold. Data from Lookonchain reveals a sophisticated DeFi strategy at play, sparking intense discussion about institutional tactics and market sentiment. Let’s break down what this Fasanara Capital ETH purchase truly means for the ecosystem. What Does Fasanara Capital’s Massive ETH Move Signal? When a major institutional player makes a move of this scale, it demands attention. Fasanara Capital didn’t just buy ETH; they deployed it strategically into the Morpho lending protocol. There, they used their newly acquired Ethereum as collateral to borrow 13 million USDC. This action is a classic DeFi leveraging strategy. It suggests the firm is potentially recycling capital to fund even more ETH acquisitions, amplifying their position without committing additional fiat capital upfront. This approach highlights a mature, calculated entry into the digital asset space. It’s not speculative frenzy; it’s strategic accumulation. The move demonstrates deep familiarity with decentralized finance tools, positioning Fasanara not just as an investor, but as an active participant in the Ethereum economy. Decoding the Strategy: Why Use Morpho and Borrow USDC? To understand the impact of the Fasanara Capital ETH purchase , we must look at the mechanics. By depositing ETH into Morpho and borrowing stablecoins, the firm achieves several objectives: Maintaining Exposure: They keep their ETH holdings, benefiting from any potential future price appreciation. Generating Liquidity: The borrowed USDC provides immediate capital that can be redeployed. Cost-Efficiency: This can be a lower-cost method to increase buying power compared to traditional financing. The choice of Morpho is also significant. As a lending protocol that optimizes rates between lenders and borrowers, it indicates a focus on capital efficiency. This entire operation is a masterclass in using DeFi primitives for sophisticated treasury management. What Are the Broader Implications for Ethereum and Crypto Markets? This transaction is a substantial data point for market analysts. A single entity accumulating over 6,500 ETH in a short timeframe reduces available supply on exchanges, which can impact market dynamics. More importantly, it serves as a powerful sentiment indicator. Institutional players like Fasanara Capital conduct extensive due diligence. Their commitment suggests a strong, research-backed belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Furthermore, their comfort with complex DeFi interactions validates the entire Ethereum application layer. It signals that institutional capital is becoming increasingly adept at navigating the decentralized landscape, moving beyond simple spot purchases on centralized exchanges. Key Takeaways from This Institutional Crypto Play The Fasanara Capital ETH purchase offers clear lessons for observers and participants alike: Institutional Sophistication is Growing: Moves are no longer just about buying Bitcoin. They involve layered strategies within the DeFi ecosystem. Ethereum as Collateral: ETH’s role as premier collateral asset in DeFi is being embraced by traditional finance. Strategy Over Speculation: This was a calculated financial engineering move, not a mere bet on price. In conclusion, Fasanara Capital’s recent activity is a compelling narrative of institutional adoption evolving into institutional integration. It showcases a future where traditional investment firms seamlessly utilize decentralized protocols to execute complex strategies. This Fasanara Capital ETH purchase and subsequent leveraging is more than a trade; it’s a blueprint for how sophisticated capital will interact with the digital asset economy moving forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Fasanara Capital? Fasanara Capital is a London-based asset management firm specializing in fintech and credit investments. They have shown increasing interest in the digital asset space, making them a notable institutional player in crypto. Why is borrowing USDC after buying ETH significant? Borrowing USDC against ETH collateral allows the firm to access liquid capital without selling their ETH. This “leveraging” strategy suggests they may use the borrowed funds to purchase more assets, effectively increasing their market exposure and potential returns. What is the Morpho protocol? Morpho is a decentralized lending protocol built on Ethereum that optimizes interest rates by matching peer-to-peer loans within larger liquidity pools like Aave or Compound. It’s known for offering potentially better rates to both lenders and borrowers. Does this large purchase guarantee ETH’s price will rise? Not necessarily. While large accumulations can reduce sell-side pressure and signal confidence, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by a vast array of factors including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. This is a strong bullish signal, but not a guarantee. What does this mean for everyday crypto investors? It highlights the growing sophistication and long-term planning of major investors entering the space. For everyday investors, it reinforces the importance of understanding not just what assets are being bought, but how they are being used within the broader DeFi ecosystem. Is this type of leveraged strategy common in crypto? Yes, using crypto assets as collateral to borrow stablecoins for further investment or spending is a common practice in DeFi, often referred to as “leveraging up” or using a “recursive strategy.” However, it carries risks if the value of the collateral asset falls significantly.

This stage normally arrives when the infrastructure is in its final stages and supply is already getting tighter. Price often reacts later. The trend is beginning to take shape around a DeFi crypto with less than $0.1, but has some indications of breaking into a significantly bigger growth stage. This project has not been dependent on hype but it has been through constructing first. Consequently, analysts are working towards higher upside capitalization which is pegged on usage, rather than speculation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Development and Vision Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum based DeFi crypto, which consists of lending and borrowing. On a high level, the protocol will enable users to provide assets and collect yield and borrowers access liquidity by pledging assets. The system is designed in terms of coherent regulations, direction of interests and forensible results. The MUTM token has gone through gradual price increment presales in various structured phases. The per unit presently is selling at $0.035 in presale which is a 2.5x jump from initial phase 1 price of $0.01. Increase in funding has been gradual and the holders have increased to over 18,600 participants. This is a trend that is usually regarded as accumulation rather than short term trading by the analysts. The interesting part is that a large proportion of the entire pre-sale allotment is already shared. This implies that at this point new entrants are getting into a phase where the supply is highly constrained compared to where it used to be at the beginning of the process. Demand driven Revenue, V1 Launch and mtTokens A major point in analyst models is the upcoming V1 launch . After the protocol goes live, the chain becomes active in terms of lending and borrowing. This is what typically happens when the DeFi crypto valuation changes to the usage based pricing instead of the idea based pricing. One of the important parts of the design is mtTokens. Once users add their assets, they get mtTokens which reflect their lending pool rank. These mtTokens increase in proportion to the interest paid by borrowers. This forms a rationale to hold, as the yield builds up as time goes by. A model of buy and distribute is also used in Mutuum Finance. A fraction of protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM tokens in the market and allocate it to the holder of the mtTokens. This connection, as analysts note, places the protocol usage directly in relation to token demand. According to conservative post-V1 adoption, other analysts describe a price situation in which MUTM may increase by 4x-5x of its current value with the increased borrowing spurred by the transitional rate. Layer 2 and Oracle Expansion In addition to V1, the roadmap contains a native borrower-backed stablecoin. Stable assets can also see their use rise day by day due to the reduced volatility risk of the assets to the lender as well as the borrower. This may cause an increase in the volume of transactions on the protocol. There will also be expansion Layer 2. With reduced charges and quick deals, lending business will become more available to less prolific customers. Analysts tend to consider Layer 2 support as one of the successive moves to scale DeFi protocols beyond their first adopters. Oracles are also important. Valid price feeds are required to control the loan to value ratios and liquidations. Credible oracles assist in hedging lenders and stabilising the system during market fluctuations. Some analysts describe an even more bullish case of over the upside, guaranteed by stablecoin use, Layer 2 support and trustworthy oracle information together. MUTM could achieve a higher growth of 600-800% in the long term period in this model since the increment would not be linked with short term momentum. Security, Bug Bounty and On Chain Activity Security has not been considered as an afterthought. Mutuum Finance has already had a CertiK scan report with a score of good and is being fully reviewed by Halborn. A bug bounty of $50,000 USD is one more added protection that encourages outsourcing testing. The other board monitored by the analysts is the 24 hour leaderboard. This is not a one time affair but a continuous activity. Demand is also increased with card payment support and the new users can easily enter the ecosystem. Combined with this, it is why others refer to MUTM as a new crypto with one of the more obvious upside profiles below $0.1. The infrastructure is almost ready, supply is already constrained, and usage is shortly to start, which analysts are detecting an arrangement in which price can immediately spur ahead once utility is launched.

According to a Dec. 22 company disclosure, BitMine’s treasury now stands at about 4.066 million ETH, a holding that the firm says is part of a multi-quarter accumulation plan. BitMine Inches Past 4 Million Reports have disclosed that the firm added nearly 98,850 ETH in a single week, a wave of purchases that pushed the total past the 4 million threshold. Market watchers say those buys were executed across several transactions and through both open market and OTC channels. The company also reported combined assets—crypto plus cash and other investments—of roughly $13 billion, with the ETH stake accounting for the bulk of that value. It seems that Tom Lee( @fundstrat )’s #Bitmine just bought another 13,412 $ETH ($40.61M). https://t.co/m3WT8Jwh6x pic.twitter.com/DCpdDNp0U9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 22, 2025 Recent Buys And Treasury Value Based on on-chain alerts, BitMine made another discrete buy of 13,410 ETH, a purchase that on public trackers was valued close to $41 million. Earlier rounds this month included larger accumulations, which some outlets aggregated as roughly $300 million in fresh ETH added over several days. Taken together, the recent activity shows a rapid pace of accumulation compared with the firm’s earlier disclosures. Analysts note that a corporate buyer of this scale can take a meaningful chunk of available sell-side inventory off the market, especially when moves are concentrated over a short period. BitMine provided its latest holdings update for Dec 22th, 2025: $13.2 billion in total crypto + “moonshots”:-4,066,062 ETH at $2,991 per ETH ( @coinbase )– 193 Bitcoin (BTC)– $32 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) (“moonshots”) and– total cash of $1.0 billion.… — Bitmine (NYSE-BMNR) $ETH (@BitMNR) December 22, 2025 Foreign exchange and crypto trackers flagged the timing of purchases against recent price dips, suggesting BitMine bought while ETH traded below certain recent highs. Some traders interpreted the buys as a sign of long-term conviction, while others warned about short-term volatility if sales reverse. Market Reaction And Next Steps Shares of BitMine and related crypto stocks showed active trading after the disclosures, and institutional interest was visible: asset managers have been reported to add positions in public companies tied to crypto treasuries in recent trading notices. Company filings and investor updates indicate BitMine plans to continue its ETH accumulation toward a stated target that management has framed as a sizable portion of total supply. Other Details Reported On-chain intelligence firms and public filings are the main sources of the totals published this week. Lookonchain and similar services logged the individual transfers and flagged the wallet activity linked to BitMine, which helps independent trackers reconcile the flows with the company’s own statements.

The blockchain analytics platform said that Sun’s locked WLFI tokens have lost around $60 million in value over the past three months. WLFI Launch Controversy Bubblemaps’ latest comment has renewed attention on the controversy that surrounded WLFI’s launch back in September, when the project was hit by confusion, supply disputes, and allegations of insider manipulation that largely affected retail investors. At the center of the dispute was Justin Sun, whose wallets were frozen by WLFI shortly after launch following what the team described as unusual on-chain activity that raised concerns about insider selling. When WLFI launched, the distribution of tokens immediately became a point of contention. The community allocation was initially expected to be 5%, but only 4% of tokens actually went live because not all users utilized the required lockbox mechanism. At the same time, liquidity and marketing allocations, originally reported at 1.6%, were later clarified to total about 2.8% of supply. This pushed the effective circulating supply closer to 6.8%. Other large allocations, including a 10% ecosystem fund and a 7.8% tranche reserved for Alt5 Sigma, were unlocked but not subject to vesting. Some analysts said that this created an illusion of available supply that complicated price discovery. WLFI-Justin Sun Fallout Sun held roughly 3% of WLFI’s total supply, of which only 20% was unlocked at launch. Sun publicly stated that he would not sell his tokens and said he supported WLFI’s long-term vision. Despite this, WLFI debuted at $0.20 with a market capitalization of about $1 billion, while trading volumes surged into the billions. The token’s price then declined steadily, and on-chain analysts noted that the price movements appeared more mechanical than organic. According to WeRate co-founder Quinten Francois, part of the volatility may have come from exchanges offloading liquidity allocations, while Sun was allegedly involved in activity linked to HTX, including offering users high yields to deposit WLFI. Blockchain experts reported that around $9 million worth of WLFI was moved early on from addresses linked to Sun through HTX and Binance. Following these transfers, WLFI froze Sun’s wallet using its “guardianSetBlacklistStatus” function. The freeze sparked debate within the community. Some praised the move as a safeguard against potential repeat behavior. Sun, however, publicly appealed for his tokens to be unfrozen.

XRP, once viewed primarily as an altcoin driven by speculation, is now emerging as a credible bridge between digital assets and traditional finance. This shift has drawn attention from analysts and investors who see the token’s growing presence in regulated investment vehicles as a sign of structural maturation. The reception of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offers a window into this transformation and highlights why market participants are increasingly optimistic about its long-term potential. According to MOLT MEDIA’s X post, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan emphasized that XRP ETFs have been “better received than Ethereum was.” Speaking alongside Ripple CTO David Schwartz, Hougan noted that sustained inflows into XRP ETFs reflect not just temporary trading interest but deeper structural demand. This observation underscores how regulated instruments can channel institutional capital into assets previously considered niche or speculative. Wall Street understands #XRP – that is why XRP ETFs have been “Better Received than Ethereum was.” pic.twitter.com/e7gA7p2A43 — MOLT MEDIA (@MoltMoney) December 22, 2025 Institutional Confidence in XRP Unlike earlier crypto ETFs, which relied heavily on speculative interest, XRP’s regulated funds have attracted consistent institutional participation. Hougan’s assessment points to a market increasingly confident in XRP’s utility and regulatory compliance. This is reinforced by the steady inflows into ETFs, suggesting that investors perceive XRP as a long-term infrastructure asset rather than a short-term speculative vehicle. Institutional appetite is also bolstered by Ripple’s continued emphasis on real-world use cases, particularly in cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. By addressing inefficiencies in the traditional financial system, XRP demonstrates tangible value that resonates with large-scale investors seeking assets with practical utility and growth potential. ETF Inflows Signal Structural Demand XRP’s ETF inflows provide more than just liquidity—they indicate a structural market trend. These inflows persisted during periods of broader crypto market weakness. This highlights demand that is decoupled from typical retail trading cycles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hougan and other industry observers suggest that this pattern reflects a maturation of the market, where long-term capital is increasingly distinguishing between foundational assets and purely speculative tokens. Historical comparisons with Ethereum ETFs reveal a notable contrast. Ethereum’s initial ETFs faced slower adoption and narrower engagement from institutional players. XRP, in contrast, has benefitted from clear regulatory frameworks and strategic market positioning, allowing it to capture investor confidence more quickly and at scale. Liquidity and Market Impact Beyond inflows, XRP ETFs deepen overall market liquidity, facilitating smoother price discovery and reducing volatility associated with concentrated retail trading. By allowing institutional investors to participate via regulated instruments, XRP strengthens the ecosystem’s structural integrity and creates a feedback loop of credibility and adoption. This is particularly relevant in volatile market conditions, where institutional stability can provide a counterbalance to retail sentiment swings. Strategic Implications for Investors Hougan’s commentary highlights a broader shift in how Wall Street views digital assets . XRP’s ETF performance demonstrates that investors are now prioritizing compliance, utility, and institutional accessibility. For market participants, this evolution signals a turning point: XRP is no longer simply a speculative altcoin but a regulated, functional asset positioned for sustained growth. As XRP continues to integrate into mainstream financial infrastructure, ETFs play a pivotal role in bridging traditional investment strategies with blockchain technology. The reception of these funds not only reflects confidence but also underscores the token’s emerging status as a credible, long-term investment vehicle.
