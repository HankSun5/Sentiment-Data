Imagine a company, a significant player in the digital gold rush, suddenly facing the prospect of being removed from one of the world’s most prestigious stock exchanges. This isn’t just a minor hiccup; it’s a critical juncture that could redefine the future trajectory of Argo Blockchain and set a precedent for other publicly traded crypto entities. What’s Behind Argo Blockchain ‘s Nasdaq Delisting Scare? The core of this unsettling development for Argo Blockchain stems from a fundamental Nasdaq listing requirement: maintaining a minimum bid price of $1 per share. According to reports from The Block, the company received an initial warning letter back in January, signaling its non-compliance with this crucial rule. Nasdaq typically grants a 180-day grace period for companies to regain compliance. Unfortunately for Argo Blockchain , despite this generous window, its stock failed to recover above the $1 threshold consistently. This persistent underperformance ultimately led Nasdaq to initiate discussions about delisting. For publicly traded companies, maintaining listing compliance is paramount. It’s not merely a bureaucratic formality; it directly impacts investor confidence, liquidity, and the company’s ability to raise capital. When a stock consistently trades below a certain price point, it can signal underlying financial instability or a lack of market interest, prompting exchanges to step in to protect investors and maintain market integrity. The Stakes Are High: Why a Nasdaq Delisting Matters for Argo Blockchain A potential delisting from Nasdaq carries significant ramifications for Argo Blockchain . It’s not just about losing a prestigious ticker symbol; it affects the very fabric of the company’s public market presence. Let’s break down why this is such a critical challenge: Reduced Visibility and Prestige: Nasdaq is a global stage, offering immense visibility and credibility. Delisting means losing this prominent platform, potentially diminishing investor awareness and interest. Liquidity Concerns: Trading on an over-the-counter (OTC) market, which is often the next step for delisted stocks, typically results in significantly lower trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads. This makes it harder for investors to buy or sell shares, impacting liquidity. Access to Capital: Being listed on a major exchange often makes it easier for companies to raise capital through equity offerings. Delisting can complicate future fundraising efforts, potentially limiting growth opportunities for Argo Blockchain . Investor Confidence: News of delisting can trigger a loss of confidence among current and prospective investors, leading to further sell-offs and a downward spiral in share price. This situation highlights the precarious balance that many cryptocurrency companies, particularly those in the capital-intensive mining sector, must maintain between operational costs, market conditions, and regulatory compliance. Navigating the Storm: Argo Blockchain ‘s Strategy In response to Nasdaq’s decision, Argo Blockchain has made its intentions clear: it plans to formally request a hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. This is a standard procedure that allows a company to present its case, explain its plans for regaining compliance, and argue against the delisting. Crucially, by requesting this hearing, any delisting action is typically stayed or postponed until the hearing process concludes and a decision is rendered. What might Argo Blockchain present at such a hearing? They would likely outline a strategic plan to boost their share price, which could involve: Operational Improvements: Highlighting efficiencies in their mining operations, such as lower energy costs or increased hash rate. Financial Restructuring: Detailing plans to improve their balance sheet, reduce debt, or secure new funding. Market Outlook: Presenting a positive outlook for the crypto market, especially Bitcoin’s price, which directly impacts their revenue. Reverse Stock Split: A common tactic where a company reduces the number of its outstanding shares, proportionally increasing the share price. This is a purely cosmetic fix but can help meet listing requirements. The success of this appeal hinges on Argo Blockchain ‘s ability to convince the panel that they have a credible and actionable plan to regain and sustain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules. Beyond Argo Blockchain : The Broader Crypto Mining Landscape The challenges faced by Argo Blockchain are not isolated incidents; they reflect broader headwinds that have swept across the entire cryptocurrency mining sector. The year 2022, in particular, proved to be brutal for miners. A confluence of factors created a ‘perfect storm’: Plummeting Bitcoin Prices: The significant drop in Bitcoin’s value directly reduced the revenue generated from mining. Soaring Energy Costs: Geopolitical events and inflation led to a sharp increase in electricity prices, which is a miner’s largest operational expense. Increased Network Difficulty: As more miners entered the space during the bull market, the difficulty of mining new blocks increased, requiring more computational power for the same reward. Many mining companies, including those like Core Scientific and Compute North, faced bankruptcy or significant financial distress during this period. While the market has shown signs of recovery, the scars remain, and companies like Argo Blockchain are still navigating the aftermath, trying to find stable ground amidst ongoing market fluctuations and regulatory uncertainties. What Are Nasdaq’s Listing Requirements, Anyway? For those curious about the specifics, Nasdaq, like other major exchanges, has stringent criteria for companies wishing to be listed and remain listed. These requirements are designed to ensure market quality, investor protection, and the integrity of the trading environment. While there are multiple pathways to listing, the common denominator includes: Minimum Bid Price: As seen with Argo Blockchain , a stock must maintain a minimum bid price, typically $1. Shareholder Equity: Companies must meet certain thresholds for shareholder equity. Market Capitalization: A minimum total market value for the company’s outstanding shares. Public Float: A minimum number of publicly held shares and their aggregate market value. Corporate Governance: Adherence to specific corporate governance standards, including independent directors and audit committees. Failure to meet any of these continuous listing standards can trigger a delisting notice, giving companies a chance to rectify the situation before being removed from the exchange. A Glimpse into the Future: What’s Next for Argo Blockchain ? The path forward for Argo Blockchain is uncertain but holds several potential scenarios. The most favorable outcome would be for the company to successfully present its case at the Nasdaq hearing, demonstrate a viable plan to regain compliance, and be granted an extension or a favorable ruling allowing it to remain listed. This would likely involve a strategic move, such as a reverse stock split, if market conditions don’t naturally push the share price above $1. Alternatively, if the hearing panel rules against Argo Blockchain , the company would likely be delisted from Nasdaq. In such a scenario, its shares would typically move to the OTC Markets Group, where they can still be traded, albeit with reduced liquidity and visibility. In more extreme cases, a company might consider going private or exploring other strategic options if public trading becomes too burdensome or unprofitable. For investors, this situation underscores the importance of due diligence, especially in volatile sectors like cryptocurrency mining. Understanding the financial health, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance of a company like Argo Blockchain is crucial before making investment decisions. Final Thoughts: A Pivotal Moment for Argo Blockchain The potential Nasdaq delisting of Argo Blockchain is more than just a headline; it’s a stark reminder of the challenges and rigorous demands placed on publicly traded companies, especially those operating in nascent and highly volatile industries like cryptocurrency. While Argo Blockchain is fighting to retain its coveted Nasdaq listing, its journey serves as a valuable case study for the entire crypto mining sector. The outcome of its hearing will not only shape its own destiny but also offer insights into the resilience and adaptability required for crypto companies to thrive in the mainstream financial world. The next few months will be crucial for Argo Blockchain as it navigates this critical juncture. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary reason for Argo Blockchain ‘s delisting threat from Nasdaq? The primary reason is Argo Blockchain ‘s failure to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share, as required by Nasdaq’s listing rules, for a sustained period after receiving an initial warning. Q2: What happens if Argo Blockchain is delisted from Nasdaq? If delisted, Argo Blockchain ‘s shares would likely move to the over-the-counter (OTC) market, which typically has lower liquidity, less visibility, and fewer regulatory requirements compared to Nasdaq. This can impact investor access and the company’s ability to raise capital. Q3: What is a “180-day grace period” in Nasdaq’s rules? The 180-day grace period is the time given by Nasdaq to a company, like Argo Blockchain , after it receives a non-compliance notice. During this period, the company is expected to regain compliance with the specific listing rule (e.g., the $1 minimum bid price) to avoid delisting. Q4: How does this situation affect Argo Blockchain ‘s investors? Investors may experience reduced liquidity for their shares, potential price volatility, and a decrease in investor confidence. If the company moves to an OTC market, trading may become less accessible or efficient. Q5: What are the next steps for Argo Blockchain ? Argo Blockchain intends to request a hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. This hearing allows them to present their plan for regaining compliance, and any delisting action is stayed until the hearing process concludes. Did you find this article insightful?

Recently, the crypto community was abuzz with news of a monumental USDT transfer : a staggering 396,571,740 USDT, valued at approximately $396 million, moved from the OKX exchange to an unknown wallet. This colossal sum, reported by blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, immediately captured the attention of investors, traders, and analysts alike. What does such a massive movement of stablecoins signify, and what potential implications does it hold for the broader crypto ecosystem? What Exactly Happened with This Colossal USDT Transfer? On [Insert Date of Transaction if known, otherwise state ‘a recent day’], Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracking and analytics platform, flagged an extraordinary transaction. Their report indicated that 396,571,740 Tether (USDT), the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, had been moved from the popular cryptocurrency exchange OKX. The destination? An address classified simply as an ‘unknown wallet.’ To put this into perspective, we are talking about nearly $400 million in digital assets shifting hands in a single transaction. The Sum: A staggering 396,571,740 USDT. The Origin: OKX, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange. The Destination: An unidentifiable, ‘unknown wallet’ address. The Value: Approximately $396 million, a sum that rivals the market capitalization of many smaller altcoins. Such a significant USDT transfer from a centralized exchange often signals a major event, be it an institutional move, an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or a large investor consolidating holdings. Understanding the potential motives behind these ‘whale’ transactions is crucial for deciphering market sentiment and potential future movements. Who Are These ‘Whales’ and Why Do Their Moves Matter? In cryptocurrency parlance, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. These players often possess enough assets to significantly influence market prices through their buying or selling activities. When a crypto whale initiates a massive USDT transfer , it’s akin to a large ship moving in the ocean – it creates waves. Their movements matter for several reasons: Market Impact: While USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, large transfers can still precede significant market activity. For instance, a whale moving USDT onto an exchange might be preparing to buy other cryptocurrencies, potentially driving prices up. Conversely, moving USDT off an exchange could indicate an intention to hold long-term, engage in OTC deals, or even prepare for a large sell-off elsewhere. Liquidity Shifts: Large transfers affect the liquidity available on exchanges. If a substantial amount of USDT is moved off an exchange, it reduces the immediate stablecoin liquidity for trading pairs on that platform. Sentiment Indicator: Whale movements are often seen as an indicator of smart money sentiment. If whales are accumulating, it can be a bullish sign; if they are distributing, it might signal caution. What Are the Potential Reasons Behind Such a Large USDT Transfer? While the exact reasons for this specific USDT transfer remain unknown, based on historical patterns and market dynamics, several plausible scenarios could explain such a colossal movement: Scenario Explanation Potential Implication OTC Deal Settlement A private, off-exchange transaction between two large parties. USDT is often used for settling these large deals to avoid slippage on public exchanges. Neutral to slightly bullish, as it might precede large institutional buying of other assets. Cold Storage Transfer The whale is moving funds from an exchange to a more secure, offline wallet for long-term holding. Generally bullish, indicating an intention to hold rather than sell immediately. Exchange Wallet Rebalancing OKX itself might be rebalancing its hot and cold wallets, moving funds to secure them or manage liquidity. Neutral, a routine operational procedure for exchanges. Preparation for Major Investment The whale might be preparing to deploy this capital into other cryptocurrencies or DeFi protocols. Potentially bullish for the target asset(s). How Does a USDT Transfer Like This Affect Market Sentiment? While a USDT transfer itself doesn’t directly impact the price of USDT (as it’s a stablecoin), the sheer size of this particular transaction can influence broader market sentiment. Large movements of funds, especially from major exchanges, often lead to increased scrutiny and speculation. This can contribute to: Increased Volatility: If the market perceives this transfer as a precursor to significant buying or selling of other assets, it can lead to increased price swings in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Heightened Awareness: It brings attention to the transparency of blockchain transactions and the power of ‘whales’ in the crypto space. Investor Behavior: Some retail investors might try to ‘front-run’ or mimic whale movements, potentially exacerbating market trends. It’s important for individual investors to remember that while tracking whale movements can be insightful, it’s not a foolproof strategy. Markets are complex, and a single transaction, no matter how large, is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. What Can We Learn from Tracking Whale Transactions? The transparency of blockchain technology allows anyone to track these large transactions, offering a unique window into market dynamics. Services like Whale Alert provide valuable data, but interpreting that data requires context and understanding. While a large USDT transfer from an exchange to an unknown wallet doesn’t provide immediate answers, it prompts questions that can lead to deeper market analysis. For the average investor, the key takeaway is to remain informed but not to panic or make rash decisions based solely on a single large transaction. Diversification, risk management, and a long-term investment strategy generally remain the most robust approaches in the volatile crypto market. Conclusion: The Enduring Mystery of the Crypto Whale The $396 million USDT transfer from OKX to an unknown wallet serves as a powerful reminder of the immense capital flowing within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the specific motivations behind this colossal move remain shrouded in mystery, it underscores the significant influence of large holders, or ‘whales,’ on market sentiment and potential future price action. As the digital asset space continues to mature, tracking and understanding these large transactions will remain a vital aspect of market analysis, offering glimpses into the strategies of the biggest players and the underlying health of the blockchain economy. For now, this particular USDT transfer adds another fascinating chapter to the ongoing saga of crypto’s intriguing and often unpredictable landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDT? A1: USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, meaning its value is intended to remain stable at $1. It is widely used in the crypto market for trading, as a store of value, and for cross-exchange transfers due to its stability and liquidity. Q2: What is an ‘unknown wallet’? A2: An ‘unknown wallet’ refers to a cryptocurrency address that has not been publicly identified or linked to a specific individual, exchange, or institution. While the transaction is transparent on the blockchain, the owner of the wallet remains anonymous. Q3: Does a large USDT transfer always mean something significant for the market? A3: Not necessarily. While large transfers often warrant attention and can precede market movements, they can also be part of routine operations like exchange rebalancing, OTC deals, or cold storage transfers that have minimal direct market impact. It’s crucial to consider context. Q4: How can I track large crypto transactions myself? A4: You can use blockchain explorers specific to the cryptocurrency’s network (e.g., Etherscan for Ethereum-based USDT, Tronscan for TRC20 USDT) to view transactions. Services like Whale Alert also aggregate and report significant movements across various blockchains. Q5: Should I adjust my investment strategy based on whale movements? A5: While observing whale movements can provide insights, it’s generally not advisable to base your entire investment strategy on them. Whales have different goals and resources than retail investors. A sound strategy should include diversification, risk management, and alignment with your personal financial goals.

Over the past few months, both retailers and manufacturers have raised concerns that the new tariffs on foreign items will cut their profits unless they pass expenses along. On Tuesday, Procter & Gamble, known for household names like Bounty paper towels and Tide detergent, painted a bleak picture for 2025 as reported by Reuters . In a memo to major chains such as Walmart, P&G explained it plans to raise prices on about a quarter of its U.S. products starting next week, with increases of about 5%. Although equity benchmarks have surged, largely thanks to technology stocks, many staple‑goods companies have lag behind. After the April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, P&G’s share price slid roughly 19%, while Nestlé fell 20%, Kimberly‑Clark dropped 11%, and PepsiCo slipped close to 7%, even as the S&P 500 climbed about 13%. American customers turn away from expensive brands Food and drink makers have seen weak sales because budget‑conscious shoppers are avoiding expensive name brands. Nestlé recently observed that consumers in North America are still hesitant to pay extra at the checkout. Any further mark‑ups could intensify investor concerns over how large household names will balance cost‑conscious buyers with their rising import expenses. “You’re going to see companies like Walmart, Amazon and Best Buy forced to pass price increases to consumers,” said Bill George, former Medtronic chief executive and Harvard Business School fellow. He added, “Main Street has yet to see the fallout from increased tariffs, and they’re going to go higher.” Companies face billions in added costs A Reuters tariff tracker estimated that, between July 16 and 25, companies could collectively incur roughly $7.1 billion to $8.3 billion in additional costs this year. Automakers such as General Motors and Ford have already absorbed billions, while others front‑loaded shipments to lock in pre‑tariff rates and buy time before raising prices. Economists warn that once those stockpiles run out, potentially late 2025 or early 2026, consumers will begin to see the impact in official inflation figures. EssilorLuxottica, maker of Ray‑Ban sunglasses, has implemented price bumps, and Swiss watchmaker Swatch lifted its recommended retail prices by about 5% following the April tariff news. CEO Nick Hayek told Reuters the change barely dented demand, pointing out that luxury‑watch buyers are less sensitive to cost and often make purchases abroad to take advantage of lower taxes. “You cannot do this with cars or heavy machinery, but you can with watches,” he said. Under the arrangement, imports from the EU will carry a uniform 15% duty, an added cost almost certain t o be passed to American customers . Goods from Japan face the same rate, while U.K. exports will now incur 10%. Nations without bilateral agreements, including Brazil, Canada, and South Korea, are next in line for steeper levies. A baseline 10% tariff remains on all other imports, though the White House has floated raising it into the mid‑teens. Altogether, these steps have driven the United States’ average duty on incoming products to 18.2%, a century‑high, according to Yale’s Budget Lab. The administration maintains that the extra revenue will pour “trillions” into federal coffers, and so far this year tariff receipts exceed those of 2024 by tens of billions. In reality, importers pay the charges at the border and then weave them through distribution networks, ultimately leaving retailers and, eventually, shoppers to absorb the added expense. Yale researchers calculate that U.S. consumer prices have already risen by nearly 1.8% because of these levies, an effective income cut of about $2,400 per household. With June’s uptick in inflation, companies that formerly held prices steady are now signaling broad increases ahead. Even Trump seems to recognize the strain, recently musing about issuing tariff‑funded “rebate” checks for certain income groups. With midterm elections on the horizon, such rebates could land just in time. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a truly significant Bitcoin transfer : a colossal sum of 7,625 BTC, valued at approximately $898 million, moved from Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to an unknown new wallet. This monumental shift, first reported by blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, immediately sparked widespread speculation and discussion across the digital asset landscape. What does such a massive Bitcoin transfer signify, and why does it matter to everyday investors and market observers? What Exactly Happened with This Bitcoin Transfer? On a specific date, Whale Alert, a prominent platform known for tracking large cryptocurrency movements, flagged an extraordinary transaction. The alert detailed the movement of 7,625 Bitcoin from a known Coinbase wallet address to a newly created, unidentifiable wallet. To put this into perspective, $898 million represents a substantial amount, even in the multi-trillion-dollar crypto market. Such a large-scale Bitcoin transfer is not an everyday occurrence and typically indicates significant strategic moves by a major holder, often referred to as a ‘whale’. Key details of the event: Amount Transferred: 7,625 BTC Approximate Value: $898 million Origin: Coinbase exchange Destination: Unknown new wallet Reported By: Whale Alert This transaction, while seemingly simple on the surface, carries layers of implications for market dynamics, investor sentiment, and the broader perception of cryptocurrency. Why Does a Massive Bitcoin Transfer Spark So Much Interest? Large Bitcoin transfer events, especially those involving whales, often become focal points for several reasons. Firstly, they represent a significant portion of the total circulating supply moving hands, which can be interpreted as a strong signal regarding market sentiment. Secondly, the anonymity inherent in blockchain transactions, where wallet addresses are public but their owners are not, adds an element of mystery and intrigue. Is it an institution? A high-net-worth individual? A cold storage move? The unknown nature fuels speculation. Furthermore, such transfers can: Indicate potential market shifts: Whales often have deep insights or are reacting to significant market events. Influence investor psychology: Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) or conversely, optimism, can spread based on interpretations of whale moves. Highlight security practices: Moving large sums off exchanges to private wallets is a common security measure. Who Are Crypto Whales, and What’s Their Role in a Bitcoin Transfer? In the cryptocurrency ecosystem, ‘whales’ are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of a particular cryptocurrency, in this case, Bitcoin. Their holdings are so substantial that their buying or selling activities can significantly impact market prices. When a whale executes a large Bitcoin transfer , especially from an exchange to an unknown wallet, it signals a deliberate action that could precede a major market event or simply be a strategic decision for their portfolio management. Their actions are closely watched because: Aspect Description Market Influence Their trades can create significant price volatility. Sentiment Indicator Their movements are often seen as a barometer of market confidence. Information Asymmetry Whales may have access to information or insights not available to the general public. This particular Bitcoin transfer highlights the power and potential impact of these large holders. What Are the Potential Reasons Behind This $898 Million Bitcoin Transfer? While the exact motive behind this colossal Bitcoin transfer remains unknown, several common scenarios could explain such a move: Cold Storage for Security: One of the most common reasons for moving large amounts of crypto off an exchange is to secure them in cold storage (offline wallets). This minimizes the risk of hacks or exchange insolvency. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The BTC might be intended for a private, over-the-counter sale to an institutional buyer or another large investor, bypassing public exchanges to avoid market disruption. Preparation for Selling: While less likely for a move to an ‘unknown’ wallet if immediate selling is intended on an exchange, it could be a precursor to distributing funds to various exchanges for a large sell-off. Portfolio Rebalancing/Diversification: The whale might be rebalancing their portfolio, potentially moving funds to a new custodian or preparing to allocate capital to other assets. Institutional Custody: A large institution might be moving funds into a new, dedicated custody solution, perhaps after acquiring the BTC. Each of these possibilities carries different implications for the market, making the tracking of this particular Bitcoin transfer so crucial. How Does a Large Bitcoin Transfer Impact Market Sentiment and Price? The immediate impact of a significant Bitcoin transfer , especially one of this magnitude, is primarily on market sentiment. When large sums move from an exchange, it can be interpreted in different ways: Bullish Interpretation: If the BTC is moved to cold storage, it suggests the holder intends to HODL (hold on for dear life) and has no immediate plans to sell, which is generally seen as a bullish signal. It reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges. Bearish Interpretation: If the transfer is perceived as preparation for a large sell-off, it can trigger fear among investors, potentially leading to panic selling and a price dip. Uncertainty: The ‘unknown’ destination often leads to uncertainty, as the market tries to decipher the whale’s intentions. This uncertainty itself can cause minor fluctuations. It is important to remember that while such transfers can cause ripples, they don’t always directly lead to immediate price swings. The market’s reaction often depends on the prevailing sentiment and other macroeconomic factors. The Intricacies of Blockchain Transparency and Anonymity One of the fascinating aspects of cryptocurrency is its paradoxical nature regarding transparency and anonymity. Every Bitcoin transfer is recorded on a public ledger (the blockchain), meaning anyone can see the transaction details: the sender’s address, the recipient’s address, and the amount. This provides unparalleled transparency. However, the addresses themselves are pseudonymous. They are long strings of characters that do not directly reveal the real-world identity of the owner. This creates a layer of anonymity. While forensic blockchain analysis firms can sometimes de-anonymize addresses by tracking patterns or linking them to known entities (like exchanges), a transfer to a truly ‘new, unknown wallet’ often means the owner’s identity remains private, at least for a period. This balance of transparency and privacy is a cornerstone of blockchain technology and a key reason why large transfers like this one generate so much intrigue. What Can Investors Learn from This Massive Bitcoin Transfer? For everyday investors, a Bitcoin transfer of this scale offers several valuable lessons and actionable insights: Don’t Panic: While large movements can cause short-term market jitters, it’s crucial to avoid emotional reactions. Not every whale move signifies an impending crash or pump. Understand Market Dynamics: Learn about whale movements, exchange flows, and on-chain analytics. These tools can provide a deeper understanding of market forces beyond just price charts. Prioritize Security: If you hold significant amounts of crypto, consider moving them to cold storage. This transaction serves as a reminder that even major exchanges can be vulnerable, and self-custody offers ultimate control. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the context behind major news. Don’t rely solely on headlines. Understand the potential implications before making investment decisions. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, short-term whale movements are often just noise. Focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and adoption trends. This event underscores the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency market, where large players can move significant capital with profound, yet often unstated, intentions. Concluding Thoughts on the Mysterious Bitcoin Transfer The recent Bitcoin transfer of 7,625 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown wallet serves as a potent reminder of the significant capital flows that characterize the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate reasons behind this nearly $900 million move remain shrouded in mystery, it highlights the ongoing power of crypto whales and their potential influence on market sentiment. Whether this transfer presages a new wave of institutional adoption, a strategic shift towards enhanced security, or something else entirely, it reaffirms the importance of monitoring on-chain data for insights into the evolving digital asset landscape. As the crypto space matures, understanding these large-scale movements becomes increasingly vital for anyone navigating this exciting, yet sometimes unpredictable, financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular digital asset, such as Bitcoin. Their significant holdings mean their buying or selling activities can have a noticeable impact on market prices and sentiment. Q2: Why is a large Bitcoin transfer from an exchange significant? A large Bitcoin transfer from an exchange to an unknown wallet is significant because it often indicates a strategic move by a major holder. It can signal intentions like moving funds to cold storage for security, preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) sale, or rebalancing a portfolio, all of which can influence market perception and potentially future price action. Q3: Does a Bitcoin transfer like this always mean a price change is coming? No, a large Bitcoin transfer does not always directly lead to an immediate price change. While such movements can influence market sentiment and create speculation, the actual impact on price depends on various factors, including the whale’s ultimate intentions (e.g., selling vs. holding), overall market conditions, and macroeconomic trends. Q4: How can I track large Bitcoin transfers myself? You can track large Bitcoin transfers using blockchain analytics platforms and services like Whale Alert, Glassnode, or CryptoQuant. These platforms monitor on-chain data and provide real-time alerts or insights into significant movements of cryptocurrency assets. Q5: Is it safer to keep my Bitcoin on an exchange or in a private wallet? For large amounts of Bitcoin, it is generally considered safer to keep them in a private, self-custodied wallet (especially a hardware wallet or ‘cold storage’) rather than on an exchange. While exchanges offer convenience, they are centralized targets for hackers and are subject to operational risks. A private wallet gives you full control over your funds.

The South Korean media outlet News1 reported that the Bank of Korea (BOK) has established a new division named the “Cryptoasset Department.” The headquarters of the Bank of Korea, in Seoul, South Korea. Cryptoassets Department: New BOK Division to Monitor Crypto Sector The BOK also announced that its Digital Currency Research Lab, which operates within its Financial Settlement Bureau, will be renamed the Digital Currency Lab on July 31. News1 explained: “This appears to be an attempt to emphasize its status as a business unit.” The bank added that it has also reorganized the roles of the teams that make up the lab, and will assign staffers to test token usability. The BOK said its Cryptoasset Team Department would operate within its Financial Settlement Bureau. This division, it said, will be responsible for monitoring the crypto market. Its remit will also include Korean won-pegged stablecoins and legislative matters. The media outlet wrote that experts have interpreted the reshuffle as an “attempt to better respond to recent discussions on stablecoin issuance, while continuing work on its central bank digital currency (CBDC).” The Bank of Korea remains concerned at the tariff impact on economic expansion rather than inflation, Governor Rhee Chang-yong says https://t.co/e4gpV9bZqs — Bloomberg (@business) July 1, 2025 CBDC Plans on Ice? The BOK recently hit the pause button on its CBDC rollout plans, seemingly in direct response to the government’s stablecoin legalization plans. The bank seems to believe that CBDC-based deposit tokens are no different from bank-supported KRW stablecoins. The BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong said last year that deposit tokens are essentially “stablecoins issued by banks.” Rhee said earlier this month: “No matter if we are talking about a won stablecoin or a deposit token, we will need a digital currency in the future. We will carefully consider whether it is better to gradually move forward with a focus on the banking sector or to expand this to the wider private sector.” From Breakingviews – Breakingviews – Samsung’s $16.5 bln Tesla coup comes with caveats https://t.co/SRFpPxv2Ey https://t.co/SRFpPxv2Ey — Reuters (@Reuters) July 29, 2025 South Korean Stablecoin Regulation Incoming The bank’s move comes just hours after the nation’s two biggest political parties rolled out stablecoin regulation bills . Both bills propose giving the Financial Services Committee sweeping regulatory powers over the stablecoin industry. Critics think this will significantly diminish the role of the BOK. And the BOK has previously hit out at private sector stablecoin adoption plans. It claims that KRW-pegged coins could undermine Seoul’s ability to conduct effective monetary policy. Some of the country’s biggest tech firms have already registered KRW stablecoin-themed trademarks in anticipation of a green light from Seoul.

49202843,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76059,1753831812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Projected Price if It Fully Replicates This 2017 Fractal,https://timestabloid.com/analysts-says-xrp-could-rally-9546-if-this-happens/,"XRP has experienced a strong recovery since late 2024, significantly outperforming many altcoins during this period. Currently trading at approximately $3.12, the asset has risen by over 530% from its November 2024 low of around $0.50. This resurgence has led several market observers to revisit an old theory, that XRP may be replicating the same price pattern it followed during its historic 2017 rally. Analysts Revisit the 2017 Price Structure A growing number of XRP-focused analysts believe the asset’s recent movements closely resemble its behaviour during the 2017–2018 bull market. During that previous cycle, XRP started the year with relatively stagnant price action, trading within a symmetrical triangle. It broke out in March 2017 and reached $0.39 by May. After a lengthy consolidation period, the asset surged to its all-time high of $3.31 in early 2018, marking a 60,000% increase from its early breakout price of $0.0055. This pattern appears to be playing out once again, according to some analysts. XRP showed signs of stagnation in the months leading up to November 2024, again trading within a triangular formation. It broke out in November, peaked at $3.40 by January 2025, and has since been consolidating. Now, in mid-2025, the token has resumed its upward movement, prompting speculation that a second major rally could be underway. Prominent market commentators who have highlighted this fractal pattern include EGRAG Crypto , Bassii, Lud , CryptoWZRD, Javon Marks , Charting Guy , and others. While most agree on the general resemblance to 2017, their projected price targets vary significantly due to differing assumptions about market conditions and capital inflows. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Exploring the Implications of a Full Repetition While most analysts lean toward conservative projections, a few have explored what would happen if XRP repeated the full scale of its 2017 rally. Based on historical performance, a 60,000% increase from the $0.50 price recorded in November 2024 would place XRP near the $300 mark, which amounts to over 9,546% increase from the current price of $3.11 Such a scenario would drastically reshape the market. With roughly 60 billion XRP in circulation, a $300 price point would result in a total market capitalization of around $18 trillion. This figure would make XRP one of the most valuable assets globally, competing alongside the market capitalization of gold and vastly exceeding that of Bitcoin and Ethereum combined. Because of these implications, most analysts hesitate to endorse the $300 price level as a realistic short-term target. However, they acknowledge that it serves as a useful theoretical benchmark for understanding the asset’s upside potential in an unconstrained environment. For investors who entered the market during XRP’s late 2024 breakout, the possible return on investment under such a rally would be substantial. An individual who acquired 10,000 XRP at $0.50, spending $5,000, would see their holdings valued at $3 million if the token reached $300. While such returns remain speculative, they illustrate the kind of exponential growth that has drawn continued attention to XRP.

With a current price of $3.24, the token is showing short-term strength, up 2.01% in the past 24 hours. However, a 7-day drop of over 8% still lingers, leaving traders questioning: has XRP found its base – or is more turbulence ahead? Looking at the hourly chart, XRP’s bullish breakout in mid-July was followed by a sharp correction from the $3.80 zone. That drop found support around $3.00, and since then, the token has begun to grind higher again. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits near 61, indicating mild bullish momentum without yet entering overbought territory. If buyers regain control, the next target may sit around $3.55, a key resistance from the last local peak. While traders dissect XRP’s short-term moves, some are already shifting their attention to early-stage opportunities that could offer even higher returns. One such project making waves is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads after data projections suggested that a modest $1,400 allocation could balloon to $23,000 if growth trends persist. XRP Chart Hints at Recovery XRP’s recent consolidation just above the $3.20 level is critical. The token has formed a mild bullish divergence on the RSI, suggesting a potential move higher in the short term. However, buyers will need to push through the $3.45–$3.55 resistance zone to confirm a new uptrend. Should that breakout happen, the next targets could stretch to $3.80 and eventually back toward $4.00, but only if macro sentiment remains strong . The New Altcoin That is Eye ing Explosive Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to gain traction among early investors, with a presale stage that is already seeing rapid participation. What’s drawing attention isn’t just hype—it’s the strong projections being circulated by analysts. Based on current models, $1,400 invested now could turn into $23,000 during the next altcoin cycle. The project has already outperformed early metrics of several well-known meme coins, and demand is growing as available slots in early stages disappear quickly. With limited allocations remaining, the clock is ticking for those looking to position ahead of the next presale tier. What Comes Next for XRP? For XRP, the outlook hinges on reclaiming mid-July levels and proving that its recovery has real backing. The token must hold above $3.20 and gain momentum toward $3.50 for traders to stay bullish. Otherwise, the risk of retesting lower levels remains. But whether XRP surges or consolidates, opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE remind investors that some of the biggest gains often come from early, strategic moves—before the crowd catches on.

Recently, a significant development emerged from South Korea, a nation known for its vibrant yet tightly controlled digital asset market. If you’re involved in crypto, understanding the nuances of Korean crypto regulation is crucial, especially as authorities recently issued a stark warning to some of the country’s largest exchanges. What’s Stirring the Waters in Korean Crypto Regulation? South Korea’s financial authorities, specifically the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), have stepped in with a firm hand, raising serious concerns with the nation’s two dominant cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb. The core issue? Their recently launched crypto lending services. According to Yonhap News, these services sparked alarms due to perceived legal risks and inadequate user protection measures. On July 25, a pivotal meeting took place. Executives from five major exchanges convened with the FSS to address these pressing concerns head-on. The outcome was immediate and impactful: Upbit , one of South Korea’s leading exchanges, promptly suspended its USDT lending service. Bithumb , another giant in the space, ceased accepting new loan applications for its lending products. This swift action underscores the seriousness with which Korean regulators view these financial products. The FSS isn’t stopping there; citing ongoing controversy and the need for a robust framework, they plan to establish a dedicated task force. This task force will collaborate with industry participants to develop a comprehensive self-regulatory framework, aiming to strike a balance between innovation and investor safety within the realm of Korean crypto regulation . The Perils of Crypto Lending: Why Regulators Are Concerned Crypto lending, while offering attractive yields, comes with inherent complexities and risks that often escape the notice of average users. Regulators worldwide, and particularly in South Korea, are increasingly wary of these services due to several critical factors: Inadequate Investor Protection: Unlike traditional banking, crypto lending platforms typically offer no deposit insurance. If a platform collapses or borrowers default, lenders can lose assets entirely, a key concern for the FSS. Legal Ambiguity: The legal classification of crypto lending services remains unclear in many jurisdictions. This ambiguity creates regulatory gaps, potentially leading to fraud or market manipulation, issues South Korean authorities aim to preempt. Counterparty and Transparency Risks: Users are exposed to the risk of borrowers defaulting, especially in volatile markets. Furthermore, many platforms lack transparency regarding fund deployment and financial health, making it difficult for users to assess true risk. Potential for Systemic Risk: The interconnectedness of crypto lending platforms can create systemic risks. A crisis at one major entity could ripple through the entire ecosystem, as witnessed in past market downturns. These concerns highlight the FSS’s commitment to ensuring that user funds are adequately protected and that the market operates with transparency, core tenets of sound Korean crypto regulation . A Glimpse into South Korea’s Evolving Regulatory Landscape South Korea has long been a frontrunner in adopting and regulating digital assets, balancing innovation with strong consumer protection. Its journey with Korean crypto regulation includes: Early Adoption & Controls: A vibrant early market led to concerns over speculation, prompting crackdowns in 2017-2018, including bans on anonymous trading accounts and ICOs. FATF Travel Rule: In 2021, South Korea was among the first to implement the FATF’s “Travel Rule,” requiring virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share customer information for transactions above a threshold, enhancing anti-money laundering efforts. Strict Licensing: All crypto exchanges must register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and adhere to stringent AML/KYC protocols, including unique real-name bank account requirements for deposits and withdrawals. Push for Comprehensive Legislation: There’s an ongoing effort to enact the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA), aiming to provide a clearer legal framework for various crypto assets and establish robust investor protection. The current actions against lending services are a clear signal of the urgency to address specific risks before this broader framework is fully in place. This latest intervention reinforces South Korea’s determination to foster a mature and responsible crypto market, prioritizing stability and investor trust. What Does This Mean for Users and Exchanges? The FSS’s warning and the subsequent actions by Upbit and Bithumb have significant implications for the South Korean crypto ecosystem. For Crypto Users: Enhanced Safety: While potentially limiting high-yield opportunities, regulatory intervention aims to make the market safer, leading to more transparent and regulated lending options. Increased Due Diligence: This event underscores the importance for users to conduct thorough research on any crypto service, understanding its risks, regulatory compliance, and operational transparency. For Crypto Exchanges: Operational Adjustments: Exchanges must quickly adapt services, enhance risk management, and improve user disclosures to align with regulatory expectations. Opportunity for Collaboration: The proposed self-regulatory task force offers exchanges a chance to actively shape future Korean crypto regulation , contributing industry expertise to effective guidelines. Focus on Responsible Innovation: Exchanges will need to prioritize user safety and transparency in developing new products, ensuring long-term sustainability and trust in a regulated environment. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community As the landscape of Korean crypto regulation continues to evolve, stakeholders can take proactive steps: For Individual Investors: Stay Informed & Prioritize Security: Keep abreast of regulatory news and use only well-established, regulated platforms. Be cautious of exceptionally high returns. Understand Risk & Diversify: Fully grasp the risks associated with various crypto products and avoid over-concentration in any single asset or service. For Crypto Exchanges and Service Providers: Proactive Compliance & Engagement: Implement robust internal controls and actively participate in regulatory discussions to help shape fair and effective rules. Responsible Innovation & User Education: Develop services that prioritize safety and transparency, and clearly communicate risks and benefits to users. For Policy Makers and Regulators: Foster Dialogue & Agile Regulation: Maintain open communication with the industry and develop flexible frameworks that adapt to rapid technological changes without stifling innovation. Harmonize Globally: Work towards international cooperation to prevent regulatory arbitrage and foster a stable global market. The recent actions by South Korean financial authorities serve as a potent reminder that the era of “wild west” crypto is rapidly drawing to a close in mature markets. The focus is clearly shifting towards establishing a robust, secure, and transparent environment for digital assets. While this might temporarily temper some high-risk opportunities, it ultimately paves the way for greater institutional adoption and long-term stability for the crypto market. The formation of a self-regulatory task force signals a collaborative approach, aiming to build a future where innovation thrives hand-in-hand with stringent investor protection. As Korean crypto regulation continues to evolve, its influence will undoubtedly resonate across the global digital asset landscape, shaping how other nations approach the complex task of governing this transformative technology.

The company is set to allocate a significant portion of its cash reserves – specifically 20% – into crypto assets, beginning with Bitcoin. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a powerful statement from a major player about the evolving landscape of corporate finance and the increasing legitimacy of digital assets. This Martı crypto investment marks a pivotal moment, signaling a new era for treasury management in a volatile economic climate. Why is Martı Making This Strategic Crypto Investment? The announcement came directly from Oğuz Alper Öktem, the visionary founder of Martı, via a post on X. His explanation was clear and strategic: the move is primarily aimed at preserving the value of the company’s idle cash. In today’s economic environment, where inflation can erode the purchasing power of traditional fiat currencies, holding large sums of cash can be a liability rather than an asset. Öktem emphasized Martı’s perspective on crypto, particularly Bitcoin, as a long-term store of value. This isn’t a speculative gamble; it’s a calculated decision to protect the company’s financial health. Let’s break down the core reasons behind this strategic shift: Inflation Hedge: Many traditional currencies are experiencing significant inflation, diminishing the real value of cash holdings. Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are increasingly viewed as a hedge against such economic pressures due to their decentralized nature and limited supply. Long-Term Value Preservation: Martı sees Bitcoin not as a short-term trading instrument, but as an asset class capable of maintaining and growing value over extended periods, offering a more robust alternative to traditional cash reserves. Diversification: By adding crypto to its treasury, Martı diversifies its asset portfolio, reducing reliance on a single type of currency or investment. This diversification can enhance financial resilience. Innovation and Forward Thinking: Embracing crypto aligns with Martı’s identity as an innovative tech company. It demonstrates a willingness to adapt to new financial paradigms and leverage cutting-edge solutions. Crucially, Öktem also clarified that this Martı crypto investment will not impact the company’s existing budget or its ambitious plans for expanding its shared ride and other transportation services. This reassures stakeholders that operational growth remains a top priority, with crypto serving as a strategic financial safeguard. The Broader Trend: Corporate Treasury and Crypto Adoption Martı is not operating in a vacuum. Its decision to integrate crypto into its treasury strategy is part of a growing global trend. Over the past few years, a number of prominent corporations have explored or outright adopted Bitcoin and other digital assets for their balance sheets. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square (now Block) have made headlines for their significant crypto holdings, often citing similar reasons to Martı: hedging against inflation, seeking alternative stores of value, and embracing technological innovation. This shift reflects a maturing perspective on cryptocurrencies within the corporate world. What was once dismissed as a niche, volatile asset class is now being seriously considered by finance departments worldwide. The reasons are compelling: Traditional Treasury Challenge Crypto Solution (e.g., Bitcoin) Erosion of value due to inflation Decentralized, limited supply asset (potential inflation hedge) Low returns on traditional cash holdings Potential for significant long-term appreciation Concentration risk in single fiat currency Diversification into a non-correlated asset Inefficiencies in cross-border payments Faster, cheaper global transactions (for operational use cases) The increasing institutional infrastructure supporting crypto, including regulated exchanges, custody solutions, and clearer accounting guidelines, has also made it more feasible for corporations to engage with digital assets. This growing ecosystem reduces some of the historical barriers and risks associated with corporate Martı crypto investment strategies. Navigating the Waters: Benefits and Risks of Martı’s Crypto Investment While the potential benefits of Martı’s move are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency. The crypto market is renowned for its volatility, with prices capable of experiencing rapid and significant fluctuations. This means that while the value of Martı’s crypto holdings could increase substantially, there’s also the risk of considerable depreciation. Potential Benefits: Protection Against Currency Devaluation: Especially relevant in economies prone to high inflation or currency instability, Bitcoin offers a potential safe haven. Growth Potential: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown a strong long-term growth trajectory, offering the potential for significant capital appreciation. Pioneering Image: Martı positions itself as a forward-thinking, innovative company, potentially attracting talent and investment from those aligned with the digital economy. Potential Challenges & Risks: Market Volatility: The primary concern is price fluctuations. A sudden market downturn could impact the reported value of Martı’s reserves. Regulatory Uncertainty: While evolving, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains complex and varies by jurisdiction. Changes could impact the viability or cost of holding digital assets. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of crypto requires robust security measures to protect against hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, some traditional investors might still view crypto as too risky, potentially influencing stock performance or investor sentiment. Martı’s decision underscores a calculated risk assessment, weighing the potential for long-term value preservation against these known challenges. Their stated focus on ‘idle cash’ suggests a cautious approach, not impacting core operations, which is a prudent strategy for a first-time corporate Martı crypto investment . What Does Martı’s Bold Move Mean for the Future of Corporate Finance? Martı’s allocation of 20% of its cash reserves to crypto is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a bellwether for the future of corporate treasury management. This decision by a prominent Turkish tech company could inspire similar moves across emerging markets and beyond. As digital economies expand and the global financial landscape continues to evolve, companies may increasingly look beyond traditional assets to manage their liquidity and preserve wealth. This trend suggests a paradigm shift where: Crypto Becomes a Mainstream Asset Class: More companies will integrate digital assets into their balance sheets, moving crypto from the fringes to a core component of corporate finance. Innovation in Treasury Management: Financial departments will need to develop new expertise in managing digital assets, including custody, accounting, and risk management specific to crypto. Increased Regulatory Clarity: As corporate adoption grows, governments and regulatory bodies will be pushed to provide clearer guidelines, fostering a more secure and predictable environment for crypto investments. Martı’s announcement serves as a case study, demonstrating that even established, publicly traded companies are willing to embrace innovative financial strategies to adapt to modern economic realities. It highlights a growing confidence in the long-term viability and utility of digital assets. Actionable Insights from Martı’s Crypto Investment Journey For businesses and individuals alike, Martı’s move offers several valuable insights: Re-evaluate Cash Management: Are your idle cash reserves truly serving you, or are they losing value to inflation? Explore alternative strategies for value preservation. Understand Digital Assets: Educate yourself and your team on the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies, their risks, and their potential benefits. The digital economy is here to stay. Consider Long-Term Strategy: Short-term speculation is risky. Martı’s approach emphasizes long-term value storage, a more prudent strategy for corporate treasuries. Start Small and Scale: Martı’s 20% allocation, while significant, is still a portion of their reserves, not their entire treasury. This phased approach can mitigate initial risks. Consult Experts: For businesses considering similar moves, engaging with financial advisors specializing in digital assets and corporate treasury management is crucial. The decision by Martı to make a significant Martı crypto investment is a testament to the growing acceptance and strategic importance of digital assets in the global economy. It reflects a proactive approach to financial management in an era of economic uncertainty and technological advancement. A Glimpse into the Future: Martı Paving the Way Martı’s bold move to allocate 20% of its cash reserves to crypto, starting with Bitcoin, is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic declaration. It underscores a growing corporate belief in digital assets as a legitimate and necessary component of modern treasury management, particularly for preserving value against inflationary pressures. By taking this pioneering step, Martı is not only safeguarding its own financial future but also setting a precedent for other companies in Turkey and around the globe. This isn’t merely about holding crypto; it’s about embracing innovation, adapting to new economic realities, and charting a course for resilient financial growth in the digital age. The ripple effect of this Martı crypto investment will undoubtedly be felt across industries, prompting more conversations about the role of digital assets in corporate balance sheets.

This move highlights a significant shift in the banking sector within the region, reflecting the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance. Rakbank’s customers can now directly engage in crypto transactions via the bank’s mobile banking app, accessing services such as buying, selling, and swapping cryptocurrencies directly from their UAE dirham accounts.

Raheel Ahmed, Rakbank’s Group CEO, highlighted the strategic importance of this launch, stating that it aligns closely with the bank’s mission of digital innovation complemented by a human touch. Ahmed also emphasized that the integration with Bitpanda allows Rakbank to provide customers a regulated, simplified, and secure path into digital asset trading. Ahmed added: We recognize the opportunity this solution will provide to customers in the UAE, as we believe they deserve a more efficient and seamless crypto buying, selling and swapping journey that is fully regulated and entirely in AED. A Regulatory Milestone for UAE Banking The collaboration between Rakbank and Bitpanda signifies a pivotal moment for regulatory advancement in digital asset adoption within the UAE’s banking industry.

In a new interview on The Wolf of All Streets, Hougan says that after making “tons of money” in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), TradFi firms are now seeking alternative opportunities in the industry. “They made all this money. All this money flowed into Bitcoin. The price went up a 140%. And what are they going to do? They’re going to rotate into like Kellogg’s [stock]? No, they’re going to rotate into Circle and Ethereum and treasury companies. And now ETH treasury companies. And now Solana treasury companies… It’s going to go all the way. It’s altseason in TradFi for sure.” The Bitwise CIO says the trend of investing in crypto treasury companies is in an early phase. According to Hougan, the trend is only going to accelerate in the coming months. “And I know that’s counter to the media narrative, which feels like we’re peak bubble, we’re, you know, March 2000 in the internet. But we’re not. We’re 1998. Like, people are still just getting excited. The amount of flow that comes through my inbox is incredible. And if you’re bullish about crypto generically, why would you think this trend stops? If I think Bitcoin is going to $200,000, do I think this treasury trend increases or decreases?

According to a recent statement by market commentator Common Sense Crypto, a $1,000 investment in XRP today could potentially grow to between $10,000 and $50,000. The analyst shared this projection on X, highlighting it as a key point for investors to consider when evaluating ROI across digital assets. In contrast, he argued that a similar investment in Bitcoin would likely yield much smaller gains, estimating a return of just $1,300 to $1,500. This comparison, he emphasized, demonstrates that current price levels are less important than growth potential when assessing investment opportunities in the crypto market. Here's a quick fact to ponder, if you put $1,000 into $xrp today you will most likely end up with at least $10,000 – $50,000 in this cycle, if you put the same $1,000 into $btc you will most like only end up with $1300 – $1500. ROI (return on investment) is more important than… — Common Sense Crypto (@TheCSCrypto) July 12, 2025 XRP vs. Bitcoin: ROI Potential Sparks Debate The analyst’s comments reflect a growing narrative within the XRP community that XRP has more room for growth due to its lower price and market capitalization. With XRP currently priced around $3.15 and a total market cap of approximately $186 billion, advocates believe it has more upside potential than Bitcoin , which trades at over $120,000 and holds a market cap exceeding $2.3 trillion. This perspective is not new. In June, Alpha Lions Academy founder Edoardo Farina also noted that XRP has historically offered higher returns in shorter timeframes compared to Bitcoin. Farina pointed to XRP’s surge from $0.50 in November 2024 to $3.40 by January 2025, a gain of nearly 600%. During the same period, Bitcoin increased from $68,000 to $112,000, translating to a more modest return of around 64%. Using that timeframe as an example, Farina explained that a $50,000 investment in XRP would have grown to $340,000, while the same amount in Bitcoin would have reached just over $82,000. Can XRP Reach $50,000 on a $1,000 Investment? To achieve a $10,000 return from a $1,000 investment in XRP at its current price of $3.15, the token would need to reach $31.85. For a $50,000 return, XRP would have to trade above $159, a level far beyond its all-time high of $3.84 recorded in 2018. Reaching $159 would place XRP’s market capitalization near $9.5 trillion, surpassing the valuation of many global tech giants and even rivaling national economies. Such a projection aligns with ultra-bullish forecasts from some influencers, including Dustin Layton, who previously suggested that 1,000 XRP could yield $50,000 by 2025. However, these estimates have been widely criticized as unrealistic by more conservative voices in the crypto space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Experts Urge Caution on Exaggerated Price Targets Skeptics warn that despite XRP’s recent growth, it has consistently underperformed compared to Bitcoin in long-term recovery metrics. While Bitcoin has doubled its 2017 peak, XRP has yet to surpass its previous all-time high. Responding to Common Sense Crypto’s outlook, another user, Justin Windheim, dismissed the $159 projection, calling it unrealistic. More measured projections from platforms like Changelly and Telegaon estimate that XRP may not reach $50 until around 2035. Some forecasts for a $150 valuation extend even further, with timelines reaching into the 2040s. While Common Sense Crypto’s projection has energized parts of the XRP community, broader market analysis suggests a more measured approach. Historical performance and current market dynamics indicate that achieving the high-end targets, such as $159 per XRP, would require unprecedented adoption and global economic shifts. Although XRP may continue to offer competitive returns compared to Bitcoin in the short term, investors are advised to remain cautious and weigh speculative forecasts against fundamental data and realistic growth models.

With legal clarity now largely behind Ripple Labs, market optimism is swelling around the idea that XRP may finally become the next altcoin to secure ETF status. That shift would not only elevate institutional access to XRP but could also spark a broader wave of crypto ETF launches—reshaping how traditional investors enter the market. In this context, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the eye of early-stage investors, offering what some say could be a Shiba Inu-style opportunity . While XRP is grabbing ETF headlines, MAGACOIN is rapidly selling out its presale stages and attracting attention from traders who want in before mainstream adoption hits. Solana: The Next ETF Candidate? Solana is widely considered the next likely contender after XRP to receive ETF approval. With its high-speed blockchain and increasingly popular NFT and DeFi ecosystems, Solana has already established deep institutional connections. It’s trading at $185, and analysts suggest an XRP ETF could pave the way for similar financial products tied to Solana. The SEC has so far focused more on Ethereum, but Solana’s rising adoption metrics may put it next in line. A Closer Look at This Explosive Altcoin’s Momentum A small investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver major returns if projections hold true – an attractive proposition that’s fueling the current rush of interest. What makes MAGACOIN stand out is its rapid-fire sellouts in each presale round and a community that’s growing by thousands weekly. The project isn’t just benefiting from early investor hype—it’s also building an ecosystem that rewards strategic timing. With comparisons to DOGE and SHIBA growing louder, smart money is eyeing MAGACOIN before exchange listings begin. Litecoin: A Quiet Contender With Strong Fundamentals Trading near $115, Litecoin might not dominate headlines like Solana or XRP, but its longevity and proven security model make it a serious ETF candidate. The coin already has deep liquidity, established use cases in payments, and minimal regulatory noise—something that can’t be said for many altcoins. If XRP breaks the ETF barrier, Litecoin could be fast-tracked due to its technical simplicity and network stability. Conclusion As XRP pushes toward ETF approval, the market is preparing for a domino effect that could elevate Solana and Litecoin into the ETF spotlight. At the same time, early backers of MAGACOIN FINANCE are locking in positions ahead of what could be one of the biggest presale ROI stories of the cycle.

49204781,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=775961,1753834496,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49204781.jpeg,Meta says it is democratizing AI but who controls it?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-says-it-is-democratizing-ai/,"Over the past few years, Meta has invested billions of dollars into research and hired leading scientists to build powerful AI systems. It has also built a large computing infrastructure and released a group of large language models called LLaMA, its latest, LLaMA 3, to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Meta has made its models open-source to allow anyone to access, use, and build on them freely, and says it wants to “open up” AI to benefit everyone. Most people think this is a bold step toward making superintelligence more fair, shared, and useful for the world. They say the company’s move will speed up innovation, help smaller players compete, and prevent a monopoly on AI. On the other hand, critics say Meta wants to shape how AI is built, used, and regulated without appearing too dominant by offering the tools but keeping control of the ecosystem. The company still decides when and how to release its models, limits what people can do with them, and builds the platforms where these tools will live and grow. This raises a tough but important question: Is Meta creating a smarter future for everyone, or is it quietly building a new kind of control? Not through force or censorship, but through subtle influence, design, and growing dependence. Meta invests big in AI for everyone Meta is pouring enormous resources into Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), AI models designed to think, reason, and learn like humans. These models will one day write code, answer questions, make ethical decisions, solve business problems, and adapt to new situations without reprogramming. Whoever builds AGI first will shape how billions of people interact with technology for decades, and Meta wants to be 10 steps ahead of its competition. The company collects vast amounts of data from billions of users to help teach its AI models how humans express thoughts, emotions, and intentions. Every meme, text, image, voice recording, video, “like,” and emoji reaction is raw data. Meta is building AGI directly from the messy, emotional, highly detailed reality of human life as it plays out online every day. This way, the systems learn what people say, how they say it, when they say it, who they say it to, and how others respond. Meta recently merged its FAIR (Fundamental AI Research) and GenAI (Generative AI) teams into a single, centralized unit focused solely on developing general-purpose AI systems. This shows the company is looking beyond smarter assistants or better content filters, focusing on new interfaces for communication, ways of organizing knowledge, and forms of social and economic influence. Meta Says Openness Helps Progress Mark Zuckerberg says Meta will “freely share” its AI models with the world for faster innovation, greater safety, and a more inclusive future where AI benefits everyone. Most supporters say this openness invites more innovation because people from different backgrounds can use, test, and improve the tools together. They don’t have to wait for a few big companies to decide what happens next. On top of that, they claim mistakes and risks become easier to catch because the model isn’t hidden behind company walls. However, critics argue that Meta has quietly kept the most advanced and powerful versions locked away despite releasing parts of Llama 3 to the public. The company still controls the versions with the highest intelligence and greatest influence, while the world gets a taste of what Llama can do. What’s more, critics say this strategy helps Meta improve its models without paying for outside research or user testing because millions of people use and test the tools. It also earns them praise for being open and generous. Meta says it supports openness, but its actions tell a different story. It gives some tools away, but holds the most powerful ones back. So the real question is: Is this true open-source progress, or just a smart way to stay ahead without seeming like a monopoly? Meta builds AI that learns from people’s data Meta doesn’t need to look far when training its powerful language model, Llama 3. It has a data goldmine with access to one of the world’s largest content ecosystems through Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. The company says it used public web data, computer code, synthetic data (artificially generated content), and possibly material created by users on its platforms. That means anything from blog posts to Reddit threads to images you uploaded on your timeline might become part of the material used to train the AI. The model may be built on a foundation that many people never knowingly agreed to contribute to. Artists, writers, musicians, and developers argue that Meta and other tech giants are building billion-dollar AI systems using creative content they never paid for, credited, or asked permission to use. It feels like digital trespassing where companies walk into their space, take what they want, and profit from it under the guise of innovation. Governments and officials in regions like the European Union are starting to pay attention. They are now asking where this training data comes from, whether users gave meaningful consent, and how this aligns with privacy laws like the GDPR. They also want companies to explain how they handle sensitive data, copyrighted content, and personal information.

How do we make sense of this constant flux? One of the most insightful tools at our disposal is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . As of July 30, this crucial indicator, provided by the software development platform Alternative, has climbed to 74, firmly planting itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This one-point increase from the previous day highlights a palpable shift in market sentiment, signaling growing optimism among participants. But what exactly does this mean for your crypto journey? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a barometer for market sentiment. It ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 signifying ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 representing ‘Extreme Greed.’ Think of it as a psychological snapshot of the market, helping investors gauge whether the collective mood is one of panic-driven selling or enthusiastic buying. 0-24: Extreme Fear – This often indicates oversold markets and potential buying opportunities for brave investors. 25-49: Fear – Investors are worried, but not in a full panic. Caution prevails. 50-74: Greed – A positive sentiment, often associated with rising prices and increased buying interest. 75-100: Extreme Greed – The market is likely overbought, fueled by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), and potentially ripe for a correction. The index doesn’t just pull a number out of thin air. It’s a sophisticated aggregation of six distinct market factors, each contributing a specific weight to the final score. Let’s delve into these components to truly appreciate the depth of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Dissecting the Drivers Behind the Index Score The strength of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach. By combining various indicators, it provides a more holistic view of market psychology than any single metric could offer. Here’s a closer look at the factors: Volatility and Market Momentum/Volume (25% each) These two factors collectively account for a significant portion of the index. Volatility measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates relative to its average. High volatility, especially when coupled with falling prices, often signals fear. Conversely, steady, upward movement with low volatility can indicate confidence. Market Momentum/Volume assesses the current trading volume and market momentum compared to average levels. High buying volume on rising prices typically indicates greed, while high selling volume on falling prices points to fear. When the market is surging, and trading volumes are robust, it suggests strong buying interest and a general sense of optimism. Social Media and Surveys (15% each) The crypto community is highly active on social media, making it a rich source of sentiment data. The index analyzes keywords and sentiment from various platforms to gauge the public mood. For instance, a surge in positive mentions of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies can push the index towards greed. Similarly, an increase in negative or panicky discussions would reflect fear. Historically, Surveys were also a component, directly polling investors for their sentiment. However, it’s important to note that this specific factor is currently paused, meaning the index relies on the other five components for its calculation. Bitcoin Dominance and Google Trends (10% each) Bitcoin Dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap. When Bitcoin dominance rises, it often indicates that investors are moving funds from altcoins back into Bitcoin, typically seen as a safer haven during uncertain times (fear). Conversely, falling Bitcoin dominance, especially during a bull run, suggests investors are taking higher risks on altcoins (greed). Finally, Google Trends provides insight into public interest. The index analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A spike in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price prediction” or “buy crypto” can signal rising public interest and potentially, greed. Conversely, searches for “is crypto dead?” might indicate fear. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Implications and Risks The current reading of 74 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market squarely in the ‘Greed’ zone. While this might sound positive, it comes with its own set of considerations: Increased FOMO: When prices are rising, and sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, many new investors jump in, fearing they’ll miss out on potential gains. This can lead to irrational buying decisions. Potential for Correction: Historically, periods of extreme greed often precede market corrections. When everyone is optimistic, and prices seem to only go up, the market can become overextended, making it vulnerable to sudden pullbacks. Heightened Volatility: While greed drives prices up, it can also lead to sharp drops as early investors take profits, triggering cascading sell-offs. Risk of Overvaluation: Assets may trade at prices not fully supported by their underlying fundamentals, driven more by speculative demand than intrinsic value. It’s crucial to remember that a high index reading is not a definitive sell signal, but rather a yellow flag. It encourages caution and strategic thinking rather than impulsive action. Beyond the Index: Strategic Considerations for Investors While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an excellent tool, it should never be your sole guide. A comprehensive investment strategy combines various analytical approaches: The Contrarian Approach: Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” This philosophy aligns perfectly with the index. When the index is high, it might be a good time to consider taking some profits or tightening your stop-loss orders. Conversely, when the index plummets into ‘Extreme Fear,’ it could signal an opportune time to accumulate assets at lower prices, assuming your long-term conviction remains strong. Combine with Fundamental and Technical Analysis Don’t just look at sentiment. Research the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you’re interested in – their use cases, development teams, community support, and technological innovation. Pair this with technical analysis, studying price charts, trading patterns, and indicators to identify potential entry and exit points. The index provides the ‘why’ (market mood), while fundamental and technical analysis offers the ‘what’ and ‘when’. Risk Management and Diversification Regardless of market sentiment, robust risk management is paramount. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider dollar-cost averaging, which involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price fluctuations. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of market volatility. Diversifying your portfolio across different assets can also reduce risk, preventing overexposure to any single cryptocurrency. Challenges and Limitations of the Index No tool is perfect, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has its limitations: Lagging Indicator: While useful, the index is often a reflection of what has already happened. Market sentiment can shift rapidly. Bitcoin-Centric: Although it considers overall market sentiment, its components are heavily weighted towards Bitcoin. Altcoin sentiment might differ. Surveys Paused: The absence of the survey component means a direct measure of investor opinion is currently missing, relying more on observable market behavior. Not a Crystal Ball: It cannot predict future price movements with certainty. It’s a guide to sentiment, not a guarantee of market direction. Investors should use the index as a complementary tool, understanding its strengths and weaknesses, to make more informed decisions. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto’s Emotional Tides The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74 signifies a period of heightened optimism and ‘Greed’ in the crypto market. This reflects improving sentiment driven by factors like increasing market momentum and social media buzz. While positive sentiment can be exhilarating, it’s also a crucial time for prudence. By understanding the underlying components of the index and combining its insights with thorough fundamental and technical analysis, investors can better navigate the emotional tides of the cryptocurrency market. Remember, successful investing often involves thinking long-term and avoiding impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. Stay informed, stay strategic, and approach the market with a balanced perspective. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and who provides it?

A year after the nation’s pivotal Virtual Asset User Protection Act came into full effect, this move underscores a robust commitment to safeguarding user funds and bolstering trust in the nascent yet rapidly expanding crypto market. This proactive approach, spearheaded by top players like Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, signals a new era of accountability and protection, setting a powerful precedent for global regulatory frameworks. South Korea Crypto Reserves: A Landmark in User Protection The evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation has seen South Korea emerge as a frontrunner in establishing clear guidelines to protect virtual asset users. The Virtual Asset User Protection Act, a watershed moment, mandates that exchanges establish substantial reserve funds and adhere to strict security protocols, including the cold storage of a significant portion of customer funds. The recent revelation that the top five exchanges have collectively set aside over 260 billion won (approximately $189.7 million USD) in South Korea crypto reserves by the end of June is a direct testament to the act’s impact. This financial cushion is designed to act as a buffer against potential operational risks, security breaches, or unforeseen financial challenges, providing an unprecedented layer of security for millions of crypto investors. Diving Deep into South Korea’s Crypto Exchange Reserves The commitment to user protection is evident in the individual contributions of each major exchange to the collective South Korea crypto reserves . Understanding the breakdown provides valuable insights into their operational strategies and risk management approaches. The figures, as reported by local outlet MTN News and confirmed by lawmaker Huh Young, highlight the industry’s dedication: Exchange Reserve Fund (KRW) Reserve Fund (USD) Cold Storage % of Customer Assets Notes Bithumb 150.1 billion won $108.1 million 90.6% Largest reserve contribution Upbit 4.2 billion won $3 million 98.3% Highest cold storage percentage Coinone 30 billion won $21.6 million N/A Significant reserve contribution Korbit 16 billion won $11.5 million N/A Solid reserve contribution Gopax N/A N/A N/A Covers liability through insurance instead of direct reserve fund This diverse approach, encompassing both direct reserve funds and insurance, highlights the industry’s flexibility in meeting regulatory demands while prioritizing user safety. The high percentages of cold storage across these platforms are particularly noteworthy, as cold wallets are widely considered the most secure method for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency, effectively isolating assets from online vulnerabilities. Beyond the Numbers: The Significance of Robust South Korea Crypto Reserves The accumulation of these substantial South Korea crypto reserves represents a fundamental shift in how crypto exchanges perceive their responsibility to users. What are the broader implications and benefits of such robust financial safeguards? Enhanced User Confidence: Significant funds set aside for user protection instill a crucial sense of security, attracting new users and retaining existing ones. Mitigation of Systemic Risk: These reserves act as a critical safety net against insolvency due to hacks, operational failures, or extreme market downturns, preventing wider market destabilization. Setting a Global Benchmark: South Korea’s proactive regulatory stance and the industry’s response set a compelling example for other nations grappling with effective crypto regulation. Promoting Market Stability: By reducing the risk of catastrophic failures, these reserves contribute to overall market stability, encouraging more orderly market behavior. Accountability and Transparency: Public disclosure of reserve figures promotes greater accountability from exchanges, encouraging high operational standards and transparent financial practices. Challenges and the Path Forward for South Korea Crypto Reserves While the establishment of these substantial South Korea crypto reserves is a monumental achievement, the path forward is not without its challenges. The dynamic nature of the crypto market necessitates continuous adaptation and vigilance. What hurdles might lie ahead, and how can they be addressed? Maintaining Adequacy in Volatile Markets: Ensuring reserve funds remain adequate amidst wild crypto asset fluctuations requires sophisticated financial management and dynamic adjustment mechanisms. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Regulations will likely evolve; exchanges must remain agile and prepared to adapt to new compliance requirements without stifling innovation. Balancing Protection with Innovation: Overly stringent requirements could limit smaller exchanges. Regulators must strike a delicate balance between robust protection and fostering a competitive, innovative market. Insurance vs. Direct Reserves: Gopax’s reliance on insurance highlights a debate. While viable, its scope and payout limits must be clearly understood and communicated to users, ensuring its effectiveness. Addressing these challenges will require ongoing dialogue between exchanges, regulators, and user advocacy groups to ensure the protective framework remains effective, fair, and conducive to growth. Conclusion: A Secure Future for Crypto in South Korea The establishment of nearly $190 million in South Korea crypto reserves by the nation’s top exchanges marks a monumental achievement in the quest for a more secure and trustworthy cryptocurrency environment. Driven by the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, this initiative showcases a profound commitment to user safety, setting a high bar for accountability and risk management. South Korea’s proactive regulatory stance and the industry’s dedicated response provide a powerful example of how collaboration can lead to a safer, more stable, and ultimately more prosperous digital asset future. This significant financial commitment is not just about numbers; it’s about building lasting trust and ensuring that users can engage with the crypto market with greater peace of mind, potentially influencing global best practices for crypto regulation and user protection. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Virtual Asset User Protection Act? A1: The Virtual Asset User Protection Act is a landmark South Korean law implemented to enhance the security and integrity of virtual asset transactions.

This method is crucial for security as it makes assets virtually immune to online hacking attempts, providing the highest level of protection against theft and unauthorized access. Q4: How do these reserves protect users? A4: These reserve funds act as a financial safety net. In the event of an exchange experiencing a security breach, operational failure, or financial distress, these reserves can be used to compensate users for their losses, thereby safeguarding their assets and maintaining confidence in the platform. Q5: What makes Gopax’s approach to liability different? A5: Unlike the other four exchanges that maintain direct reserve funds, Gopax has chosen to cover its liability through comprehensive insurance policies. This alternative strategy relies on the financial backing and coverage provided by an insurance provider to protect user assets.

If approved, analysts believe XRP could finally unlock major upside, potentially pushing well beyond its current $3.12 price. The move would open the floodgates for institutional demand – just like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs did – and could set the tone for what’s next in the altcoin cycle. Other tokens expected to benefit from this decision include Solana, Dogecoin, and Stellar—all of which are being closely watched as potential ETF candidates themselves. With hype mounting, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also seeing record-breaking investor demand, with early access spots vanishing faster than ever . Solana Targets Institutional Capital Markets Solana has emerged as one of the most promising Layer 1 platforms, and its developers just released a long-term roadmap aiming to make Solana the foundation of global “Internet Capital Markets” (ICMs) by 2027. This ambitious goal includes enhancig bandwidth, reducing latency, and introducing smart contract-level control for transaction execution. Currently trading near $190, Solana’s potential ETF candidacy and technical evolution could attract institutional interest rapidly – especially if XRP leads the way. Dogecoin Gains Unexpected Institutional Attention Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after Bit Origin, a China-based Bitcoin miner and pork processor, purchased 40.5 million DOGE for around $9.9 million. With DOGE now priced around $0.26, this move signals growing treasury interest in the original meme coin. Dogecoin’s cultural strength and popularity give it a realistic shot at becoming the first meme coin ETF—if regulators approve XRP and then look for other high-profile retail tokens. Early Rounds Selling Out as Demand Spikes As institutional money begins circling big-name altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly stealing headlines . With each presale round closing faster than the last, the project is breaking participation records and fueling massive FOMO . Early-stage investors are rushing in before the next tier opens, and analysts say MAGACOIN could be among the top gainers of the upcoming cycle , thanks to a rapidly growing ecosystem and loyal community. With entry points narrowing, early access may not be available for long—especially if momentum continues building at this pace. Stellar Often Rises with Ripple Stellar may not always dominate headlines, but its close historical ties to Ripple and similar use case have made it a consistent follower of XRP’s movements. Co-founded by Ripple’s Jed McCaleb, Stellar focuses on cross-border payments and currently trades near $0.43. If an XRP ETF gets greenlit, Stellar could see a sympathetic rally—mirroring XRP’s moves as it has done many times in the past. Conclusion: XRP’s ETF hopes have brought new energy into the altcoin space. Solana and Dogecoin are lining up as next-in-line ETF contenders, while Stellar remains a reliable XRP proxy. But with MAGACOIN FINANCE now selling out faster than ever, investors looking for the next breakout are locking in positions before broader market awareness kicks in.

Building Trust: A physical presence can foster confidence in new digital financial services. This localized strategy could serve as a successful pilot, demonstrating stablecoins’ practical utility before broader rollout. Global Ambitions: How Will This Partnership Expand Stablecoin Financial Services? While initially focused on South Korea’s foreign resident community, Danal and Hancom With have clear ambitions to expand into overseas markets. This global vision underscores the universal applicability of stablecoin financial services . Their expansion strategy will integrate advanced AI and security technologies, crucial for ensuring the safety, efficiency, and regulatory compliance of international financial operations. AI integration could lead to personalized services, fraud detection, and automated support, enhancing user experience. Robust security is paramount for protecting assets and data in the sensitive financial sector. By leveraging these technologies, the partnership aims to build a secure, intelligent ecosystem for global stablecoin transactions, potentially setting new standards for digital financial services across borders. Navigating the Landscape: Potential Benefits and Challenges for Stablecoin Financial Services The advent of advanced stablecoin financial services from the Danal-Hancom With partnership offers significant benefits alongside notable challenges. Key Benefits: Increased Financial Inclusion: Simplifying digital finance access for underserved populations. Reduced Transaction Costs: Lower fees for blockchain-based transactions, especially remittances. Faster Settlements: Transactions can settle in minutes, unlike traditional banking. Innovation in Fintech: Pushing boundaries in digital payments and services. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain’s transparency provides clarity on transaction flows.

Addressing these challenges proactively is vital for the venture’s long-term success. A New Era for Digital Finance The collaboration between Danal and Hancom With marks a pivotal moment for the evolution of stablecoin financial services . By combining Danal’s payment expertise with Hancom With’s blockchain prowess, and by strategically targeting foreign residents with user-friendly kiosk services, they are laying the groundwork for a more accessible, efficient, and secure digital financial ecosystem.

Recently, Pump.fun, a prominent Solana (SOL)-based platform, made headlines with a significant move that underscores its commitment to its native asset. If you’re following the latest in crypto, you’ve likely heard about the ongoing PUMP token buyback program, and the latest transfer of 12,000 SOL, valued at an impressive $2.16 million, is a clear signal of continued strategic support for the PUMP token ecosystem. What’s Driving Pump.fun’s Latest PUMP Token Buyback? On-chain analyst @EmberCN on X brought to light this latest development: a transfer of 12,000 SOL directly to the address designated for purchasing PUMP tokens. This isn’t a one-off event but rather a continuation of a robust buyback initiative that Pump.fun has been actively pursuing. For those unfamiliar, a buyback program involves a company repurchasing its own shares or tokens from the open market, often with the goal of reducing the circulating supply and potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. This recent transfer follows an even larger allocation made on July 16, when Pump.fun moved a substantial 187,770 SOL, worth approximately $30.53 million at the time, from its fee wallet to fund the buyback. The sheer scale of these operations highlights Pump.fun’s dedication to supporting its ecosystem. To date, the platform has already spent a significant 129,100 SOL, totaling around $21.5 million, to acquire 3.828 billion PUMP tokens. This aggressive purchasing has occurred at an average price of $0.0056 per PUMP token, demonstrating a consistent effort to accumulate and manage the token’s supply. Key Details of the PUMP Token Buyback Program: Latest Transfer: 12,000 SOL ($2.16 million) sent to the buyback address. Previous Major Funding: 187,770 SOL ($30.53 million) transferred on July 16 from the fee wallet. Total SOL Spent So Far: 129,100 SOL ($21.5 million). Total PUMP Tokens Acquired: 3.828 billion PUMP. Average Buyback Price: $0.0056 per PUMP token. These figures paint a clear picture of a platform actively reinvesting its earned fees back into its core asset, aiming to foster stability and growth for its community members and token holders. The consistent execution of the PUMP token buyback strategy suggests a long-term vision for the token’s health. Why Are Crypto Buybacks, Like the PUMP Token Buyback, Important? The concept of a token buyback, while common in traditional stock markets, holds unique significance in the volatile cryptocurrency space. For projects like Pump.fun, implementing a PUMP token buyback program can convey several crucial messages to the market and its community: Scarcity and Value Appreciation: By reducing the total circulating supply of PUMP tokens, the buyback program can, in theory, increase the scarcity of the token. If demand remains constant or grows, a reduced supply can lead to an increase in the token’s price per unit. This is a fundamental economic principle of supply and demand at play. Price Support and Stability: Regular buybacks can act as a form of price support, especially during periods of market volatility. When there’s a consistent buyer in the market (the project itself), it can help cushion downward price movements and establish a floor for the token’s value. Confidence Signal: A project conducting a significant buyback demonstrates its confidence in its own long-term prospects. It signals to investors that the team believes their token is undervalued and is willing to invest its own capital to support it. This can attract new investors and retain existing ones. Value Distribution to Holders: While not a direct dividend, buybacks indirectly benefit existing token holders by potentially increasing the value of their holdings. It’s a way for the project to share its success with its community without directly distributing funds. Fee Management: In Pump.fun’s case, using fees generated by the platform to fund the buyback creates a virtuous cycle. The more successful the platform is in facilitating memecoin launches, the more fees it generates, which can then be used to support the PUMP token, further enhancing its appeal. Understanding these underlying motivations helps to contextualize why such a significant financial commitment to the PUMP token buyback is a noteworthy event in the Solana ecosystem. Pump.fun’s Strategic Vision: Beyond the PUMP Token Buyback While the PUMP token buyback is a significant aspect of Pump.fun’s current strategy, it’s essential to look at the broader picture of what Pump.fun aims to achieve. Launched on the Solana blockchain, Pump.fun carved out a niche by simplifying the process of launching memecoins. It addresses common challenges faced by new projects, such as ensuring fair distribution and preventing rug pulls, by integrating features like bonding curves and automatic liquidity provision. The platform’s success is rooted in its user-friendly interface and its ability to empower anyone to create a token with minimal technical knowledge. This democratization of token creation has led to a surge in new memecoins, contributing to Solana’s vibrant and often experimental DeFi landscape. By generating substantial fees from these launches, Pump.fun is able to fund initiatives like the PUMP token buyback, creating a self-sustaining economic model. However, the memecoin space is not without its challenges. It’s characterized by extreme volatility, speculative trading, and the inherent risks associated with assets that often derive their value from community sentiment and viral trends rather than fundamental utility. Pump.fun’s strategic moves, including the PUMP token buyback , can be seen as an effort to bring a degree of stability and long-term vision to a segment of the crypto market that is notoriously unpredictable. Navigating the Memecoin Market: What Investors Should Know About PUMP Token and Others For investors considering exposure to memecoins, including PUMP, understanding the dynamics of the market is crucial. While the PUMP token buyback offers a positive signal, it doesn’t eliminate the inherent risks. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this unique segment: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the project thoroughly. Understand its mechanics, its community, and the team behind it. For PUMP, this means understanding Pump.fun’s platform, its fee structure, and its stated goals. Understand Tokenomics: Look beyond the hype. How many tokens are in circulation? What’s the total supply? How are tokens distributed? In the case of PUMP, knowing about the buyback program’s impact on supply is key. Assess Liquidity: Ensure there’s sufficient liquidity for the token you’re interested in. Pump.fun’s model includes automatic liquidity provision, which is a positive, but market depth can still vary. Manage Risk: Memecoins are highly volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and avoid putting all your capital into a single, high-risk asset. Community and Sentiment: Memecoins are heavily influenced by community sentiment and social media trends. Stay informed about community discussions, but always verify information independently. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if you’re looking for short-term speculative gains or if you believe in the long-term viability of the platform. The PUMP token buyback indicates a long-term strategy from the project’s side, but individual investor goals may differ. The continuation of the PUMP token buyback program is a strong indicator of Pump.fun’s belief in its ecosystem. However, like all crypto investments, it requires careful consideration and a clear understanding of the associated risks and rewards. In conclusion, Pump.fun’s consistent and substantial investment in its PUMP token buyback program, highlighted by the latest $2.16 million SOL transfer, demonstrates a strategic commitment to strengthening its native asset. By reducing supply and signaling confidence, these buybacks aim to foster a more stable and attractive environment for PUMP token holders. As the memecoin landscape continues to evolve on Solana, Pump.fun’s proactive approach to managing its tokenomics could set a precedent for other platforms. This bold move reinforces its position as a key player in the decentralized creation of new digital assets, underpinning its potential for continued influence in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

What’s particularly notable about this rally is that it appears to be driven by fresh capital inflows – not a rotation out of Bitcoin (BTC), as some have suggested. ETH Rally Driven By Fresh Capital According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Carmelo Aleman, claims that ETH’s current rally is a result of capital rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum are unfounded. Aleman references on-chain data – especially the Bitcoin Realized Cap – to explain his analysis. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Wyckoff ‘Liftoff’ Phase – Can ETH Reach A New High? For the uninitiated, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap measures the total value of all BTC in circulation based on the price at which each coin last moved on-chain, rather than the current market price. It provides a more accurate view of actual capital invested in Bitcoin, helping identify accumulation or distribution trends over time. Aleman shared the following chart showing that, as of July 25 at 11 AM UTC, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high (ATH) in Realized Cap at $1.018 trillion. This increase strongly suggests that capital remains flowing into Bitcoin – not out of it. In fact, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap has continued to rise, albeit gradually, even as Ethereum gained bullish momentum. Aleman explains that brief pauses in BTC price action typically align with phases of capital accumulation, which have historically preceded major rallies. Further, Aleman remarked that ETH is simply benefitting from the strong growth prospects of the Ethereum ecosystem. July witnessed a significant surge in interest in the ETH ecosystem, which reflected in the steep rise in price of the digital asset. Ethereum Network Seeing Returning Interest Multiple metrics reinforce the view that new capital is entering the Ethereum ecosystem. For example, data from DefiLlama shows that the Total Value Locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms has risen significantly – from $49 billion on April 29 to $84.6 billion by July 29. Additional on-chain metrics point to a similar trend. According to etherscan.io, daily transactions on the Ethereum network have been climbing steadily, with nearly 1.48 million transactions recorded on July 27 alone. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Major Surge For Ethereum Price, Eyeing $4,000 In Its Best July Yet There’s also growing speculation that Ethereum’s declining circulating supply is contributing to upward price pressure. Over the past month, ETH reserves on centralized exchanges have dropped by one million coins, supporting the narrative of a developing “supply crunch.” Adding to that, Ethereum liquid staking recently reached a new record high, with 35.5 million ETH now locked in liquid staking protocols. At press time, ETH trades at $3,772, down 1% in the past 24 hours.

If you’ve been watching your altcoin portfolio closely, you might have noticed that Bitcoin has been stealing the spotlight. The latest data from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index confirms this sentiment, currently sitting at a score of 38. This figure clearly indicates that we are firmly entrenched in what is known as ‘Bitcoin Season.’ But what exactly does this mean for you, and how should you navigate these shifting tides? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Crypto Compass The Altcoin Season Index is a crucial metric for any cryptocurrency investor. Tracked diligently by CoinMarketCap (CMC), a leading cryptocurrency price data platform, this index provides a clear snapshot of whether the broader crypto market is favoring Bitcoin or the vast array of alternative cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins. Here’s a breakdown of how it works: What it Tracks: The index meticulously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC over the past 90 days. It specifically excludes stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) to ensure a true reflection of market sentiment towards volatile assets. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially declared in Altcoin Season , a significant majority—at least 75%—of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over that 90-day period. This signals a broad-based rally across the altcoin market. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, we enter Bitcoin Season when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates that Bitcoin is the primary driver of market gains, with altcoins generally lagging behind or even losing value relative to BTC. The Score Range: The index scores range from 1 to 100. A higher score leans towards Altcoin Season, while a lower score indicates Bitcoin Season. The current score of 38, as reported at 00:30 UTC on July 30, down one point from the previous day, firmly places us in Bitcoin Season. Why Are We in Bitcoin Season? Unpacking the Dominance The shift from an altcoin-friendly environment to one dominated by Bitcoin isn’t arbitrary. Several powerful factors often contribute to Bitcoin’s resurgence and altcoin underperformance: 1. The Halving Hype and Pre-Halving Accumulation: Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC entering the market, tend to precede significant price rallies. Investors often front-run these events, accumulating Bitcoin in anticipation of future gains. This increased demand, coupled with diminishing supply, naturally drives Bitcoin’s price up, often at a faster rate than altcoins. As the next halving approaches, we often see a ‘flight to quality’ where investors prioritize Bitcoin’s perceived stability and proven track record over the higher risk, higher reward nature of altcoins. 2. Institutional Inflows and Spot ETFs: A significant driver of Bitcoin’s recent dominance has been the increasing institutional adoption. The approval and launch of Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for traditional finance players to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. These large capital inflows tend to concentrate on Bitcoin due to its liquidity, regulatory clarity (relative to many altcoins), and established infrastructure, further solidifying its market cap and dominance. 3. Macroeconomic Headwinds and Risk Aversion: In periods of global economic uncertainty, high inflation, or rising interest rates, investors across all asset classes tend to become more risk-averse. In the crypto space, Bitcoin is often seen as the relatively safer haven compared to the more volatile and speculative altcoin market. This ‘risk-off’ sentiment can lead to capital flowing out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, or even out of the crypto market entirely, with Bitcoin often being the last to see significant outflows. 4. Altcoin Specific Underperformance: While Bitcoin shines, many altcoins might be facing their own challenges. These could include project delays, lack of significant development, waning community interest, regulatory crackdowns on specific categories (like DeFi or NFTs), or simply a rotation of capital out of highly speculative assets. Some altcoins may have experienced parabolic runs in previous cycles and are now undergoing significant corrections or consolidation phases. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Strategies for Astute Investors So, with the Altcoin Season Index screaming ‘Bitcoin Season,’ how should you adjust your strategy? This period isn’t necessarily a time for panic, but rather for strategic re-evaluation. 1. Prioritize Bitcoin and Blue-Chip Altcoins: During Bitcoin Season, it often makes sense to increase your exposure to Bitcoin itself. Its relative stability and consistent performance make it a strong foundational asset. If you still wish to hold altcoins, focus on ‘blue-chip’ altcoins—those with strong fundamentals, established ecosystems, significant market capitalization, and proven utility (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, BNB). These are generally more resilient during Bitcoin-dominated periods. 2. Embrace Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider implementing a Dollar-Cost Averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money into your chosen assets at regular intervals, regardless of their price. DCA helps mitigate the risk of volatility and allows you to accumulate more assets when prices are lower, reducing your average purchase cost over time. 3. Deep Dive into Research and Due Diligence: This period is an excellent opportunity to conduct thorough research on potential altcoin investments. Look beyond hype and examine a project’s whitepaper, team, technology, use case, community engagement, and tokenomics. Understanding a project’s true value proposition will help you identify gems that might outperform when the market eventually shifts back towards altcoins. 4. Rebalance Your Portfolio Strategically: Regularly review your portfolio allocation. If Bitcoin has significantly outperformed your altcoins, your portfolio might have become imbalanced. Consider rebalancing by taking some profits from your Bitcoin holdings (if you’re up) and reallocating to promising altcoins that are currently undervalued or to stablecoins, positioning yourself for the next market shift. When Will Altcoin Season Return? Glimmers of Hope While Bitcoin Season is currently in full swing, market cycles are inherently dynamic. The pendulum will eventually swing back. What could trigger the next Altcoin Season? 1. Bitcoin Consolidation: Often, after a strong Bitcoin rally, its price will consolidate or enter a period of sideways movement. This stability allows capital that flowed into Bitcoin to seek higher returns in altcoins, triggering a new wave of altcoin rallies. 2. Emerging Narratives and Technological Breakthroughs: New sectors or technological advancements within the crypto space can spark significant interest and investment in specific altcoin categories. Think about the rise of DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, or more recently, AI-related tokens and Real World Assets (RWAs). 3. Ethereum’s Performance: As the largest altcoin by far, Ethereum’s performance is a crucial indicator. A strong rally in Ethereum, driven by upgrades (like the upcoming Pectra or Osaka) or increased network activity, often pulls the broader altcoin market along with it. 4. General Market Sentiment Shift: A broader increase in investor risk appetite, perhaps fueled by positive macroeconomic news or significant regulatory clarity, could lead to a renewed enthusiasm for the entire crypto market, benefiting altcoins disproportionately. Comparison: Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season To summarize the core differences, consider this table: Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Altcoin Season Index Score Typically 1-25 (or current 38) Typically 75-100 Dominant Performer Bitcoin 75%+ of Top 100 Altcoins Investor Sentiment Caution, Flight to Quality, Accumulation Risk-on, FOMO, Speculation Typical Market Cap Trend Bitcoin’s dominance grows Altcoins’ collective market cap grows faster than BTC General Strategy Accumulate BTC, focus on blue-chips, research Diversify into promising altcoins, take profits Conclusion: Stay Informed, Stay Strategic The Altcoin Season Index at 38 is a clear signal: Bitcoin is currently leading the charge in the cryptocurrency market. Understanding this dynamic is not about predicting the exact moment of a shift, but rather about equipping yourself with the knowledge to make informed decisions. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a new investor, recognizing the nuances of Bitcoin Season versus Altcoin Season can significantly impact your portfolio’s performance. While the allure of rapid gains from altcoins is strong, the current market environment calls for a more cautious and strategic approach, emphasizing Bitcoin and well-researched altcoin projects. By staying informed about key metrics like the Altcoin Season Index and adapting your strategy accordingly, you can navigate the volatile crypto landscape with greater confidence and position yourself for future success, regardless of which season the market is in. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does the Altcoin Season Index score of 38 mean? A1: An Altcoin Season Index score of 38 indicates that the market is currently in ‘Bitcoin Season.’ This means that fewer than 25% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin is currently the dominant performer. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? A2: The index, tracked by CoinMarketCap, compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. If 75% or more of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, it’s Altcoin Season. If 25% or fewer do, it’s Bitcoin Season. Q3: Is Bitcoin Season a bad time for altcoins? A3: Not necessarily ‘bad,’ but altcoins generally underperform Bitcoin during Bitcoin Season. It means capital is primarily flowing into Bitcoin, and many altcoins may see their value decrease relative to BTC. However, it can also be a good time to accumulate fundamentally strong altcoins at lower prices. Q4: What factors contribute to Bitcoin Season? A4: Key factors include anticipation of Bitcoin halving events, increased institutional adoption (like Bitcoin Spot ETFs), a ‘flight to quality’ during macroeconomic uncertainty, and general underperformance or consolidation phases for many altcoin projects. Q5: When can we expect the next Altcoin Season? A5: Predicting the exact timing is difficult, but potential triggers include Bitcoin entering a period of consolidation, the emergence of strong new narratives or technological breakthroughs in the altcoin space, significant upgrades to major altcoins like Ethereum, or a general increase in market risk appetite.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-says-most-people-will-only-have-dust-of-xrp-at-5-heres-why/,"A prominent XRP community analyst has raised concerns that the token may soon reach a valuation where most retail investors can only afford fractional amounts. Xena, a well-followed voice in the XRP ecosystem, made this claim after the asset finally broke above the $3 price level, following several failed attempts in recent months. Xena’s remarks came shortly after XRP rose to $3.16, a development that marks a significant shift in the asset’s accessibility for everyday investors. She noted that at the current rate, XRP is becoming increasingly difficult to accumulate in meaningful quantities unless one invests a substantial sum of money. $1000 gives you roughly 330 XRP. At only $3, XRP becomes less and less affordable for most people. At $5 only it would be dramatically too high for most – they will only have dust of XRP. Unless you are rich already and $5 doesn't make any difference – we are entering those… — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) July 16, 2025 $1,000 Now Yields Just Over 300 XRP As XRP trades at $3.16, $1,000 would only be enough to purchase approximately 316 tokens. This is a steep decline from what the same amount could have acquired just a year ago. For instance, in July 2024, XRP hovered around $0.48, meaning $1,000 could secure roughly 2083 tokens at that time. The difference in purchasing power highlights a growing concern among community members. Xena emphasized that this trend, if it continues, will make XRP increasingly out of reach for ordinary investors who once viewed it as an accessible entry point into crypto. Community analyst Edoardo Farina shared similar sentiments last month when XRP traded at $2. He argued that the price was already becoming unaffordable for retail participants aiming to build significant holdings. Entering the XRP Rich List Becoming More Difficult Recent data shows that acquiring 2,400 XRP, the approximate threshold to enter the top 10% of XRP holders, has become increasingly difficult for the average retail investor. For context, at the current price of $3.16, purchasing 2,400 XRP would require over $7,500. This amount is out of reach for many individuals earning an average income in countries like the U.S. or the U.K., unless they save consistently over several months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This marks a considerable shift from previous years, when XRP was priced low enough that even modest investments yielded substantial quantities of the token. As the price rises, the gap between casual investors and large holders is widening. Predictions for Continued Price Growth and Reduced Access According to Xena, the token could soon reach $5, which represents a 57% increase from current levels. She believes that at this point, most individuals will no longer be willing or able to purchase XRP in substantial amounts. Instead, their contributions would result in small, fractional holdings that offer limited exposure. She further stated that unless an investor has access to significant capital, XRP is quickly approaching a price range that may be viewed as excessive by those seeking to acquire 1,000 XRP or more. Her comments draw parallels to the early investment patterns of other major cryptocurrencies that saw widespread accumulation followed by a shift to limited ownership as prices surged. Xena’s observations reflect a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space, where rising asset values can price out smaller investors. As XRP continues to appreciate , its affordability may become a barrier to entry for many, potentially altering its appeal among retail participants.

FET, AAVE, Monero & BlockDAG Show Strong Growth",https://thecoinrise.com/which-are-the-good-cryptos-to-invest-in-2025-fet-aave-monero-blockdag-show-strong-growth/,"As the crypto market begins to recover, many traders are paying close attention to good cryptos to invest in 2025. The recent rise in market activity and a more optimistic outlook are drawing attention to coins that show consistent performance and future potential. This week, a few altcoins are standing out thanks to key developments, strong price action, and growing real-world use cases. Leading the charge is BlockDAG, which is rapidly gaining popularity with its presale and utility-based features. Meanwhile, Monero is showing strength despite regulatory concerns, AAVE is rebounding with renewed DeFi interest, and FET remains a strong contender in the AI crypto segment. Let’s take a closer look at what’s powering these good cryptos to invest in 2025. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG continues to hold a strong position among good cryptos to invest in 2025, as its presale numbers speak volumes. The project has now raised over $355 million with more than 24.4 billion BDAG coins sold. The current price per BDAG coin is just $0.0016, available until August 11th. Its listing price remains confirmed at $0.05, offering a possible 3,025% gain for those who enter before the presale closes. There’s more than just price appeal. BlockDAG’s mining ecosystem already supports over 2.5 million users via the X1 mobile miner, while 18,000 X10 home mining devices have been delivered to users. These two tools together increase accessibility and provide boosted daily BDAG rewards. This project runs on a hybrid PoW and DAG model, making it scalable, efficient, and decentralized. BlockDAG also introduced the “No Vesting Pass,” which means all BDAG coins purchased now will be fully unlocked on launch day. That’s a major plus for users wanting immediate access. With early participants already experiencing a 2,660% growth in their holdings since batch 1, BlockDAG (BDAG) clearly stands out among good cryptos to invest in 2025. Monero (XMR) Monero is maintaining its spot on the radar of good cryptos to invest in 2025, even as it faces regulatory hurdles. Currently priced between $322 and $325, Monero recently recovered from a volume dip triggered by Kraken’s partial delisting in some European regions. Despite the pressure, technical indicators suggest a rounded bottom pattern forming, which might open the way for a breakout towards $417 if resistance points are crossed. The privacy-focused coin also saw increased attention following the arrest of a hacker who attempted to use Monero for laundering. This incident highlighted both its privacy strengths and the possible limitations under scrutiny. On-chain data shows that the coin’s core user base remains active and engaged, supporting the ongoing demand. If current chart patterns play out and privacy coins gain further relevance in global debates, Monero could quietly rise as one of the good cryptos to invest in 2025. AAVE (AAVE) AAVE is regaining upward momentum, making its way into the discussion about good cryptos to invest in 2025. Hovering around $297 to $298, AAVE bounced back from $280 support levels after last week’s 9.2% drop. Increased whale buying and a 2.3% rise in 24 hours show signs of recovery with potential to cross the $299 to $300 resistance zone. Its strong base in the DeFi space adds weight to the outlook. With over $30 billion locked in its protocol and recent expansion to the Sonic blockchain, AAVE is strengthening its cross-chain presence and long-term stability. These moves build trust among users and indicate a well-supported future. Caution remains due to phishing concerns and earlier price dips, but its bounce from support and continued project expansion are key reasons AAVE earns a place among the good cryptos to invest in 2025. Artificial SuperIntelligence Alliance (FET) The project formerly known as Fetch.ai, now operating as Artificial SuperIntelligence Alliance, remains high on the list of good cryptos to invest in 2025. Trading around $0.732 to $0.736, FET experienced a brief pullback this week but still holds a lead over many AI-related assets. A 9.7% weekly surge earlier in July confirmed its strong position in the AI crypto sector. FET’s transition into an alliance with SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, and CUDOS has created one of the most extensive decentralized AI partnerships in crypto. Under new marketing leadership and with the debut of a decentralized developer forum, the project signals major future expansion. Experts believe it could break past the $0.83 to $0.87 mark in the coming months. Backed by a $1.7 billion market cap and involvement in both AI and blockchain sectors, FET remains a standout among good cryptos to invest in 2025. It is gaining attention from both institutional players and the tech-savvy public. Final Say! Navigating the market for good cryptos to invest in 2025 means focusing on real use cases and current momentum. This week’s notable names, BlockDAG, Monero, AAVE, and FET, are making moves backed by active communities and solid growth stories. BlockDAG leads the charge with over $355 million raised and a strong mining base. With the No Vesting Pass and 100% unlocked tokens at launch, it offers a rare advantage. Monero continues to prove its resilience, AAVE is growing its DeFi ecosystem, and FET is powering forward in the AI sector. Together, they represent some of the most promising and good cryptos to invest in 2025 . The post Which Are the Good Cryptos to Invest in 2025?

Each has its own narrative, but the common thread driving momentum is the looming expectation of multiple spot ETF approvals. XRP and Solana are now front-runners to follow Ethereum in gaining ETF status, a move that could shift billions in institutional capital their way and potentially spark fresh rallies. While big names dominate the ETF conversation, newer entrants lik e MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging as high-risk , high-reward alternatives . As major players fight for institutional traction, MAGACOIN is attracting retail buzz with explosive potential . Ethereum: Still the Market Leader Ethereum continues to hold the top position in the altcoin space. Trading just above $3,860, ETH has shown strong momentum throughout July. Its daily volume sits above $32 billion, reflecting deep liquidity and continued investor interest. With its ETF already approved, ETH remains the benchmark for how traditional finance could embrace altcoins. Solana and XRP: ETF Optimism Building Solana has rebounded to $192, supported by bullish sentiment around its roadmap and increasing chatter about an upcoming ETF approval. SOL aims to be the backbone of internet capital markets by 2027—a vision that’s gaining traction among institutional investors. XRP, meanwhile, is hovering around $3.22 and has remained in focus following ongoing legal clarity and its own ETF expectations. After reaching $3.60 earlier this month, XRP is now consolidating near key levels as traders await a potential breakout. Investors FOMO for This New Project Amid the ETF-driven rush, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out its own path— growing faster than Solana did in its early days. With analysts now highlighting a 10,500% ROI opportunity, the project’s presale rounds are closing at record speed . Unlike older altcoins competing for ETF approvals, MAGACOIN is drawing retail attention by offering early-stage access to a fast-developing ecosystem. The limited entry window and rapid presale progress suggest smart money is already positioning for a major move. Conclusion With ETF hype lighting up the charts, Ethereum remains the anchor, while XRP and Solana could lead the next altcoin rally if approvals go through. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight among early-stage investment opportunities, offering rare upside at a moment when institutional focus is elsewhere.

Titled the 21st Century Mortgage Act, the bill proposes that cryptocurrency be recognized as a legitimate asset for mortgage applications, allowing digital asset holders to use their crypto as collateral when applying for single-family loans. This legislative action comes after the US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a June directive advising federal mortgage agencies to explore crypto assets in reviewing mortgage applications. Lummis’s bill would enshrine this guidance into law, officially incorporating digital assets into the American housing finance system. Lummis said on Tuesday that the bill adopts a modern approach to building wealth and highlighted that, even for those who do not invest in digital assets, they likely know someone who does. She added that the bill aims to promote economic inclusion and reflects current trends in accumulating wealth, particularly among younger investors. Lummis cited a recent US Census Bureau report that found, as of the first quarter of 2025, just 36% of Americans aged 35 and younger own homes compared with older age groups. She contends that permitting crypto to count as mortgage collateral could carve out new avenues to homeownership for this digitally savvy segment of Americans. If approved, borrowers would not be required to convert their crypto holdings into fiat currency. Instead, the value of the crypto assets could be directly valued or considered when assessing the mortgage application. This could enable buyers to not risk out on potential asset growth by selling their tokens to be eligible for a home loan. Democrats question crypto risk in housing loans That logic does not go over well with some lawmakers, however. Senate Democrats push back on proposed implementation of digital assets in the US housing market. They say cryptocurrency is still far too volatile, illiquid, and unpredictable for it to be considered stable collateral for long-term loans , such as mortgage payments. In a letter dated July 24, a group of Senate Democrats expressed concern to FHFA Director William Pulte about the potential financial risks of the policy. They warned that, even as the crypto market matures, ongoing volatility and liquidity issues could make it difficult for borrowers to exit their crypto positions and convert assets into cash at prices sufficient to support their mortgage obligations. The members requested a full risk assessment, recommending that the FHFA consider the broader implications of digital assets in the traditional housing finance system. They also cautioned that crypto-based mortgage lending could inadvertently drive up the price of homes, exacerbate speculation in the market, or destabilize parts of the economy if the values of cryptocurrencies unexpectedly plummet. Congress pushes forward crypto mortgage bills Other crypto-centric bills are currently making their way through Congress, as part of a larger trend toward regulating and mainstreaming digital assets in US financial law. Ms. Lummis also sponsored a separate Republican bill to establish a full market structure for digital assets. That bill carves out SEC and CFTC roles and offers regulatory clarity for crypto exchanges, token issuers, and investors. Another bill gaining traction — especially among conservatives — would prohibit the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC) based on privacy and government overreach concerns. The House passed this bill and may come up in the Senate in the fall, after the August recess. The House version of Lummis’ mortgage bill, which is also called the American Homeowner Crypto Modernization Act , was introduced on July 14 by Representative Nancy Mace. Mace’s legislation requires mortgage lenders to consider digital assets in their underwriting if borrowers have assets in crypto brokerage accounts. Global events are stoking momentum as well. In July, Australian company Block Earner said it would offer Bitcoin-backed mortgages. The rollout was facilitated by a legal victory after the Federal Court of Australia decided that the firm’s crypto loan products should not be regarded as financial products under the current legislation.

These colossal holders of digital assets have the power to influence market sentiment and price action with their significant transactions. Recently, the crypto community has been buzzing about an extraordinary accumulation spree by one such entity, signaling potentially strong confidence in the future of Ethereum. Who is This Mysterious Ethereum Whale and What Are They Doing? Imagine a financial titan quietly making moves that ripple across the entire market. That’s precisely what’s happening with an Ethereum whale address, specifically one starting with 0x3dF. According to diligent on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, this particular address has been on an aggressive buying spree, demonstrating a remarkable commitment to Ethereum. Just recently, this mysterious entity added another 12,000 ETH to its massive holdings, a transaction valued at an impressive $45.01 million. What makes this even more compelling is that this significant purchase was facilitated via Galaxy Digital, a prominent financial services and investment management company in the digital asset space. This connection raises interesting questions about the nature of the whale – is it an individual, an institution, or a fund? The latest acquisition is merely a continuation of a larger trend. Since July 19, this same Ethereum whale has accumulated a staggering 112,972 ETH over an 11-day period. At current valuations, this amounts to approximately $413 million. The average purchase price during this intense accumulation phase stands at $3,662, suggesting a calculated strategy rather than impulsive buying. To put this into perspective, here’s a quick overview of the whale’s recent activity: Metric Details Whale Address (Partial) 0x3dF… Latest Accumulation 12,000 ETH ($45.01 million) Acquisition Platform Galaxy Digital Accumulation Period 11 days (since July 19) Total ETH Accumulated 112,972 ETH Total Value Accumulated $413 million Average Purchase Price $3,662 Why Does an Ethereum Whale’s Movements Matter So Much? The actions of an Ethereum whale are not just interesting anecdotes; they are significant market indicators. Here’s why: Market Sentiment: When a large holder accumulates substantial amounts of an asset, it often signals strong bullish sentiment. It suggests that those with significant capital believe the asset’s price will appreciate in the future. This can instill confidence in smaller investors. Price Impact: Massive buy orders create demand, which can directly push up the price of an asset. While a single purchase might not cause a dramatic spike, consistent accumulation over days or weeks, as seen with this Ethereum whale , creates sustained buying pressure. Institutional Interest: The involvement of entities like Galaxy Digital suggests that institutional players or sophisticated investors are behind these moves. Institutional participation is often seen as a sign of maturity and legitimacy for the crypto market, attracting more traditional finance players. Liquidity Dynamics: Whales can absorb significant portions of available supply, reducing liquidity and potentially making the asset more susceptible to price swings if they later decide to sell. Tracking such movements provides valuable insights into potential market trends and investor confidence. It’s like peeking into the minds of the market’s biggest players. Decoding the Ethereum Whale’s Strategy: What Can We Learn? This particular Ethereum whale ‘s accumulation at an average price of $3,662 suggests a strategic entry point, potentially anticipating further price appreciation for ETH. But what could be their ultimate goal? Long-Term Holding (HODLing): The sheer volume and consistent accumulation over 11 days point towards a long-term investment strategy. This whale might be positioning themselves for future Ethereum developments, such as scaling solutions or increased institutional adoption, expecting ETH to reach significantly higher valuations. Staking Rewards: Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) allows ETH holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards. A large accumulation could be aimed at becoming a major validator, earning passive income from network security. DeFi Participation: With such a substantial amount of ETH, the whale could be looking to participate in various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, leveraging their assets for lending, borrowing, or yield farming opportunities. Market Conviction: The commitment of $413 million implies strong conviction in Ethereum’s underlying technology and its ecosystem. This kind of investment is not made lightly and usually follows extensive research and analysis. For everyday investors, understanding the motivations behind such large accumulations can be enlightening. It underscores the potential perceived value of Ethereum by those with deep pockets. However, it’s crucial to remember that while following an Ethereum whale can be insightful, it should not be the sole basis for your investment decisions. What Are the Challenges and Considerations When Observing Ethereum Whale Activity? While fascinating, tracking an Ethereum whale comes with its own set of challenges and caveats: Anonymity: Blockchain addresses are pseudonymous. While we can see the transactions, we don’t know the identity of the person or entity behind the 0x3dF address. This makes it impossible to fully understand their overall financial situation or their complete strategy. Not Always Right: Even whales can make mistakes. Market conditions can change rapidly, and large positions can suffer significant losses if trends reverse unexpectedly. Blindly copying a whale’s moves without your own research is a risky strategy. Market Manipulation: In some cases, large transactions can be part of a broader strategy to manipulate the market, creating artificial demand or supply. While there’s no indication of this here, it’s a general risk to be aware of. Liquidation Risks: If a whale uses borrowed funds for their accumulation, a sudden market downturn could lead to liquidation events, which can further exacerbate price drops. Therefore, while observing an Ethereum whale ‘s activities provides valuable data, it’s essential to integrate this information with a broader understanding of market fundamentals, technical analysis, and your own risk tolerance. The consistent accumulation by this particular Ethereum whale is a testament to the ongoing interest and confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. Whether driven by long-term vision, staking ambitions, or DeFi opportunities, such significant movements highlight the vibrant and evolving nature of the crypto market. As the digital asset space continues to mature, on-chain analysis remains an indispensable tool for understanding the forces at play and the strategies of its most influential participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Ethereum whale in cryptocurrency? An Ethereum whale refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency. Their holdings are significant enough that their buying or selling activities can notably impact the market price and sentiment of ETH. Why is this specific Ethereum whale’s accumulation significant? The accumulation of 112,972 ETH ($413 million) over just 11 days by a single address is significant because it demonstrates strong conviction in Ethereum’s future.

The ABC reported Tuesday that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and communication minister Anika Wells would announce the move on Wednesday. The move would bring YouTube abruptly into the company of major social networks, such as TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat, as potential targets of the proposed regulations. Due to coming into force as early as the end of 2025, the ban will prevent children from setting up or using accounts on popular social media sites where parent or guardian consent is not included as a requirement offered by the service. The announcement comes as the internet companies face mounting pressure over young people’s safety online, including their use of social media and its effects on mental health and exposure to harmful content. YouTube was not originally included in the roundup of platforms that the legislation would apply to. The exclusion had resulted in numerous complaints from rivals in the tech industry and safety advocates. It also raises long-term questions about the fairness and effectiveness of the law that is now being considered. Regulators demand better protections for kids The government’s decision to expand the codes to YouTube is a response to years of pressure from multiple quarters, including inside and outside the tech industry. Regulators, including the eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, have warned that not including YouTube would leave a gaping loophole in shielding children from the worst of the digital world. YouTube is often the first platform young Australians use for learning, entertainment, and social interaction. However, it has also become a major channel through which harmful content reaches this age group. Excluding it from regulation would undermine the effectiveness of the entire policy. The row intensified last month when it was revealed that the then-communications minister, Michelle Rowland, had secretly reassured Google executives, who own YouTube, that their platform would not fall under the new rules. The personal pledge , previously reported, drew outrage and questions about transparency and influence in creating policy. Competing firms, including Meta Platforms Inc. (the parent company of Facebook and Instagram), Snap Inc. (Snapchat), and TikTok, reportedly pushed back, arguing that the law would need to be applied uniformly across all platforms to be effective. Firms must act to restrict under-16 access While the new restrictions aim to keep online spaces safer for children , they are also fraught with enforcement issues. Minister Wells acknowledged that tech-savvy young users will look for a way around the restriction. “Kids will find workarounds, God bless them, we know they will,” Wells told ABC on Wednesday. “Platforms must take reasonable steps to try and stop that from happening.” Online companies must also have the strongest age verification and parental consent system under the law. Though specific enforcement mechanisms are yet to be worked out, companies that defy the rules could be hit with hefty fines. The ban will spare YouTube Kids, an app built not only for kids, but with parental controls and curated content. The government says it will give parents a safer alternative for finding child-friendly materials online. The response has been mixed from digital rights activists and parents. Some celebrate it as a move to rein in cyberbullying, oversharing, and addictive content for children. Critics of these efforts argue that heavy regulation could put up barriers to popular educational and creative tools, which students use widely. Even so, the step will put Australia at the vanguard of an emerging global trend. Governments worldwide, from the United States to the UK, from other European Union member countries, are mulling stricter digital protections for children.

In an audio recording obtained by CNBC , Pichai pointed out that earlier, when companies experienced a period of massive investment, they responded by adding more workforce. However, the CEO stated that this has taken a new shift with the increased adoption of AI in the sector. In this AI era, he anticipated that the technology needs to be applied in the company’s daily operations for a firm to achieve more success in its productivity. Several tech companies embrace AI in their productivity There is a widespread trend among tech companies that invest significant amounts in constructing large data centers that can support huge AI models and manage heavy workloads. The companies are trying to reduce costs in other areas to achieve this significant investment . An example of this tech company is Google. According to recently released reports, it is eyeing an investment of around $85 billion to boost capital expenditures this year. This is a 10% increase from the last investment of around $75 billion. During a meeting, Pichai highlighted that the competition in the tech sector has become stiffer. According to his research, some firms will prioritize enhancing their employee productivity, urging that this is a good strategy; hence, they should consider it too. Similar to Google, Amazon has also shifted its focus towards AI. Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon, shared a message with the employees, mentioning that since the company has increasingly adopted AI generative tools and agents, it will soon lay off some corporate staff. In the meantime, Jassy urged the employees to quickly explore using AI tools in productivity and teach themselves how to work effectively with fewer people in their teams. The same month, Julia Liuson, the president of the Developer Division at Microsoft, addressed employees, stating that at this time, adopting AI in their daily operations was not an option. This came after Tobi Lutke, the CEO of Shopify, pointed out that tech companies expect their employees to learn to use AI in their daily operations quickly. Afterwards, Lutke stated that before teams request additional staff or resources, they should explain why they cannot achieve their goals using AI. Google lays off its workforce to significantly invest in AI Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has significantly reduced its workforce in the past few months. To illustrate, in 2023, it started off with around 191,000 full-time workers. This figure drastically dropped to around 187,000 as per last month’s data. Even if it has increased its workforce, it is only a very small percentage, reports from sources reveal. Concerning its layoff, Google began cutting off 6% of its workforce in 2023 across various departments. This did not stop at this point; it has embraced the trend to date. Analysis from sources revealed that Google has continued reducing its workforce since the year began, while giving employees buyouts. In a statement, Pichai expressed that this is a time to make significant investments, and therefore, caution should be exercised while managing the company’s resources. Concerning Google’s advancements in AI, the CEO mentioned that he was pleased with the progress as it aligned with his goals: to improve the firm’s effectiveness and productivity. Google declined to respond to a request for comment immediately.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. On Wednesday in the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that investors are now allowed to do in-kind redemptions for bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The decision lets institutional traders create and redeem ETF shares directly in BTC or ETH, improving efficiency by avoiding fiat conversions. But in Hong Kong, this isn't anything new. In late 2023, during the early days of the regulatory process to bring crypto ETFs to the market (they launched in April 2024), the Securities and Futures Commission – the city's markets regulator – mentioned in a circular that in-kind redemptions would be allowed. Part of the reason why they were allowed was a technical one: ETF issuers were required to partner with licensed local crypto exchanges and use custody solutions. This wasn't the case in Ontario, Canada, which had crypto ETFs first, nor the U.S. In Hong Kong there wasn't the same debate about the status of Ether as a security as there was in the U.S. In contrast, U.S. regulators wrestled with concerns over custody, anti-money laundering risks, and potential market manipulation. While the SEC never explicitly banned in-kind redemptions, ETF sponsors were required to remove them from early filings . The Commission favored a cash-only approach as a cautious first step, citing untested operational processes and uncertainty over how to securely settle large crypto transfers. That stance wasn’t without internal pushback. SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda publicly criticized the agency’s approach during the January 2024 approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. He pointed out that commodity-based ETFs, like those backed by gold, routinely use in-kind redemptions and questioned why crypto was being treated differently. Uyeda argued that the SEC failed to explain why it considered cash-only redemptions “non-novel,” despite the clear deviation from standard ETF practice, and warned that the lack of reasoning set a troubling precedent. The episode highlights how Hong Kong’s regulator moved with greater clarity and cohesion from the start as it brought these products to market. By enabling in-kind redemptions early on, and pairing them with strict licensing and custody requirements, the SFC avoided the internal contradictions and policy drift that defined the U.S. rollout. However, there's going to be one side effect from all of this: tracking flows. Crypto data aggregator SoSoValue , which provides daily flow updates for crypto ETFs, warns that ""subscriptions of physical bitcoin do not generate cash inflows for the [ETFs], so they cannot be simply counted in daily net inflow statistics."" They've tried to create methods and models to work around this, but say they have been unsuccessful so far. So unless ETF issuers in the U.S. publish daily flow in cash and crypto, tracking this metric is going to be an issue. And it's an important one to track, as it shows investor sentiment for the asset class. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin is trading above $117,500 after a modest rebound, but momentum remains weak as ETF outflows persist, whales take profit near $118K, and macro headwinds, including a firm dollar and hawkish Fed expectations, continue to limit upside. ETH: ETH is trading above $3,700. ""Ethereum has proven in parallel with BTC since its inception to be the second most battle-tested network, and very likely institutions now see Ether the token as a formidable asymmetric bet alongside bitcoin,"" said March Zheng, General Partner of Bizantine Capital, in a note to CoinDesk. Gold: Gold rebounded to $3,334 on Tuesday, snapping a four-day losing streak ahead of the Fed meeting, as traders priced in steady rates despite weak U.S. job data Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed as U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed Trump’s Friday tariff deadline will proceed as planned, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 flat at the open. S&P 500: U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending a six-day record streak, as investors weighed earnings, economic data, and the upcoming Fed rate decision.

SEI Price Signal Points to Bull Flag Breakout With Eyes on $0.27 SEI just broke out of a bull flag pattern, sending out a strong SEI price signal. After weeks of tight range trading, the breakout has turned heads, and now, traders are targeting $0.27 as the next key level. This move comes as SEI continues to grow as a Layer 1 network with fast execution and efficient parallel processing. Its appeal to developers and traders is rising, aligning perfectly with the recent price action. Beyond the chart, SEI is onboarding more users and supporting new protocol launches. With fundamentals matching the momentum, this breakout may not just be a flash in the pan, it could be the start of a bigger leg higher if the volume continues to build. BlockDAG’s X1 App Rockets to 2.5M Users as Ecosystem Expansion Accelerates BlockDAG’s X1 mining app just hit a massive milestone, 2.5 million users. That’s not hype, that’s real adoption in action. This surge reflects a growing wave of daily miners fully engaged with the platform, and the momentum isn’t slowing down. A recent demo showed how combining the X1 app with the X10 hardware miner can boost daily rewards from 20 BDAG to 200 BDAG, a 10x increase that’s catching serious attention across the crypto world. As adoption climbs fast, so does presale demand. BlockDAG has already raised over $355 million, moved 24.4 billion coins, and delivered 18,860+ miners around the globe. With Batch 29 now priced at $0.0276, the limited-time $0.0016 offer remains open until August 11, offering a shot at 3,025% ROI before the $0.05 launch. This isn’t just about impressive numbers, it’s about real-world usage and rapid scaling. BlockDAG is rolling out products that users are actually mining with. The upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11 will take the project mainstream. With surging adoption, layered tech, and real results, BlockDAG is staking its place among the most bullish crypto coins of the year. Summing Up PEPE’s rally highlights the meme coin revival, and the new PEPE price pattern could signal more upside. SEI’s breakout and bullish SEI price signal show growing trader interest in scalable Layer 1 chains. Both offer short-term moves, but neither match the full package that BlockDAG delivers. BlockDAG combines long-term utility with immediate upside. With a $355M raise, real user growth, and mining rewards that scale, it’s doing more than just riding momentum. The $0.0016 price paired with a hard-coded $0.05 launch offers up to 3,025% ROI, giving buyers a rare opportunity. As August 11 draws closer, BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release is shaping up to be one of the year’s biggest crypto moments. And for those watching bullish crypto coins , this may be the play they can’t afford to miss.

Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Major Surge For Ethereum Price, Eyeing $4,000 In Its Best July Yet This spike follows the recent passage of the Guiding and Empowering Nation’s Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act on July 18, signaling a pivotal shift in regulatory clarity and institutional confidence in the sector. Google Data: Parabolic Growth and Market Dominance Data from Coingecko shows that the stablecoin market cap now stands at $272 billion, representing roughly 7% of the total cryptocurrency market. U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins account for about 98% of this total, with Tether maintaining its dominance at 60%. In the meantime, as stablecoin activity increases, the Bitcoin price trends to the upside as seen on the chart below. Bitcoin price trends to the upside as stablecoin activity heats up. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitwise Asset Management reported record-breaking stablecoin transactions and issuance across 2025, prompting crypto analysts to call the market’s trajectory “parabolic.” Ethereum-based firm SharpLink summed up the sentiment in a viral post: “You can’t spell ‘stablecoins’ without ‘parabolic.'” GENIUS Act Sparks Institutional Adoption The GENIUS Act, hailed for providing much-needed regulatory structure, has ignited a wave of interest from both retail users and financial institutions. Companies like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood have launched or explored their own stablecoins, aiming to offer 24/7 funding, faster settlements, and increased user engagement. Nassar Al Achkar, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinW exchange, explained that stablecoins are emerging as a “hedge against crypto volatility” and a valuable tool for cross-border payments. “Institutions are entering the space not just for innovation, but for safer investor options,” he added. Stablecoins’ Speculation Set to Change to Foundation The surge in search interest, as measured by Google, and market activity shows a significant transformation in how stablecoins are perceived, from speculative digital assets to foundational elements in global finance.

With institutional interest rising and a fresh cycle looming, 2025 might reward those who position themselves early in high-potential assets. XRP and Binance Coin are once again in focus—but a newer entrant is starting to build serious buzz among early movers. Just like XRP captured attention during its breakout years, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now drawing comparisons thanks to its rapid presale growth and aggressive utility rollout. Early supporters believe it could follow a similar path, especially with analysts projecting a major surge. XRP: Regulatory Tailwinds Could Fuel a Rally XRP has been one of the most closely watched assets in crypto, especially after Ripple’s almost certain victory over the SEC. The token is gaining momentum on the back of ETF speculation, with many in the space expecting XRP to follow Ethereum and Bitcoin with its own fund listing soon. This development could open the door to mainstream adoption, driving demand from institutional players that have so far remained on the sidelines. A Newcomer With 50x Potential While XRP continues to battle for its place in the regulated crypto space, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already gaining traction at record speed. According to experts, its growth curve has even outpaced XRP ’s early adoption rate. With limited allocations remaining, investors are scrambling to get in before the next price tier hits. Those who secure a position now could see $1,000 grow to $50,000 if projections hold, making it one of the most explosive opportunities in the market. Each stage is filling up faster than the last, as both retail and early institutional buyers race for entry. Binance Coin: Utility Keeps It Relevant Despite facing regulatory pressure in some regions, Binance continues to dominate global trading volumes. Its native token, BNB, remains at the heart of the platform’s ecosystem—powering discounted trading, launchpads, and gas fees on Binance Smart Chain. With the exchange continuing to expand its reach, BNB is likely to benefit from increased transaction volume and long-term user growth, even in a tougher regulatory climate. Recently BNB even hit a new all-time high (ATH) above $850. Conclusion Between XRP’s ETF-driven potential, Binance Coin’s unmatched utility, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale growth, these three tokens represent different tiers of opportunity heading into 2025. For investors hunting the next breakout success, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current pace and projections stand out as a rare early-stage chance .

Imagine an investor who not only foresaw but profited significantly from one of the most tumultuous events in crypto history – the collapse of Terra and its token LUNA. Now, this very same entity, often dubbed smart money crypto , is making headlines again, this time with a substantial acquisition of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Ethereum (ETH) totaling an impressive $9.765 million. What does this strategic maneuver tell us about the current market landscape, and what lessons can we glean from such seasoned players? Who is this “Smart Money Crypto” Investor? The investor in question isn’t a celebrity trader or a well-known institution, but rather a specific on-chain address identified by astute analysts like @ai_9684xtpa on X (formerly Twitter). This address first gained notoriety for its uncanny ability to short Bitcoin (BTC) just before the catastrophic implosion of the Terra-LUNA ecosystem, netting a staggering $5.16 million in profits. Their foresight during such a volatile period cemented their reputation as a true smart money crypto entity, capable of anticipating major market shifts. Their recent activity paints a fascinating picture: over a mere nine hours, this address executed a series of significant purchases. This isn’t just a random accumulation; it’s a calculated deployment of capital into two of the most foundational assets in the crypto space. Such rapid, large-scale movements from an address with a proven track record inevitably spark curiosity and discussion across the crypto community. Unpacking the Strategic Moves: Why WBTC and ETH? The choice of assets – Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Ethereum (ETH) – is particularly telling. These aren’t speculative altcoins but rather the titans of the crypto world, often considered the digital equivalents of blue-chip stocks. The total acquisition stands at $9.765 million, with a detailed breakdown provided by on-chain analysis: Ethereum (ETH): A total of 1,362.8 ETH was acquired. Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems, offering unparalleled utility and a robust development community. Its upcoming upgrades, particularly those enhancing scalability and efficiency, position it for continued growth. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): A significant portion of the acquisition involved WBTC, with 643.19 ETH being converted from WBTC. WBTC is an ERC-20 token representing Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing Bitcoin’s value to be used within Ethereum’s DeFi applications. The average purchase price for WBTC was approximately $117,993, while ETH was acquired at an average price of $3,757.25. This conversion from WBTC to ETH suggests a potential rebalancing or a strategic shift within their portfolio, possibly to capitalize on Ethereum’s ecosystem growth or anticipated performance. This focus on established, high-liquidity assets suggests a long-term, fundamental belief in their value proposition rather than a short-term speculative play. It indicates that even after profiting from market downturns, this smart money crypto investor is confident in the foundational strength of these leading cryptocurrencies. The Anatomy of a Smart Money Crypto Play Understanding how this investor operates requires a brief dive into the concepts of shorting and on-chain analysis: What is Shorting? Shorting, or “short selling,” is an investment strategy where an investor borrows an asset (in this case, Bitcoin) and sells it, expecting its price to fall. If the price does drop, they buy it back at a lower price, return the borrowed asset, and pocket the difference. The investor’s ability to successfully short BTC right before the Terra-LUNA collapse demonstrated a keen understanding of market fragility and impending volatility. What is On-Chain Analysis? On-chain analysis involves examining data directly from a blockchain’s public ledger. This includes transaction volumes, active addresses, large wallet movements, and exchange inflows/outflows. By meticulously tracking these data points, analysts can identify patterns and behaviors of significant market participants, often referred to as “whales” or, in this case, smart money crypto . The transparency of blockchains allows for unprecedented insight into market dynamics that traditional financial markets often lack. The fact that this investor’s moves are identifiable and tracked highlights the power of on-chain data. It provides a unique window into the strategies of those who consistently make profitable decisions. Navigating Market Signals: What Can We Learn from Smart Money Crypto? While blindly following any single investor is never advisable, the actions of proven smart money crypto can offer valuable insights. Their moves often precede broader market trends or indicate a shift in sentiment among large holders. Here’s what we can potentially learn: Conviction in Blue-Chips: The strong buy into WBTC and ETH suggests a belief in their long-term value and resilience, even amidst broader market uncertainties. Risk Assessment: Their prior success in shorting during a crash demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of risk and market cycles, indicating they are not merely chasing hype but making calculated decisions. Strategic Rebalancing: The conversion of WBTC to ETH could signal a shift in strategic focus or an anticipation of stronger performance from Ethereum’s ecosystem in the near term. It’s crucial to remember that market conditions are constantly evolving, and what worked in the past may not guarantee future success. However, observing the moves of such experienced players can certainly inform one’s own research and decision-making process. Challenges and Considerations for Following Smart Money While the allure of mirroring successful investors is strong, there are several challenges and considerations: Lag Time: On-chain data is public, but by the time a significant move is identified and reported, the opportunity for the average investor might have diminished due to price changes. Context is Key: You see the “what” (the purchase) but not necessarily the “why” (the full rationale, the investor’s overall portfolio, their hedging strategies, or their long-term goals). Market Impact: Large trades by smart money can themselves influence prices, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy or a temporary surge that might not be sustainable. Different Risk Appetites: A large investor might have a much higher risk tolerance and capital base than an individual, making their strategies unsuitable for everyone. Therefore, while observing smart money crypto is informative, it should always be part of a broader, well-researched investment strategy, not the sole basis for decisions. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Journey So, how can you leverage these observations for your own investment strategy? Stay Informed with On-Chain Analysis: Follow reputable on-chain analysts and platforms that track significant wallet movements. Understanding these flows can provide early indicators of market sentiment shifts. Focus on Fundamentals: The smart money’s preference for WBTC and ETH reinforces the importance of strong fundamentals. Invest in projects with clear utility, robust technology, and active development. Practice Risk Management: Diversify your portfolio, never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Develop Your Own Thesis: Use smart money moves as a data point, but always conduct your own due diligence. Understand why you are investing in a particular asset. Learn from Market Cycles: The investor’s success during the Terra-LUNA crash highlights the importance of understanding market cycles, identifying overvalued assets, and preparing for potential downturns. These principles, combined with a keen eye on the market’s leading indicators, can empower you to make more informed decisions in your crypto journey. Summary: A Glimpse into Strategic Crypto Investment The latest moves by the anonymous smart money crypto investor serve as a powerful reminder of the strategic depth within the cryptocurrency markets. From profiting handsomely during a historic crash to now deploying nearly $10 million into foundational assets like WBTC and ETH, their actions underscore a sophisticated approach to navigating market volatility. While we can’t replicate their exact strategies, observing such impactful trades provides invaluable insights into potential market trends and the enduring appeal of high-quality digital assets. It highlights the power of on-chain analysis in uncovering hidden market dynamics and reinforces the importance of fundamental strength in long-term crypto investments. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these seasoned players can offer a unique perspective on where the smart money is heading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is “smart money” in crypto? In cryptocurrency, “smart money” typically refers to experienced, well-informed investors or institutions with a proven track record of making profitable trades. They often have access to superior information, advanced analytical tools (like on-chain analysis), or simply a deeper understanding of market dynamics, allowing them to anticipate trends and make strategic moves before the broader market. How did this specific investor profit from the Terra-Luna crash? This investor reportedly profited by “shorting” Bitcoin (BTC) just prior to the Terra-Luna collapse. Shorting involves borrowing an asset, selling it, and then buying it back at a lower price to return it, profiting from the price difference. Their timing indicates a remarkable foresight into the market’s impending downturn during that period. Why are WBTC and ETH considered strategic buys for smart money crypto? WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) and ETH (Ethereum) are considered blue-chip cryptocurrencies. WBTC brings Bitcoin’s value to the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, offering liquidity and utility. Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform, foundational to DeFi, NFTs, and numerous dApps. Their strong fundamentals, widespread adoption, and continuous development make them relatively stable and high-potential assets for long-term strategic investment, even for smart money crypto . Is it always wise to follow smart money crypto moves? While observing smart money moves can provide valuable insights, it’s not always wise to blindly follow them. There can be a lag between their trades and public knowledge, and their strategies might not align with an individual’s risk tolerance, capital, or investment goals. It’s crucial to use their actions as one data point among many, conducting your own thorough research and due diligence. What is on-chain analysis, and how does it help identify smart money? On-chain analysis involves examining publicly available data directly from a blockchain, such as transaction volumes, wallet balances, and large transfers. By analyzing these patterns, analysts can track the movements of significant market participants (“whales” or “smart money”), identify accumulation or distribution phases, and gain insights into market sentiment and potential future price movements.

Renowned for its focus on disruptive innovation, Ark Invest has once again turned heads with a significant and strategic investment in BitMine Immersion Technologies. This isn’t just a minor portfolio adjustment; it’s a bold declaration of confidence in the burgeoning crypto ecosystem, particularly as Ark Invest deepens its exposure to crypto-related equities. For investors keen on understanding the pulse of institutional adoption in the digital frontier, this move offers compelling insights into the evolving landscape. What’s Behind Ark Invest’s Strategic BitMine Share Acquisitions? The recent activity from Ark Invest underscores a deliberate and aggressive pivot towards companies deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space. On July 29, Ark Invest added another $15.3 million worth of BitMine Immersion Technologies shares to its portfolio. This substantial purchase came hot on the heels of a $20 million acquisition just the day before, as reported by The Block. Such back-to-back, multi-million dollar investments signal a clear and urgent intent. When we zoom out, the scale of Ark Invest’s commitment becomes even more apparent. Over the span of just one week, the firm has accumulated an astonishing $182 million in BitMine shares. This rapid accumulation isn’t coincidental; it’s a calculated move to significantly increase Ark Invest’s exposure to crypto-related equities. But why BitMine, specifically? The answer lies in BitMine’s compelling fundamentals and its strategic positioning within the crypto world. The company recently disclosed holding more than $2 billion in Ethereum, one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This substantial Ethereum treasury provides Ark Invest with indirect, yet significant, exposure to the performance of a major digital asset without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself in certain funds. Furthermore, BitMine has also announced a robust $1 billion share buyback program, a move often interpreted by the market as a strong signal of confidence from a company’s management in its own valuation and future prospects. This program could potentially boost shareholder value by reducing the number of outstanding shares, making the remaining shares more valuable. Let’s look at the recent acquisitions: Date Investment Amount Cumulative Weekly Investment July 28 $20 million – July 29 $15.3 million – Since last week – $182 million How Does BitMine Immersion Technologies Fit into Ark Invest’s Innovation Thesis? Ark Invest, under Cathie Wood’s leadership, is not just about investing in ""tech""; it’s about identifying and capitalizing on ""disruptive innovation."" BitMine Immersion Technologies, as its name suggests, is at the forefront of advanced cryptocurrency mining, utilizing immersion cooling techniques. This technology offers significant advantages in terms of energy efficiency, operational stability, and scalability for large-scale crypto mining operations. In a world increasingly focused on sustainability and efficiency, BitMine’s approach aligns perfectly with the kind of forward-thinking companies Ark Invest seeks out. Beyond the operational aspects, BitMine’s substantial Ethereum holdings are a critical piece of the puzzle. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi), represents a cornerstone of the broader Web3 movement. By investing in BitMine, Ark Invest gains exposure to the potential upside of Ethereum without directly navigating the complexities of holding the digital asset itself within all its funds. This strategy allows Ark to benefit from the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem while maintaining a focus on publicly traded equities, which can offer certain liquidity and regulatory advantages for institutional investors. The $1 billion share buyback program further solidifies BitMine’s appeal. A share buyback signals that management believes its stock is undervalued and is willing to invest its own capital to reduce outstanding shares, thereby increasing earnings per share and potentially boosting the stock price. For Ark Invest, this indicates a well-managed company with strong financial health and a commitment to shareholder returns, making it an even more attractive long-term holding. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market and Investors? The actions of prominent institutional investors like Ark Invest often serve as a bellwether for broader market sentiment and future trends. When Ark Invest makes such a substantial bet on a crypto-related equity, it sends a powerful signal of validation to the entire digital asset space. Here’s what it could mean: Increased Institutional Confidence: Ark Invest’s move could encourage other institutional players, who might have been hesitant, to explore similar investments in crypto-related companies. This trickle-down effect can lead to greater capital inflow into the sector. Focus on Crypto-Related Equities: While direct crypto investments are popular, this highlights the growing importance of publicly traded companies that provide exposure to the digital asset economy. These equities can offer a more traditional investment vehicle for those seeking crypto exposure with established corporate structures. Positive Sentiment for Ethereum: BitMine’s significant Ethereum holdings mean that Ark Invest is indirectly betting on Ethereum’s long-term value. This could contribute to positive sentiment around ETH, especially among investors who follow institutional moves. Validation of Mining Infrastructure: The investment validates the importance of robust and efficient mining infrastructure providers like BitMine, recognizing them as crucial components of the blockchain ecosystem. This strategic positioning by Ark Invest also aligns with the ongoing narrative of increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. As regulatory frameworks evolve and the technology matures, more traditional investment firms are finding innovative ways to participate in the digital asset revolution. This isn’t just about price speculation; it’s about investing in the foundational layers and key players that are building the future of finance and technology. Navigating the Opportunities and Challenges of Crypto Equities While Ark Invest’s move is undoubtedly exciting, it’s important to approach investments in crypto equities with a balanced perspective, understanding both the opportunities and the potential challenges. Opportunities: Diversified Crypto Exposure: Investing in companies like BitMine offers a way to gain exposure to the crypto market without directly holding volatile digital assets. This can be appealing for institutional investors or those seeking a more regulated investment vehicle. Leverage to Growth: Companies involved in crypto mining, infrastructure, or services can offer leveraged exposure to the growth of the underlying crypto market. As the crypto economy expands, so too can the revenues and profits of these companies. Professional Management: Investing in publicly traded companies means benefiting from professional management teams, established business models, and often, greater transparency compared to direct crypto investments. Potential for Dividends/Buybacks: Unlike direct crypto holdings, equities can offer traditional shareholder returns like dividends or share buyback programs, enhancing overall investor returns. Challenges: Correlation to Crypto Prices: While not direct, the performance of crypto-related equities is often highly correlated with the underlying cryptocurrency prices. A downturn in Bitcoin or Ethereum can significantly impact these stocks. Operational Risks: Companies like BitMine face operational risks such as energy costs, hardware depreciation, technological obsolescence, and the complexities of managing large-scale mining operations. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related businesses is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the profitability and viability of these companies. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its extreme volatility. This volatility can spill over into the equities of companies that are heavily invested in or reliant on crypto. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor: Learning from Ark Invest For individual investors looking to navigate the exciting yet complex world of crypto, Ark Invest’s strategic decisions offer valuable lessons: Long-Term Vision is Key: Ark Invest consistently emphasizes a long-term investment horizon, focusing on disruptive trends rather than short-term market fluctuations. This approach is crucial when investing in nascent but high-potential sectors like crypto. Look Beyond Direct Crypto: While holding Bitcoin or Ethereum directly is one way to participate, consider the broader ecosystem. Companies building the infrastructure, providing services, or holding significant crypto assets can also be compelling investment opportunities. This is precisely where Ark Invest is focusing. Understand Underlying Assets: Before investing in a crypto-related company, delve into its fundamentals. What are its core operations? What digital assets does it hold? How robust is its business model against market volatility? Evaluate Management and Strategy: Look for companies with strong management teams, clear strategies, and a demonstrated commitment to shareholder value, as evidenced by actions like BitMine’s share buyback program. Diversify and Manage Risk: Even in high-conviction areas, diversification is paramount. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Understand your risk tolerance and allocate capital accordingly. The continuous evolution of the digital asset space demands vigilance and an open mind. Ark Invest’s latest move is a testament to their belief in the transformative power of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, not just as speculative assets, but as fundamental building blocks of the future economy. By strategically investing in companies like BitMine, they are not only seeking financial returns but also actively participating in shaping this future.

By increasing its exposure to crypto-related equities, particularly a company with significant Ethereum holdings and a robust share buyback program, Ark Invest is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the continued growth and institutionalization of the cryptocurrency market. This move underscores the firm’s commitment to disruptive innovation and provides a compelling blueprint for how traditional investment firms are increasingly integrating digital assets into their portfolios. For investors and enthusiasts alike, it highlights the undeniable trajectory of crypto from a niche interest to a pivotal component of the global financial landscape, with firms like Ark Invest leading the charge towards a decentralized future. *** Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ark Invest and who is Cathie Wood? A1: Ark Invest is an American asset management firm founded by Cathie Wood in 2014. It is known for its focus on disruptive innovation and invests in companies involved in artificial intelligence, robotics, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and blockchain technology. Cathie Wood is the CEO and CIO of Ark Invest, widely recognized for her bullish views on innovative technologies and long-term investment strategies. Q2: Why is Ark Invest investing so heavily in BitMine Immersion Technologies? A2: Ark Invest’s heavy investment in BitMine is primarily driven by BitMine’s significant holdings of Ethereum (over $2 billion) and its $1 billion share buyback program. This provides Ark Invest with indirect exposure to a major cryptocurrency while investing in a company that demonstrates strong financial health and commitment to shareholder value. BitMine’s use of immersion cooling technology for mining also aligns with Ark’s focus on efficient and innovative technologies. Q3: What does BitMine’s $2 billion in Ethereum holdings mean for investors? A3: BitMine’s substantial Ethereum holdings mean that its financial performance and valuation can be significantly influenced by the price movements of Ethereum. For investors, it offers a way to gain exposure to Ethereum’s potential growth through a publicly traded company, without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency itself.

Q5: Are there risks associated with investing in crypto-related equities like BitMine? A5: Yes, there are inherent risks. While offering indirect crypto exposure, these equities are still highly correlated with the volatility of underlying cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.

This event isn’t just another large crypto transaction; it signals a profound shift in how institutional players are engaging with digital assets. The sheer scale and speed of this purchase highlight a growing confidence in the long-term value and utility of Bitcoin within traditional financial frameworks. Let’s delve into the details of this monumental event and explore its far-reaching implications for the future of finance. What Exactly Happened with Anchorage Digital Bitcoin? According to data shared by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on X, Anchorage Digital purchased a total of 10,141 BTC, valued at approximately $1.19 billion at the time of the transactions. What makes this particular acquisition stand out is not just the colossal sum, but the incredibly short timeframe in which it occurred – a mere nine hours. This rapid accumulation from multiple wallet addresses suggests a highly coordinated and strategic move by the crypto bank. Anchorage Digital is not just any player in the crypto space. As a federally chartered digital asset bank, it holds a unique position, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the nascent world of cryptocurrencies. Its status as a regulated entity means its actions often carry more weight and set precedents for other institutional investors considering deeper dives into digital assets. This significant Anchorage Digital Bitcoin purchase underscores a calculated strategy, likely driven by strong client demand or a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s trajectory. Why This Massive Bitcoin Acquisition Matters for the Market The acquisition of over a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin by a regulated entity like Anchorage Digital sends a powerful message to the global financial markets. It’s a testament to the increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, moving beyond speculative interest to strategic asset allocation. Here’s why this event holds such significance: Validation of Bitcoin as an Institutional Asset: For years, Bitcoin was largely seen as a retail or niche investment. This purchase, however, reinforces its legitimacy as a serious asset class for large-scale financial institutions. It suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a viable store of value or even a reserve asset. Bolstering Market Confidence: Such a substantial investment from a regulated bank can instill greater confidence among other institutional players and even retail investors. It signals that established financial entities are not only exploring but actively committing significant capital to the crypto space, potentially reducing perceived risks. Impact on Liquidity and Price Dynamics: While a $1.19 billion purchase is substantial, the market absorbed it relatively smoothly. This demonstrates the increasing depth and liquidity of the Bitcoin market, capable of handling large institutional inflows without extreme volatility. It also hints at a potential long-term upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price as demand from such entities grows. Setting a Precedent for Future Inflows: Anchorage Digital’s bold move could encourage other banks, asset managers, and corporate treasuries to accelerate their own crypto strategies. As more institutions seek to diversify portfolios or offer digital asset services, similar large-scale acquisitions could become more common, driving further institutionalization of the crypto market. The Mechanics Behind a Multi-Million Dollar BTC Acquisition Executing a purchase of 10,141 BTC within a nine-hour window is no small feat. It requires sophisticated infrastructure and strategic execution to minimize market impact and ensure security. Institutions like Anchorage Digital typically don’t buy such large quantities directly on open exchanges, which could lead to significant price slippage. Instead, they often utilize specialized channels: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desks: These are private trading desks that facilitate large transactions between two parties, often institutions, without going through public order books. OTC desks provide better price execution for large volumes and help maintain market stability. Dark Pools: Similar to traditional finance, crypto dark pools allow institutions to place large orders without revealing their intentions to the broader market, preventing front-running and minimizing price impact. Algorithmic Execution: Advanced trading algorithms are employed to break down large orders into smaller chunks, executing them across various exchanges and OTC desks over time to achieve the best average price and reduce volatility. For Anchorage Digital, a regulated custodian, the acquisition also involves stringent security protocols for storing these digital assets. This includes a mix of cold storage (offline wallets) for the vast majority of assets, coupled with robust multi-signature wallets and advanced cryptographic security measures to protect client and proprietary funds. The secure management of this Anchorage Digital Bitcoin holding is paramount. What Challenges and Opportunities Arise from Such Large-Scale Bitcoin Holdings? While the acquisition presents immense opportunities, it also comes with its own set of challenges that institutions must navigate. Challenges: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for digital assets is still evolving. Holding significant amounts of Bitcoin requires continuous adaptation to new compliance requirements and potential shifts in policy. Security Risks: Despite advanced security measures, the sheer value of the holdings makes them a prime target for sophisticated cyberattacks. Continuous investment in cutting-edge security infrastructure is non-negotiable. Market Volatility: While Bitcoin’s long-term outlook may be bullish, short-term volatility can still impact the valuation of large holdings, requiring robust risk management strategies. Custody and Operational Complexity: Managing, securing, and transacting with such large amounts of digital assets adds significant operational complexity compared to traditional assets. Opportunities: New Product Development: With substantial Bitcoin holdings, Anchorage Digital can potentially expand its service offerings, including Bitcoin-backed lending, staking services, or even structured products tailored for institutional clients. Enhanced Competitive Advantage: Being a leader in large-scale institutional Bitcoin acquisition and custody positions Anchorage Digital strongly against competitors, attracting more clients seeking secure and compliant digital asset solutions. Revenue Generation: Beyond capital appreciation, these holdings can generate revenue through transaction fees, lending, or other yield-generating strategies, bolstering the bank’s financial performance. Influencing Industry Standards: As a regulated entity handling such large volumes, Anchorage Digital can play a pivotal role in shaping best practices and industry standards for institutional digital asset management. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The Anchorage Digital Bitcoin acquisition is more than an isolated event; it’s a significant indicator of a broader trend. The past year has seen a surge in institutional interest, fueled by factors such as the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the U.S., which have opened new, regulated avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This has significantly de-risked Bitcoin for many large financial players. As the digital asset ecosystem matures, we can expect more traditional financial institutions to follow suit, either through direct purchases, offering crypto custody services, or integrating digital assets into their existing product lines. This institutional embrace is crucial for Bitcoin’s journey towards mainstream adoption, bringing with it increased liquidity, stability, and regulatory clarity. The future of finance is increasingly digital, and events like Anchorage Digital’s substantial Bitcoin purchase serve as powerful reminders of this ongoing transformation. For investors, this signals a deepening market and potential long-term growth, while for institutions, it underscores the urgency of developing robust digital asset strategies. Conclusion Anchorage Digital’s swift acquisition of over $1.19 billion worth of Bitcoin is a landmark event, underscoring the accelerating pace of institutional adoption within the cryptocurrency space. It highlights Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as a legitimate and valuable asset class for regulated financial entities. This move not only reinforces confidence in the digital asset market but also sets a precedent for how traditional finance will continue to integrate and leverage the power of blockchain technology. As more institutions recognize the strategic importance of digital assets, we can anticipate a future where Bitcoin plays an even more central role in the global financial landscape.

ADA, with its robust development history, is regaining momentum after recent pullbacks. Meanwhile, PENGU has emerged from the NFT niche into the broader crypto spotlight – fueled by surging trading volume and renewed interest from retail buyers. While both ADA and PENGU are gathering attention, another name has quietly begun capturing early investors—MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-moving presale that’s drawing XRP whale wallets in record numbers. With limited supply and rising demand, its explosive early adoption rate is becoming hard to ignore. Cardano Struggles, but Support Holds Cardano is trading around $0.8195, down roughly 11% on the week, but the chart shows buyers still defending support levels. The RSI currently sits near 39.5, signaling oversold territory, and the recent hourly chart bounce could suggest an upcoming reversal. ADA’s long-term fundamentals remain strong with its research-first approach and expanding ecosystem, but short-term volatility is challenging investor patience. ADA is still far away from its previous all-time high (ATH) – meaning the potential for a huge ROI is still in the cards. Why Smart Money is Turning to This New Presale As big names like ADA and PENGU compete for attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a quiet frontrunner in the early-stage investment race. Its current presale phase is reportedly selling out at a pace unseen since early Dogecoin or SHIBA INU surges. Investor demand has already pushed multiple rounds to sell out in minutes, and with record-breaking on-chain activity, analysts are comparing its potential to the beginnings of some of crypto’s most iconic coins. $2,000 today could return more than $94,000 if current projections play out, according to early-stage forecast models. PENGU Builds Momentum From NFT Roots Unlike ADA’s methodical climb, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is thriving on pure community-driven momentum. Trading around $0.04195, the token has jumped nearly 10% over the past week, supported by surging 24-hour volume surpassing $1.4 billion. RSI levels are stabilizing near 44, hinting at a possible continuation of the uptrend if market sentiment holds. With fresh listings and influencer buzz, PENGU could be one of this cycle’s breakout performers. Summary While Cardano and PENGU show different strengths—ADA with its ecosystem depth and PENGU with short-term momentum—many eyes are shifting toward newer high-ROI investments . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid presale growth and increasing whale wallet activity position it as one of the most aggressive emerging opportunities for 2025.

One such somber announcement recently reverberated through the blockchain community: the tragic passing of Radix blockchain founder and original architect, Dan Hughes. This news, shared by the Radix team on X, marks a profound moment for the layer-1 project and its dedicated community. Understanding the Legacy of Dan Hughes and the Radix Blockchain Dan Hughes was not just a founder; he was the visionary mind behind the Radix blockchain , a project aiming to solve some of the most persistent scalability and developer experience issues plaguing decentralized finance (DeFi). His journey began long before the current crypto boom, driven by a deep conviction that decentralized systems held the key to a better financial future. Hughes’s commitment led to the development of Radix’s unique architecture, including the innovative Cerberus consensus mechanism and the Scrypto programming language, designed to make building secure and scalable DeFi applications intuitive and efficient. The Radix project stands out in the crowded layer-1 space due to its focus on “programmable DeFi.” Unlike many other blockchains that adapt existing technologies, Radix was built from the ground up with a clear vision for how a global financial system could operate on decentralized rails. Dan Hughes’s technical prowess and unwavering dedication were instrumental in shaping this ambitious roadmap, guiding the project through years of research, development, and community building. His influence extended beyond code; he fostered a culture of meticulous engineering and long-term thinking, which became the bedrock of the Radix Foundation’s approach. The Unforeseen Challenge: A Moment of Grief and Reflection for Radix On July 27, the Radix team shared the heartbreaking news that Dan Hughes passed away unexpectedly from natural causes at his home. This sudden loss has undoubtedly sent shockwaves through the Radix community and the broader crypto ecosystem. Losing a founder, especially one so deeply intertwined with the project’s technical and philosophical foundations, is a significant blow. It’s a moment of profound grief, not just for his colleagues and collaborators but for everyone who believed in his vision for the Radix blockchain . The immediate reaction from the Radix team, as communicated on X, highlighted their need for a short period to grieve and to focus on maintaining operational stability. This measured response underscores the professionalism and dedication of the team, even in the face of immense personal loss. It reflects an understanding that while the human element is paramount, the continuity of the project and its mission remains a critical responsibility to the community and investors who have supported Radix’s journey. Ensuring Continuity: The Radix Foundation’s Strategic Moves In light of this tragic event, the Radix Foundation has acted swiftly and decisively to ensure the continued operational stability and strategic direction of the Radix blockchain . To maintain leadership and governance, Chief Strategy Officer Adam Simmons and Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Day have joined Chief Executive Officer Andy Jarrett as directors of the Radix Foundation. This expanded leadership team brings a wealth of experience and a deep understanding of the project’s intricacies, ensuring that Dan Hughes’s vision can be carried forward without interruption. This move is crucial for several reasons: Shared Vision: Adam Simmons and Jonathan Day have been integral parts of the Radix leadership for a considerable time, working closely with Dan Hughes. Their elevation ensures that the core philosophical and technical direction remains consistent with the original vision. Operational Stability: By strengthening the board, the Foundation reinforces its ability to make timely decisions, manage resources effectively, and oversee the ongoing development and deployment of the Radix network. Community Reassurance: A clear succession plan and robust governance structure provide much-needed reassurance to the Radix community, developers, and investors that the project is resilient and prepared to navigate unforeseen challenges. Strategic Execution: With a consolidated leadership team, the Foundation can continue to execute its ambitious roadmap, focusing on key milestones such as network upgrades, ecosystem growth, and developer adoption. The emphasis is clearly on maintaining momentum and delivering on the promises made to the community, demonstrating the project’s unwavering commitment despite the personal tragedy. What Does This Mean for the Future of Radix Blockchain? While the loss of a founder is undeniably difficult, the swift actions taken by the Radix Foundation signal a strong commitment to the project’s future. For the Radix blockchain , this period will likely involve a renewed focus on internal stability, transparent communication, and continued development. The core technical team, which has been building alongside Dan Hughes for years, remains intact and dedicated to advancing the protocol. The future trajectory of Radix will depend heavily on the continued execution of its roadmap, particularly the transition to the Babylon mainnet and the subsequent Scrypto development. The project’s strength lies not just in its individual contributors but in its robust architecture and the passionate community it has cultivated. The challenge now is to channel the collective grief into a renewed determination to realize Dan Hughes’s vision of a truly scalable and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem. This event also highlights a broader truth in the decentralized world: while founders are crucial for initial vision and momentum, the long-term success of a blockchain project ultimately relies on its community, its decentralized nature, and the resilience of its core team. Radix is now presented with an opportunity to demonstrate this resilience and to prove that its foundational principles are strong enough to withstand even the most unexpected challenges. The Broader Implications for Layer-1 Blockchains The passing of Dan Hughes serves as a poignant reminder for the entire layer-1 blockchain space about the importance of succession planning, robust governance, and distributed leadership. While many projects start with a charismatic founder at the helm, true decentralization and long-term viability require a framework that can endure beyond any single individual. The Radix Foundation’s prompt response in reinforcing its leadership team offers a valuable case study in crisis management within a decentralized context. This situation underscores the need for blockchain projects to: Diversify Leadership: Ensure that critical knowledge and decision-making capabilities are not solely concentrated in one or two individuals. Strengthen Governance: Establish clear protocols for leadership transitions and strategic oversight, ideally involving community input where appropriate. Empower Core Teams: Build strong, self-sufficient technical and operational teams capable of continuing development even if key figures depart.

Here’s what this could mean for the market. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Turned Negative Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the recent trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap. The “Coinbase Premium Gap” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the BTC price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). The former cryptocurrency exchange is primarily used by US-based investors, especially large institutional entities. The latter, on the other hand, has a global userbase. As such, the Coinbase Premium Gap essentially tells us about how the buying or selling behaviors differ between the American and foreign whales. Related Reading: XRP Dormant Coins On The Move: Reason Behind Price Plunge? When the value of the metric is positive, it means the cryptocurrency is listed for a higher price on Coinbase than Binance. Such a trend implies buying pressure is stronger (or selling pressure is weaker) on the former as compared to the latter. On the other hand, the indicator having a negative value implies Binance is the platform observing a net higher accumulation as its users have pushed BTC to a higher value than on Coinbase. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-hour moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-hour MA Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has mostly held a positive value for a while now, indicating that Coinbase users have been buying. This accumulation was so consistent earlier that it managed to reach a streak of 94 days, but recently, a dip into the negative territory finally broke it. “This was the longest streak in history,” notes the analyst. Since the start of 2024, US institutional investors have generally played a driving role in the market, with the price often showing correlation to the Coinbase Premium Gap. Given this pattern, a pivot to selling from this group can naturally be a bearish sign for Bitcoin.

So, here is another graph, this one from CryptoQuant author IT Tech, that shows how the metric’s fluctuations have looked on a higher resolution over the past month: From the chart, it’s apparent that the metric has seen multiple drops into the negative zone recently, with the latest one coming during the past day. “The demand in the US Market is weakening,” says the analyst. “Caution is necessary.” BTC Price Bitcoin has been unable to find a direction as its price is still floating around $117,700.

As the global economy becomes increasingly digital, XRP’s role in cross-border transactions has expanded rapidly. Major banks like Santander and SBI are already using Ripple’s network to settle payments in seconds, while American Express and others explore further integration. This real-world use case sets XRP apart from most other tokens that rely solely on speculation. Adding to the momentum is growing anticipation around a spot XRP ETF. After Ethereum’s approval earlier this year, XRP is now seen as one of the top candidates for institutional recognition. A spot ETF would mark a major milestone, likely unlocking billions in demand from funds and investors who have previously been sitting on the sidelines. That kind of attention is now spreading to new altcoins, too. One early-stage project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is being described as a “ next XRP moment ” by some analysts. With a projected 13,200% ROI for early backers, MAGACOIN is attracting serious interest from investors hoping to secure a position before it reaches exchanges. Its presale rounds are selling out quickly, signaling that smart money is already moving in. Even a $2,500 investment could grow to over $330,000 if the forecasts play out. Back to XRP, long-term price forecasts are getting increasingly bold. As the global financial system slowly modernizes, XRP’s position as a bridge currency becomes more valuable. Analysts are starting to model future scenarios where XRP climbs past $20 or even $25 by 2030 – especially if Bitcoin hits six figures and the crypto market enters a full adoption phase. That would mean 100 XRP could be worth over $2,500 , turning a modest purchase today into a sizeable return within a few years. The bullish outlook isn’t just based on speculation. Ripple’s expanding network of partners, its steady legal progress, and the almost-certain ETF approval combine to make XRP one of the strongest bets for the next decade. While the crypto space remains volatile, XRP’s real-world utility continues to provide it with solid ground beneath its price action.

On July 29, these investment vehicles once again captured headlines, recording a substantial total net inflow of $79.62 million . This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks an impressive streak of four consecutive trading days with positive flows, signaling growing investor confidence and sustained interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels. For many in the cryptocurrency community and traditional finance alike, the approval and subsequent performance of US spot Bitcoin ETFs have been a game-changer. These instruments provide a regulated, accessible pathway for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of direct ownership, such as managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges. This accessibility has been a significant driver of the recent inflows, as more diverse investor pools look to capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential. Understanding the Dynamics of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Inflows The daily inflow and outflow data for US spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a fascinating snapshot of market sentiment and the strategic movements of major players. On July 29, the picture was largely positive, albeit with some interesting nuances: BlackRock’s IBIT Leads the Charge: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continued its dominant performance, pulling in a staggering $157.19 million in inflows. This consistent leadership underscores BlackRock’s significant market presence and investor trust in their offering. VanEck’s HODL Sees Modest Gains: VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (HODL) also contributed positively, albeit on a smaller scale, with $5.82 million in inflows. This indicates a broader interest beyond just the largest funds. Outflows from Key Players: While the overall trend was positive, some funds experienced outflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw $48.97 million in outflows, a pattern observed since its conversion from a trust to an ETF. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) recorded $26.22 million in outflows, and ARK Invest’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) had $8.2 million in outflows. These outflows often reflect profit-taking, rebalancing of portfolios, or shifts towards lower-fee alternatives. Steady Holdings: The remaining US spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, suggesting a period of stability for those particular funds. The net positive flow, despite some significant outflows, highlights the robust demand for new capital entering the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. It’s a testament to the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, viewing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate component of a diversified investment portfolio. Why Are These Inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs So Important? The continuous positive flow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market and traditional finance. Here’s why: Institutional Validation: The sheer volume of inflows, particularly into funds managed by financial giants like BlackRock, signals increasing institutional validation of Bitcoin as an asset class. This can pave the way for more traditional investors to allocate capital to digital assets. Market Maturation: The presence of regulated ETF products contributes to the maturation of the Bitcoin market. It brings greater transparency, liquidity, and adherence to established financial standards, which can reduce volatility and enhance investor confidence. Price Impact: While not a direct cause-and-effect, sustained inflows into Bitcoin ETFs create demand for underlying Bitcoin. As ETFs acquire more BTC to back their shares, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially exerting upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price over time. Accessibility and Education: ETFs simplify Bitcoin investment, making it accessible to a wider audience who might be intimidated by direct crypto purchases. This increased accessibility also fosters greater education about digital assets within traditional financial circles. Competitive Landscape: The competition among various ETF providers drives innovation in product offerings, fee structures, and marketing efforts, ultimately benefiting investors. The interplay between these factors creates a powerful feedback loop, where positive inflows reinforce confidence, leading to further interest and investment. The Evolution of Bitcoin Investment: From Retail to Institutional Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital currency to a globally recognized asset has been remarkable. Initially, its adoption was primarily driven by tech-savvy individuals and early adopters. However, the introduction of financial products like futures contracts and, more recently, US spot Bitcoin ETFs , has opened the floodgates for institutional capital. This shift signifies a maturation of the asset class. Institutions bring not only significant capital but also a long-term investment horizon and a demand for regulatory clarity and robust infrastructure. The consistent inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs are a clear indicator that this institutional embrace is not a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in how Bitcoin is perceived and integrated into global financial portfolios. The ability to invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts, with the familiarity and security associated with ETFs, has demystified crypto for many. This ease of access, combined with the potential for diversification and growth, makes US spot Bitcoin ETFs an increasingly attractive option for a broad spectrum of investors. Challenges and Considerations for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs While the recent inflows paint a rosy picture, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and considerations associated with US spot Bitcoin ETFs and the broader crypto market: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. While ETFs offer exposure, they do not mitigate the underlying price fluctuations of Bitcoin. Investors must be prepared for significant price swings. Regulatory Scrutiny: The cryptocurrency landscape is still evolving, and regulatory frameworks can change. Future regulations could impact the operations or attractiveness of Bitcoin ETFs. Competition: The market for US spot Bitcoin ETFs is becoming increasingly competitive. While this can benefit investors through lower fees, it also means funds must constantly innovate to attract and retain capital. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, such as interest rate changes, inflation, or geopolitical events, can significantly influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin, impacting ETF flows. Grayscale’s GBTC Outflows: The continued outflows from GBTC, while decreasing, still represent a significant factor. As investors shift from the older trust structure to newer, often lower-fee ETFs, GBTC’s performance will remain a key indicator of market rebalancing. Despite these challenges, the overall trajectory for US spot Bitcoin ETFs appears positive, driven by sustained demand and increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. What’s Next for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Crypto Market? The consistent positive flows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs are a powerful indicator of shifting tides in the investment world. As more institutions and traditional investors gain comfort with Bitcoin through these regulated products, we could see further integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. This could lead to: Increased Product Diversity: The success of Bitcoin ETFs might pave the way for other single-asset crypto ETFs (e.g., Ethereum ETFs) or even multi-asset crypto baskets. Enhanced Market Liquidity: More capital flowing into the market via ETFs can increase overall liquidity, making Bitcoin trading more efficient and potentially less volatile in the long run. Broader Educational Initiatives: As more financial advisors become familiar with and recommend these products, it will naturally lead to greater public understanding of cryptocurrencies. The journey of US spot Bitcoin ETFs is far from over. Each day’s inflow and outflow data contribute to a larger narrative of adoption, maturation, and the gradual integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric. The recent $79.62 million inflow is not just a number; it’s a testament to the enduring appeal and growing legitimacy of Bitcoin in the eyes of the world’s investors. Concluding Thoughts: The Unstoppable Momentum of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs The latest figures, showing a substantial $79.62 million in net inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 29, underscore a compelling narrative of growing confidence and sustained institutional interest. With four consecutive days of positive flows, spearheaded by BlackRock’s impressive IBIT, these regulated investment vehicles are clearly becoming a preferred gateway for traditional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin. While outflows from some funds like Grayscale’s GBTC indicate ongoing market rebalancing, the overall trend points towards a robust and maturing ecosystem. This consistent influx of capital not only validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class but also signals a significant step forward in the broader integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. As these ETFs continue to gain traction, they are poised to play an increasingly vital role in shaping the future of investment portfolios worldwide, reflecting an undeniable shift in how the world views and invests in the digital frontier.

Q3: Which US spot Bitcoin ETF is seeing the most inflows? A3: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has consistently been a leader in terms of inflows, often attracting the largest share of new capital among the various US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Q4: Why are some US spot Bitcoin ETFs experiencing outflows? A4: Outflows from certain ETFs, particularly Grayscale’s GBTC, are often attributed to profit-taking by early investors, rebalancing of portfolios, or a shift of capital towards newer ETFs with potentially lower management fees. Bitwise and ARK Invest also saw some outflows on July 29. Q5: How do US spot Bitcoin ETFs affect Bitcoin’s price? A5: While not the sole determinant, sustained inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs increase demand for Bitcoin as the funds need to acquire more BTC to back their shares. This reduced supply on exchanges can exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price over time. Q6: Are US spot Bitcoin ETFs suitable for all investors? A6: While they offer accessibility, investors should be aware that Bitcoin is a volatile asset. ETFs provide exposure to this volatility.

On July 29, these investment vehicles witnessed a substantial net inflow of $218.09 million, extending an impressive streak to 18 consecutive trading days of positive inflows. This sustained momentum signals a growing confidence and appetite among investors for regulated exposure to Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This consistent influx of capital into Spot Ethereum ETFs is more than just a fleeting trend; it represents a significant shift in how traditional finance interacts with the burgeoning crypto market. It underscores a broader acceptance of digital assets as legitimate investment instruments, moving beyond the speculative fringes into mainstream portfolios. Understanding the Phenomenal Growth of Spot Ethereum ETFs The latest figures, as shared by crypto analyst Trader T on X, highlight the robust performance of Spot Ethereum ETFs . The $218.09 million net inflow on July 29 contributes to a prolonged period of investor enthusiasm, demonstrating consistent demand for these products. Let’s break down the contributions from key players on this significant day: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund led the charge, recording a substantial $223.18 million in inflows. BlackRock’s entry into the crypto ETF space has often been a catalyst for market confidence, and their Ethereum offering appears to be no exception. ARK 21Shares’ CETH: In contrast, ARK 21Shares’ CETH experienced a modest outflow of $5.09 million. While this indicates some profit-taking or reallocation, it was significantly overshadowed by the larger inflows into other funds. Other ETFs: The remaining Spot Ethereum ETFs reported no changes in their holdings for the day, suggesting stability across a broader range of offerings. This dynamic interplay of inflows and minor outflows paints a picture of a maturing market where capital is actively managed, yet the overall trend remains overwhelmingly positive for Spot Ethereum ETFs . Why Are Investors Pouring into Spot Ethereum ETFs? The consistent net inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs are not accidental. Several compelling factors are driving this surge in investor interest: Institutional Validation: The approval and launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs by major financial institutions like BlackRock signal a strong vote of confidence from the traditional finance sector. This validation makes crypto investments more palatable and accessible for institutional investors who operate under strict regulatory frameworks. Regulatory Clarity: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of these ETFs provided much-needed regulatory clarity. This reduces uncertainty for investors, making it safer to allocate capital to digital assets through regulated products. Accessibility for Mainstream Investors: Spot Ethereum ETFs offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for individuals and institutions who may be hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. They eliminate the complexities of self-custody, private keys, and navigating crypto exchanges, making Ethereum investment as straightforward as buying shares in a traditional stock market. Ethereum’s Robust Ecosystem: Beyond just a digital currency, Ethereum is a foundational blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi (decentralized finance), NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and a myriad of Web3 innovations. Investors are recognizing the long-term potential of Ethereum’s ecosystem and its pivotal role in the future of the internet, making Spot Ethereum ETFs an attractive way to gain exposure to this growth. These combined factors create a powerful narrative for sustained interest and investment in Spot Ethereum ETFs . What Challenges Might Spot Ethereum ETFs Face? While the outlook for Spot Ethereum ETFs appears bright, it’s essential to consider potential challenges and complexities that could influence their trajectory: Market Volatility and Price Swings: Despite the growing institutionalization, the underlying asset, Ethereum, remains highly volatile. Significant price fluctuations in ETH could lead to corresponding volatility in ETF values, potentially deterring risk-averse investors or leading to periods of net outflows. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: While the initial approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs is a milestone, the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Future legislative changes or new interpretations of existing laws could impact the operation or attractiveness of these funds. Competition from Other Investment Vehicles: Investors have various options for gaining exposure to Ethereum, including direct ownership, futures ETFs, and other structured products. Intense competition among these different avenues could fragment liquidity and dilute the overall inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs . Custody and Security Risks: Although ETFs mitigate individual custody risks, the underlying assets are still held by custodians. While highly regulated, the inherent risks associated with digital asset security, though rare for major custodians, remain a consideration for some investors. Understanding these challenges is crucial for a balanced perspective on the future of Spot Ethereum ETFs . The Road Ahead: What Do These Inflows Mean for Ethereum? The consistent inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs carry significant implications for both Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market: Potential for Price Appreciation: Sustained demand from ETFs, especially from institutional investors, could exert upward pressure on Ethereum’s price. As ETFs acquire ETH to back their shares, it reduces the circulating supply available on exchanges, potentially leading to price increases if demand outstrips supply. Increased Market Legitimacy: The success of Spot Ethereum ETFs further solidifies the legitimacy of digital assets in the eyes of traditional finance. This could pave the way for more crypto-related financial products and services, fostering greater integration between the two worlds. Broader Adoption of Digital Assets: As more investors gain exposure to Ethereum through ETFs, it naturally increases awareness and understanding of the underlying technology and its potential. This broader adoption could accelerate innovation and development within the Ethereum ecosystem. Actionable Insight for Investors: For those considering investing, these inflows highlight a growing trend. However, due diligence remains paramount. Research the specific ETF, understand its fees, and assess your own risk tolerance. Diversification within your portfolio is always a prudent strategy. The trajectory of Spot Ethereum ETFs is likely to be a key indicator for the health and maturation of the digital asset market in the coming months and years. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The consistent and substantial net inflows into U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs , particularly the $218.09 million recorded on July 29 and the impressive 18-day streak, mark a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. This trend reflects a growing appetite from both institutional and retail investors for regulated, accessible exposure to Ethereum’s innovative ecosystem. While challenges such as market volatility and evolving regulations persist, the overwhelming positive sentiment and the clear demand for these products underscore a significant shift towards the mainstream acceptance of digital assets. As Spot Ethereum ETFs continue to gain traction, they are not only reshaping investment strategies but also cementing Ethereum’s position as a foundational asset in the evolving financial landscape.

A: On July 29, BlackRock’s ETHA fund saw substantial inflows of $223.18 million, demonstrating strong investor confidence.

ETH is now consolidating gains and might soon aim for a move toward $4,000. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,840 and $3,880 levels. The price is trading above $3,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,840 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains supported above the $3,725 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum price struggled to extend gains above the $3,940 level, like Bitcoin . ETH price started a downside correction from the $3,939 high and traded below $3,900. The price traded below the $3,820 support level and settled below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,515 swing low to the $3,939 high. Moreover, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,840 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the price is steady above the $3,720 support and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,515 swing low to the $3,939 high.

Ethereum’s Transformative Journey: Key Milestones and Innovations Over the past decade, Ethereum has not just grown; it has evolved, adapting to new challenges and fostering unprecedented innovation. The journey to the Ethereum 10th anniversary is paved with significant milestones that have reshaped the entire digital economy: The Birth of Smart Contracts (2015): Ethereum pioneered the concept of self-executing contracts, laying the foundation for automated, trustless agreements on the blockchain. This innovation unlocked possibilities far beyond simple currency transfers. The DAO Hack and Hard Fork (2016): A pivotal moment that tested Ethereum’s resilience and led to the controversial but ultimately strengthening hard fork, creating Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). This event underscored the importance of community consensus and security. The DeFi Explosion (2020-Present): Decentralized Finance (DeFi) found its primary home on Ethereum, enabling lending, borrowing, trading, and insurance services without traditional intermediaries. Projects like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound showcased the power of open finance. The NFT Boom (2021-Present): Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) gained mainstream traction, with Ethereum providing the underlying infrastructure for digital art, collectibles, gaming assets, and more. This created new forms of digital ownership and creator economies. The Merge (2022): One of the most ambitious technological upgrades in blockchain history, Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This significantly reduced its energy consumption and set the stage for future scalability improvements, marking a monumental achievement leading up to the Ethereum 10th anniversary . Scalability Solutions (Ongoing): While The Merge addressed energy efficiency, efforts continue on scaling solutions like sharding and Layer 2 rollups (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) to increase transaction throughput and reduce gas fees, ensuring Ethereum remains the leading smart contract platform. Each of these milestones represents not just a technical achievement but a societal shift, demonstrating Ethereum’s capacity to adapt, innovate, and lead the charge towards a more decentralized future. Navigating the Challenges: What Lies Ahead for Ethereum After its 10th Anniversary? While the Ethereum 10th anniversary is a cause for celebration, it’s also an opportune moment to acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead. No groundbreaking technology is without its hurdles, and Ethereum is no exception. The path forward involves continuous refinement and addressing complex issues to ensure its long-term viability and widespread adoption. One primary challenge remains scalability . Despite the success of Layer 2 solutions and the promise of sharding, the demand for Ethereum’s block space continues to grow, often leading to high transaction fees (gas fees) during peak usage. While significant progress has been made, achieving a truly global scale that can support billions of users seamlessly is an ongoing endeavor. Security is another paramount concern. As the value locked within Ethereum’s ecosystem grows, so does its attractiveness to malicious actors. While the core protocol has proven robust, smart contract vulnerabilities and phishing scams remain persistent threats that require constant vigilance from developers and users alike. Furthermore, the evolving regulatory landscape presents both opportunities and challenges. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. Clear, thoughtful regulation could foster innovation and provide greater certainty, but overly restrictive measures could stifle growth and push development offshore. Ethereum’s decentralized nature makes it particularly complex to regulate. Finally, decentralization itself, while a core tenet, requires continuous effort to maintain. Concerns about validator centralization post-Merge or the influence of large staking pools are regularly discussed within the community. Ensuring that power remains distributed and that the network resists single points of failure is a perpetual balancing act. Addressing these challenges is crucial for Ethereum to solidify its position as the foundational layer of the decentralized web for the next decade and beyond its Ethereum 10th anniversary .

In a significant development that underscores its commitment to becoming a leading Web3 hub, Hong Kong is taking a decisive step towards integrating stablecoins into its regulated financial ecosystem. The anticipation surrounding the issuance of the first Hong Kong stablecoin license marks a pivotal moment, signaling a new era of trust and stability in the region’s digital asset landscape. Understanding the Hong Kong Stablecoin License Timeline According to Deputy Chief Executive Darryl Chan, as reported by the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is on track to issue its inaugural Hong Kong stablecoin license in early 2026. This timeline follows the official rollout of Hong Kong’s comprehensive stablecoin regulatory framework on August 1st. The framework introduces a structured approach to governing stablecoin activities, laying the groundwork for a secure and compliant environment. What does this mean for the industry? The period leading up to early 2026 is crucial. It includes a six-month grace period during which provisional licenses are expected to be granted. This phased approach allows existing and aspiring stablecoin issuers to align their operations with the new regulatory requirements, ensuring a smooth transition. The HKMA’s proactive stance reflects a careful balance between fostering innovation and safeguarding financial stability, a key principle in establishing Hong Kong as a reliable digital finance center. Why is Hong Kong Stablecoin Regulation Crucial? Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to a stable asset like fiat currency or gold, are vital bridges between traditional finance and the volatile cryptocurrency market. Their stability makes them essential for various applications, from remittances and payments to decentralized finance (DeFi) and trading. However, without proper oversight, they can pose risks related to financial stability, consumer protection, and illicit financing. Hong Kong’s move to regulate stablecoins is not merely about compliance; it’s a strategic play to solidify its position as a global financial hub in the digital age. By providing clear rules, the HKMA aims to: Enhance Trust: Regulated stablecoins offer greater transparency and accountability, fostering investor and user confidence. Attract Innovation: Regulatory certainty can draw more legitimate businesses and talent to Hong Kong, encouraging the development of new stablecoin-related products and services. Mitigate Risks: A robust framework helps prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes, protecting the integrity of the financial system. Promote Integration: Regulated stablecoins can be more easily integrated into traditional financial systems, facilitating broader adoption and utility. This commitment to a regulated environment signals Hong Kong’s readiness to embrace digital assets responsibly, differentiating itself from jurisdictions with less defined frameworks. Decoding HKMA’s Stablecoin Framework: What Does it Entail? While the full details of the framework are extensive, the core principles of the HKMA’s stablecoin regulation focus on ensuring stability, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Based on global best practices and the HKMA’s prior discussions, key aspects likely include: Reserve Requirements: Mandating that stablecoin issuers hold high-quality, liquid reserves fully backing the issued stablecoins. This is crucial for maintaining the peg and ensuring redemption. Prudential Standards: Requirements for capital adequacy, governance, risk management, and operational resilience for stablecoin issuers. Disclosure and Transparency: Regular audits and public disclosure of reserve compositions, redemption policies, and financial health. Consumer Protection: Measures to safeguard users’ funds, provide clear terms and conditions, and establish dispute resolution mechanisms. AML/CFT Compliance: Strict adherence to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations, including Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. The grace period allows entities to prepare for these stringent requirements, potentially requiring significant operational and technological upgrades. The HKMA’s approach suggests a preference for asset-referenced stablecoins, which are typically backed by fiat currencies or other assets, over algorithmic stablecoins. Opportunities and Challenges Ahead for the Hong Kong Stablecoin License The introduction of a clear Hong Kong stablecoin license framework presents both immense opportunities and considerable challenges for market participants. Opportunities: Market Access and Legitimacy: Licensed entities gain a stamp of approval, opening doors to institutional investors and mainstream financial services. Enhanced Trust and Adoption: Users will have greater confidence in stablecoins issued under a robust regulatory regime, potentially leading to wider adoption for payments and remittances. Innovation within Boundaries: While regulated, the clarity allows for focused innovation, as developers and businesses can build with confidence in legal parameters. Global Competitiveness: Hong Kong strengthens its appeal as a destination for digital asset businesses, competing with other major financial centers like Singapore, Dubai, and even the European Union with its MiCA regulation. Challenges: Compliance Burden: Meeting stringent regulatory requirements can be costly and resource-intensive, particularly for smaller entities. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Regulators must continually adapt to rapid technological advancements without stifling innovation. Interoperability: Ensuring that Hong Kong-licensed stablecoins can seamlessly interact with other global digital asset ecosystems will be key. Talent Acquisition: The demand for skilled professionals in regulatory compliance, blockchain technology, and cybersecurity will likely increase. Navigating these challenges effectively will be crucial for Hong Kong to fully capitalize on the opportunities presented by stablecoin regulation. Hong Kong’s Broader Digital Vision: Beyond the Hong Kong Stablecoin License The move to regulate stablecoins is not an isolated event but a significant piece of Hong Kong’s broader strategy to embrace digital finance and establish itself as a Web3 hub. The city has been actively exploring various facets of digital assets, including: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): The HKMA is deeply involved in Project mBridge, a multi-CBDC platform for wholesale cross-border payments, showcasing its commitment to digitalizing core financial infrastructure. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs): Hong Kong has already implemented a licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms, with major players like HashKey Exchange and OSL securing licenses. Tokenization: The government has issued tokenized green bonds, demonstrating a practical application of blockchain technology in traditional finance. These initiatives collectively paint a picture of a jurisdiction determined to lead in the digital economy. The upcoming Hong Kong stablecoin license will integrate seamlessly into this vision, providing a regulated, stable medium for transactions within this burgeoning ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Digital Finance Hong Kong’s impending issuance of its first Hong Kong stablecoin license marks a landmark achievement in the global journey towards regulated digital finance. It reflects a mature and forward-thinking approach by the HKMA, balancing the immense potential of stablecoins with the necessary safeguards for financial stability and consumer protection. This strategic move not only enhances Hong Kong’s competitive edge in the digital asset space but also provides a robust model for other jurisdictions considering similar regulatory frameworks. As early 2026 approaches, the world will be watching closely as Hong Kong solidifies its position as a leading innovator and trusted hub for the future of money.

SHIB, the once-unstoppable meme token, is showing signs of fatigue as trading volume thins out even during upward moves. This kind of price action—where the candles glow green but the order books are hollow—often hints at a potential fake-out. It’s the crypto equivalent of a car revving uphill on fumes. Without a sudden surge in buying interest, SHIB could easily slide back to key support levels near $0.0000136 or even $0.0000130. Meanwhile, new money in the market is looking elsewhere. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are becoming the focal point for early-stage investors hoping to catch the next breakout before it enters the mainstream spotlight. SHIB Rally Faces Trouble as Volume Fades This is where the outlook gets murky for SHIB holders. Price may be pushing toward resistance at $0.0000145, but the lack of strong buying interest suggests it’s not sustainable. Without significant volume to confirm the breakout, SHIB risks a reversal. Volume always tells the truth, and right now, it’s signaling that this move might not hold up. However, things may change in August as signs of the beginning of the altcoin season could significantly boost investor activity and push prices to new highs. PENGU Shows Signs of Strength PENGU, another sub-$1 altcoin, is showing a much healthier pattern. After periods of sideways consolidation, the token has staged sharp upward bursts, suggesting that it’s being actively accumulated. Unlike SHIB, PENGU’s movements appear to have some weight behind them, with support holding and momentum indicators (like the RSI) hovering at mid-range levels—not overbought, not oversold. This setup often precedes a breakout, especially if the broader altcoin market begins to heat up in early August. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a name that serious traders are watching closely. Crypto insiders are now comparing its early trajectory to SHIBA INU’s explosive debut – a comparison not made lightly. With strong demand from early adopters, limited access, and multiple presale rounds selling out rapidly, analysts are pointing to a projected ROI of up to 13,200% for strategic early movers. As attention grows, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could replicate the viral growth that made SHIB a household name in crypto. What to Watch for in August SHIB will need a serious volume boost if it wants to avoid another retracement. If big players start dumping during this weak rally, it could accelerate the slide back to support. On the flip side, any surprise uptick in volume could reverse the bearish tone. PENGU, on the other hand, looks technically stronger heading into August. With resistance levels now within striking distance and the RSI resetting, the coin could be one headline or market push away from a new high. In a market where timing is everything, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are offering early entrants a rare opportunity at outsized gains – the kind not seen since SHIBA INU first took off.

A recent announcement that has caught the attention of many in the crypto community is the impending Binance delisting of specific spot trading pairs. For traders and investors holding XVS or YGG tokens, this update is not just news; it’s a call to action. Understanding the implications and preparing for these changes is crucial for managing your digital assets effectively. Understanding the Crucial Binance Delisting: What’s Happening? Leading global cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, recently made an important announcement via its official website. The exchange confirmed its decision to delist two specific spot trading pairs: XVS/TRY (Venus/Turkish Lira) and YGG/TRY (Yield Guild Games/Turkish Lira). This crucial Binance delisting is scheduled to take place on August 1st at 03:00 UTC . For those trading or holding these specific pairs, this means that after the stated time, you will no longer be able to execute spot trades involving XVS against TRY or YGG against TRY on the Binance platform. While delistings are a common occurrence in the fast-paced crypto market, each announcement carries specific implications for the affected assets and their holders. This particular Binance delisting highlights the exchange’s ongoing efforts to optimize its trading environment, ensuring liquidity and compliance across its vast array of offerings. It’s not uncommon for exchanges to periodically review their listed assets based on various criteria, and this move falls within that operational framework. Why Do Crypto Exchanges Like Binance Delist Trading Pairs? It might seem abrupt, but the decision to delist a trading pair is often a calculated move by exchanges like Binance. These decisions are not made lightly and are typically based on a rigorous review process designed to protect users and maintain a robust trading environment. Here are some of the primary reasons behind a Binance delisting or any exchange’s decision to remove a pair: Liquidity and Trading Volume: One of the most common reasons is low liquidity. If a trading pair doesn’t generate sufficient trading volume, it can lead to wider bid-ask spreads, increased slippage, and a less efficient market for traders. Exchanges aim to provide a vibrant marketplace, and illiquid pairs can detract from that experience. Project Performance and Viability: Exchanges continuously monitor the performance of listed projects. This includes assessing factors like development activity, community engagement, network stability, and overall project roadmap progress. If a project fails to meet certain performance benchmarks or shows signs of abandonment, it may be considered for delisting. Regulatory Compliance: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Exchanges must adhere to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions they operate in. A token or trading pair might be delisted if it no longer meets specific regulatory requirements or if new regulations make its continued listing problematic. Security and Integrity Concerns: Any suspicion of market manipulation, security vulnerabilities, or unethical behavior associated with a token or its project can lead to a swift delisting. Exchanges prioritize the security of their users’ funds and the integrity of their trading platform. Community Feedback and User Protection: While less direct, user complaints or significant negative sentiment surrounding a project can also play a role. Exchanges aim to protect their users from projects that may be harmful or have malicious intent. In the case of the XVS/TRY and YGG/TRY Binance delisting , the exact specific reasons weren’t detailed in the public announcement, but they generally fall under one or more of these categories, reflecting Binance’s commitment to maintaining a high-quality trading ecosystem. What Does This Binance Delisting Mean for Your Portfolio? For individuals actively trading XVS/TRY or YGG/TRY, or simply holding XVS or YGG tokens on Binance, this announcement necessitates immediate attention. It’s not just about the removal of a trading option; it’s about understanding the next steps to manage your assets effectively. Here’s what you need to consider: Immediate Actions Required for Affected Users The most important takeaway is the deadline: August 1st, 03:00 UTC . Before this time, if you have open orders for XVS/TRY or YGG/TRY, Binance recommends that you cancel them. Any open spot orders for these pairs will be automatically canceled once the delisting takes effect. This is a standard procedure to prevent unexpected trades after the pair is removed. What about your XVS and YGG tokens? The delisting of a trading pair does not mean the underlying asset is removed from the exchange entirely, nor does it mean your tokens are gone. In this specific case, only the TRY pairs are being delisted. This means: You will still be able to trade XVS against other available pairs (e.g., XVS/USDT, XVS/BUSD if they are listed). You will still be able to trade YGG against other available pairs (e.g., YGG/USDT, YGG/BUSD if they are listed). You can still hold XVS and YGG tokens in your Binance wallet. You will still be able to withdraw XVS and YGG tokens from Binance to an external wallet or another exchange. However, the key implication is the removal of direct trading against the Turkish Lira for these specific assets. If your primary strategy involved trading these pairs against TRY, you will need to adjust your approach. Understanding Withdrawal Windows and Conversion Options While the XVS/TRY and YGG/TRY spot trading pairs are being removed, Binance typically provides a window for users to manage their assets. For instance, withdrawal services for the delisted tokens usually remain active for a period, allowing users to move their funds off the platform if they wish. Always check Binance’s official announcement for specific details regarding withdrawal timelines, as these can vary. If you hold XVS or YGG and want to convert them to fiat or other cryptocurrencies on Binance, you will need to use other available trading pairs. For example, you might convert XVS to USDT, and then convert USDT to TRY (if USDT/TRY is available) or withdraw USDT to a fiat on-ramp. This adds an extra step but ensures you can still manage your assets on the platform. Table: Actionable Steps for Affected Traders Scenario Recommended Action Before August 1st, 03:00 UTC Post-Delisting Options You have open XVS/TRY or YGG/TRY spot orders Cancel all open orders manually. Orders will be automatically canceled. You hold XVS or YGG tokens No immediate action required for holding. Trade against other available pairs (e.g., USDT), or withdraw to another wallet/exchange. You wish to trade XVS/YGG against TRY Execute trades before the deadline. Convert XVS/YGG to another stablecoin (e.g., USDT), then trade stablecoin for TRY, or withdraw. Navigating Future Binance Delistings: Proactive Strategies This recent Binance delisting serves as a valuable reminder for all crypto traders: the market is dynamic, and asset listings are not permanent. Developing proactive strategies can help you mitigate risks associated with such changes. Risk Management Strategies for Your Portfolio Diversification is key. Relying heavily on a single token or a small set of tokens, especially those with lower liquidity or smaller market caps, can expose you to higher risks during delistings or market volatility. Consider spreading your investments across a range of assets. Regularly review your portfolio. Stay informed about the projects you’ve invested in. Follow their development updates, community sentiment, and any news from the exchanges where they are listed. Early awareness of potential issues can give you time to react. Utilize stop-loss orders. While not directly related to delistings, using stop-loss orders can help manage risk by automatically closing a position if the price moves against you, preventing significant losses, especially in illiquid markets where delisting announcements can cause price drops. Staying Informed in a Fast-Paced Market Subscribing to official exchange announcements (like Binance’s), following reputable crypto news outlets, and participating in relevant community forums can help you stay ahead of such developments. Binance, like other major exchanges, typically provides ample notice before delisting, giving users time to adjust their positions. Broader Market Implications of a Binance Delisting While the delisting of two specific TRY pairs might seem minor in the grand scheme of Binance’s vast offerings, such events contribute to the broader narrative of market maturity and risk management within the crypto space. They underscore the importance of project resilience and the ongoing evaluation of digital assets by major platforms. Project Resilience and Investor Confidence When a major exchange like Binance delists a pair, it can impact the perception of the underlying project. For projects like Venus (XVS) and Yield Guild Games (YGG), the delisting of a specific fiat pair doesn’t necessarily signify the end of the project. However, it can affect their liquidity against that particular fiat currency and potentially influence investor confidence, especially if traders were heavily reliant on that specific pair. Conversely, projects that consistently meet listing requirements and maintain strong fundamentals demonstrate resilience, which can bolster investor confidence. This continuous evaluation by exchanges helps to filter out weaker projects, ideally leading to a healthier overall market. Market Sentiment and Evolution Each delisting, whether small or large, contributes to the overall market sentiment. It reminds participants that not all listed assets will succeed indefinitely and that due diligence is paramount. This process is a natural part of market evolution, as the crypto space matures and strives for greater stability and professionalism. It reinforces the idea that exchanges are actively curating their listings to provide a secure and efficient trading environment. Binance’s Commitment to a Healthy Ecosystem Binance’s decision to undertake this Binance delisting aligns with its stated commitment to fostering a robust and secure trading environment. The exchange frequently reviews all listed spot trading pairs to ensure a high standard of quality. Factors typically considered include: Commitment of team to project Level and quality of development activity Trading volume and liquidity Stability and security of network from attacks Network / smart contract stability Public communication from team Responsiveness to our periodic due diligence requests Evidence of unethical / fraudulent conduct or negligence Contribution to a healthy and sustainable crypto ecosystem By periodically removing pairs that no longer meet these stringent criteria, Binance aims to protect its users from potentially illiquid or problematic assets, ensuring that its platform remains a reliable choice for millions of traders worldwide. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts Stay Informed: Regularly check official announcements from exchanges where you trade. Set up alerts for project updates. Understand the “Why”: Don’t just react to a delisting; try to understand the underlying reasons. This knowledge improves your market acumen. Diversify Wisely: Spread your investments across different assets and even different exchanges to minimize exposure to single-point risks. Have a Contingency Plan: Know your options for converting or withdrawing tokens if a pair you hold is delisted. Practice Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider tools like stop-loss orders. In conclusion, the upcoming Binance delisting of the XVS/TRY and YGG/TRY spot trading pairs on August 1st, 03:00 UTC, is a clear signal to affected traders to take prompt action. While delistings are a natural part of the evolving crypto landscape, they underscore the importance of vigilance, proactive portfolio management, and staying informed. By understanding the reasons behind such decisions and preparing accordingly, you can navigate these changes smoothly and continue to participate confidently in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading. Always refer to Binance’s official announcements for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding your assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “delisting a spot trading pair” mean? A1: Delisting a spot trading pair means that the cryptocurrency exchange (in this case, Binance) will no longer support direct trading between the two assets in that specific pair. For example, with XVS/TRY delisted, you can no longer directly exchange XVS for Turkish Lira (TRY) on Binance’s spot market. Q2: Will my XVS or YGG tokens disappear from my Binance account after the delisting? A2: No, your XVS and YGG tokens will not disappear. The delisting only affects the specific XVS/TRY and YGG/TRY trading pairs. You will still hold your XVS and YGG tokens in your Binance wallet, and you can still trade them against other available pairs (e.g., USDT) or withdraw them to an external wallet or another exchange. Q3: What should I do if I have open orders for XVS/TRY or YGG/TRY? A3: Binance recommends that you cancel any open spot orders for XVS/TRY or YGG/TRY before the delisting on August 1st at 03:00 UTC. Any remaining open orders for these pairs will be automatically canceled by the system once the delisting takes effect. Q4: Why does Binance delist certain trading pairs? A4: Binance delists trading pairs for various reasons, including low trading volume and liquidity, concerns about the underlying project’s performance or viability, regulatory compliance issues, security risks, or to ensure the overall quality and health of its trading ecosystem. These decisions are part of Binance’s regular review process. Q5: How can I stay informed about future Binance delistings or important announcements? A5: To stay informed, regularly check Binance’s official announcement page on its website. You can also follow their official social media channels, subscribe to their newsletters, and monitor reputable cryptocurrency news outlets that cover major exchange announcements. Q6: Does this delisting affect XVS or YGG on other exchanges? A6: This specific Binance delisting only affects trading on the Binance platform. The availability of XVS and YGG on other cryptocurrency exchanges is determined by those individual platforms and is not directly impacted by Binance’s decision. However, a major exchange delisting can sometimes influence broader market sentiment for the affected tokens.

The entity announced it had priced an oversubscribed and upsized PIPE financing round, backed by 10X Capital and YZi Labs, in a bid to transform into a BNB-focused treasury vehicle. BNB Treasury Move In an official press release, CEA said that it aims to become the largest publicly traded BNB treasury company in the United States and bring institutional exposure to Binance’s native Layer 1 blockchain asset. The PIPE, priced above market, attracted over 140 subscribers from across the globe, including leading crypto investment firms like Pantera Capital, GSR, and Blockchain.com. Post-closing, CEA said that it plans to begin deploying capital into BNB. The company’s new leadership includes crypto veterans David Namdar (Galaxy Digital co-founder), Russell Read (former CIO of CalPERS and Deutsche Bank Asset Management), and Saad Naja (formerly of Kraken and Exinity). This pivot represents one of the first institutional-scale vehicles providing BNB exposure through public markets. Talking about the development, Namdar said, “BNB Chain is one of the most widely used blockchain ecosystems globally, yet institutional access has been limited until now. By creating a US-listed treasury vehicle, we are opening the door for traditional investors to participate in a transparent way. This is a significant step in bridging digital assets and mainstream capital markets.” Treasury Diversification Ramps Up The latest development comes just days after Nasdaq-listed Windtree Therapeutics announced plans to raise $520 million to expand its BNB crypto reserves. The raise includes a $500 million equity line of credit (pending shareholder approval) and a $20 million stock purchase agreement with Build and Build Corp. It said 99% of proceeds will go toward acquiring BNB. The company has partnered with Kraken for custody and trading support. Windtree joins a growing list of firms, including Nano Labs, turning to BNB over Bitcoin or Ethereum as institutional altcoin adoption gains momentum.

George Jones Widow Files Theft Report Over Stolen Crypto The July 25 report states that Jones’ 58-year-old ex-boyfriend, Kirk West, was taken into custody at Nashville International Airport on Thursday, July 24. Police arrested a Tennessee man at Nashville airport after he allegedly stole millions in cryptocurrency from George Jones' widow, his ex-girlfriend. https://t.co/L81ZHhCvPt — NewsChannel 5 (@NC5) July 25, 2025 WKRN-reviewed documents allege that Jones filed a theft report on Wednesday, July 23, claiming West stole $400,000 in cash and approximately 5,534,307 XRP coins after breaking into a safe in her home. Jones had kicked West out of their Tennessee residence on June 28 and called her granddaughter to help secure her valuables after she allegedly discovered he had cheated on her. As of Tuesday afternoon, the stolen XRP was valued at over $17 million. However, Jones and her attorneys were able to recover most of the missing cryptocurrency—except for nearly 400,000 tokens, worth approximately $1.2 million. West faces a Class A felony charge for theft of more than $250,000, and his bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk West’s Fraudulent History Revealed West previously pleaded guilty to bank fraud in 2026, a case in which his legal fees were paid by Jones. The two met shortly after George Jones’ death in 2013, when West toured a home Nancy Jones was selling. Reports say she later learned West was penniless and homeless before allowing him to move in with her in September 2013. They began a romantic relationship the following month. West is scheduled to appear in court on October 23 in connection with the alleged theft of Jones’ cash and cryptocurrency .

And rug pulls? Lots of rug pulls. Those days feel like a fever dream. The industry that once promised to revolutionize gaming overnight through unsustainable play-to-earn models has quietly evolved into something far more substantial and sustainable. In 2024-2025, blockchain gaming is experiencing a quiet renaissance, driven by fundamentals instead of FOMO. Gone are the days when success meant token velocity and hype cycles. Instead, serious capital is backing projects with real gameplay, legacy studios are engaging on their own terms and unexpected markets like Spain are emerging as strategic launchpads. This isn’t the loud, flashy comeback many expected but the methodical rebuilding that actually matters. From speculation to substance The 2021 cycle was intoxicating in all the wrong ways. Success was measured by how fast a token pumped rather than by whether anyone enjoyed the game. Projects launched with elaborate tokenomics promising sky-high returns, attracting players who treated gaming like a second job. The collapse was inevitable, baked into the model from the start. Today’s projects tell a different story. Developers are focused on gameplay, cross-platform interoperability and economic models designed to survive market volatility. In 2024, blockchain games attracted 7.4 million daily active wallets – a 421% jump from 2023 – proof that players are sticking around for the fun, not just the tokens. Developers are asking better questions. Will people still play this game without token rewards? Does it offer lasting value beyond speculation? Can the economy stand on its own? What matters now isn’t token velocity but whether the game is fun. This shift from hype to substance is the industry’s most important evolution. The new generation of blockchain games is being developed by teams that understand entertainment, not just cryptocurrency mechanics. Blockchain is no longer the main event – i t’s the technology quietly powering experiences people actually want to engage with. Why serious investors are back The smart money that fled during the 2022 crash is quietly returning, but with a very different mindset. Investors like José Herrera , a prominent Spanish angel, aren’t just cutting checks but are also advising teams directly and backing founders they trust with long-term capital. This is disciplined value creation, not just speculative noise. With the blockchain gaming market valued at $14.8 billion in 2024 and projected to hit $1.17 trillion by 2033, the opportunity in sustainable models is too big to ignore. Today’s investors are doing real due diligence. They’re scrutinizing teams’ track records, evaluating partnership potential and stress-testing whether business models can weather market cycles. Flashy whitepapers and polished roadmaps aren’t cutting it anymore. What matters is traction, working products, clear revenue pipelines and real product–market fit. This new capital is sharper, more selective and deeply pragmatic. Rather than chasing token pumps, they’re backing capable teams, proven studios and strong IP. The focus is back on fundamentals like compelling gameplay, strategic partnerships and business-savvy execution. And that discipline is exactly what the industry needs to move beyond the hype and build something that lasts. Mainstream validation and real partnerships The most telling sign of blockchain gaming’s maturation isn’t on crypto X (formerly Twitter) but in traditional gaming boardrooms. AAA and AA studios are stepping in as development partners, tech collaborators and strategic advisors. Rather than crypto projects learning to build games, established game companies are exploring how blockchain can enhance what they already do best. Partnerships with major entertainment and sports IPs signal a real shift in confidence. When legacy brands license their properties to blockchain games, they’re doing so because they see viable, long-term value and not for short-term novelty. These alliances bring more than recognition. They offer seasoned distribution networks, monetization expertise and deep understanding of what makes entertainment succeed. Rather than trying to disrupt the gaming world from the outside, the new wave of projects is integrating blockchain inside existing entertainment frameworks. The result? Games that feel familiar to mainstream players but that also offer something truly new through digital ownership, interoperability and community-driven economies. Why Spain is becoming a Web 3.0 gaming powerhouse While much of the crypto world focuses on Silicon Valley or Asia, Spain is quietly emerging as one of Europe’s most dynamic hubs for Web 3.0 gaming. Thanks to supportive policies, like regulatory sandboxes, developers can test blockchain projects in a supervised environment, free from much of the regulatory drag found elsewhere. In 2024-2025, Web 3.0 investment in Spain is surging. Early-stage capital is flowing into infrastructure, DeFi and gaming projects, with new funds launching to target opportunities across both Europe and Latin America. Spain also boasts robust market momentum in emerging gaming formats. Its metaverse gaming sector is forecast to reach $472 million in 2024 and grow to $2.7 billion by 2030. This growth mirrors rising digital media spending and gaming adoption across the country. On the ground, Spain blends competitive dev talent, startup agility and strong connections to Latin America, giving Web 3.0 gaming projects a unique advantage – EU-level infrastructure and regulatory clarity, coupled with access to a rapidly growing Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking market. Compared with slower, more cautious European tech hubs, Spain is fast, connected and culturally aligned with what comes next in gaming. It’s not just joining the blockchain gaming renaissance but is helping to lead it. The next era isn’t loud – it ‘s built to last Blockchain gaming is no longer trying to disrupt traditional gaming overnight. Instead, it’s seeking to integrate with it. This quiet shift signals real maturity. The projects succeeding now aren’t the loudest or most ambitious. They’re the most sustainable, the most playable and the most useful. Builders rather than hype men are leading this new phase. They’re creating games people genuinely want to play, economies that hold up and partnerships that move the needle. The future belongs to teams that can blend great gameplay with real-world utility, not those chasing token pumps or social media virality. The next chapter of blockchain gaming won’t be written in pump-and-dumps. It will be shaped by playable, investable and enjoyable experiences that put the tech back in service of the player. This isn’t a comeback. It’s a new game entirely. Xavier Baldó is the CEO and founder of EFC and a member of the Blockchain Game Alliance.

It is the swift, unforgiving mechanism that closes out leveraged positions when a trader’s margin falls below the required threshold, often leading to substantial losses. Over the last 24 hours, the crypto market has once again witnessed significant instances of crypto perpetual futures liquidation , underscoring the inherent volatility and risks of this popular trading instrument. Understanding these liquidations is not just about observing numbers; it is about grasping the underlying market dynamics and learning crucial lessons in risk management. For many, the world of perpetual futures can seem daunting, a complex web of leverage, margin, and funding rates. Yet, it is a cornerstone of modern crypto trading, offering opportunities for magnified gains, but equally, for magnified losses. When market conditions turn unfavorable, or positions are over-leveraged, the system intervenes, leading to the dreaded liquidation event. Let us dive into the recent 24-hour breakdown and explore what these figures tell us about the current state of the market and the behavior of its participants. Understanding the Mechanics of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Before we dissect the latest figures, it is crucial to understand what crypto perpetual futures liquidation truly means. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not. They are designed to mimic spot market prices through a funding rate mechanism. Traders can open positions with leverage, meaning they can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital (margin). However, this leverage is a double-edged sword. If the market moves against a leveraged position, the trader’s equity (margin) begins to deplete. Exchanges set a ‘maintenance margin’ level. If the value of a trader’s margin account falls below this level, the exchange automatically closes (liquidates) the position to prevent the account from going into negative equity. This process is often swift and can result in the entire margin being lost. Key factors contributing to liquidation include: High Leverage: The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to trigger liquidation. Volatile Market Swings: Sudden, sharp price movements can quickly push positions past their liquidation price. Insufficient Margin: Not adding more funds to a losing position (margin call) when needed. Poor Risk Management: Failing to use stop-loss orders or manage position sizes effectively. The Shocking 24-Hour Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Breakdown: What the Numbers Reveal The past 24 hours have been a stark reminder of the power of market forces, particularly for those holding leveraged long positions. Here is the breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation across major assets: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidation (24h) Long Position Liquidation Percentage BTC $35.49 million 65.33% ETH $72.66 million 60.76% XRP $12.66 million 75.15% These figures are illuminating. With a staggering $72.66 million in ETH liquidations, Ethereum futures traders bore the brunt of the market’s recent movements, followed by Bitcoin at $35.49 million and XRP at $12.66 million. What is particularly striking is the high percentage of long positions liquidated across all three assets: 65.33% for BTC, 60.76% for ETH, and a significant 75.15% for XRP. This data strongly suggests that the market experienced a notable downward price action, catching many optimistic long traders off guard. The dominance of long liquidations indicates that a significant portion of traders were betting on price increases, only to see their positions wiped out as prices fell. This often leads to a cascading effect, where initial liquidations further depress prices, triggering more liquidations in a vicious cycle. Why Do Traders Get Liquidated? Common Pitfalls in Crypto Perpetual Futures Trading The high volume of crypto perpetual futures liquidation we just observed is not random; it is a direct consequence of common trading mistakes. Understanding these pitfalls is the first step toward avoiding them: Excessive Leverage: This is arguably the biggest culprit. While 100x leverage might seem enticing for massive gains, it means a mere 1% price movement against your position can lead to liquidation. Many traders overestimate their ability to predict short-term market movements. Ignoring Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss is your safety net. It automatically closes your position at a predetermined price, limiting potential losses. Many traders, driven by hope or fear, fail to set stop-losses or move them, leading to devastating outcomes. Lack of Market Analysis: Entering trades without thorough technical and fundamental analysis, or failing to stay updated on market news and sentiment, leaves traders vulnerable to unexpected shifts. Emotional Trading: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) on a rising market or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) during a dip often leads to impulsive decisions, such as opening highly leveraged positions at unfavorable times or holding onto losing trades too long. Poor Position Sizing: Investing too large a portion of one’s capital into a single trade, especially a highly leveraged one, amplifies risk exponentially. Navigating the Volatility: Strategies to Avoid Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation While the market will always have its unpredictable moments, there are concrete strategies traders can employ to minimize the risk of crypto perpetual futures liquidation : Practice Prudent Leverage: Start with low leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) until you gain significant experience and confidence. Even experienced traders often stick to moderate leverage to manage risk effectively. Implement Strict Risk Management: Always use Stop-Loss Orders: Determine your maximum acceptable loss before entering a trade and set a stop-loss accordingly. Define Take-Profit Levels: Know when to exit a winning trade to lock in profits. Position Sizing: Never risk more than a small percentage (e.g., 1-2%) of your total trading capital on any single trade. Conduct Thorough Market Analysis: Combine technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) with fundamental analysis (news, project developments, macroeconomic factors) to make informed decisions. Stay Informed, Not Obsessed: Keep an eye on market news but avoid constant chart watching, which can lead to emotional decisions. Set alerts for key price levels. Understand Funding Rates: Be aware of the funding rates, especially if holding positions for extended periods, as these can eat into profits or exacerbate losses. Consider a Diversified Approach: While futures are speculative, avoid putting all your capital into a single, highly leveraged position. The Broader Impact of Massive Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations Beyond the individual trader, large-scale crypto perpetual futures liquidation events have broader implications for the market: Increased Volatility: Liquidations often trigger further price swings as forced selling occurs, creating a domino effect that can lead to flash crashes. Market Sentiment Shift: A wave of liquidations can dampen overall market sentiment, leading to a period of fear and uncertainty among traders. Opportunity for Contrarian Traders: While painful for those liquidated, these events can create opportunities for well-capitalized traders to enter positions at lower prices. Health Check on Market Health: Frequent, large liquidations can signal an over-leveraged market, indicating a need for caution and potentially a period of deleveraging. The recent liquidations, particularly the high percentage of long positions, serve as a potent reminder of the inherent risks in highly leveraged trading. They highlight the importance of disciplined risk management, a deep understanding of market mechanics, and the wisdom to avoid succumbing to greed or fear. Ultimately, success in the perpetual futures market is less about predicting every price move and more about managing risk effectively. The numbers from the past 24 hours are not just statistics; they are a crucial lesson for every trader navigating the exhilarating yet perilous world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Q1: What is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? A1: Crypto perpetual futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below the required maintenance margin, typically due to adverse price movements. It prevents the trader’s account from going into negative equity. Q2: Why do most liquidations happen to long positions during a market downturn? A2: When the market experiences a downturn, prices fall. Traders holding long positions (betting on price increases) will see their positions lose value. If the price drop is significant enough and they are highly leveraged, their margin will deplete, leading to the liquidation of their long positions. Q3: How can I calculate my liquidation price? A3: Most crypto exchanges provide a liquidation price calculator directly on their trading interface. This calculation depends on your entry price, leverage, initial margin, and maintenance margin rate. It’s crucial to know this price for every leveraged trade. Q4: Are liquidations always bad? A4: For the individual trader experiencing it, liquidation is always a negative event as it results in loss of capital. However, from a broader market perspective, liquidations can help to deleverage an overheated market, potentially leading to healthier, more sustainable price action in the long run. Q5: What is the most important tip to avoid crypto perpetual futures liquidation? A5: The single most important tip is to use prudent leverage and always implement strict risk management, primarily through the consistent use of stop-loss orders. Never risk more than you can afford to lose on any single trade. Q6: Does adding more margin prevent liquidation? A6: Yes, adding more margin (also known as ‘topping up’ your margin) to your position can lower your liquidation price, giving your trade more room to move against you before being liquidated. However, this also means you are committing more capital to a potentially losing trade.

In the dynamic world of finance, where every major economic announcement sends ripples across asset classes, understanding traditional markets is key, even for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. As the highly anticipated Federal Reserve rate decision approaches, the global financial landscape is holding its breath. This critical moment directly influences everything from the strength of the US Dollar to the performance of Asia FX , and by extension, the liquidity and investor sentiment in the crypto market. While digital assets often carve their own path, they are not immune to the gravitational pull of macro-economic forces. Let us delve into the current market dynamics and explore what these shifts could mean for your portfolio. Why is Asia FX Holding Its Breath? Asian currencies have largely remained muted, showing minimal movement as market participants brace for clarity from the Federal Reserve. This cautious stance is a direct reflection of the interconnectedness of global finance, where the actions of one major central bank, particularly the Fed, can dictate the direction for currencies worldwide. Investors in Asia are not making significant directional bets, preferring to wait for concrete signals regarding future monetary policy. Japanese Yen (JPY): The JPY has shown relative stability, though underlying pressures from Japan’s continued ultra-loose monetary policy contrast with global tightening trends. The Bank of Japan’s stance remains a key factor, but the Fed’s decision can still induce volatility, especially if it impacts yield differentials. Chinese Yuan (CNY): The CNY’s performance is heavily influenced by China’s economic data and the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) policy. Recent efforts by the PBOC to stabilize the currency have played a role in its muted behavior, but global sentiment driven by the Fed remains a significant external factor. Korean Won (KRW) & Singapore Dollar (SGD): These currencies often act as barometers for broader Asian economic health and global trade. Their current muted state indicates a collective wait-and-see approach, with traders avoiding large positions until the Fed’s path becomes clearer. Indian Rupee (INR): While domestic factors like inflation and trade balance play a large role for the INR, the US Dollar’s strength or weakness, dictated by Fed policy, remains a primary external driver for its movement against the greenback. The collective calm across Asia FX highlights a market poised on the edge, ready to react swiftly to any surprises from the Fed. This period of low volatility often precedes significant price action, making the upcoming decision even more critical for currency traders and, by extension, those observing capital flows into risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The US Dollar ‘s Delicate Dance: What’s Driving Its Weakness? The US Dollar has recently experienced a slight weakening, a notable shift given its prolonged period of strength. Several factors contribute to this delicate dance, creating a complex backdrop for the upcoming Fed announcement. Understanding these drivers is essential, as the dollar’s trajectory has profound implications for global liquidity and the attractiveness of alternative investments, including digital assets. Softer Inflation Data: Recent inflation reports from the United States, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), have shown signs of cooling. This suggests that inflationary pressures might be easing, potentially reducing the urgency for the Federal Reserve to maintain an aggressive tightening stance. Lower inflation often translates to reduced expectations for future rate hikes, which can weigh on a currency. Anticipation of Rate Cuts: Following the softer inflation prints, market participants have begun pricing in a higher probability of interest rate cuts later in the year or early next year. While the immediate Fed decision might be a hold, the forward-looking sentiment of potential cuts makes the dollar less attractive compared to currencies from economies where rates might remain higher or even rise. Return of Risk-On Sentiment: As concerns about a severe global recession ease, a ‘risk-on’ sentiment has started to return to global markets. In such an environment, investors tend to move away from safe-haven assets like the US Dollar and into higher-yielding or growth-oriented assets, which can include equities, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies. Technical Factors: From a technical analysis perspective, the Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar’s value against a basket of major currencies, has shown signs of breaking key support levels, reinforcing the bearish sentiment among some traders. The weakening of the US Dollar can be a double-edged sword for crypto. On one hand, a weaker dollar can make dollar-denominated assets, including cryptocurrencies, more attractive to international investors. On the other hand, it might signal broader economic uncertainty, which could still lead to cautious investment behavior. The key is to monitor whether the dollar’s weakness is a sign of a healthier global economy or underlying domestic issues. Anticipating the Crucial Fed Rate Decision : What Are the Expectations? The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is undoubtedly the highlight of the week for financial markets. The Fed rate decision is not just about the interest rate itself; it’s about the accompanying statement, economic projections, and Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. These elements provide critical insights into the Fed’s thinking and future policy path. The primary mandate of the FOMC is to maintain maximum employment and price stability (i.e., control inflation). In recent months, the Fed has aggressively raised interest rates to combat persistent inflation. Now, with inflation showing signs of cooling, the market is intensely focused on whether the Fed will signal an end to its tightening cycle or hint at future easing. What are the likely outcomes? Holding Rates Steady: The most widely anticipated outcome is that the Fed will hold the federal funds rate steady. This would allow the central bank to assess the impact of previous rate hikes on the economy and inflation. A pause does not necessarily mean an end to tightening, but rather a wait-and-see approach. Forward Guidance: Beyond the rate decision, the language used in the FOMC statement will be scrutinized. Phrases indicating a ‘data-dependent’ approach or reiterating a commitment to ‘bring inflation back to target’ will be parsed for hawkish or dovish signals. Economic Projections (Dot Plot): The updated ‘dot plot,’ which shows individual FOMC members’ projections for future interest rates, will be crucial. A shift towards lower future rate expectations among members could signal a more dovish outlook. Conversely, if dots remain high, it could suggest a more hawkish stance than markets anticipate. Jerome Powell’s Press Conference: Chair Powell’s tone and answers during the post-meeting press conference often move markets more than the statement itself. His commentary on the labor market, inflation outlook, and the path of monetary policy will provide invaluable clarity. Here’s a simplified look at potential scenarios and market reactions: Fed Outcome Market Reaction (General) Potential Crypto Impact Rates Held, Dovish Guidance Risk-on assets (equities, crypto) rally; US Dollar weakens. Positive for crypto; increased liquidity and investor appetite. Rates Held, Hawkish Guidance Risk-on assets volatile; US Dollar strengthens; bond yields rise. Mixed to negative for crypto; uncertainty and potential liquidity drain. Unexpected Rate Hike Sharp sell-off in risk assets; strong US Dollar rally. Strongly negative for crypto; significant downward pressure. The market is looking for signals of a ‘pivot’ – a shift from tightening to easing. Even if rates are held, any hint of future cuts could be a significant bullish catalyst for risk assets, including the crypto market. Conversely, a more hawkish stance could dampen spirits. How Do Changing Interest Rates Impact the Crypto Landscape? For cryptocurrency investors, understanding the relationship between traditional interest rates and digital assets is paramount. While crypto often boasts decentralization and independence, it is undeniably influenced by the broader financial environment, especially the cost of capital. The Cost of Capital: When central banks raise interest rates , the cost of borrowing money increases across the economy. This makes it more expensive for businesses to expand and for consumers to take out loans. For investors, higher rates mean that less risky assets, like government bonds or high-yield savings accounts, offer more attractive returns. This can draw capital away from speculative, higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Impact on Liquidity: Higher interest rates are often accompanied by quantitative tightening (QT), where central banks reduce their balance sheets. This process effectively removes liquidity from the financial system. Less liquidity means less capital available to flow into speculative markets, including crypto, potentially leading to lower trading volumes and price stagnation or declines. Risk-On vs. Risk-Off Sentiment: Crypto assets are generally considered ‘risk-on’ investments. In periods of economic uncertainty or when interest rates are high, investors tend to adopt a ‘risk-off’ stance, favoring safer assets. Conversely, when rates are low and economic conditions are perceived as stable, investors are more willing to take on risk, which can benefit crypto. DeFi Yields and Stablecoins: The impact of interest rates extends to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. When traditional borrowing costs rise, it can influence the demand for stablecoins and the yields offered on various DeFi protocols. Higher traditional yields might make some DeFi opportunities less competitive, while lower rates could boost demand for higher-yielding DeFi products. In essence, higher interest rates typically create headwinds for crypto by making safer investments more appealing and by reducing overall market liquidity. A dovish shift from the Fed, hinting at future rate cuts, would likely be a significant positive catalyst for the crypto market, potentially signaling renewed inflows and increased risk appetite. Navigating Global Markets : Strategies for the Savvy Investor In an environment where global markets are intricately linked and highly responsive to central bank actions, adopting a strategic approach is crucial for investors, particularly those with exposure to the volatile crypto space. Here are actionable insights to navigate the current landscape: Stay Informed on Macro Data: Regularly monitor key economic indicators from major economies, especially the US (inflation, employment, GDP) and China (manufacturing, trade). These data points directly influence central bank decisions and market sentiment. Understanding the narrative behind the numbers is as important as the numbers themselves. Understand Correlations: Recognize that while crypto can sometimes decouple from traditional markets, it often remains correlated with risk assets like tech stocks. Pay attention to how the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 react to macro news, as this can provide clues for crypto’s potential direction. Diversification is Key: While the allure of high returns in crypto is strong, prudent investors diversify their portfolios. This doesn’t just mean holding various cryptocurrencies, but also considering a balanced allocation across different asset classes, including stablecoins, and potentially even some traditional assets, to mitigate risk during periods of high volatility. Practice Risk Management: Given crypto’s inherent volatility, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Employ strategies like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate the impact of price swings. Consider setting stop-loss orders for active trades to limit potential downside. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: During periods of macro uncertainty, it’s easy to get caught up in short-term price fluctuations. Revisit the fundamental value proposition of the cryptocurrencies you hold. Projects with strong use cases, robust development, and growing ecosystems are better positioned to weather economic storms. Be Prepared for Volatility: The period around a major Fed rate decision is often marked by increased volatility. Have a plan for how you will react to different scenarios. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on immediate market reactions, which can often be whipsaws. By adopting a well-informed and disciplined approach, investors can better position themselves to navigate the complexities of global markets and potentially capitalize on opportunities that arise from macro-economic shifts. Conclusion The muted movements in Asia FX and the slight weakening of the US Dollar are clear indicators of a market holding its breath ahead of the pivotal Fed rate decision . This announcement, along with the accompanying economic projections and Chair Powell’s commentary, will set the tone for global markets , influencing everything from currency valuations to commodity prices and, critically, the future trajectory of interest rates . For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these macro forces is not merely academic; it is fundamental to navigating the digital asset landscape. The interconnectedness of finance means that shifts in traditional monetary policy directly impact liquidity, investor sentiment, and the overall attractiveness of risk assets like crypto. By staying informed, adopting sound risk management practices, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, investors can better prepare for the volatility and opportunities that lie ahead, ensuring they are well-equipped to make informed decisions in this ever-evolving financial ecosystem.

Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a significant Anchorage Digital ETH unstake . This wasn’t just any transaction; it involved a substantial amount of Ethereum, signaling potentially strategic shifts from one of the industry’s most prominent regulated crypto banks. Understanding such moves is crucial for anyone looking to grasp the evolving dynamics of institutional participation in the digital asset space. The Core Revelation: A Strategic Anchorage Digital ETH Unstake On-chain analytics recently brought to light a notable transaction involving U.S.-based crypto bank Anchorage Digital. An address, widely suspected to belong to Anchorage, received a staggering 8,052 ETH from Lido, a leading liquid staking platform. This transfer, valued at approximately $30.25 million, occurred just hours before the news broke, according to insights from on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X. What makes this particular Anchorage Digital ETH unstake so compelling is the history behind a significant portion of the withdrawn ETH. A total of 7,576 ETH had been staked since August 2023, a period when Ethereum’s price hovered around $1,672. This long-term commitment to staking, followed by a strategic unstake, points to more than just routine operations. It highlights a calculated decision to realize gains and potentially reallocate capital in the current market environment. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key figures: Total ETH Unstaked: 8,052 ETH Approximate Value at Unstake: $30.25 million ETH Staked Since August 2023: 7,576 ETH ETH Price in August 2023: ~$1,672 Unpacking the Gains: A Deep Dive into Profitability The financial implications of this Anchorage Digital ETH unstake are significant. The 7,576 ETH that had been staked since August 2023, when ETH was valued at roughly $1,672, has seen a remarkable appreciation in price. Considering current market prices, this portion alone represents an estimated $15.79 million in gains purely from price appreciation. This figure doesn’t even account for the staking rewards accumulated over the months, which would add a substantial sum to the total profit. This event underscores the dual benefit of staking Ethereum for institutional players: not only do they earn passive income through staking rewards, but they also benefit immensely from the underlying asset’s price growth. For an entity like Anchorage Digital, which manages significant digital assets for its clients, optimizing these returns is a core part of its strategy. The decision to unstake suggests a careful evaluation of market conditions and potential future opportunities. To put the price appreciation into perspective: Metric Value ETH Staked (August 2023) 7,576 ETH Approx. Value at Staking $12.67 million (7,576 ETH * $1,672) Approx. Current Value $28.46 million (7,576 ETH * ~$3,750, assuming current ETH price) Estimated Price Appreciation Gain ~$15.79 million Why This Anchorage Digital ETH Unstake Matters: Institutional Playbooks in Action When an entity like Anchorage Digital makes a move of this magnitude, it’s rarely a whimsical decision. It’s often part of a broader, well-thought-out strategy. The Anchorage Digital ETH unstake could be indicative of several institutional playbooks: Profit Realization: The most obvious reason. After significant price appreciation and accumulated staking rewards, taking profits is a sound financial decision, especially for regulated entities managing client funds. Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutions frequently rebalance their portfolios to maintain desired asset allocations or to shift capital towards new opportunities. The unstaked ETH could be earmarked for investments in other cryptocurrencies, traditional assets, or even new DeFi protocols. Liquidity Management: While liquid staking offers flexibility, having direct access to native ETH provides maximum liquidity for immediate deployment or withdrawal, which is critical for institutional operations. Regulatory Considerations: As the regulatory landscape for crypto continues to evolve, regulated entities like Anchorage Digital must constantly adapt. Unstaking might be part of a strategy to comply with new guidelines or to prepare for future regulatory shifts. Client Mandates: Anchorage Digital serves institutional clients. The unstake could be in response to specific instructions from one or more of their clients who wish to exit their ETH positions or reallocate their funds. These strategic moves by institutional crypto players are increasingly important. They provide insights into how large capital is being managed within the digital asset ecosystem and can often precede broader market trends or shifts in investor sentiment. The Mechanics of Staking: A Primer for the Curious To fully appreciate the significance of an Anchorage Digital ETH unstake , it’s essential to understand the mechanics of Ethereum staking. Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with ‘The Merge’ and subsequent upgrades. In a PoS system, instead of miners, ‘validators’ secure the network by staking their ETH. How ETH Staking Works: Becoming a Validator: To run a validator node, one must stake a minimum of 32 ETH. This ETH acts as collateral, incentivizing honest behavior. Earning Rewards: Validators are rewarded with newly minted ETH for proposing and validating blocks, ensuring the network’s integrity. Risks Involved: Staking carries risks, including ‘slashing’ (penalties for misbehavior or downtime) and ‘illiquidity’ (staked ETH is locked and cannot be easily accessed until unstaked). For institutions managing vast sums, the illiquidity aspect of traditional staking can be a significant hurdle. This is where liquid staking solutions come into play, offering a compelling alternative. Liquid Staking Explained: How Lido Enhances Flexibility Lido is the largest liquid staking protocol for Ethereum, and its role in the Anchorage Digital ETH unstake is central. Liquid staking addresses the illiquidity problem of traditional ETH staking by issuing a liquid token (like stETH for Lido) in return for staked ETH. Benefits of Liquid Staking with Lido: Liquidity: Holders receive stETH, which can be traded, used in DeFi protocols, or sold, even while the underlying ETH remains staked. This provides flexibility that traditional staking lacks. Accessibility: Users can stake any amount of ETH, bypassing the 32 ETH minimum requirement for running a solo validator. Diversification: Reduces reliance on a single validator, spreading risk across Lido’s network of professional node operators. Compounding Rewards: Staking rewards are automatically added to the stETH balance, allowing for compounding returns. The ability to maintain liquidity while earning staking rewards makes platforms like Lido incredibly attractive to institutional investors who require flexibility and capital efficiency. The Anchorage Digital ETH unstake from Lido highlights that even with liquid staking, institutions will eventually need to convert their liquid staking tokens back to native ETH to realize profits or reallocate capital. Anchorage Digital: A Bridge to Institutional Crypto Adoption Anchorage Digital is not just another crypto company; it holds the distinction of being the first federally chartered crypto bank in the U.S. This regulatory status is paramount, as it allows them to provide institutional-grade crypto services, including custody, trading, and staking, to traditional financial institutions, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. Their actions are often viewed as a bellwether for broader institutional adoption and sentiment. When a regulated entity like Anchorage engages in a significant Anchorage Digital ETH unstake , it suggests a calculated financial decision made within a robust compliance framework. Their involvement legitimizes crypto in the eyes of traditional finance and helps bridge the gap between the two worlds. Anchorage’s commitment to security, regulatory compliance, and robust infrastructure makes them a trusted partner for institutions venturing into digital assets. Their recent unstake provides a rare glimpse into the operational strategies of a leading institutional player in the crypto space. What Does This Anchorage Digital ETH Unstake Mean for the Broader Market? The implications of such a large Anchorage Digital ETH unstake are multifaceted and extend beyond just Anchorage’s balance sheet: Potential ETH Supply Dynamics: While 8,052 ETH is a significant sum, it’s a small fraction of the total circulating supply. However, if this unstake is part of a larger trend of institutional profit-taking, it could subtly impact selling pressure or liquidity on exchanges. Impact on Liquid Staking Protocols: While Lido remains dominant, large unstakes from major players could prompt discussions about diversification among institutional users or the stability of TVL (Total Value Locked) in these protocols. Institutional Sentiment Indicator: This move could be interpreted in various ways. Some might see it as a sign of cautious optimism, where profits are being taken to de-risk. Others might view it as a precursor to new, strategic investments, signaling confidence in other areas of the crypto market. Market Maturity: The fact that institutions are actively managing staked assets, realizing gains, and making strategic reallocations demonstrates the increasing maturity and sophistication of the crypto market. For individual investors, monitoring such institutional flows provides valuable context. It highlights the importance of understanding not just price action, but also the underlying capital movements and strategic decisions of major market participants. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Future Outlook While the Anchorage Digital ETH unstake showcases successful profit realization, the crypto market is not without its challenges. Volatility remains a constant factor, and regulatory uncertainties continue to shape institutional behavior. Crypto banks like Anchorage operate in a complex environment, balancing innovation with compliance. Looking ahead, we can expect institutional engagement with staking and DeFi to grow, but always with an eye on risk management and regulatory clarity. The ability to seamlessly enter and exit positions, as demonstrated by Anchorage’s unstake, will be critical for further institutional adoption. The future of institutional crypto will likely involve: More Sophisticated Strategies: Beyond simple staking, institutions will likely explore more complex DeFi strategies, yield optimization, and structured products. Enhanced Regulatory Frameworks: Clearer rules will provide greater certainty, encouraging more traditional financial players to enter the space. Continued Innovation: New protocols and services will emerge to cater specifically to the needs of institutional clients, focusing on security, scalability, and compliance. The Anchorage Digital ETH unstake is a testament to the profitability and growing sophistication of institutional engagement in the crypto ecosystem. It underscores the potential for significant returns in digital assets, even for regulated entities operating with a high degree of prudence and strategic foresight. As the market matures, we can anticipate more such calculated moves from major players, each offering valuable insights into the evolving landscape of institutional crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is ETH unstaking? ETH unstaking is the process of withdrawing previously staked Ethereum (ETH) from a validator or a staking pool. When ETH is staked, it’s locked to secure the Ethereum network and earn rewards. Unstaking makes that ETH liquid again, allowing it to be traded, sold, or used for other purposes. Who is Anchorage Digital? Anchorage Digital is a U.S.-based, federally chartered crypto bank. It provides institutional-grade digital asset services, including custody, trading, and staking, to financial institutions, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals, bridging traditional finance with the crypto world. What is Lido, and how does it relate to the Anchorage Digital ETH unstake? Lido is a leading liquid staking protocol that allows users to stake their ETH without locking it up. Instead, users receive stETH (staked ETH), a liquid token that represents their staked ETH and accumulated rewards. The Anchorage Digital ETH unstake occurred from Lido, meaning Anchorage converted their stETH back to native ETH. Why did Anchorage Digital unstake such a large amount of ETH? While the exact reasons are proprietary, potential motivations for the Anchorage Digital ETH unstake include profit realization from significant price appreciation and staking rewards, portfolio rebalancing, managing liquidity for client mandates, or strategic reallocation of capital to other investment opportunities within or outside the crypto market. What are the risks associated with ETH staking, even with liquid staking? Even with liquid staking, risks include smart contract vulnerabilities (the risk of bugs in the protocol’s code), slashing (penalties for validator misbehavior), and market risk (the value of ETH or the liquid staking token can fluctuate). While liquid staking mitigates illiquidity, it introduces additional counterparty risk to the protocol itself. How does an institutional unstake, like the Anchorage Digital ETH unstake, affect the ETH price? A single unstake, even a large one, typically has a minimal direct impact on ETH’s price given the asset’s vast market capitalization. However, if such unstakes become a widespread trend among institutions, signaling a collective desire to take profits or reduce exposure, it could contribute to increased selling pressure or a shift in market sentiment.

Other bullish signals for the cryptocurrency include the declining supply of tokens on exchanges and the solid interest in spot Ethereum ETFs. The Largest Whales on the Move Despite not posting any major gains in the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) remains among the top-performing cryptocurrencies over the last month, with its price soaring by 54% to the current $3,800 (according to CoinGecko’s data). Moreover, the recent whale activity suggests that the valuation may pump even more in the short term. The popular X user Ali Martinez revealed that big investors (those holding between 10,000 and 100,000 coins) have scooped up more than 220,000 ETH in the past 48 hours. The USD equivalent of the stash is just under $850 million (calculated at current rates), with this cohort of market participants now controlling almost 28.4 million tokens. This represents 23.5% of ETH’s circulating supply. Such accumulation leaves fewer assets available on the open market, which, combined with non-declining demand, is supposed to result in a surging price. Additionally, the move may incentivize smaller investors to enter the ecosystem with fresh capital. Martinez has been quite vocal on ETH recently. Earlier today (July 29), he noted that there has been plenty of hype surrounding the second-largest cryptocurrency, but predicted that “the real breakout” will begin once the price soars above $4,100. The X user Michael van de Poppe said ETH didn’t witness the previously expected correction. “In that case, I think we’ll be seeing another run upwards, the target is quite clear: the high at $4,100. I think we’ll sweep that level and consolidate for a little. Up we go,” he added. More Bullish Factors The outflow from exchanges has been more than evident in the past several months. Over one million ETH has been withdrawn from centralized platforms in the last 30 days alone, which typically results in reduced immediate selling pressure. As CryptoPotato reported , the total number of Ethereum tokens stored on exchanges has plunged to approximately 19 million, representing the lowest point seen in nearly a decade. The massive capital that continues to flow into spot ETH ETFs should also be considered a bullish element. Those products have collectively attracted roughly $5 billion in 17 days, signaling solid interest from investors. In fact, the last outflow day was on July 2.

The move comes ahead of its well-known initial public offering (IPO) , planned for the first quarter of 2026. The Information reported the news on Tuesday, citing industry sources. According to Arjun Sethi, who was appointed as Kraken’s co-CEO in late 2024, the latest funding round could help the company get investors comfortable with the valuation, which had lacked before, pulling Kraken off a potential public listing. Is Kraken Launching Its IPO Soon? Bloomberg reported in March that the recent regulatory clarity in the US has driven Kraken’s long-term plans to go public. “We’ll pursue public markets as it makes sense for our clients, our partners and shareholders,” the company said at the time. The company reported a revenue surge to $472 million during the first quarter of 2025 , a 19% year-over-year increase. Kraken attributed the surge to increased trading activity amid volatile conditions. In recent months, the company has expanded its services to more countries , deepening its foothold in jurisdictions where regulatory clarity is imminent. Further, private shares of Kraken stock are actively being traded on secondary marketplaces like Forge, and the company could be gearing up for a potential IPO next year. That said, this isn’t the first time Kraken has been rumored to be seeking an IPO. Founder and former CEO Jesse Powell touted in 2021 that the company could go public the following year. Another Bloomberg report last year noted that a 2025 IPO could be on the table. While rumors of a Kraken IPO continue, there haven’t been any definitively announced plans so far. Crypto Firms Join IPO Rush Last week, crypto custody startup BitGo confidentially filed for a U.S. listing , joining a wave of crypto companies seeking to capitalize on strong market momentum. The IPO plans followed after USDC issuer Circle debuted publicly in June with a strong market reception. Less than 24 hours after Circle’s debut, the Winklevoss brothers-run Gemini confirmed it had filed a confidential S-1 with the U.S. SEC. BREAKING NEWS: Crypto exchange Gemini has filed to go public, a Friday press release from the Winklevoss-led company reveals. #Gemini #SEC https://t.co/vBUt7t6Cr4 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 6, 2025 “The number of shares of Class A common stock to be offered and the price range… have not yet been determined,” Gemini said in its IPO filing. Though the company is yet to disclose timing or valuation targets, industry insiders expect the listing before the end of the year.

With institutional capital circling and major altcoins showing signs of life, the stage is set for high-potential projects to shine—especially those with strong narratives and growing ecosystems. XRP, Pi Coin, and Solana are three names dominating investor watchlists. Each comes with unique strengths and momentum, but a new altcoin quietly climbing the ranks—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is now being whispered about in the same breath. Insiders say its explosive presale could mirror the kind of breakout seen in past cycles with coins like SHIBA INU. XRP’s Institutional Push Gains Strength Ripple’s token XRP is riding a wave of optimism fueled by global adoption of its blockchain infrastructure. Banks and payment firms across Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America are increasingly adopting XRPL as a low-cost, high-speed alternative to SWIFT. Analysts also believe a spot XRP ETF is becoming almost inevitable after Ethereum’s approval cleared a path for alt-based investment vehicles. With its market cap already among the top 3, any regulatory greenlight could be the spark for a major move. Solana Eyes ETF Inclusion and Global Market Reach Solana is another key player in the conversation. Known for its blazing-fast speed and expanding DeFi footprint, Solana has laid out a long-term plan to serve as the backbone of future internet capital markets. With major U.S. and Asian funds showing interest, and ETF speculation heating up, SOL could be one of the biggest winners of the next breakout – especially with current price levels still well below previous highs. Early-Stage Surge No One Saw Coming While XRP and Solana draw headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a breakout story of its own. The project’s early-stage presale is breaking records , with each round closing faster than the last. According to sources familiar with the launch, investors who secured MAGACOIN at early prices could see exponential gains – especially if the current demand trend continues. The MAGACOIN community has grown rapidly, driven by buzz that this could be the next meme-to-utility crossover success. With limited access and rounds selling out in minutes, early participants are treating this as a rare chance to enter before listings. Pi Coin: Hype, Hope, and Uncertainty Pi Coin remains one of the most hyped yet mysterious projects in the altcoin space. With tens of millions of users worldwide, the Pi Network has an enormous base – but still lacks full on-chain functionality. If the team delivers a functional mainnet and secures key exchange listings, Pi Coin could trigger a retail wave like no other. Until then, it remains speculative – but too big to ignore. Conclusion: The Window for Early Movers Is Narrowing The next altcoin breakout could come from many directions – XRP’s institutional push, Solana’s infrastructure dominance, or Pi’s grassroots momentum. But with MAGACOIN FINANCE already outperforming early-stage expectations and presale windows closing rapidly, it’s quickly earning a spot alongside top-tier contenders . As smart money positions itself early, the race to dominate the next bull market is just getting started.

Prices are climbing, and people are back on the lookout for the top trending cryptos to watch heading into 2025. Bitcoin still grabs the spotlight, but other coins are quietly making strong moves. These are projects with real use, active teams, and fast-growing technology. From well-known names like Ethereum and Cardano to fast-rising stars like BlockDAG, 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year for crypto. These coins are building strong networks that can grow with time. So if someone is planning one’s next move or just wants to see where crypto is heading, this blog covers four coins that could make a big splash in 2025: BlockDAG, Ethereum, Chainlink, and Cardano. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): 30x Return Potential With Solid Tech BlockDAG is becoming one of the top trending cryptos to watch for 2025. With $355 million raised and 24.4 billion coins already sold, BlockDAG (BDAG) is on track to finish one of the largest presales in the crypto world. Right now, buyers can get in at a special GLOBAL LAUNCH release price of $0.0016 until August 11. The confirmed launch price is $0.05. That means a chance to earn up to 3,025% in returns. The BlockDAG ecosystem is also seeing real activity. More than 2 million users are mining BDAG using the X1 mobile app, which needs no hardware or setup. Those who want more power have shown huge interest in BDAG miners as over 18,800 miners have been sold. These devices are easy to plug in and use at home. Developers are showing up in big numbers. Over 4,500 developers are building more than 300 dApps in areas like AI, identity, and DeFi. There’s also a NO VESTING PASS offer right now, which means all coins bought today will be fully unlocked when BlockDAG launches. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release happening on August 11, this is not just another presale, it’s a working system with people using and building on it. Given its low entry price and high growth, BlockDAG looks like a rare chance for major gains going into 2025. 2. Ethereum (ETH): The Big Name Backed By Institutions Ethereum keeps showing why it’s here to stay. In July alone, more than $5.1 billion went into Ethereum ETFs. One fund, ETHA, brought in $440 million in just a single day. That shows how much big companies trust Ethereum’s future. Companies like BitMine and The Ether Machine are also adding ETH to their balance sheets. The charts look strong, too. If ETH breaks past $4,000, experts believe it could go as high as $5,000–$6,000. Ethereum offers steady growth, deep liquidity, and the most developer activity in the space. That makes it one of the top trending cryptos for 2025. As more people use staking, and as ETFs grow, Ethereum’s reach and value could grow even more. 3. Chainlink (LINK): A Key Player In Cross-Chain Data Chainlink remains the top data solution in crypto. With its price sitting near $18.70–$18.80 and over $500 million in daily trading, it’s in high demand. One big reason is that Chainlink works across many blockchains. It recently connected with Solana for Proof-of-Reserve and messaging systems. LINK also keeps growing through tools like CCIP and Data Streams. As more DeFi apps and Web3 systems need real-world data, Chainlink fills that role. Its trading chart shows a rising trend. The steady outflow from exchanges suggests holders are confident. That’s why many call LINK one of the top trending cryptos for 2025. As crypto becomes more connected, Chainlink’s role will become even more important. 4. Cardano (ADA): Quiet Strength With Developer Power Cardano isn’t always in the news, but it’s gaining ground in a big way. ADA just went up 15% this past week. It broke out of a long downtrend and may be forming a golden cross, a strong bullish sign. It now ranks #5 on GitHub for developer activity. That shows steady work happening behind the scenes. On-chain numbers are also strong: over 2,000 live projects, 111+ million transactions, and 1.34 million delegated wallets. New tools like Tool Compass are making it easier for developers to build on Cardano. Experts say the price could reach $1.20 soon, and maybe $2–3 later on if growth continues. It earns its place among the top trending cryptos for its solid structure and long-term growth path. Wrap Up! Looking ahead, the crypto scene is full of promise. Ethereum is building trust with big money. Chainlink is becoming the go-to source for data across chains. Cardano is growing slowly but steadily with strong tech teams behind it. And then there’s BlockDAG, a fast-moving, user-focused platform with millions already using it. Its GLOBAL LAUNCH release gives buyers a rare price of $0.0016 until August 11. With a set launch price of $0.05, that’s a possible 3,025% gain. With over 24.4 billion coins sold and no vesting, BlockDAG stands out. If someone is looking to spot the next big winner, this could be it. In the hunt for the top trending cryptos, these four names, each in their own way, could shape the next wave of growth in 2025.

Despite the bullish setup, an analyst suggests that investors start to become more cautious as the weeks progress. Related Reading: Injective Targets $25 Amid Crucial Breakout Attempt – New Highs In Sight? Bitcoin Bull Flag To Determine Next Move Since the early July breakout, Bitcoin has been trading within a crucial price range, hitting its latest all-time high during this period. The flagship crypto has been hovering between $114,000-$120,000, retesting the local lows on Friday before recovering the range highs over the weekend. Amid this performance, market watcher Crypto Patel highlighted that BTC is trading inside a bull flag formation in the 4H chart, which could lead to an 8%-12% move once broken out. According to the analysis, if the cryptocurrency successfully breaks above the pattern’s descending resistance, near the $120,000 mark, its price could see a surge toward the $130,000 barrier for the first time. On the contrary, a rejection from this area could send Bitcoin toward the bull flag’s support, around $114,000, once more. The analyst warned that despite the key support’s strength, a breakdown below this level would invalidate the bullish pattern and risk a drop to the $100,000 level or below. In a Monday analysis, analyst Rekt Capital also discussed BTC’s bull flag in the weekly chart. He noted that Bitcoin closed last week above the bull flag top despite the Friday drop, “preparing and positioning itself for a confirmed breakout.” Therefore, the start-of-week pullback could be considered a volatile post-breakout retest if the cryptocurrency closes this week above $119,200. The analyst explained that “price has an entire week to do that; in fact, price could downside wick below the Bull Flag bottom to form a potential Diamond-Shaped candlestick formation in the downside wicks.” “It makes sense why price needs to dip,” he detailed, “it also makes sense for price to dip via the perspective of the newly formed Weekly CME Gap.” BTC’s Rally Running Out Of Time? As Daan Crypto Trades pointed out, BTC opened the week with a new CME Gap between $118,297 and $120,035, which was immediately closed on Monday, as the price retraced to the $117,000 mark. Notably, the flagship crypto has been closing its CME Gaps at the start of the week for the past five weeks, “building quite the streak at this point.” To the trader, “the longer this goes on, the more of a self-fulfilling prophecy it will become.” Rekt Capital also highlighted that Bitcoin has entered Week 4 of its second Price Discovery Uptrend, asserting that if BTC confirms a breakout from the weekly bullish flag, then “trend continuation in Price Discovery Uptrend 2 would be achieved.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Rally Might Be Running on Fumes, Analyst Warns of August Turning Point He warned that the second Uptrend could not last much longer. According to the analyst, the trend continuation could fail in the coming weeks, as the cryptocurrency transitions into the Weeks 5-7 of this phase. It’s worth noting that this cycle’s first Price Discovery uptrend lasted around 6-7 weeks before reaching the local top. As a result, he considers it “would be conservative thus to become increasingly cautious as time goes on,” starting to become “cautiously optimistic” from this week on. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,161, a 2.1% decline in the weekly timeframe.

The price is now trading below $3.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3.120 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $3.080 zone. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Increase XRP price started a fresh decline below the $3.30 zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $3.250 and $3.220 support levels. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3.004 swing low to the $3.330 high. The bears even pushed the price below the $3.120 support zone. Finally, the bulls appeared near the $3.080 level.

The first major resistance is near the $3.20 level. A clear move above the $3.20 resistance might send the price toward the $3.250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.330 resistance or even $3.350 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $3.40 zone. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $3.20 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.080 level. The next major support is near the $3.020 level.

The regulator voted on July 29 to approve orders allowing authorized participants to create and redeem shares of Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products (ETPs) in kind, meaning they can receive the underlying cryptocurrency directly rather than cash. Until now, spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs approved in 2024 were restricted to cash-only transactions. Chairman Paul S. Atkins said following the vote: “A key priority of my chairmanship is developing a fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for crypto asset markets. Investors will benefit from these approvals, as they will make these products less costly and more efficient.” I'm pleased to share the SEC approved in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETPs. The approvals continue to build a rational regulatory framework for crypto, leading to a deeper and more dynamic market, which will benefit all American investors. https://t.co/UbQ9pXlBpD pic.twitter.com/DX8ub16Ey3 — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) July 29, 2025 New Redemption Option to Boost Flexibility and Cut Costs The in-kind redemption model is common for traditional stock and commodity ETFs. In this system, authorized participants exchange shares for the underlying securities rather than cash. Now, applying the same mechanism to crypto ETPs, industry observers say, reduces friction. Additionally, it gives issuers and market makers greater flexibility when managing the funds. Move Lets Investors Defer Capital Gains Until Crypto Sale By allowing in-kind transfers, the SEC also gives institutional investors better tax efficiency. In a cash redemption, ETP issuers must sell the underlying cryptocurrency to raise funds, often triggering capital gains that are then passed on to shareholders. In-kind redemptions allow investors to receive the crypto directly and defer taxes until they decide to sell the assets. The Commission’s vote also advanced other initiatives to standardize the treatment of crypto-based products. It approved exchange applications to list and trade a mixed spot Bitcoin and Ether ETP, as well as options and Flexible Exchange (FLEX) options on certain spot Bitcoin products. Position limits for options on Bitcoin ETPs were increased to align with generic limits of up to 250,000 contracts. ETP Issuers Poised to Benefit as SEC Eases Operational Constraints Two scheduling orders were also issued to seek public comment on whether national securities exchanges should be allowed to list and trade two large-cap crypto ETPs. These products had been approved earlier by the Division of Trading and Markets under delegated authority. The decision marks a departure from the more restrictive framework adopted for crypto ETFs last year. In addition, analysts said the shift brings the sector closer to how mainstream ETFs operate. As a result, it could lead to tighter spreads and better liquidity. Moreover, it may attract new institutional investors who had been cautious about the operational constraints of cash-only redemptions. Crypto ETF assets have grown rapidly since spot Bitcoin ETFs debuted in early 2024, amassing tens of billions in assets under management. The SEC’s latest orders could accelerate that growth as issuers adapt to the new framework.

One such entity making significant waves is MARA Holdings , formerly known as Marathon Digital. This U.S. crypto mining powerhouse recently unveiled its second-quarter financial results, and the numbers are nothing short of remarkable, setting a new benchmark for the company’s performance. Unpacking MARA Holdings’ Astounding Financial Performance MARA Holdings has truly outdone itself, reporting an astonishing 64% year-over-year (YoY) increase in its second-quarter revenue. This surge pushed their total revenue to a record-breaking $238 million, marking their highest quarterly revenue ever recorded. This isn’t just a slight uptick; it’s a testament to strategic execution and favorable market conditions. Let’s break down these impressive figures: Record Revenue: $238 million in Q2, an all-time high for the company. Significant YoY Growth: A robust 64% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Net Income Soars: Net income skyrocketed by an incredible 505% to $808 million. This exponential growth highlights not just revenue generation but also enhanced profitability. These figures paint a picture of a company firing on all cylinders, demonstrating robust operational capabilities alongside a shrewd understanding of market dynamics. For anyone observing the crypto mining sector, MARA Holdings ‘ performance provides a compelling case study in successful navigation of this often-unpredictable industry. The Bitcoin Effect: Fueling MARA Holdings’ Unprecedented Gains While operational efficiency plays a crucial role, a significant driver behind MARA Holdings ‘ monumental net income jump was the surging price of Bitcoin (BTC). The company reported a staggering $1.2 billion in unrealized gains, directly attributable to the appreciation in Bitcoin’s value during the quarter. This highlights a critical aspect of crypto mining companies’ financial health: their exposure to the underlying digital assets they produce. MARA Holdings strategically holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin. As of their Q2 report, the company boasts an impressive $5.87 billion worth of BTC on its balance sheet. This considerable holding means that when Bitcoin’s price rises, the value of their assets increases significantly, contributing to massive unrealized gains that bolster their net income figures. Conversely, it also means they are exposed to potential downturns, emphasizing the high-stakes nature of their business model. This direct correlation between Bitcoin’s price movements and MARA Holdings ‘ financial outcomes underscores the symbiotic relationship between miners and the cryptocurrency market. It’s a reminder that while mining generates new coins, the existing treasury of mined assets can become an equally, if not more, impactful factor in a company’s financial performance, especially during bull runs. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Mining Landscape? MARA Holdings ‘ stellar Q2 results send a powerful signal across the entire crypto mining industry. It suggests that despite challenges like increasing network difficulty and fluctuating energy costs, well-managed and scaled operations can achieve extraordinary profitability. Their success provides a beacon of optimism for the sector, indicating that significant returns are possible for companies that can optimize their operations and manage their Bitcoin holdings effectively. Several factors contribute to a mining company’s ability to capitalize on market opportunities: Operational Efficiency: Lowering energy consumption and maximizing hash rate per unit of power. Strategic Bitcoin Holdings: Deciding when to sell mined BTC versus holding for future appreciation. Infrastructure and Scale: Investing in robust, scalable mining facilities. Risk Management: Hedging against price volatility or energy cost fluctuations. MARA Holdings ‘ ability to leverage rising Bitcoin prices through its extensive holdings sets a precedent. It showcases that a diversified strategy, encompassing both active mining and strategic asset management, can yield exceptional results. This could encourage other miners to re-evaluate their own balance sheet strategies and the extent to which they retain mined Bitcoin. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for MARA Holdings While the Q2 report is a cause for celebration, the crypto mining industry is perpetually in motion, presenting both ongoing challenges and exciting opportunities for MARA Holdings . Potential Challenges Ahead: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The very factor that drove their Q2 gains can also lead to significant losses if prices decline. Managing this inherent volatility remains a core challenge. Network Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining new Bitcoin increases, potentially reducing profitability per unit of hash rate. Energy Costs and Sustainability: Rising energy prices and increasing scrutiny over environmental impact require continuous innovation in sustainable mining practices. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving regulations globally could impact operations and the overall market. Bitcoin Halving: The upcoming Bitcoin halving events will reduce the block reward, necessitating even greater efficiency to maintain profitability. Opportunities for Continued Growth: Expansion of Operations: Further increasing their hash rate and geographical footprint can boost mining output. Technological Advancements: Investing in more efficient mining hardware (ASICs) can significantly improve profitability. Diversification: Exploring other blockchain-related ventures or services beyond just Bitcoin mining. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with energy providers or technology firms to optimize operations. MARA Holdings ‘ future success will depend on its ability to strategically address these challenges while capitalizing on emerging opportunities. Their strong financial position, as evidenced by the Q2 report, provides a solid foundation for navigating these complexities. A Glimpse into MARA Holdings’ Operational Strengths Beyond the impressive financial figures, it’s worth noting the operational backbone that supports MARA Holdings ‘ achievements. The company has consistently focused on expanding its mining capacity and improving efficiency. Their commitment to building a robust infrastructure capable of handling massive computational power is fundamental to their ability to mine Bitcoin competitively. Their operational strategy often involves securing access to reliable and cost-effective energy sources, which is paramount in an energy-intensive industry like crypto mining. By strategically managing their fleet of miners and optimizing their energy consumption, MARA Holdings positions itself to maximize its Bitcoin production, laying the groundwork for future revenue generation and asset accumulation. This focus on core operational strengths, combined with astute financial management, solidifies MARA Holdings ‘ position as a leader in the digital asset mining space, poised for continued influence in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion: A Beacon of Growth in the Digital Frontier MARA Holdings ‘ second-quarter performance is a powerful narrative of success in the cryptocurrency sector. With record revenue, soaring net income, and substantial unrealized gains from its Bitcoin holdings, the company has demonstrated remarkable resilience and strategic acumen. This achievement not only solidifies MARA Holdings ‘ standing as a dominant player in crypto mining but also serves as an inspiring example of how companies can leverage market dynamics to achieve extraordinary financial results.

Recently, the spotlight has been firmly fixed on Strategy, a prominent Bitcoin treasury firm, as it reveals an astounding figure: a staggering $28.18 billion in unrealized profits from its extensive Bitcoin holdings . This isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to a bold, long-term vision in the volatile yet rewarding digital asset space. What does this mean for the crypto market, and what can we learn from such an audacious investment strategy? Unpacking Strategy’s Phenomenal Bitcoin Holdings The sheer scale of Strategy’s success with its Bitcoin holdings is truly remarkable. According to data shared by Lookonchain on X, the firm is currently sitting on an unrealized profit of $28.18 billion. This impressive figure comes on the heels of their continued accumulation strategy. Just recently, Strategy significantly expanded its portfolio by purchasing an additional 21,021 BTC, valued at approximately $2.46 billion at the time of acquisition, with an average cost of $117,256 per Bitcoin. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the key figures: Total Bitcoin Holdings: 628,791 BTC Current Market Value: Approximately $74.26 billion (based on current market prices) Average Entry Price: $73,277 per BTC Total Unrealized Profit: $28.18 billion These numbers paint a clear picture of a company deeply committed to Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Their average entry price of $73,277 is crucial here, indicating that a significant portion of their acquisitions occurred at much lower price points, allowing them to capitalize on Bitcoin’s subsequent price surges. This consistent accumulation, even during market fluctuations, underscores a conviction that few institutional players have demonstrated. Why Strategy’s Approach to Bitcoin Holdings Matters Strategy’s journey with its substantial Bitcoin holdings isn’t just about impressive profits; it’s a powerful narrative for the broader crypto ecosystem. Their strategy highlights several critical aspects: Institutional Confidence: Strategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, evidenced by continuous purchases and holding through market cycles, sends a strong signal to other corporations and institutional investors. It demonstrates that Bitcoin can be a viable and highly profitable treasury asset, challenging traditional notions of corporate finance. Long-Term Vision: Unlike many who engage in short-term trading, Strategy exemplifies a long-term ‘HODL’ strategy. Their willingness to buy and hold, even as prices fluctuate, is a testament to their belief in Bitcoin’s future potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Pioneering Corporate Adoption: Strategy was one of the first major publicly traded companies to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Their success acts as a blueprint and a case study for other companies considering similar moves, potentially accelerating mainstream corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies. Market Influence: Given the sheer size of their Bitcoin holdings , Strategy’s actions can influence market sentiment. Large purchases can provide upward price momentum, while their consistent holding reduces circulating supply, potentially contributing to price stability and appreciation over time. The Anatomy of a Winning Strategy: Lessons from Their Bitcoin Holdings What can aspiring investors or even other corporations learn from Strategy’s successful management of its Bitcoin holdings ? It boils down to a few core principles: Conviction and Research: Strategy’s leadership has consistently articulated a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. Their investments are not speculative bets but rather calculated decisions based on extensive research into Bitcoin’s monetary policy, network security, and potential as a global reserve asset. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): While not explicitly stated as their sole method, their consistent purchases over time, across various price points, resemble a sophisticated form of dollar-cost averaging. This strategy helps mitigate the risk of market timing and smooths out the average purchase price. Transparency: Strategy has been remarkably transparent about its Bitcoin strategy, regularly disclosing its holdings and purchases. This transparency builds trust with investors and provides valuable data for market analysts. Patience: The most significant lesson might be patience. Unrealized profits become realized only when assets are sold. Strategy’s ability to hold through significant bull and bear cycles underscores the importance of a long-term perspective in volatile markets. Are There Risks to Such Massive Bitcoin Holdings? While the current profits are impressive, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with such substantial Bitcoin holdings . Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a significant factor. A sudden market downturn could rapidly diminish these unrealized gains. Furthermore, regulatory changes, technological shifts, or unforeseen global economic events could impact Bitcoin’s value. Strategy’s strategy is not without its critics, who point to the concentration risk and the potential for large unrealized losses if market conditions turn sour. However, the firm has consistently expressed confidence in its long-term outlook, viewing Bitcoin as a superior form of money and a long-term hedge against fiat currency debasement. Actionable Insights for Your Own Crypto Journey While most individual investors won’t have the capital to replicate Strategy’s scale, their success with Bitcoin holdings offers valuable lessons: Educate Yourself: Understand the technology, economics, and long-term potential of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. Consider a Long-Term Perspective: Short-term trading is risky. A long-term ‘HODL’ strategy, particularly for foundational assets like Bitcoin, can be more rewarding. Dollar-Cost Average: Invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This reduces risk and averages out your purchase price over time. Diversify (Carefully): While Strategy is heavily concentrated in Bitcoin, individual investors might consider a diversified portfolio across a few strong assets, based on their risk tolerance. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and be prepared for significant price fluctuations. Strategy’s journey serves as a compelling case study in institutional crypto adoption and the potential for significant returns when conviction meets a long-term vision. Their massive unrealized profits from Bitcoin holdings not only highlight their strategic prowess but also reinforce Bitcoin’s growing prominence as a legitimate and powerful asset class in the global financial landscape. As the digital economy evolves, stories like Strategy’s will undoubtedly continue to inspire and inform the future of investment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are unrealized profits in the context of Bitcoin holdings? Unrealized profits refer to the theoretical gain on an investment that has not yet been sold. For Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings, it means the current market value of their Bitcoin is $28.18 billion higher than their total purchase cost, but they haven’t sold the Bitcoin yet to ‘realize’ those profits. 2. How does Strategy acquire such large amounts of Bitcoin? Strategy typically acquires Bitcoin through open market purchases, often executed in large blocks through institutional trading desks. They fund these purchases through various means, including equity offerings and convertible senior notes, demonstrating their commitment to accumulating Bitcoin as a treasury asset. 3. Is Strategy’s investment strategy considered risky? While any investment in volatile assets like Bitcoin carries risk, Strategy’s approach is based on a long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value. They view it as a superior store of value and a hedge against inflation. The risk is managed by their long-term horizon and their belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental properties, rather than short-term price speculation. 4. What is the significance of Strategy’s average entry price of $73,277? The average entry price of $73,277 indicates the average cost at which Strategy acquired all its Bitcoin. A lower average entry price relative to the current market price signifies substantial unrealized profits. It highlights their strategic accumulation over time, including periods when Bitcoin’s price was lower. 5. Can other companies replicate Strategy’s success with Bitcoin holdings? While every company’s financial situation and risk tolerance differ, Strategy’s model provides a blueprint for corporate Bitcoin adoption. Success would depend on a similar long-term conviction, a robust financial strategy to fund acquisitions, and a willingness to navigate market volatility.

Despite the red candles, sentiment remains high across social media and crypto circles, as traders await a potential ETF greenlight—an event many believe could act as a major catalyst for XRP’s next rally. With Ripple’s institutional partnerships expanding and legal clouds clearing, there’s rising confidence that XRP is positioning for a decisive move. Many investors who previously overlooked the coin are now circling back, especially as Bitcoin and Ethereum begin to consolidate gains from earlier this month. It’s in this environment of renewed optimism that newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are beginning to attract serious attention from early-stage investors looking for the next major breakout before it happens. XRP’s Chart Signals a Potential Reversal Technical analysis shows XRP may be preparing for a breakout. The token’s price has retraced to a key support zone just above $3.00, while the RSI has dropped below 40, often a signal of oversold conditions. If momentum shifts in early August—as many expect with increasing ETF speculation—a run toward $4.50 or even $5.00 could be back on the table. Amid this backdrop, early-stage buyers are racing into MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has rapidly become one of the fastest-moving altcoins of 2025. Unlike typical meme coin hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing record presale sellouts , driven by a loyal and growing community. Analysts are pointing out that MAGACOIN’s current momentum already exceeds many top altcoin’’s early growth curves, suggesting a rare opportunity . Early investors have seen allocations disappear in minutes , reinforcing the urgency for those still on the sidelines. Can XRP Hit $5 Before August Ends? The path to $5 isn’t without resistance, but the ingredients are lining up: Legal clarity post-SEC developments Rising calls for a spot XRP ETF Historical RSI patterns showing recovery setups Growing institutional engagement across Ripple’s network A shift in capital from meme tokens into high-potential assets like XRP If these elements converge, XRP could see a second wind that drives price action toward—and potentially beyond—the $5.00 mark by the end of August. Conclusion XRP’s technicals and ETF optimism make it one of the most-watched tokens heading into August. But investors looking to diversify are also turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, where record-speed presale sellouts and community traction hint at a massive run ahead. For those aiming to catch the next bullish wave, both XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are firmly on the radar.

The company, which already holds the largest Bitcoin treasury among publicly traded firms, revealed on Tuesday that it made the purchase at an average price of $117,256 per coin. This latest move brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 628,791 BTC. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, this is the company’s largest acquisition since the end of March. STRC IPO Becomes Biggest US Listing of 2025 Strategy financed the purchase through its fourth preferred stock offering — STRC — raising $2.5 billion. The firm sold 28 million shares of its Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock at $90 per share, significantly upsizing the deal from its initial $500 million target. The STRC issuance is now the largest US IPO of 2025 in terms of gross proceeds, surpassing the $1 billion offering from Circle Internet Group earlier this year. Strategic Financing Model Draws Copycats This latest acquisition is part of Strategy’s broader approach of using capital markets to increase its Bitcoin reserves. Over the years, the company has deployed a mix of equity offerings, debt instruments, and convertible notes to fund its Bitcoin purchases. This strategy has inspired at least 160 public companies to add cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets. STRC to Begin Nasdaq Trading Strategy confirmed that STRC would begin trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. This marks the first perpetual preferred security issued by a Bitcoin treasury firm to be listed on a US exchange. STRC will offer monthly board-adjusted dividends, making it attractive to income-oriented investors. It joins a family of similar instruments from Strategy, including STRK, STRF, and STRD — each designed to meet different investment goals, with varying yields and dividend structures. Shares Show Modest Reaction Ahead of Earnings Shares of Strategy (MSTR) dipped 2.26% at Tuesday’s close but slightly recovered 0.52% in after-hours trading to reach $396.70. So far in 2025, MSTR shares are up by 31.55%, a slower pace compared to the 358.55% surge seen in 2024. This latest Bitcoin buy comes just ahead of the company’s second-quarter earnings report, due Thursday, which will detail how its fundraising and crypto investments have impacted its financials through June 30.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TREASURY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-30 04:31:50
49216208,https://nulltx.com/?p=151619,1753849959,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,How To Vet a Token’s Holder Distribution with SolScan and BaseScan,https://nulltx.com/how-to-vet-a-tokens-holder-distribution-with-solscan-and-basescan/,"When researching a token, checking how its supply is distributed using SolScan or BaseScan is crucial. A highly centralized distribution (lots of tokens held by just a few wallets) can be a red flag. A healthy token has many holders sharing the supply more evenly. Block explorers let you see this on-chain data: on SolScan (for Solana tokens) and BaseScan (for Base/Ethereum L2 tokens), every token’s page lists supply, number of holders, and “Top Holders” details. Use these tools to answer: Who are the top 10 or 100 holders? What share do they hold? If one wallet or a few hold the majority of tokens, proceed with caution. Using SolScan to Check Holders and Whales To analyze a Solana-based token, open SolScan and paste the token’s symbol or mint address into the search bar. On the token’s info page you’ll see core metrics (price, total and circulating supply, etc.) and tabs like Holders , Transfers , Metadata , etc. Clicking Holders brings up a list of the largest addresses and the percentage of supply each holds. This reveals any big whales at a glance. For example, below is a SolScan “Holders” view (USDC on Solana): it shows each top wallet’s share of the supply. Such charts make it easy to spot when a few addresses (often exchanges or team wallets) dominate. If a few wallets hold tens of percent of the supply, that’s a warning sign. Using BaseScan to Check Holders and Distribution For Base tokens, use BaseScan . As with Etherscan, paste the token’s contract address into BaseScan’s search bar. The token’s page will display price, total supply, number of holders, and transaction history. Crucially, there is a Holders section that lists top addresses and their share of supply. Like SolScan, this instantly shows if a few wallets, often labeled “Verified Token” or large exchanges, own most of the supply. On BaseScan, look for the “Holders” or “Rich List” section. There you can see exactly how many addresses hold the token and the balance of each top holder. If available, BaseScan’s charts and stats will also show token distribution. For example, trading analysis might flag if whales deposit tokens on an exchange. Whale Concentration: Why It Matters High whale concentration can mean easy manipulation. If just 1–2 wallets control 90% of supply, “it’s a huge imbalance”. Those whales alone could crash or pump the price. In many projects, whales hold 80%+ of tokens. Even retail investors typically hold under 10% of supply. So when vetting, compare the distribution you see on SolScan or BaseScan to these norms. Ideally, no single wallet should hold an extreme share. A rule of thumb: if the top 10 holders together own, say, over 50 – 60%, consider that very centralized. For context, popular assets with low concentration might have over 30% in their top-10. Tools like SolScan make it easy to spot such cases. If the SolScan holders chart (or BaseScan holder list) shows one or two addresses with huge bars, be wary. Watch out for these signs: – Sudden Large Transfers: If a whale address you saw moves many tokens at once (especially to an exchange address), it could trigger a price dump. SolScan/BaseScan allow you to see an address’s transaction history, so you can catch these events. – Identical Balances: If two or more top holders have almost the same balance or were funded at the same time, they may be related (like multiple wallets owned by one person). This is a red flag for “address clustering,” implying the supply is really in one hand. – Infinite Profit/No Cost: On SolScan, if a holder’s PnL shows “∞” (infinite), it often means they were airdropped tokens for free (common for dev wallets or marketing airdrops). Large dev wallets often show this because they received tokens from minting. Patience and cross-checking help. Use whale tracking alerts or scripts (or simple manual checks) to follow large wallet moves. Whale tracking bots can notify you, but even manually, you can enter a whale address in SolScan to see its history. If a whale that used to sit still suddenly starts selling, you’ll know to be cautious. Dev/Team Wallets and Vesting Schedules A project’s roadmap or tokenomics usually includes vesting for team and investors. Ideally, these tokens are locked and released slowly. When vetting, find the addresses associated with the team or treasury and check if their tokens are locked or moving. On SolScan/BaseScan, there’s no built-in “lock” indicator, but you can infer: if big transfers happen on known unlock dates, that’s a sign. Always read the official docs or whitepaper for vesting schedules, and use explorers to verify. For example, if a whitepaper says “20% unlocked at TGE, then 10% monthly,” you should see a large transfer on launch like 20%, then smaller monthly transfers from the team wallet. If vesting is unclear or a team wallet suddenly moves a large chunk without public notice, that’s very risky. Some tools like Tokenomist track scheduled unlocks for top tokens, but for custom tokens you’ll rely on on-chain clues. On BaseScan, check if the token’s contract or a related vesting contract holds tokens. On SolScan, check if the token mint authority or a timelock program still holds large balances. If the team’s portion is already liquid on exchanges, beware it could be dumped. Spotting Suspicious Patterns Beyond obvious whales and vesting, look for odd patterns: – New Token Packs: If many new wallets suddenly accumulate tokens like during launch, and then stop trading, they may be sleeper bots. If they later all dump, it’s coordinated. – Exchanges vs. Decentralization: A few centralized exchange addresses holding a ton can be good (it means many users deposit there), but if only exchanges hold a token and no small holders appear, trading depends entirely on those exchanges. That’s risky liquidity-wise. – Token Flows: SolScan’s “Token Flow Visualizer” or simply watching transfer logs can show tokens bouncing between wallets. Chains of rapid transfers might indicate wash trading or attempts to hide who’s moving the coins. While SolScan’s newer flow charts are interactive, you can also manually click through transfer lists to trace movements. If something looks fishy, do more digging: check social media or community channels to see if anyone noted these wallets, or use other analytics tools. But always anchor back in the explorer data: it doesn’t lie. Example Checklists Here’s a quick checklist when vetting distribution on SolScan or BaseScan : – Holders Count: Large vs. small number of holders (hundreds vs. thousands). More holders usually means broader distribution. – Top Wallets: Click the holders list. Note any single wallet with over 5–10%, and sum of top 5 or 10. High numbers are risky. – Whales/Exchanges: See if big holders are labeled (Binance, Coinbase, etc.) or are long addresses (likely non-exchange). – Dev/Team: Find clues: token mint authority, founder tweets announcing “my wallet is X”, or a vesting contract address. Check their balances and movements. – Vesting Checks: Compare on-chain transfers to the project’s stated vesting. On BaseScan, monitor known team addresses for token flows after unlock dates. On SolScan, look for transactions from the mint or stake accounts. – Suspicious Flows: On both explorers, use the Transfers log to spot repeated large transfers or circular flows (tokens sent to one address and back). By using SolScan and BaseScan this way, beginners and intermediate users can get a clear picture of a token’s ownership. Remember, a decentralized token (many holders, no giant whales) is generally safer than one where a few wallets control the game . Always cite the on-chain data you see, in practice, saving screenshots or noting SolScan/BaseScan links helps verify your findings. This kind of due diligence, paired with community research, greatly reduces the risk of nasty surprises from hidden whales or locked token dumps. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The MSCI index for Asia‑Pacific rose 0.3%, where Taiwan led the gains, as American stocks closed slightly lower. Japan’s Nikkei dipped 0.03% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slid 0.4%. The euro recovered from a one‑month low, gaining 0.2% to $1.1564, after the EU struck a trade deal with the U.S. administration. Traders are bracing for a series of central bank announcements, key economic data releases and corporate earnings reports over the coming days, all leading up to President Donald Trump’s August 1 deadline for new tariffs, dubbed “Liberation Day.” The Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday, although a handful of policymakers may dissent and call for lower borrowing costs in view of growing global uncertainties. U.S. Treasuries strengthened ahead of the Fed’s decision A strong seven‑year note auction eased worries about demand for government debt, pushing the benchmark 10‑year yield down to 4.328%, its lowest since July 3, while the two‑year yield held at 3.873%. Investors now look to the Bank of Japan, which is expected to keep its policy rate unchanged on Thursday. They will study its statement for signs of when it might resume rate increases, now that a recent trade deal with the United States has cleared the path for tighter policy. With the August 1 deadline looming, trade talks with several countries were entering final hours, as diplomats warned time was running out to prevent fresh U.S. import duties. On Tuesday, U.S. and Chinese officials said they would seek to extend their 90‑day tariff truce, though they announced no major progress, leaving both sides awaiting political approval before any further moves. U.S. officials noted that President Trump must decide whether to extend the truce, which expires on August 12, or let tariffs return to triple‑digit levels, as the final choice rests with the White House. India is also gearing up for steeper U.S. duties, expected to range from 20% to 25% on certain exports, as officials there pause new trade offers ahead of the August 1 cutoff, according to two unnamed government sources. In another push to avert fresh taxes, three South Korean cabinet ministers travelled to Washington for meetings with Commerce Secretary Lutnick, in what officials described as a last‑ditch effort to secure concessions. Oil prices ticked up In energy markets, oil prices ticked up on worries about future supply shortages after President Trump imposed a tight deadline on Russia to end its military actions in Ukraine. Brent crude for September delivery rose by 14 cents, or 0.19%, to settle at $72.65 per barrel. The spotlight also turns to earnings from U.S. tech giants, with Microsoft and Meta set to report on Wednesday. Analysts say their results will shape sentiment for the rest of the reporting season, following a relatively solid start to quarterly updates. At the same time, the Singapore dollar gained 0.2% after the Monetary Authority of Singapore opted to keep its policy unchanged.

This move could be a game-changer, not just for the London-based neobank, but for the entire fintech landscape, especially for those keenly watching the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. It signals a clear intent from Revolut to deepen its roots in the lucrative U.S. market, promising a more integrated and comprehensive financial experience for its American users. Why is a National US Banking License So Crucial for Revolut’s Strategic Growth, Making This Revolut Acquisition a Game-Changer? For a neobank like Revolut, operating without a full national banking license in a market as vast and regulated as the United States presents significant limitations. Currently, Revolut relies on partnerships with existing U.S. banks to offer its services, which can restrict the scope of products, increase operational costs, and dilute its brand control. Acquiring a nationally chartered U.S. bank, as reported by the Financial Times, would fundamentally change this dynamic. Here’s why it’s a strategic imperative: Direct Deposit Insurance: A national license would enable Revolut to offer FDIC-insured accounts directly, building greater trust and confidence among consumers who prioritize security for their deposits. Expanded Product Offerings: With a license, Revolut could independently offer a broader range of financial products, including loans, mortgages, and potentially more sophisticated investment options, without needing a third-party partner. Reduced Operational Costs: Cutting out intermediary banks can lead to significant cost savings, which can then be passed on to customers through better rates or invested in product development. Full Control Over Customer Experience: Operating under its own license would give Revolut complete control over the entire banking stack, from onboarding to customer service, ensuring a seamless and consistent user experience. Enhanced Regulatory Standing: Holding a national license demonstrates a higher level of regulatory compliance and oversight, bolstering Revolut’s reputation and legitimacy in the eyes of regulators and consumers alike. How Does Revolut Currently Operate in the US, and What Limitations Does It Face Without a Full License, Prompting This Potential Revolut Acquisition ? Revolut officially launched in the U.S. in March 2020, but its operations have been somewhat constrained compared to its European footprint. Without its own banking charter, Revolut has functioned more as a financial technology company offering a front-end interface built on top of traditional banking infrastructure. This means: Reliance on Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) Providers: Revolut partners with U.S. banks to hold customer deposits and facilitate transactions. While this allows for rapid market entry, it means Revolut doesn’t directly control the underlying banking services. Limited Autonomy: The scope of services Revolut can offer is often dictated by its partners’ licenses and risk appetites, which might not align perfectly with Revolut’s global ambitions or its innovative approach to finance. Fragmented Regulatory Landscape: Operating state-by-state with various money transmitter licenses can be cumbersome and less efficient than a single national banking license. This reliance highlights the strategic necessity of a direct banking license. A successful Revolut acquisition would be the fastest route to achieving this, bypassing the lengthy and complex process of applying for a new charter from scratch. In the Dynamic Fintech Landscape, What Makes a Traditional Bank an Attractive Target for a Revolut Acquisition ? While some fintechs opt to build their banking operations from the ground up, acquiring an existing bank offers several compelling advantages, particularly for a global player like Revolut: Instant Licensing: The most significant benefit is immediately gaining a national banking charter, which can take years to secure through new applications. Established Infrastructure: Acquired banks come with existing operational infrastructure, including core banking systems, compliance frameworks, and often, a customer base. Regulatory Relationships: An existing bank already has established relationships with regulators, which can smooth the transition and ongoing compliance efforts. Talent Pool: The acquisition brings with it experienced banking professionals who understand the intricacies of the U.S. regulatory and operational environment. This strategy isn’t unique to Revolut. Other fintech companies, such as LendingClub and SoFi, have also pursued and completed similar acquisitions to gain banking charters, illustrating a growing trend where digital natives are buying their way into the traditional banking system to unlock new growth avenues and control their destiny. What Complex Regulatory Hurdles Must Revolut Overcome to Finalize a Successful Revolut Acquisition in the Highly Regulated U.S. Banking Sector? The U.S. banking regulatory environment is notoriously complex and stringent. A Revolut acquisition of a nationally chartered bank would involve navigating multiple layers of regulatory approval: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC): As the primary regulator for national banks, the OCC would need to approve the change of control and ensure Revolut meets all prudential standards. Federal Reserve: If the acquired bank is a state member bank or a bank holding company, the Federal Reserve would also have a say. State Regulators: Even with a national charter, state-specific regulations may apply depending on the acquired bank’s operations. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC): Regulators will scrutinize Revolut’s existing AML/KYC frameworks and its ability to integrate the acquired bank’s systems to maintain robust financial crime prevention.

The move would allow the UK’s largest fintech to bypass the often lengthy process of securing a banking charter from scratch. The company is considering acquiring a nationally chartered bank that already holds a licence, the Financial Times reported Tuesday. An acquisition would allow Revolut to lend in the US more quickly than applying for a banking charter independently, which can take years. Revolut weighs buying US bank to get licence https://t.co/YTVJXzbAlV — Financial Times (@FT) July 30, 2025 According to the report, the company is also said to be weighing applying for its own banking licence rather than entering through an acquisition. Revolut didn’t respond to Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Trump-Era Policies Seen as Potential Boost to Revolut’s Licence Bid The fintech, which has 60m customers worldwide, has been searching for ways to deepen its presence in the US, one of the world’s largest financial markets. Winning an American banking licence would provide access to a vast base of customers and deposits at a time when UK fintechs are facing slower growth at home. US President Donald Trump’s deregulatory agenda has created a perception that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency could expedite the approval process for bank charters, the FT said. However, Revolut is still exploring the most efficient path forward. Revolut Eyes Middle East, Latin America as It Seeks Scale Abroad The company is already in talks for a $1b deal that would raise fresh capital and value the fintech at about $65b , the FT reported ths week. Part of the funding would help finance its global expansion. Revolut has considered similar strategies elsewhere, including a plan to acquire a Middle Eastern bank. It completed the purchase of Argentine bank Cetelem from BNP Paribas last month as part of its expansion drive. Although Revolut holds banking licences in Lithuania, which allows it to operate across the European Union, and in Mexico, it has yet to secure one in the UK. Regulators approved its application last year but imposed restrictions that continue to limit its lending activity. US Banking Approval Could Pave Way for Digital Asset Services The company’s international ambitions extend beyond traditional banking. Revolut, which has offered crypto trading in the UK and the European Economic Area, resumed limited crypto operations in Hungary this week. The move came after a regulatory freeze earlier this summer, when Hungary introduced a new law requiring all crypto service providers to hold a domestic licence. As of Oct. 2023, Revolut suspended its crypto services in the US due to regulatory uncertainty. Now, it’s push for an American banking licence could lay the groundwork for broader product offerings, including digital asset services, if approved. Industry observers say a US banking licence would mark a significant milestone for Revolut and help it compete with American fintech rivals.

With Bitcoin and Ethereum already receiving spot ETF approvals and seeing massive institutional inflows, speculation is now swirling around which altcoin might be next. For many analysts, that frontrunner could beSolana – thanks to its lightning-fast transactions, growing developer base, and strong network effect. Solana’s current price hovers just under $186, and while some short-term pullbacks have occurred, the broader trend still points upward. If it secures an ETF in the coming months, history suggests we could see a rapid price breakout—similar to Bitcoin’s run past $70K or Ethereum’s rally after its own approval. Amid this growing institutional interest, investors are also exploring early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which some believe could offer even greater upside due to its current presale status. Solana’s Setup for a Breakout Technically, Solana is forming a solid base after cooling off from its June highs. Its all-time high remains at $293, and momentum indicators show the coin could be gearing up for a retest if a positive ETF headline hits. The recent RSI dip into oversold territory may be the kind of reset needed before a renewed push. In many ways, Solana is now where Ethereum was just weeks before its own ETF triggered a wave of new capital. Traders are watching the $190–$200 zone closely. A breakout above that could open the path to $220 and then $293. Beyond price action, ETF approval would bring legitimacy and long-term capital, potentially reshaping Solana’s role in the broader crypto landscape. A Rare Opportunity for Crypto Investors While Solana garners attention from institutions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-conviction pick for retail investors looking to strike early. The project is currently in presale, and slots are disappearing fast. What’s driving this surge? Analysts point to MAGACOIN’s aggressive development pace and viral community growth. With projections as high as 31x ROI, a $1,000 investment today could skyrocket to $31,000 by the next major cycle, according to early forecasts. The project has already hit several key milestones, including rapid user onboarding and ecosystem rollout. Could Solana Reach $293 Again? That depends largely on one thing: the ETF. If Solana receives regulatory approval in the U.S., institutional demand could skyrocket—just as it did for BTC and ETH. With fundamentals aligned and sentiment shifting, the next few weeks could be critical. And while Solana chases ETF-driven momentum, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are quietly giving early investors a shot at major gains , even before they hit centralized exchanges.

For years, companies like MicroStrategy have dominated headlines with their aggressive accumulation of digital assets. Now, a powerful new contender has emerged, poised to redefine the landscape of corporate Bitcoin holdings . Get ready to dive into the exciting revelation from Twenty One Capital, a firm backed by some of the biggest names in finance and technology, as they unveil their substantial stake in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Unveiling Twenty One Capital: A New Giant in Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The cryptocurrency community is buzzing with the official launch of Twenty One Capital’s website, which came with an astounding disclosure: the firm now holds a staggering 43,514 BTC. This isn’t just another small player; Twenty One Capital is a joint venture bringing together the formidable strengths of Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and SoftBank. This powerhouse combination signals a profound level of institutional confidence in Bitcoin, setting a new benchmark for strategic Bitcoin holdings . To put Twenty One Capital’s acquisition into perspective, let’s compare their Bitcoin holdings with other prominent corporate players: Corporate Holder Approximate BTC Holdings Notable Backers/Context MicroStrategy 628,791 BTC Pioneering corporate Bitcoin strategy, led by Michael Saylor MARA Holdings (Marathon Digital) 49,951 BTC Leading Bitcoin mining company, accumulating BTC from operations Twenty One Capital 43,514 BTC Joint venture backed by Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank Based on outstanding shares and public disclosures, Twenty One Capital immediately ranks as the third-largest corporate holder of BTC. This places them in an elite club, demonstrating a clear long-term commitment to the digital asset. Their significant Bitcoin holdings are not merely a speculative bet but rather a strategic investment that could influence market dynamics for years to come. Why Are These Substantial Bitcoin Holdings So Significant? The announcement of Twenty One Capital’s impressive Bitcoin holdings resonates deeply within the financial world for several compelling reasons: Institutional Validation: When entities like Twenty One Capital, backed by established financial and tech giants, publicly commit to such substantial Bitcoin holdings , it sends an undeniable signal of legitimacy. This move chips away at the lingering skepticism often associated with cryptocurrencies, painting Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset, but as a viable, long-term store of value and a strategic treasury reserve asset. It acts as a powerful endorsement, encouraging other corporations and institutional investors who might have been on the fence to reconsider their stance on digital assets. Market Maturity: The entry of such a well-capitalized and diversified firm into the top tier of corporate Bitcoin holdings indicates a maturation of the cryptocurrency market. It suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed through a traditional investment lens, where fundamental value, scarcity, and long-term growth potential are key drivers, rather than just short-term price fluctuations. Supply Dynamics: With more and more Bitcoin being locked up in long-term corporate and institutional Bitcoin holdings , the available supply for trading on exchanges can decrease. This reduction in liquid supply, combined with consistent demand, could exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price over time, especially as its scarcity becomes more pronounced. Bridge to Traditional Finance: The involvement of firms like Cantor Fitzgerald (a prominent financial services firm) and SoftBank (a global technology investment giant) in Twenty One Capital’s venture creates a stronger bridge between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning digital asset space. Their participation can pave the way for more mainstream adoption and integration of Bitcoin into established investment portfolios. The Power Players Behind the 43,514 BTC: A Look at Twenty One Capital’s Backers Understanding the collective strength behind Twenty One Capital’s formidable Bitcoin holdings is crucial. Each partner brings unique expertise and influence to the table, creating a robust foundation for this new venture: Tether: As the issuer of USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, Tether plays a pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem. Its involvement brings deep liquidity knowledge, extensive market insights, and a proven track record in digital asset operations. Tether’s backing adds a layer of confidence regarding the operational efficiency and strategic management of such significant Bitcoin holdings . Bitfinex: A veteran cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex provides the technical infrastructure, trading expertise, and direct access to global crypto markets. Their experience in managing large-scale digital asset transactions and security protocols is invaluable for safeguarding Twenty One Capital’s substantial Bitcoin holdings . Cantor Fitzgerald: This renowned global financial services firm brings decades of experience in traditional capital markets, institutional trading, and asset management. Their participation signals a significant endorsement from the mainstream finance world, potentially opening doors for further institutional engagement and sophisticated financial strategies around these Bitcoin holdings . SoftBank: The Japanese multinational conglomerate holding company is famous for its Vision Fund, which invests heavily in technology and disruptive innovation. SoftBank’s involvement underscores a belief in Bitcoin as a transformative technology and a long-term asset, aligning the firm’s strategic vision with the future of digital finance and large-scale Bitcoin holdings . The synergy among these diverse entities positions Twenty One Capital not just as a holder, but as a potentially influential force in shaping the narrative and trajectory of institutional Bitcoin holdings . Navigating the Waters: Potential Impacts and Challenges for Massive Bitcoin Holdings While the emergence of Twenty One Capital is largely seen as a positive development, holding such substantial Bitcoin holdings comes with both immense opportunities and inherent challenges. Opportunities: Enhanced Market Stability: Large, long-term institutional Bitcoin holdings can contribute to market stability by reducing the overall volatility often associated with retail trading. These entities are less likely to engage in short-term speculative selling, providing a more stable demand base. Driving Innovation: With significant capital committed to Bitcoin, Twenty One Capital and its backers may be incentivized to invest in infrastructure, security solutions, and new financial products that leverage their Bitcoin holdings , benefiting the entire ecosystem. Regulatory Clarity: The presence of established players often necessitates clearer regulatory frameworks. Their lobbying power and adherence to compliance can help push for more favorable and predictable regulations, which is beneficial for all participants in the crypto space. Challenges: Volatility Risk: Despite the long-term outlook, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Fluctuations in its value can significantly impact the balance sheets of companies with large Bitcoin holdings , potentially affecting their financial reporting and investor confidence. Security Concerns: Managing and securing 43,514 BTC requires top-tier cybersecurity measures. Any breach could lead to catastrophic losses, making robust cold storage and multi-signature solutions paramount. Regulatory Scrutiny: While they can push for clarity, large institutional Bitcoin holdings also attract increased scrutiny from regulators concerned about market manipulation, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance. Public Perception: The association with firms like Tether (which has faced past regulatory challenges) could lead to public relations hurdles, requiring transparent communication regarding their Bitcoin holdings and operational practices. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings and the Crypto Market? Twenty One Capital’s significant entry is more than just a headline; it’s a harbinger of things to come. This move is likely to inspire other large corporations and institutional investors who have been cautiously observing the crypto market from the sidelines. The validation provided by such a diverse and influential group of backers could trigger a domino effect, leading to a broader trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings becoming a standard part of treasury management and investment portfolios. For the broader crypto market, this signals continued maturation and integration into the global financial system. Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital currency to a globally recognized asset class is accelerating, driven by the increasing confidence of major financial players. We can expect to see: Increased institutional liquidity. More sophisticated financial products built around Bitcoin. A continued focus on regulatory compliance and transparency. Potentially, a reduction in extreme price swings as more long-term capital enters the market. For individual investors and enthusiasts, this development reinforces the long-term investment thesis for Bitcoin. It underscores the idea that Bitcoin is not just a passing fad but a fundamental shift in how value is stored and transferred in the digital age. Keeping an eye on these large institutional moves provides valuable insight into the macro trends shaping the future of digital assets. Conclusion The emergence of Twenty One Capital as a major player in corporate Bitcoin holdings marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. With 43,514 BTC under its belt and the formidable backing of Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and SoftBank, this joint venture is not just accumulating assets; it’s signaling a profound belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value and its role in the future of finance.

The price is now facing hurdles near $820 and might dip again toward the $788 support. BNB price is correcting gains and traded below the $820 support zone. The price is now trading below $810 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $800 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $788 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Trims Some Gains After a steady increase, BNB price failed to clear the $860 zone. There was a downside correction below the $850 and $680 levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . The price even dipped below $840 and tested $800. There was a clear move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $744 swing low to the $861 high. The bulls are now active near the $800 support zone. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $800 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $810 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $810 level. The next resistance sits near the $820 level. A clear move above the $820 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $845. A close above the $845 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $860 resistance.

The company said it planned to increase this allocation to 50% soon. Marti’s announcement mentioned that the crypto assets would be held through a regulated custodian with institutional-grade compliance. The firm’s CEO, Oguz Oktem, said his company viewed crypto assets as stores of value for long-term hedging. The company disclosed that its crypto reserve strategy was not expected to interfere with its other business activities. The current execution of business operations and plans will continue as scheduled. Oktem says the Bitcoin plan mitigates fiat currency risks The company’s founder and CEO said his firm’s Bitcoin strategy was aimed at mitigating risks associated with hard currencies. He added that all crypto asset acquisitions would be held indefinitely, with plans to keep stockpiling on different crypto assets like Solana and Ethereum in the future. Marti’s financial reports showed that the company had surpassed its 2025 targets, reaching over 2 million riders and over 300K drivers as of June this year. The milestone marked an 8.3% increase in registered drivers and a 12.7% rise in the number of riders since March. The company has successfully completed over 35 million rides. “We believe this strategy represents a prudent approach to treasury management, particularly in the current economic environment which carries both inflationary and hard currency risks.” – Oguz Oktem , Founder and CEO at Marti Technologies In the press release, the company promised to disclose any further developments regarding its crypto assets reserve strategy. It also mentioned that its new treasury strategy would be executed alongside its traditional holdings in cash, cash equivalents, and securities. The crypto allocations would also apply to surplus cash reserves, not funds needed for everyday running expenses. Marti dominates tech-enabled transportation services The ride-hailing company disclosed that it managed a fleet of EVs for hire, including e-mopeds, e-scooters, and e-bikes across the country’s major cities. It provides its tech-enabled transportation services through a mobility app. Marti went public in July 2023, becoming the first micro-mobility company based in Turkey to be listed in the United States. Following news of the crypto reserve adoption strategy, its shares surged 7% on July 29 . However, the price hike didn’t last as the stock prices quickly plummeted again by 6.7%. The company joined a growing list of public companies that added crypto assets to their balance sheets. It recently announced plans to expand its coverage across Turkish cities. The company currently covers Ankara, Istanbul, Antalya, and Izmir. It will soon broaden its reach to the cities of Konya, Kayseri, Kocaeli, Bursa, Mersin, and Adana. The expansion will also increase its customer base from 28.8 million to roughly 42.2 million, and increase the company’s team to 260, up from the current 180 employees. The company expects a revenue of $34 million in 2025, with an adjusted EBITDA projection from $3 million to -$17 million. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

It also contributed to Ethereum’s recent price outperformance. Major players like BitMine Immersion Technologies, Sharplink, and newcomer Ether Machine are leading the charge, collectively amassing over 1.4 million ETH. Standard Chartered predicts that corporate entities could eventually hold up to 10% of ETH’s total supply. Corporations Race to Buy Ethereum Corporations are increasingly turning their attention to Ethereum, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, as a preferred treasury asset. A new report by Standard Chartered revealed that Ethereum-focused treasury firms acquired 1% of ETH’s total supply since the beginning of June 2025. Over the same period, these firms doubled the pace of investment compared to their Bitcoin-focused counterparts. This contributed a lot to Ethereum’s outperformance against Bitcoin. ETH held by Ethereum treasury companies (Source: Standard Chartered) This growing appetite for ETH among institutional investors is being attributed to several key drivers. Standard Chartered mentioned that strong inflows into US spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), alongside robust corporate demand, fueled the recent gains in ETH’s price. Although Ethereum is still trading more than 21% below its all-time high of $4,890 that was reached in November 2021, the bank still has a bullish year-end price target of $4,000 and suggests that continued accumulation could drive prices even higher. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum offers additional yield-generating opportunities through staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). Standard Chartered pointed out that corporate ETH treasuries can capitalize on both, unlike Ethereum ETFs in the US, which are currently restricted from participating in staking. This gives Ethereum a unique edge as a treasury asset, and the bank predicts that these firms could eventually control up to 10% of the entire ETH supply. This is a tenfold increase from current holdings. BitMine Immersion Technologies is the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, as it now holds about 625,000 ETH—about 0.52% of the circulating supply. The company announced a $1 billion stock repurchase plan, and plans to increase its ETH holdings to 5% of the total supply. Close behind is Sharplink, a Nasdaq-listed firm that recently spent $290 million to acquire over 438,000 ETH in less than a week. A new player, the Ether Machine, also announced plans to build one of the largest on-chain ETH treasuries, targeting more than 400,000 ETH worth $1.5 billion and a future listing under the ticker “ETHM.” Collectively, these moves suggest that institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition is stronger than ever.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|REGULATION|TREASURY|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-30 05:30:00

While purely theoretical, the math reveals a staggering possibility—requiring a total circulating supply of 800 billion XRP , far exceeding the current capped limit of 100 billion. Such an impossible demand would likely trigger massive scarcity, driving XRP’s price into astronomical territory. Although such scenarios are exaggerated, they underscore the belief among long-term XRP holders that true global adoption could radically change its market value. The recent wave of excitement is also fueled by expectations surrounding a potential spot XRP ETF and ongoing expansion of Ripple’s global partnerships. With investors exploring early-stage altcoins for the next explosive move, many have taken notice of MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising presale project earning fas t global attention . XRP’s Fixed Supply and Price Implications XRP’s supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens, with a significant portion already in circulation and a notable amount held by Ripple Labs. If demand spiked drastically—say, to levels where billions of people wanted to hold XRP—the resulting supply squeeze could hypothetically catapult the token into four-digit territory. To put it in perspective, if demand somehow required 800 billion XRP (100 per person), and supply stayed fixed at 100 billion, simple supply-demand imbalance could, in theory, push price upwards by 8x or more , putting XRP around $25–$30 at minimum. Of course, this excludes other factors like sell pressure, regulatory interference, or market liquidity—but the model does emphasize XRP’s long-term upside if demand scales. Why Investors Are Flocking to This Altcoin Before It Hits the Exchanges While XRP continues to hold strong in institutional corridors, newer retail-focused investors are chasing early-stage coins with high upside. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. Often compared to the early rise of meme giants like PEPE and BONK, MAGACOIN is now one of the fastest-moving presale projects of the year. Its current round is filling faster than expected , and analysts suggest returns could even exceed 13,000% for early investors. With limited access before exchange listings and rising international interest, many investors believe this could be a once-in-a-cycle opportunity. Looking Ahead: XRP and the Path to Global Integration While the dream of 8 billion people holding 100 XRP each is unlikely, the narrative highlights a key truth—XRP is positioned as one of the few altcoins actively targeting global infrastructure. Its integration into cross-border payment systems and possible ETF approval makes it one of the few with real-world utility and long-term upside. Conclusion Speculation around universal XRP ownership may seem far-fetched, but it reinforces just how valuable scarcity and demand can be in crypto economics. And as investors look ahead to the next breakout, many are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale progress as the type of early entry that could define their portfolios in the years to come.

Meanwhile, Unilabs Finance (UNIL), an emerging AI-powered investment platform, has reached a peak with over $7.2 million raised in presale. While the broader market is experiencing a slow week, analysts expect it to pick up pace and spark a renewed bullish sentiment in top altcoins like SOL. However, unlike the Solana price, UNIL has remained unaffected by the broader market direction and continues to reach new highs, driven by growing investor confidence in its presale. Solana has experienced unprecedented growth over the past few years as a utility altcoin; however, emerging altcoins, particularly AI-backed projects like Unilabs Finance, are now expected to lead the market. Let’s compare the growth potential of the Solana price and UNIL in the next bull leg. Solana Price Prediction: Will SOL Reach a New High in 2025? On the Solana price chart, a bullish rounded-bottom breakout pattern has been formed over the past few months. SOL surged over 60% from the low of this pattern, reaching a high of $206.42 on July 22nd. As the broader market has slumped, it has now pulled back and is retesting the breakout level near $179.22. Over the last 24 hours, the Solana price has declined by 3% and is currently trading at $186.35. This week’s trading volume is also consistently lower than the 10-day moving average. While SOL appears bearish on the shorter timeframe, this is primarily due to the broader market’s impact. Despite this, it remains above the crucial $179 support level, signaling bullish strength. Image Courtesy: X (Formerly Twitter) Crypto analyst Mayne has posted a forecast, targeting $220 and then the ATH at $260 in the larger timeframe. This prediction appears viable if the market regains a bullish stance and the Solana price can break out from the $206 resistance level. Unilabs Finance (UNIL): Revolutionizing Asset Management With AI The Solana price may resume its uptrend, but in the meantime, experts suggest moving funds to the Unilabs Finance presale for a stable return regardless of market fluctuations. Unilabs is the world’s first DeFi asset manager operated entirely by AI, handling over $32 million in assets under management as of Q3 2025. The platform operates on AI-powered logic and utilizes cutting-edge investment tools, including the AI Market Pulse, which analyzes on-chain data, trading volume, and gauges community sentiment through social media and news to identify the best assets for investing users’ capital. Unilabs’ Early Access Scoring System evaluates and grades emerging crypto projects to create a list of the top-performing altcoins. The AI rebalances users’ portfolios using these reports to optimize profits and manage risks as per users’ preferences. Here’s why Unilabs is winning investor attention: Unilabs reduces the complexity of DeFi asset investment and provides users with a way to make profitable trades without actively monitoring the markets every second. It offers investors up to 122% annual percentage yields on staking the native token, UNIL. The platform features a Self-Custodial Asset Vault, where users can lock their capital with blockchain-grade encryption, eliminating the risk of losing funds in potential attacks. The UNIL presale offers investors a rare opportunity to get the token at a discounted price, currently $0.0074 in stage 5. New investors can get 50% extra tokens deposited in their wallet by using the “ATH50” code during purchase. Conclusion The Solana price has slowed down as it retests a crucial support level after a breakout, but Unilabs continues to reach new highs, outperforming SOL with increasing retail demand. It is the first platform to revolutionize investment with AI algorithms and shows exponential growth potential with the growing demand for AI solutions. Early UNIL holders can make generational wealth by investing in presale and holding until the token skyrockets after listing.

According to sources familiar with the situation, discussions over the portfolio handover between financial firms and the tech giant are still in progress. However, an agreement has yet to be reached. Insiders reported that banks like American Express, Synchrony, and Barclays are no longer in contention for the card deal, giving JPMorgan a major advantage. Goldman Sachs faced regulatory scrutiny over its management of the Apple Card Goldman Sachs has been seeking to exit its partnership with Apple for a while now. What began in 2019 as a high-profile foray into consumer banking with the Apple Card soon turned into a burden, marred by technical issues, regulatory scrutiny, and allegations of algorithmic bias. Although Goldman beat out top-tier rivals to secure the Apple Card deal, the rapid growth of the program and the need to set aside reserves for potential loan losses quickly put pressure on the bank’s balance sheet. Further complicating the partnership, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Goldman and Apple to pay more than $89 million in late 2024 after concluding they misled customers and mishandled dispute processes related to the Apple Card. According to the regulator, the two institutions gave customers false information on interest-free payment plans and had lapses in their customer service. At the time, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra commented, “Apple and Goldman Sachs illegally sidestepped their legal obligations for Apple Card borrowers. Big Tech and Wall Street firms should not behave as if they are exempt from federal law.” He described the rollout as chaotic, citing that essential systems for the Apple Card were not fully operational at launch. He also noted that Goldman moved forward with the release despite third-party warnings about technological flaws in its dispute resolution system. Thus, the bank was asked to pay $19.8 million in restitution and a $45 million fine, while Apple was fined $25 million. The US watchdog also barred Goldman from offering new credit cards unless it provides a product plan to meet regulatory requirements. Consequently, mounting internal dissatisfaction and recession fears ultimately pushed CEO David Solomon to reconsider the bank’s role and begin shedding the business. The bank, however, has had trouble backing out of the partnership largely because of its customers with lower credit scores. Under the original deal, Goldman was expected to support the card up to at least 2029. Aside from the Apple card venture, it is offloading its General Motors credit card business to Barclays. Not to mention the bank had about $20.5 billion in credit card loans by March’s end. JPMorgan is asking for certain changes to be made, sources say So far, JPMorgan is the largest credit card issuer by purchase volume in the US. Securing a deal with Apple for its credit card venture would only cement its position as the leading bank in American finance. For Apple, signing with JPMorgan would mark a more stable chapter, after years of expansion overshadowed by regulatory concerns about Goldman’s billing and refunds process. Nonetheless, JPMorgan insists on certain changes, such as revisions to the servicing structure of the Apple Card, among other conditions, before agreeing to any deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. There is speculation that the bank wants to remove the Apple Card feature, calendar-based billing, which currently spreads statement dates over the month. The proposed shift would align billing so all users receive statements at the start of the month. Some insiders also claimed the bank is pushing to pay below face value for the Apple Card loans due to the losses tied to the cards. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The new wave of whale capital has brought into focus top-performing layer-1s like Solana, whose high-throughput blockchain and institutional traction make it a clear contender in the ongoing bull cycle. Regulatory clarity and strong utility-focused adoption are creating ideal conditions for next-gen platforms to thrive. Which platforms will yield the next 50x in 2025? Let’s dive in. Solana Price Predictions: SOL’s Technical Trajectory Toward $300 Target SOL is trading around $182, having recently broken out from a multi-month resistance zone. Analysts cite a classic “cup and handle” formation, as ETF volume and open interest climb rapidly on centralized exchanges. Projections by CoinCodex peg 2026 targets between $194 and $306, while InvestingHaven estimates SOL could even touch $1,000. Bloomberg analysts place a 90% approval chance for upcoming Solana spot ETFs, with seven ETF pending. When finally approved, Solana price could mirror the bullish effects seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches. Solana’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) now exceeds $10.9 billion, led by Kamino and JitoSOL. If SOL holds above $190, short term targets range from $250 to $260, setting the stage for a run to $300. New ICO Market Dynamics and Institutional Positioning The ICO landscape in 2025 has matured, with institutional investors leading funding rounds and favoring top utility-driven projects .

As Bitcoin’s global adoption accelerates and countries race to stack crypto reserves, another trend is catching fire: meme coins. These humorous tokens have evolved beyond jokes, becoming vehicles for serious wealth generation, with some yielding eye-watering returns. But with hundreds launching every month, knowing which ones to watch could be the difference between catching lightning in a bottle or missing the next wave entirely. In 2025, attention is rapidly turning to a specific class of meme coins gaining extraordinary traction: MoonBull ($MOBU), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), Dogwifhat (WIF), Floki (FLOKI), Brett (BRETT), Popcat (POPCAT), and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT). Leading this charge is MoonBull, whose whitelist just opened to the public. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull ($MOBU) is shaking up the Ethereum meme coin scene with a highly anticipated whitelist launch that rewards its earliest backers. Unlike ordinary whitelists, this whitelist grants access to elite staking rewards, bonus token allocations, and early-stage token pricing – all strictly limited and available only to the first wave of registrants. This is a limited opportunity, and once the whitelist fills, it’s gone for good. Early access to Moon Bull offers a rare gateway into an ecosystem designed for exponential growth. Whitelist members are promised first-in-line entry before the public, private roadmap hints, and the lowest possible token price. MoonBull blends the cultural firepower of memes with the backbone of Ethereum-based smart contracts, ensuring both hype and safety. Built for degen traders and meme lovers alike, MoonBull prioritizes virality without compromising on utility. As a meme token with deep staking mechanics and hidden benefits only accessible through the whitelist, it positions itself as the frontrunner among the top 10 meme coins in 2025. MoonBull isn’t just another project; it’s a movement – and the clock is ticking. No Time to Track Crypto? Get Early MoonBull Access via Email For busy professionals and students juggling deadlines, meetings, and classes, keeping up with the ever-shifting crypto market can feel impossible. That’s where MoonBull’s whitelist becomes a game-changer. Human psychology is wired to chase early access – especially when scarcity is involved. The limited whitelist taps into this instinct by offering priority access, locked-in prices, and bonus rewards before the masses flood in. It’s a pressure-free opportunity designed for people who don’t have time to constantly refresh charts or scroll through Telegram threads. All it takes is a quick email submission – no apps, no complex forms. Once you’re in, you’re on the list. That one step secures your early spot and unlocks private staking perks, confidential roadmap updates, and guaranteed alerts before the public launch. For students and corporate professionals who can’t afford to monitor crypto news 24/7, the whitelist delivers a serious edge – making early access as simple as checking your inbox. In a market driven by speed and sentiment, MoonBull’s whitelist turns limited time into a strategic advantage. 2. Dogecoin ($DOGE) Dogecoin remains a titan in the meme coin world. Launched as a joke in 2013, DOGE exploded into mainstream awareness during the 2020–2021 bull run. Its community-first ethos, low transaction fees, and unlimited supply are part of what fuels its popularity. From being used in NASCAR sponsorships to tweets from Elon Musk, Dogecoin’s journey is a masterclass in how viral marketing can lead to a serious market cap. DOGE also benefits from real-world usability. Major retailers and service providers have embraced DOGE as payment, bridging the gap between meme culture and commerce. While it lacks scarcity, its ever-growing community compensates with sheer volume and engagement. Dogecoin earns its spot on the list of top 10 meme coins in 2025 due to its staying power, strong branding, and deep cultural resonance. 3. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Shiba Inu took the meme world by storm in 2021, often called the “Dogecoin Killer.” With its massive supply and a DeFi ecosystem that includes ShibaSwap, SHIB has evolved far beyond its meme roots. It introduced utility through its Layer 2 solution, Shibarium, which further reduced gas fees and increased transaction speed. SHIB’s marketing success lies in its ability to mobilize a decentralized army of holders. Its community-backed growth, developer transparency, and growing utility give it an edge in 2025. SHIB also engages users with gamified staking and NFT features, attracting not just traders but creators and gamers alike. For its comprehensive ecosystem and consistent updates, SHIB continues to be among the top 10 meme coins in 2025. 4. Pepe ($PEPE) PEPE emerged as a controversial yet high-performing meme coin built around the infamous frog meme. What started as a tongue-in-cheek token turned into a viral phenomenon, delivering substantial gains to early holders. Despite lacking utility, PEPE made waves purely through cultural currency. While critics questioned its long-term value, PEPE maintained momentum through organic growth, clever timing, and rapid CEX listings. It reflects the high-risk, high-reward nature of meme investing. Its volatility and headline-grabbing performance make it a fixture in this year’s meme coin ecosystem. Its ability to break into mainstream awareness without foundational utility places PEPE firmly within the top 10 meme coins in 2025. 5. Bonk ($BONK) Built on the Solana blockchain, BONK is the first meme coin to gain serious traction in that ecosystem. BONK’s focus on redistributing wealth to active Solana users created a community-driven movement that accelerated Solana’s recovery post-FTX. What sets BONK apart is its utility within the Solana NFT and DeFi community. With transaction fees at a minimum and lightning-fast processing, it integrates smoothly with Web3 applications. BONK’s utility extends into tipping, staking, and NFT minting, giving it use cases beyond speculation. BONK makes the list of top 10 meme coins in 2025 due to its unique position as Solana’s flagship meme token and its utility within that chain’s ecosystem. 6. Dogwofhat ($WIF) WIF broke out with viral appeal and an aesthetic that resonated deeply with Gen Z investors. Based on an image of a Shiba Inu wearing a wool hat, WIF struck a balance between absurd humor and solid tokenomics. It gained traction through community contests, Twitter campaigns, and generous airdrops. WIF’s charm lies in its simplicity, but its roadmap includes NFT collaborations and a loyalty staking pool designed to reward long-term holders. WIF makes its mark among the top 10 meme coins in 2025 for its unique brand identity, creative marketing, and expanding roadmap. 7. Floki ($FLOKI) Named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, FLOKI gained visibility through aggressive advertising campaigns in major cities and sports arenas. The project blends meme appeal with real-world products, including a metaverse game called Valhalla and a DeFi ecosystem. FLOKI’s marketing team also forged global partnerships, expanding brand awareness across continents. Its roadmap focuses on education, gaming, and utility – building tangible applications to support the token’s meme status. FLOKI earns its place on the list of top 10 meme coins in 2025 for integrating utility, brand strength, and cross-platform influence. 8. Brett ($BRETT) BRETT is inspired by a character from the “Boy’s Club” comic series and has risen as a niche favorite among meme coin purists. With art-forward branding and edgy humor, BRETT leverages cult appeal. This Ethereum-based token relies on community-driven development and exclusive NFT drops. The developers have hinted at an upcoming DeFi integration and NFT marketplace – keeping the holders intrigued. BRETT makes this year’s list for its community commitment and potential to spark a trend in art-based meme coins. 9. Popcat ($POPCAT) POPCAT captures the spirit of absurdist internet culture with its origins in a popular meme involving a cat’s face popping open in excitement. The token quickly attracted attention with its viral branding and intense trading volumes. Built for fun but not without purpose, POPCAT is now exploring NFT integrations and gamified staking. Its roadmap includes community-voted developments and a browser-based minigame platform. POPCAT is featured in the top 10 meme coins in 2025 for its brand potential and ability to create sustained engagement through light-hearted but strategic innovation. 10. Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) PNUT is the newest entrant with a narrative-driven launch. The token is themed around a squirrel hoarding peanuts, symbolizing crypto investors stacking gains. This fresh branding angle, combined with clever marketing, has piqued community interest. The roadmap includes animated shorts, NFT comics, and DeFi-styled rewards linked to staking PNUT tokens. Early adopters are incentivized with exclusive in-game items and private staking pools. PNUT joins the top 10 meme coins in 2025 for its originality, storytelling, and engaging mechanics for early adopters. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the top 10 meme coins in 2025 are MoonBull ($MOBU), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), Dogwifhat (WIF), Floki (FLOKI), Brett (BRETT), Popcat (POPCAT), and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT).

On-chain analysis suggests that the platform spent 100% of its daily revenue on PUMP token buybacks for just one day. However, there are serious doubts that this approach is unsustainable. Related News: BREAKING: Historic Moment - SEC Approves In-Kind Redemptions for Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs Market rumors suggest that PumpFun plans to increase its buyback rate and use all of its daily revenue to support the PUMP token. However, decentralized community Dumpster DAO has cautioned against these claims. The DAO urged the community to carefully monitor on-chain data, noting that the platform had only fully implemented this strategy for one day previously. It's also noted that not all of the funds allocated that day have yet been redeemed. This has raised some suspicions that the platform is attempting to mislead on-chain observers. The redeemed tokens were not burned or transferred to another address, making it unclear whether these transactions were truly completed. *This is not investment advice.

The offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $2.52 billion, making it the largest US IPO of 2025. After underwriting discounts, commissions, and estimated expenses, Strategy expects net proceeds of around $2.47 billion. The company used the funds to acquire 21,021 BTC at an average purchase price of approximately $117,256 per bitcoin. As of July 29, Strategy holds 628,791 BTC. The new financial product is expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq on or around July 30 under the ticker symbol “STRC.” Once listed, STRC will be the first perpetual preferred security issued by a Bitcoin Treasury Company to trade on a US exchange, and the first to incorporate a board-determined monthly dividend rate policy. It will also be the first short-duration, income-oriented instrument within Strategy’s lineup of preferred offerings. The company said the deal also represents the largest exchange-listed perpetual preferred stock issuance in the US since 2009. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Moelis & Company, and TD Securities acted as joint book-running managers for the offering, while The Benchmark Company, Clear Street, AmeriVet Securities, Bancroft Capital, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, and Maxim Group LLC served as co-managers. Interestingly, Strategy’s IPO more than doubled the $1.1 billion raised by Circle in its June debut.

US-China trade talks ended without a deal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that any deal will require Trump’s personal approval before moving forward. Market participants also remained wary of the approaching U.S. tariff deadline on August 1. Gold hovered around $3,320 per ounce on Wednesday, staying near a three-week low. The Monetary Authority of Singapore kept its policy stance unchanged on Wednesday, maintaining the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) band after easing in its last two meetings. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.11% were little changed on Wednesday, with both the Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes trading flat. The Japanese yen appreciated toward 148 per dollar on Wednesday, recouping some losses from earlier in the week. On the domestic front, market participants looked ahead to the Bank of Japan’s policy decision. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.37% to above 3,620 while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.3% to 11,250 on Wednesday, with mainland stocks showing mixed performances as the US-China talks in Stockholm ended Tuesday without an extension of the current truce, and the offshore yuan steadied around 7.17 per dollar on Wednesday. During the talks, both sides agreed to pursue an extension of the 90-day tariff truce, set to expire on August 12, in an effort to ease tensions in the ongoing trade war between the world’s two largest economies. White House National Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett said the Trump administration allowed Nvidia’s H20 AI chip shipments to China in a strategic move to maintain the U.S. lead in advanced chip development. In China, investors are turning their attention to upcoming PMI data, due tomorrow, for insights into the country’s economic outlook amid mounting domestic challenges and global trade uncertainty. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.78% to 25,469 on Wednesday morning, after U.S.-China trade talks ended without a meaningful breakthrough. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.02% hovering around 81,361 after gains in the prior session, amid lingering uncertainty over US-India trade talks ahead of a looming tariff deadline. Traders continued to monitor developments after President Trump said that India could face tariffs of 20–25%, slightly below the 26% rate announced in April. On a positive note, the IMF upgraded India’s GDP forecast to 6.4% for both FY2026 and FY2027. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.63% to around 8,700 on Wednesday, halting its two-session winning streak. The Australian dollar edged higher to above $0.651 on Wednesday, ending its four-session losing streak, as a weaker US dollar outweighed soft domestic inflation figures. Australia's consumer prices rose at the slowest pace in over four years in Q2, with headline CPI at 0.7% Q/Q and 2.1% Y/Y, and core inflation easing to a three-year low of 2.7% Y/Y —both below forecasts and within the RBA’s 2–3% target range. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended in red as mixed corporate earnings and caution ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision weighed on sentiment. U.S. stock futures were flat on Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s latest policy announcement: Dow +0.15% ; S&P 500 +0.19% ; Nasdaq +0.24% .

But with increasing institutional adoption, a potential spot ETF, and Ripple’s ongoing expansion into global banking infrastructure, it’s a scenario that some crypto strategists aren’t ruling out. To match Bitcoin’s market cap, XRP would need to reach roughly $220 per coin, assuming its circulating supply remains constant at around 54 billion tokens. That represents a near 7,000% gain—a figure that has started turning heads, especially among those looking beyond short-term volatility. This kind of explosive ROI potential is part of the reason newer opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE are seeing surging demand. Its presale rounds are drawing in early movers who believe they’re spotting the next big breakout before the rest of the market catches up. Of course, the difference between XRP and Bitcoin extends beyond just numbers. Bitcoin is widely regarded as a digital store of value, while XRP’s purpose is transactional—targeting real-world cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. If Ripple’s banking partnerships continue to grow, the perceived value of XRP could shift dramatically, especially in a future where blockchain infrastructure underpins traditional finance. The team behind MAGACOIN FINANCE understands this shift in investor behavior. With ROI projections outpacing even DOGE and PEPE during their prime , it’s quickly becoming the altcoin to watch. Early backers are looking at projections where $2,700 could become $120,000 , fueled by limited access, high demand, and continuous ecosystem growth. Each presale round is filling faster, creating a sense of urgency as retail access narrows. Even if XRP doesn’t reach Bitcoin-level dominance, the road to just 10% of Bitcoin’s current market cap would still bring XRP up to approximately $22—a level that shatters its all-time high and still delivers over 6x returns for investors today. Conclusion: Flipping Bitcoin may not be realistic for XRP in the short term, but it serves as a bold benchmark for what’s possible in a rapidly evolving market. As investors chase real utility over hype , tokens like XRP—and high-potential newcomers such as MAGACOIN FINANCE—are gaining serious traction.

They foresee a major surge ahead, driven by recent US legislative developments such as the signing of the GENIUS Act. They assert that these developments bolster the role of stablecoins as key players in the future of digital payments. New Regulatory Landscape For Stablecoins Central to BlackRock’s analysis is the recently enacted GENIUS Act, legislation that aims to establish a comprehensive framework for stablecoins as a means of payment. Stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies such as the US dollar, are gaining significant traction among traditional finance firms seeking to modernize their transactions, and could solidify the dollar’s dominance in global markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Drops Among US Investors—Is a Price Correction Coming? Though their current market share is about 7%—equating to approximately $250 billion—the rapid adoption of stablecoins since 2020 indicates a growing acceptance within the financial landscape. The GENIUS Act delineates stablecoins as payment methods rather than investment products, which includes provisions to prohibit interest payments and restrict issuance to federally regulated banks and select nonbanks. This regulatory framework is poised to create a tokenized ecosystem centered around the US dollar, facilitating easier access for users in emerging markets while potentially limiting adoption in major economies due to the ban on interest payments. Additionally, the act specifies the types of assets that stablecoin issuers can hold in reserve, predominantly consisting of repurchase agreements, money market funds, and US Treasury bills with short maturities. Notably, major stablecoin issuers like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) currently hold over $120 billion in Treasury bills, yet this represents only a small fraction of the total outstanding US Treasury bills. BlackRock Optimistic About Bitcoin’s Potential BlackRock’s commentary also suggests that while the demand for Treasury bills may increase as the stablecoin market grows, the overall impact on yields could be limited. This is due to a likely offsetting shift of funds from similar assets rather than generating significant new demand. Furthermore, the US Treasury’s inclination to increase short-term debt issuance to address persistent budget deficits may also dampen any upward pressure on yields. Beyond US borders, other regions are also taking steps to regulate stablecoins. Hong Kong is implementing new regulations aimed at fostering innovation in stablecoins, while Europe is exploring the concept of a digital euro, albeit with limitations to protect traditional banks. Related Reading: XRP Dormant Coins On The Move: Reason Behind Price Plunge? Should other nations allow interest-bearing stablecoins or pursue central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the US dollar’s role in trade finance could be at risk, the experts assert, potentially prompting the US to reconsider its stance on interest payments. As digital assets continue to gain mainstream acceptance, the combination of regulatory support and US administration backing suggests a future where Bitcoin and stablecoins play a more integral role in financial systems. BlackRock remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential as a distinct return driver and a key asset in diversified investment portfolios.

Beyond the headlines and fleeting price charts, there’s a powerful indicator whispering secrets about market sentiment: the Bitcoin long-short ratio . This crucial metric offers a real-time snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves, providing invaluable insights into potential future price movements. Today, we’re diving deep into the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures across major exchanges, giving you a clear, data-driven picture of where the smart money is leaning. Understanding these ratios can be the difference between reacting to the market and anticipating its next move. What is the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio and Why Does it Matter for BTC Perpetual Futures? In the fast-paced realm of crypto trading, the ability to gauge collective sentiment is paramount. The Bitcoin long-short ratio is essentially a comparison of the number of long positions (bets that the price will go up) versus short positions (bets that the price will go down) on a particular asset, in this case, BTC perpetual futures. But what exactly are these terms? Long Positions: When a trader goes “long,” they are buying an asset with the expectation that its price will increase. It’s a bullish bet. Short Positions: Conversely, going “short” involves selling an asset (often borrowed) with the expectation that its price will decrease, aiming to buy it back at a lower price. This is a bearish bet. BTC Perpetual Futures: These are specialized futures contracts that, unlike traditional futures, do not have an expiration date. They track the price of Bitcoin and are popular among traders for their leverage options and continuous trading opportunities. The funding rate mechanism keeps their price anchored to the spot price. The ratio itself tells us which side of the market is currently dominant. If the long percentage is significantly higher, it suggests a bullish bias among traders. If the short percentage is higher, it indicates a bearish sentiment. For BTC perpetual futures , this ratio is particularly potent because these markets often represent a significant portion of the total trading volume and are frequently used by professional traders and institutions, making their positioning highly influential. Monitoring this ratio helps traders understand the prevailing mood, identify potential reversals, and even spot areas of extreme sentiment that could signal an impending shift in market dynamics. It’s not a crystal ball, but it’s a powerful lens through which to view the collective conviction of the market participants. Decoding the Latest 24-Hour Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Data Let’s get straight to the numbers. The recent 24-hour data for the Bitcoin long-short ratio paints an intriguing picture of current market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the aggregated data and specific insights from top exchanges: Category Long Percentage Short Percentage Total Market 48.63% 51.37% Binance 47.02% 52.98% Bybit 49.07% 50.93% Gate.io 52.25% 47.75% Looking at the Total Market , we observe a slight lean towards short positions (51.37% short vs. 48.63% long). This indicates that, on aggregate, more traders are currently betting on a potential downside for Bitcoin. A ratio below 1 (or short percentage above 50%) generally signals a more bearish sentiment, suggesting caution among a significant portion of the trading community. However, this aggregate view doesn’t tell the whole story. The nuances emerge when we examine individual exchanges, as each platform caters to a unique demographic of traders and often reflects distinct pockets of sentiment. Understanding these variations is key to a holistic market perspective. How Do Exchanges Differ in Their Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio? While the overall Bitcoin long-short ratio provides a general pulse, a deeper dive into individual exchanges reveals fascinating and often divergent sentiment. Why do these differences exist, and what can they tell us? Binance: A Bearish Tilt? Binance, as one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally by trading volume, often serves as a significant indicator for broader market trends. Its 24-hour long-short ratio shows 47.02% long and 52.98% short. This suggests a more pronounced bearish sentiment among Binance traders compared to the overall market average. Given Binance’s diverse user base, this could reflect a cautious stance among a large segment of retail and institutional traders anticipating a potential price correction or consolidation for Bitcoin. Bybit: Nearing Neutrality? Bybit, known for its strong focus on derivatives trading, presents a more balanced picture with 49.07% long and 50.93% short. This ratio is very close to 50/50, indicating a relatively neutral or indecisive sentiment among its traders. It suggests that while there’s a slight bearish edge, there isn’t a strong conviction towards either direction, perhaps implying a period of consolidation or anticipation of a major catalyst. Gate.io: A Bullish Outlier? In stark contrast to Binance and the overall market, Gate.io stands out with a clear bullish majority: 52.25% long versus 47.75% short. This makes Gate.io an outlier, showing that a significant portion of its user base is optimistic about Bitcoin’s immediate future. This could be due to specific regional trading patterns, a different user demographic, or perhaps even a higher concentration of long-term holders using futures for hedging or accumulating positions. These disparities highlight the importance of not just looking at aggregated data but also considering the unique characteristics and trader psychology prevalent on different platforms. A strong bullish bias on one exchange while others lean bearish could signal localized strength or weakness that might eventually spread to the broader market, or simply represent distinct trading strategies. Actionable Insights: Leveraging the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio for Your Trading Strategy Understanding the Bitcoin long-short ratio isn’t just about curiosity; it’s about gaining a potential edge in your trading decisions. While no single indicator guarantees success, integrating this data can significantly enhance your market analysis. Here’s how you can potentially leverage these insights: Confirming Trends: If Bitcoin is in an uptrend and the long-short ratio consistently shows a strong bullish bias (more longs), it can confirm the strength of the trend. Conversely, a prevailing bearish ratio during a downtrend can validate its continuation. Identifying Potential Reversals (Contrarian Indicator): Sometimes, extreme sentiment can be a contrarian signal. If the long-short ratio reaches exceptionally high long percentages, it might indicate an “overly bullish” market ripe for a correction as too many participants are on one side. Similarly, an extremely high short percentage could suggest a “capitulation” point, where a short squeeze or reversal becomes more likely. For instance, if the total market short percentage were to jump significantly higher than 51.37%, it might signal an imminent rebound. Spotting Divergences: Pay attention if the price action and the long-short ratio start moving in opposite directions. For example, if Bitcoin’s price is rising but the long-short ratio shows an increasing number of shorts, it could indicate underlying weakness or smart money taking bearish positions while retail chases the rally. Combining with Other Indicators: The Bitcoin long-short ratio is most powerful when used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools. Pair it with: Open Interest: High open interest combined with a strong long bias suggests conviction behind the bullish positions. Funding Rates: High positive funding rates often align with high long ratios, indicating longs are paying shorts to keep their positions open. Extremely high funding rates can signal an overheated market. Volume Analysis: Look for confirmation of sentiment through trading volume. Support and Resistance Levels: Use the ratio to assess sentiment at key price levels. Risk Management: Use the ratio to inform your risk assessment. If the market is heavily skewed to one side, consider adjusting your position size or setting tighter stop-losses to protect against potential sharp reversals. Remember, the market is dynamic. While the current 51.37% short dominance for total BTC perpetual futures suggests caution, this can change rapidly. Continuous monitoring and adaptation are crucial for effective trading. Challenges and Limitations to Consider While the Bitcoin long-short ratio is a valuable tool, it’s essential to be aware of its limitations: Not a Standalone Indicator: It should never be the sole basis for your trading decisions. Always combine it with other forms of analysis. Manipulation Potential: Large players can sometimes open positions to intentionally skew the ratio, creating false signals to trap retail traders. Lagging or Coincident Indicator: The ratio reflects current positioning, not necessarily future price action. It can be a coincident indicator, moving with the price, or a lagging one, confirming a trend that has already begun. Data Granularity: The provided data is for “perpetual futures.” Different types of derivatives (e.g., options, fixed-term futures) might show different sentiment. Conclusion: Navigating the Market with Data-Driven Confidence The Bitcoin long-short ratio is a vital tool for any serious crypto trader, offering a unique window into the collective psychology of the market. Our 24-hour snapshot reveals a slight bearish tilt in overall BTC perpetual futures sentiment, particularly on exchanges like Binance, while others like Gate.io maintain a bullish outlook. By understanding these nuances and integrating this data into a broader analytical framework, you can gain a significant advantage in deciphering market trends and making more informed trading decisions. Remember, knowledge is power in the volatile world of crypto. Stay informed, stay strategic, and let data guide your path to navigating the exciting yet challenging landscape of Bitcoin trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a BTC perpetual future? A1: A BTC perpetual future is a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, they can be held indefinitely, with their price kept close to the spot market through a mechanism called “funding rates.” Q2: How is the Bitcoin long-short ratio calculated? A2: The Bitcoin long-short ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions on an exchange or across multiple exchanges. Alternatively, it can be expressed as percentages of total open interest, showing the proportion of long and short positions. Q3: Does a high short ratio always mean Bitcoin’s price will drop? A3: Not necessarily. While a high short ratio indicates more traders are betting on a price decrease, it can sometimes act as a contrarian indicator. If the market becomes excessively short, it can lead to a “short squeeze” where prices rise rapidly as short sellers are forced to buy back to cover their positions, pushing the price even higher. Q4: Why do long-short ratios differ across exchanges? A4: Differences in long-short ratios across exchanges can stem from various factors, including the unique demographics of their user base, regional trading preferences, varying liquidity, or even specific market events or news that disproportionately affect traders on one platform over another. Q5: Can the long-short ratio be manipulated? A5: While the core data reflects real positions, large traders or “whales” can potentially open significant positions to intentionally skew the ratio, attempting to create a false sense of market sentiment. This is why it’s crucial to use the ratio in conjunction with other indicators and be aware of overall market context.

Court documents filed Tuesday in the Southern District of New York show that CEO Keonne Rodriguez and chief technology officer William Lonergan Hill will change their pleas during a Wednesday morning hearing before Judge Denise Cote. The pair had earlier pleaded not guilty in April 2024 to charges of running an unlicensed money-transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Indictment Links Wallet’s Mixing Tools to Silk Road and Other Crimes Prosecutors alleged Samourai processed more than $2b in unlawful transactions, including payments tied to the defunct Silk Road marketplace. The Department of Justice claimed the wallet’s popular mixing services, Whirlpool and Ricochet, were actively marketed to criminals. According to the indictment, private messages revealed Hill describing a focus on the “black/grey circular economy.” Bitcoin and other coin mixers blend transactions from multiple users, making them harder to trace on public blockchains. Privacy advocates see them as vital tools for financial anonymity, but US authorities view them as magnets for illicit activity. In 2022, the Treasury Department barred Americans from using the Ethereum-based mixer Tornado Cash, citing links to criminal groups. Privacy Advocates Fear Precedent From High-Profile Mixer Prosecutions The Samourai case mirrors actions against other privacy tools such as Tornado Cash and Bitcoin Fog. Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm is awaiting a verdict this week, while Bitcoin Fog’s founder was convicted last year. Critics argue these prosecutions threaten the open-source developers behind non-custodial software, even when there is no direct evidence of criminal intent. This sets a terrible terrible precedent for the future safety of open source developers. Samourai Wallet built our XMR BTC swap protocol into their wallet. This is not what their trial was about but still… The Monero community should care about this. It's even more… https://t.co/qIAsFHP94W — eigenwallet (@eigenwallet) July 29, 2025 Rodriguez and Hill were arrested in 2024, shortly before federal agents shut down Samourai Wallet. Prosecutors claimed the founders earned $4.5m in fees from the mixing services while enabling money laundering from phishing schemes and other crimes. The charges carry a maximum combined prison sentence of 25 years. Defense Tried to Dismiss Case Citing DOJ Memo on Crypto Mixers In April 2025, both sides asked for a delay in proceedings . This was because Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche had issued a memo, which suggested prosecutors should avoid charging crypto mixer operators for “unwitting violations.” The defense also argued Samourai’s non-custodial design aligned with 2019 guidance from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which exempts anonymizing software providers from money transmitter rules. The court scheduled arguments on the dismissal motion for July 22. However, that effort did not succeed. Additionally, claims that prosecutors had suppressed exculpatory advice also failed. As a result, a trial date had been set for Nov. 3. Judge Cote has not yet detailed how the plea change could affect sentencing. Conspiracy to commit money laundering carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, while operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business can add five more.

According to the on-chain data, a whale received 12,000 ETH, worth around $45.47 million, from Galaxy Digital in the last 2 hours. On-chain data also showed the wallet now holds 112,972 ETH, worth roughly $426.7 million. In the last 7 days, the wallet address has also accumulated more than 100 ETH, worth over $370 million. Recent data also highlighted an increase in Bitcoin accumulation by whales, with a historically low sell-side risk ratio of 0.24 indicating reduced large-scale selling pressure. The asset’s trend accumulation score has also approached 1.0 over the past two weeks, suggesting strong BTC institutional and whale buying interest. Anchorage Digital acquires 10,141 BTC, worth around $1.19 billion Anchorage Digital has accumulated 10,141 $BTC ($1.19B) from multiple wallets over the past 9 hours. https://t.co/zdNKM8YyQk pic.twitter.com/KCibu3t62l — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 30, 2025 Arkham Intelligence also revealed that Anchorage Digital has accumulated 10,141 BTC, worth around $1.19 billion, from multiple wallets over the past 9 hours. Since July 9, a total of 9 fresh wallets have accumulated 640,646 ETH, worth around $2.43 billion. Three wallets added another 74,207 ETH ($$273 million) on Thursday, showing strong confidence among large investors. Ethereum has continued to rise and reached an all-time high of $3,940.66 on Monday, a 52.20% increase in the last 30 days. At the time of publication, the digital asset is currently exchanging hands around 3,817, a 1.81% jump in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin also hit an all-time high of $123,091 on July 14, but has since slightly pulled back to around $118,000 at the time of publication. The Strategic ETH Reserve revealed that accumulation of Ether by whales and institutions has surged from 1.2 million to 2.3 million in four weeks. According to analyst Ali Martinez, whales have also purchased more than 1.13 million ETH ($4.18 billion) over the past two weeks. ETH treasury firms add to their Ethereum holdings 🚀 Ethereum Corporate Treasury Wave • Treasury firms bought 1.26 M ETH, 1 % of supply, since June, nearly matching the 2 M ETH acquired by ETFs in the same span • @StanChart Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick forecasts a 10× leap taking treasuries to 10 % of all ETH •… pic.twitter.com/HUjeoxvSiG — Gauss Research | Crypto Insights (@GaussResearch) July 29, 2025 Standard Chartered Bank reported Tuesday that corporate treasury companies have added to their Ethereum holdings and bought roughly 1.26 million ETH, around 1% of all ETH in circulation, in just two months. Standard Chartered’s global head of digital asset research, Geoffrey Kendrick, argued that ETH treasury companies are just starting and could likely buy ten times more. He also believes that such companies could hold 10% of all ETH in circulation. At the moment, Bitcoin treasury firms hold about 4.4% of the total BTC supply, with Strategy holding nearly 3%. BitMine (BNMR) is the largest ETH treasury company so far, holding roughly 625,000 ETH worth over $2.3 billion. Tom Lee’s investment firm also revealed plans to control over 5% of the total Ethereum supply. SharpLink Gaming (SBET) also had rounds of ETH purchases, making it the second-largest ETH holder with over 438,000 ETH, according to on-chain analytics. SBET’s latest buy of roughly 77,210 ETH also represents more than all the Ether issued in June. “Beyond BNMR and other existing holders, several new entrants are likely over time. In the Bitcoin treasury space, it took several years for MSTR to spawn significant buying imitators.” -Geoffrey Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered. Kendrick also believes that if BNMR attains its 5% goal, the rest of the ETH treasury companies could eventually hold more than 10% of the asset’s circulating supply. ETH has recently outperformed BTC, as seen from the ETH/BTC ratio, which has jumped from 0.032 in April to 0.018. Kendrick argued that it mirrors strong buying from treasury firms and increased inflows into ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The bank’s crypto researcher also believes that if the flows continue, ETH could break above the key $4,000 level, Standard Chartered’s current end-2025 forecast. Kendrick stated that Ethereum treasuries have more bullish potential than Bitcoin-focused ones. He argued that ETH treasuries can earn staking rewards (around 3%) and access to decentralized finance leverage, giving them a better advantage.

Solana is gaining traction among institutional players, XRP is back in the headlines after renewed scrutiny over its early ledger history, and high-risk, high-reward plays like PENGU are fueling speculation with massive token movements. While many are chasing the next short-term rally, some investors are already rotating into lesser-known presale tokens, eyeing long-term potential. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting serious attention – especially as its ongoing presale stages fill up at lightning speed. XRP Ledger’s Data Loss Sparks Debate XRP has taken center stage this week after a resurfaced controversy surrounding the permanent loss of nearly 32,000 early blocks in its ledger. Ripple CTO David Schwartz addressed concerns from the community, clarifying that the missing data was due to a technical mishap during XRP Ledger’s initial test phases—not a deliberate deletion. According to Schwartz, the team opted not to reset the ledger entirely to avoid greater harm, instead allowing the chain to continue from block 32,570. This issue, although known since May, has reignited wider discussions around transparency and data integrity in blockchain ecosystems. XRP’s reputation as a stable and reliable infrastructure makes this early-data loss particularly significant for long-time supporters. Solana’s Institutional Momentum Meanwhile, Solana continues its impressive climb among institutional players. ARK Invest has joined forces with SOL Strategies, a Canadian firm known for managing over 3.5 million SOL in staking delegations. This partnership will migrate ARK’s validator operations and offer their clients access to structured, yield-bearing investments through Solana’s staking ecosystem. Solana’s appeal lies in its speed and yield efficiency, with over 400 million SOL—worth more than $73 billion—currently staked. The network is well-positioned to capitalize on institutional demand for staking products that offer both returns and compliance—especially as more Ether-based ETF issuers push for yield-generating offerings. Magacoin Finance: The Presale Opportunity Everyone’s Talking About With each new round selling out faster than the last, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now drawing comparisons to early-stage breakouts . Investors are scrambling to get in early, lured by forecasts showing that even a small stake $2,500 could explode into $50,000 if projections play out. With limited access before a major exchange listing, the project is building momentum among those aiming to secure high-ROI positions PENGU Token Movements Raise Questions PENGU, the meme coin making noise this summer, saw over 206.9 million tokens worth $8.91 million transferred to exchanges in a single day—adding to a total of more than 2 billion tokens moved since late June. These movements have raised eyebrows, as mass transfers from a project’s deployment address often signal incoming sell pressure. Still, others argue the activity could relate to liquidity provisioning or upcoming listings. With PENGU still relatively young, the true intent behind these transfers remains unclear, but investors are watching closely. Conclusion XRP’s early history may have a few missing chapters, but its relevance in global finance is stronger than ever. Solana continues to impress institutions, while PENGU stirs speculation with its on-chain activity. But the project everyone’s quietly racing toward is MAGACOIN FINANCE—with its presale rounds selling out rapidly and upside projections fueling the hype , it’s emerging as a must-watch altcoin for those looking ahead.

Key Takeaways: MARA beat Q2 estimates with $238M in revenue and $808M in net income. Its BTC holdings hit 50,000+, worth $5.87B, making MARA the second-largest public Bitcoin holder. The company is expanding into AI infrastructure via partnerships. Net income soared to $808 million, reversing a loss of nearly $200 million in the same quarter last year, the company announced in a Tuesday press release . The jump was driven largely by a $1.2 billion unrealized gain from Bitcoin appreciation, as the asset surged 31% during the three months ending June 30. MARA Shares Jump 7.5% After Earnings Beat, Up 58% Since April MARA shares jumped as much as 7.5% in after-hours trading to $17.82 before settling at $17.22. The stock had closed Tuesday’s session down 3.2% at $16.61, but is still up 58% since April. The company’s Bitcoin production increased modestly to 2,358 BTC in Q2, compared to 2,286 BTC in the previous quarter. Its energized hashrate rose 6% to 57.4 EH/s. MARA’s Bitcoin holdings reached 49,951 BTC by the end of June, a 170% increase year-over-year, valued at $5.3 billion. The firm claims it now ranks second among public companies in Bitcoin holdings, trailing only MicroStrategy’s 607,770 BTC. Post-quarter, MARA disclosed that its BTC reserves surpassed 50,000, further strengthening its treasury position. As of the latest update, its holdings are valued at approximately $5.87 billion. In a strategic shift, MARA is now expanding its focus beyond mining. The firm announced partnerships with Google-backed TAE Power Solutions and LG-backed PADO AI to co-develop energy-efficient platforms tailored for AI and next-gen data centers.

Iran Cracks Down on Crypto Mining Amid Soaring Power Shortages As reported, Iranian authorities have sounded the alarm over crypto mining’s impact on the country’s power grid , claiming it now contributes up to 20% of the national electricity shortfall. With demand peaking during the summer heat, mining operations, many illegal, are consuming nearly 2,000 MW of electricity, equivalent to two nuclear reactors. Officials have stepped up enforcement, seizing over 250,000 unauthorized mining devices across several provinces. A recent internet outage revealed the scale of the problem, temporarily cutting 2,400 MW of consumption as 900,000 devices went offline. To combat the crisis, the government is offering cash rewards for tips on illegal mining farms hidden in homes and factories. Meanwhile, over half of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations still trace their origins to China , with 55% to 65% of mining linked to Chinese capital, hardware, or expertise, according to Uminers CEO Batyr Hydyrov. Despite China’s 2021 mining ban, key Chinese players have maintained influence by relocating operations overseas.

In a new Goldman Sachs podcast, Shah says that despite a risk asset rally in the US and strong fundamentals supporting the uptrend, the “technicals” do not show an optimistic outlook going forward. “The risk asset rally, particularly in the US, has been fierce. That recovery from April when we had all that chaos has been strong. I think it’s been pretty well grounded, earnings have been exceptionally strong. You’ve got the undercurrent of deregulation on its way. Obviously, the AI theme…. I would say that the rally thus far has its strong underpinnings. But I do think the technicals from here are less compelling. There was just a big re-risking from April, retail bought the dip, but our institutional clients definitely got defensive and they had to just chase that rally. But I think a lot of that underweight has been covered. The systematic buying, some of the best of that is behind us. The corporate buying, some of the best of that is behind us too. So I don’t think the technicals are as favorable from here.” According to Shah, the signs of a meme stock mania amid “flashpoints of froth” in the market are making him a “little bit more cautious.” “Now again, these kind of overshoots can persist for some time. I’m not saying the structural undercurrents aren’t still positive. But I do think it is an opportune time to get a bit more defensive.” A recent Reuters report cited department store chain Kohl’s, real estate flipper Opendoor Technologies, camera maker GoPro and restaurant chain Krispy Kreme as some of the equities that have poor fundamentals but are nonetheless rallying, driven by social media hype.

Within this time, the network has pioneered the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). As Ethereum celebrates its tenth anniversary, CryptoPotato has obtained exclusive commentary from a few industry experts. Their opinions address questions about the blockchain’s journey so far and what the next decade holds in store. Ethereum at 10 Ethereum introduced programmability and smart contracts to blockchain. While the network’s user base has expanded to at least 80 countries, and its transaction count is running into millions, competitors are challenging its leading position in the industry. Although the project has recently been seeing institutional adoption, it may struggle to stay relevant over the next ten years. Jamie Elkaleh, CMO at Bitget Wallet, is of the opinion that Ethereum will have to continuously re-earn its position as the default layer-1 (L1) blockchain. Only infrastructure maturity will shape the network’s future, not some “killer app.” According to Elkaleh, Ethereum’s differentiators will be interoperability and composability. The network needs to distance itself from layer-2 (L2) chain friction and focus on facilitating faster and cheaper transactions. Additionally, the network needs to prioritize cross-chain user experience (UX) and security sharing so that it can remain the “center of gravity in a multi-chain world.” When asked about the quality of Ethereum’s technical roadmap, the Bitget Wallet CMO said the challenge is velocity, not direction. While the roadmap tackles L1 limitations and L2 scalability through upgrades , competing ecosystems are leading in UX and speed. “Ethereum’s upgrades are often technically elegant but operationally complex,” he said, adding that the network risks falling behind on the UX front, unless developers accelerate execution. Refocusing on The Core L1 In his commentary, Steven Pu, co-founder of the Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible network Taraxa, emphasized the need for Ethereum to stop relying on L2 chains. He called them “centralized, insecure, and parasitic tourists,” while insisting that the best way to improve the network would be to scale the L1 chain itself. Essentially, Ethereum needs to focus on itself to become faster and cheaper, especially with next-generation L1 chains emerging every now and then. “We hope there’ll be a course change soon,” Pu stated. Will Ethereum continue to be the second-largest blockchain or be overtaken by more efficient networks? Will the ecosystem continue to deliver on decentralization while keeping up with user demands? And more importantly, will ether reach new highs and deliver significant value to investors? Only time will tell.

The Ethereum Foundation , a cornerstone in the development and growth of the Ethereum blockchain, has recently executed another significant internal ETH transfer , sparking discussions and analyses across the crypto community. While such movements are part of the Foundation’s routine operations, each transaction offers a glimpse into the strategic financial management that underpins one of the world’s most influential decentralized networks. Unpacking the Ethereum Foundation’s Latest Strategic ETH Transfer According to data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham, the Ethereum Foundation recently moved an additional 1,000 ETH, valued at approximately $3.83 million at the time of the transaction, to an internal address commencing with ‘0xbC9a’. This particular address now holds a substantial 3,531 ETH, equivalent to roughly $13.5 million. It’s worth noting that this isn’t an an isolated event; a similar ETH transfer of 1,000 ETH was also observed to the same address on July 28. These internal movements are a testament to the dynamic nature of digital asset management within large organizations like the Ethereum Foundation . Unlike transfers to external entities or exchanges, internal transfers typically involve moving funds between different wallets controlled by the same organization. This can be for various reasons, including enhanced security, operational efficiency, or strategic asset allocation. The public nature of blockchain ensures that even these internal movements are fully transparent and verifiable by anyone. Why Do Internal ETH Transfers Occur? Understanding the Ethereum Foundation’s Financial Strategy When we observe large organizations like the Ethereum Foundation moving significant amounts of cryptocurrency, it’s natural to wonder about the underlying reasons. Internal ETH transfers are a common and necessary part of managing substantial digital treasuries. These movements are typically executed for a variety of strategic purposes, none of which usually signal an imminent market event or a change in fundamental strategy. Here are some of the primary reasons why the Ethereum Foundation might conduct internal ETH transfers: Operational Funding: The Foundation requires funds to cover ongoing operational costs, including salaries for its developers, researchers, and administrative staff. Transfers may be made to operational wallets to facilitate these expenditures. Security Consolidation: For enhanced security, large amounts of cryptocurrency are often stored in ‘cold storage’ wallets, which are offline. Funds may be moved from cold storage to ‘hot wallets’ (online) in smaller, manageable amounts when needed, or between different types of secure wallets. Grant Distributions and Ecosystem Support: The Ethereum Foundation actively supports projects, research, and community initiatives through grants. Internal transfers can prepare funds for distribution to these beneficiaries. Liquidity Management: While not trading, the Foundation may need to move funds to specific addresses to manage liquidity for various ecosystem-related activities, ensuring resources are available where and when they are needed most. Treasury Management: As a large entity, the Foundation manages its treasury strategically. This can involve rebalancing assets across different internal addresses for better organization, auditing, or preparing for future planned expenditures. Each ETH transfer by the Ethereum Foundation is a deliberate action aimed at maintaining the health and operational efficiency of the ecosystem. It reflects a sophisticated approach to managing a multi-million dollar digital treasury, ensuring resources are optimally deployed for the network’s long-term prosperity. Is the Ethereum Foundation’s On-Chain Transparency a Model for Trust? One of the inherent beauties of blockchain technology is its unparalleled transparency. Every ETH transfer made by the Ethereum Foundation , whether internal or external, is recorded on the public ledger and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This level of openness is a stark contrast to the opaque financial dealings often seen in traditional corporate finance. For the Ethereum Foundation , this transparency isn’t just a byproduct of blockchain; it’s a foundational pillar of trust and accountability. The ability for anyone to verify the movement of funds provides an important layer of oversight. While the specific intent behind every internal ETH transfer isn’t always explicitly stated, the fact that these transactions are visible allows the community to track and understand the flow of resources supporting Ethereum’s development. This commitment to on-chain transparency helps to reinforce the decentralized ethos of the network, fostering greater confidence among its users and stakeholders. It allows for a degree of public accountability that is rare in other financial sectors, setting a precedent for how large organizations can operate with integrity in the digital age. What Does This Mean for the Ethereum Ecosystem and Its Future Development? The funds held and managed by the Ethereum Foundation are not merely passive assets; they are the lifeblood supporting the continuous evolution and innovation of the Ethereum blockchain. Every ETH transfer , especially those aimed at operational or development addresses, directly contributes to critical initiatives that shape Ethereum’s future. The strategic deployment of these funds has several profound implications for the ecosystem: Fueling Core Research & Development: A significant portion of the Foundation’s resources goes towards funding core protocol upgrades, scalability solutions (such as sharding and Layer 2 technologies), and crucial security enhancements. These are the technical advancements that keep Ethereum competitive and robust. Empowering Community-Driven Innovation: The Foundation provides grants to independent developers, researchers, and educators globally. These grants foster a diverse and vibrant ecosystem of innovation, allowing new ideas and projects to flourish that might not otherwise receive funding. Building Essential Infrastructure: Funds are allocated to develop and maintain vital tools, documentation, and infrastructure that make it easier for developers to build on Ethereum and for users to interact with decentralized applications. Ensuring Long-Term Sustainability: By carefully managing its treasury, the Ethereum Foundation ensures it has the financial resilience to navigate market fluctuations and continue its mission for decades to come, providing stability and continuity to the entire network. Promoting Education and Adoption: Resources are also directed towards educational initiatives and outreach programs that help onboard new users and developers, accelerating the mainstream adoption of Ethereum and blockchain technology. Ultimately, these strategic financial maneuvers by the Ethereum Foundation are geared towards fostering a robust, secure, and scalable Ethereum network capable of supporting the next generation of decentralized applications and digital economies. The health of the Foundation’s treasury is intrinsically linked to the ongoing health and progression of the entire Ethereum ecosystem, ensuring its vision of a decentralized future can be realized. How Can You Track Ethereum Foundation’s ETH Transfers? Actionable Insights for the Curious For those keen on staying informed and conducting their own due diligence, tracking the Ethereum Foundation ‘s ETH transfer activities is surprisingly straightforward thanks to public blockchain explorers. Tools like Etherscan, Arkham Intelligence (as cited in our initial report), and others provide real-time data on all transactions occurring on the Ethereum network. Here’s how you can engage with this transparency and track significant movements: Identify Key Addresses: While the specific internal address (like 0xbC9a) might be part of their operational setup, the Ethereum Foundation often uses publicly known addresses for its main treasury and grant programs. Reputable crypto news sites and analytics platforms often identify these. Utilize Blockchain Explorers: Input an identified Foundation address into a blockchain explorer. You can then view its entire transaction history, current balance, and all incoming and outgoing movements. Filters often allow you to sort by date, amount, or transaction type. Follow On-Chain Analytics Firms: Companies like Arkham specialize in tracking and analyzing movements of large entities on the blockchain.

The 21st Century Mortgage Act would modernize mortgage eligibility by requiring government-backed entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to consider digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, when evaluating single-family home loan applications, potentially reshaping access to homeownership. This bill has not gone unnoticed, as Crypto-focused influencer X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) commented on the bill, highlighting XRP’s inclusion in the proposed mortgage law, and writing, “This isn’t just bullish for XRP. It’s historic for crypto.” JUST IN $XRP is being written into US mortgage law A new Senate bill would force Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac to accept digital assets, including XRP, for home loans. They’re making it mortgage-grade This isn’t just bullish for $XRP . It’s historic for crypto Do you see it yet? pic.twitter.com/Fy2Xbofu8D — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 29, 2025 Details of the Proposed Mortgage Bill Under the proposed bill, digital assets would be factored into mortgage risk assessments. Specifically, the legislation would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to accept digital assets recorded on a distributed ledger, effectively making them financial instruments suitable for use in the home loan process. The legislation also reflects an earlier directive from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte, which urged agencies to “consider cryptocurrency as an asset for single-family loans.” Moving Into a New Age Senator Lummis called the bill a practical response to economic change, noting many young Americans now hold wealth in digital assets. According to Lummis, “We’re living in a digital age, and rather than punishing innovation, government agencies must evolve.” This shift may offer a broader on-ramp to financial inclusion, particularly for younger generations whose net worth increasingly includes cryptocurrencies. Lummis is not a supporter of XRP, and previously cancelled a meeting with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , refusing to reschedule. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, her pro-crypto stance will significantly benefit XRP, despite her preference for Bitcoin. Until now, crypto holdings were excluded from mortgage calculations, limiting the borrowing power of digitally-native consumers. The bill would prevent agencies from requiring applicants to liquidate digital assets into dollars instead of instructing them to assess these holdings in their native form. Garlinghouse, who recently testified before the Senate , has consistently called for an inclusive approach to cryptocurrency integration and use. This bill will provide a framework that will improve the market’s standing in the U.S. and further legitimize assets like XRP. What’s Next for XRP and the Broader Market? The bill’s introduction signals a potential shift in how federal institutions treat decentralized financial technologies. Though it still faces debate and refinement before becoming law, its implications are already resonating in markets and policy circles alike. 2025 has seen major bills, such as the GENIUS Act, passed into law . If passed, this legislation would mark one of the most significant integrations of cryptocurrency into U.S. financial infrastructure to date.

Many analysts believe a green light from regulators could unlock a fresh wave of institutional capital—not just for XRP, but for lesser-known altcoins that often surge in the aftershock of big headline moves. Two names drawing significant interest are Pump.fun and Pendle, both of which are positioned for explosive growth if ETF optimism turns into a full-blown altcoin rally. This comes as MAGACOIN FINANCE continues making waves in the presale space, with early predictions of 57x returns sparking attention from investors who missed out on coins like PEPE and FLOKI. Pendle: Quiet Climb Could Turn Parabolic Currently priced at $4.45, Pendle has been making steady gains in DeFi circles thanks to its focus on yield tokenization. With a market cap nearing $740 million and daily volume topping $124 million, Pendle isn’t just another small-cap play—it’s building a name as one of the more technically sound altcoins. While the past week saw a mild 3% dip, short-term indicators are pointing to renewed accumulation, especially as institutions begin exploring higher-yield strategies beyond Bitcoin and ETH. This Presale Star is Earning Comparisons to Early SHIBA INU While most eyes are on ETF headlines, early investors are flocking to one lesser-known presale token that’s rapidly selling out. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been called a “once-in-a-cycle” opportunity by insiders tracking ROI potential, with presale rounds closing at record speed . Unlike the hype-driven launches of past cycles, this project is gaining steam thanks to its strategic rollout and expanding ecosystem. With analysts projecting up to 57x gains , the buzz is quickly approaching levels last seen during the early days of viral tokens like SHIBA INU. Pump.fun: Rock Bottom Now, But Could Rocket At just $0.0025, Pump.fun is the definition of a high-risk, high-reward altcoin. It’s taken a beating this week—down over 41% in seven days—but that kind of drop is exactly what draws speculative traders looking for bottom entries. Despite the pullback, Pump.fun’s market cap still sits near $884 million, and 24-hour volume has crossed $386 million, suggesting the coin still commands major attention. If meme coin season returns—especially with DOGE and SHIB ETF chatter—Pump.fun could ride that momentum skyward. Conclusion The crypto market may be on the verge of its next major shift, with an XRP ETF potentially serving as the spark. For those hunting high-momentum altcoins, Pendle’s DeFi fundamentals and Pump.fun’s viral potential both stand out. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate presale headlines, with projected returns of 57x making it one of the most talked-about early-stage tokens heading into Q3.

With the uncertainty in the market, token unlocks like these could affect the Dogecoin price. However, with deep liquidity, there is a high possibility that the meme coin is able to absorb this massive unlock without much effect. Large Dogecoin Unlock To Hit The Market In an X post, Wu Blockchain reported that there are a number of single token unlocks that are set to go live in the altcoin market over seven days. However, the ones of concern are the linear unlocks that will continue into the first week of August, putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the market. Related Reading: XRP Won’t See Devastating Pullback Because ‘The Train Has Left The Station’ One of the major unlocks shown was for Dogecoin, which is supposed to see approximately 95.5 million DOGE tokens added to its supply. Going by the current supply, this would be an additional 0.06% added to the circulating supply. At the current market price, this would be around $22.9 million worth of tokens being added. Naturally, token unlocks can impact the price of a digital asset, and Dogecoin is no different. However, looking at the daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency, which is in the billions of dollars, as well as the deep liquidity across major crypto exchanges, it is likely that the DOGE market will absorb this new supply without much fuss. Additionally, not all of the 95 million tokens will be sent into circulation at once. Given that it’s a linear unlock, meaning the coins will be released into circulation in smaller batches, it is much easier for the market to absorb the supply without any negative impact to the Dogecoin price. Other Tokens Being Unlocked While the Dogecoin token unlock is significant, it is not the largest token unlock expected to happen this week. The crown goes to Solana, which is expected to see 465,770 tokens unlocked. This stash is worth a staggering $87 million and translates to 0.09% of the total supply. Related Reading: The Days Of Parabolic Bitcoin Bull Runs Are Over: Analyst Reveals How BTC Will Reach $1,000,000 Next on the list is the TRUMP token at 4.89 million tokens worth $50.13 million.

As a part of its new crypto treasury strategy, the app plans to increase crypto holdings to 50%. Marti is also considering accumulating other digital assets, including Ethereum and Solana , the company said Tuesday . The company plans to purchase these crypto assets as potential long-term stores of value and as a hedge against systemic financial risks. The cryptos will be custodied through a “regulated, institutional-grade custodian,” the firm noted. “Our decision to allocate capital to crypto assets acknowledges our belief that Bitcoin and other digital assets have proven their ability to store value alongside hard currencies and gold over the last several years,” said CEO Oguz Alper Oktem. Companies Accumulating Crypto is the New Talk of The Town Marti joins the flurry of companies ploughing cash into tokens. Since June, 98 companies have announced plans to raise over $43 billion to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, crypto advisory firm, Architect Partners, noted . Inspired by the top BTC corporate holder, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), these companies aim to accumulate more BTC per outstanding share over time, rather than simply tracking BTC’s price. Michael Saylor’s Strategy currently holds 628,791 BTC, per Bitcoin Treasuries data . The BTC powerhouse recently closed the largest US IPO of 2025 , raising $2.521 billion. Industry skeptics note that the rush of companies buying crypto is a sign the market is overheating. “The rise of corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin is significant, but it shouldn’t be about chasing trends or building oversized positions,” Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, told Cryptonews. “It is vital to remember that firms like Strategy and Metaplanet represent high-conviction outliers, headline grabbers with bold strategies that align with their unique business aims. For most, a more measured approach will be better suited,” he said. “One grounded in long-term belief, not short-term reliance on volatility.” Turkey’s New Crypto Restrictions Amid Growing Crypto Interest The news arrives at a time when the Turkish crypto market has seen remarkable growth in recent times. The country has seen over half of its population holding crypto, according to a KuCoin survey. Further, Turkey’s inflationary environment has significantly boosted the use of stablecoins over the past years. Last year, the USDT-TRY was the largest trading pair by volume on Binance with more than $22 billion, according to Kaiko Research . (Source: Kaiko) However, Turkey recently implemented stricter rules for crypto exchanges and investors. The new comprehensive guidelines cover establishment, operations, capital adequacy, and customer protection measures. The strict crypto oversight by Turkey’s Ministry of Treasury and Finance is a plan to clamp down on illicit financial activities. Besides, the new regulation imposes a delay on crypto asset withdrawals . Any crypto purchased, exchanged, or deposited will be subject to a 48-hour waiting period before it can be withdrawn.

This substantial investment marks a pivotal moment for the firm and underscores Hong Kong’s growing ambition to solidify its position as a leading hub for virtual assets. For anyone tracking the evolution of digital finance, this news signals a powerful vote of confidence in regulated stablecoin initiatives and the infrastructure supporting them. RD Technologies: Pioneering Hong Kong Stablecoin Innovation At the heart of this exciting announcement is RD Technologies, a Hong Kong-based entity dedicated to building the foundational infrastructure for stablecoins. Their mission extends beyond merely creating digital currencies; they are focused on establishing a robust, compliant, and efficient ecosystem that can bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning world of digital assets. This recent funding round is not just about capital; it’s a testament to the market’s belief in their vision and their ability to execute on it. The firm’s commitment to developing HKDR, a stablecoin fully backed by the Hong Kong dollar, positions them at the forefront of the region’s digital currency evolution. This initiative is crucial for fostering trust and stability within the digital asset space, offering a transparent and reliable alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies. Who’s Backing This Vision? A Strategic Investment in Hong Kong Stablecoin Future The $40 million Series A2 funding round saw participation from a formidable lineup of investors, highlighting the strategic importance of RD Technologies’ work. The round was led by: ZA Global: A key player in the fintech sector, indicating a strong alignment with digital banking and financial innovation. China Harbour: Suggests interest from infrastructure and broader economic development sectors, recognizing the foundational nature of stablecoin technology. Bright Venture: A venture capital firm focused on growth-stage companies, emphasizing the potential for significant returns. Hivemind Capital: A prominent digital asset investment firm, bringing deep expertise in the crypto space. Additional participation came from HSG, Eternal Digital, CMSC Partners, and Guotai Junan International Private Equity Fund. This diverse consortium of investors, spanning traditional finance, infrastructure, and native crypto funds, signifies a broad-based recognition of the potential impact of a well-regulated Hong Kong stablecoin . Their investment provides not just financial backing but also strategic partnerships and invaluable industry insights, accelerating RD Technologies’ development roadmap and market penetration. Unveiling HKDR: Hong Kong’s Digital Dollar and Its Potential Central to RD Technologies’ strategy is the development of HKDR, a stablecoin meticulously designed to be fully backed by the Hong Kong dollar. This crucial detail ensures that HKDR maintains a stable value, directly pegging it to one of the world’s most resilient fiat currencies. The significance of this cannot be overstated: Stability and Trust: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, HKDR offers a predictable value, making it suitable for everyday transactions, remittances, and as a store of value. Regulatory Alignment: Being fully backed and developed within Hong Kong’s evolving regulatory framework, HKDR aims to meet stringent compliance standards, fostering trust among institutions and retail users alike. Enhanced Efficiency: Digitalizing the Hong Kong dollar via a stablecoin can dramatically improve the speed and reduce the cost of cross-border payments, trade finance, and other financial services. Foundation for Innovation: HKDR can serve as a programmable money layer, enabling new financial products and services, from tokenized assets to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, all within a regulated environment. The potential applications of HKDR extend far beyond simple payments, promising to revolutionize how financial transactions are conducted in and out of Hong Kong. Why Regulated Stablecoins Matter: A Partnership with ZA Bank for Hong Kong Stablecoin Use Cases A key aspect of RD Technologies’ strategy is its collaboration with ZA Bank, one of Hong Kong’s leading virtual banks. This partnership is geared towards developing regulated use cases for financial services, a move that is absolutely critical for the mainstream adoption of stablecoins. The involvement of a licensed financial institution like ZA Bank provides several vital benefits: Regulatory Clarity: Working with ZA Bank ensures that HKDR’s applications align with existing and forthcoming financial regulations, paving the way for broader acceptance. Consumer Protection: Regulated use cases offer enhanced consumer and investor protection, building confidence in the stablecoin ecosystem. Integration with Traditional Finance: This partnership facilitates the seamless integration of HKDR into existing financial systems, making it accessible to a wider user base beyond crypto natives. Proof of Concept: Developing concrete, regulated use cases demonstrates the practical utility and viability of a Hong Kong stablecoin , moving it from theoretical concept to real-world solution. This strategic alliance is a clear indicator of Hong Kong’s pragmatic approach to integrating digital assets into its financial landscape, emphasizing regulation and stability over unchecked innovation. Hong Kong’s Grand Crypto Ambition: Becoming a Global Digital Asset Hub RD Technologies’ success and its focus on a regulated Hong Kong stablecoin are integral to the city’s broader strategy to become a premier global digital asset hub. In recent years, Hong Kong has taken decisive steps to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets, distinguishing itself from other jurisdictions that have adopted more restrictive stances. Key elements of this ambition include: Clear Licensing Regimes: Implementing licensing for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and exchanges, providing legal certainty for operators. Regulatory Sandboxes: Allowing innovative fintech firms to test new products and services in a controlled environment. Government Support: Explicitly stating its commitment to fostering Web3 development and digital innovation. Global Talent Attraction: Aiming to draw top talent and companies to its shores, leveraging its existing strengths as an international financial center. The development of a robust stablecoin infrastructure is a cornerstone of this strategy, as stablecoins are seen as the crucial bridge between traditional fiat currencies and the broader digital economy. By fostering a regulated environment for stablecoins like HKDR, Hong Kong aims to attract significant capital and innovation, potentially rivaling established crypto centers. Navigating the Future: Benefits and Challenges for Hong Kong Stablecoin Adoption The path forward for the Hong Kong stablecoin ecosystem, spearheaded by firms like RD Technologies, is filled with immense potential but also inherent challenges. What are the primary benefits a Hong Kong stablecoin brings? Enhanced Financial Efficiency: Faster, cheaper cross-border transactions and settlements. Reduced Counterparty Risk: Programmable money and instant settlement can lower risks in complex financial dealings. Innovation Catalyst: Provides a stable base layer for the development of new financial products, services, and tokenized real-world assets. Global Competitiveness: Strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial hub by embracing digital transformation. What challenges might RD Technologies and HKDR face? Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still evolving globally, requiring continuous adaptation. Market Adoption: Overcoming inertia and encouraging widespread adoption among businesses and consumers. Technological Scalability: Ensuring the underlying technology can handle high transaction volumes efficiently and securely. Global Competition: Competing with other established stablecoins and jurisdictions vying for digital asset leadership. Successfully navigating these challenges will be key to unlocking the full potential of HKDR and establishing Hong Kong as a leader in the stablecoin space. Conclusion: A New Era for Hong Kong’s Digital Finance The $40 million funding secured by RD Technologies is far more than just a financial injection; it’s a powerful validation of Hong Kong’s strategic pivot towards becoming a global digital asset powerhouse. With the development of HKDR, a fully backed Hong Kong stablecoin , and its strategic partnership with ZA Bank, RD Technologies is laying crucial groundwork for a future where digital currencies play an integral role in regulated financial services. This move not only enhances Hong Kong’s competitiveness but also sets a precedent for how traditional financial centers can embrace and integrate innovative blockchain technology responsibly. The journey ahead will undoubtedly present its own set of challenges, but with this significant backing and clear vision, RD Technologies is well-positioned to drive a revolutionary shift in Hong Kong’s digital financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a stablecoin and why is HKDR important?

Who are the key investors in RD Technologies’ $40M funding round? The Series A2 funding round was led by ZA Global, China Harbour, Bright Venture, and Hivemind Capital. Additional participation came from HSG, Eternal Digital, CMSC Partners, and Guotai Junan International Private Equity Fund, showcasing diverse institutional interest.

What is Hong Kong’s broader strategy for virtual assets? Hong Kong aims to become a leading global digital asset hub by establishing clear licensing regimes for virtual asset service providers, fostering innovation through regulatory sandboxes, and providing strong government support for Web3 development. The focus on regulated stablecoins like HKDR is a key component of this strategy. What are the main benefits of using a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin like HKDR?

That changed when the price found support near $0.0025, a zone that lines up with a high-volume node on the volume profile. This level has seen strong buying interest before, and once again, buyers stepped in. Volume increased as the asset moved toward $0.0027. The breakout also crossed the Point of Control (PoC), a level where the most trading occurred during the recent downtrend. The next area of interest sits near $0.0054, based on previous trading ranges. On-Chain Data Shows 100% Revenue Used for Buybacks On-chain data shows that Pump.fun has increased buybacks to 100% of daily revenue over the past two days. This is a sharp rise from the previous 25% rate, though no formal statement has been issued by the team. The changes can be seen in on-chain transaction records, pointing to increased activity from the platform’s treasury. Daily earnings for Pump.fun fell below $300,000 on Monday. This level of revenue has only been recorded two other times in the past year, both in September 2024. Source: DefiLlama As of now, Pump.fun has earned more than $735 million in cumulative revenue . The uptick in buybacks may be tied to efforts to stabilize the token’s price after a sharp drop earlier this month. PUMP Recovers After Airdrop Delay Sell-Off Pump.fun (PUMP) was priced at $0.002647 at press time, with a 24-hour trading volume of $612 million. The token has gained over 10% in the past day, although it remains down nearly 29% over the past week. Meanwhile, the recent breakout and buyback activity came shortly after a volatile period. On July 23, the project’s co-founder confirmed that the long-awaited airdrop would be delayed, which led to a 20% drop in the token’s value within 24 hours. Launched in 2024, Pump.fun quickly rose to prominence in the meme coin space. It hosted a $500 million ICO earlier this month, which sold out in 12 minutes. However, some users were unable to complete their purchases, prompting Kraken to offer an airdrop to affected accounts. Despite the recent rebound in price, the platform is still facing questions about sustainability in a highly competitive market.

A significant development on the horizon for the crypto community is Binance’s latest announcement: the listing of the A2Z USDT perpetual contract . This move is poised to reshape trading strategies and open up fresh avenues for market participants. What exactly does this mean for you, and how can you navigate this exciting new opportunity? What is the A2Z USDT Perpetual Contract and Why Does it Matter? On July 30 at 08:00 UTC, Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, will officially launch the A2Z USDT perpetual contract . This isn’t just another listing; it’s an expansion of the derivatives market, offering traders a new way to engage with the crypto asset A2Z. A perpetual contract is a type of futures contract that, unlike traditional futures, does not have an expiry date. This allows traders to hold their positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. The ‘USDT’ in the contract name signifies that the contract is settled in Tether, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This provides stability for traders, as their profits and losses are denominated in a less volatile asset, insulating them from the direct price fluctuations of other cryptocurrencies. The introduction of the A2Z USDT pair means that traders can now speculate on the price movements of A2Z without directly owning the underlying asset, using USDT as collateral. Understanding the Mechanics: What are Perpetual Contracts? Perpetual contracts have become incredibly popular in the crypto space due to their flexibility and accessibility. Here’s a quick breakdown of their core features: No Expiry Date: Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts don’t expire, allowing traders to hold positions for as long as they wish. Funding Rate: To keep the contract price pegged to the spot price of the underlying asset, a funding rate mechanism is employed. This periodic payment between long and short positions incentivizes convergence. Leverage: They typically offer high leverage, enabling traders to control larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital. This structure makes them attractive for both short-term speculation and longer-term strategic positioning, providing a dynamic tool for active traders. Unpacking the Leverage: What Does 75x Mean for Your Trading? One of the most striking features of the newly listed A2Z USDT perpetual contract is the maximum leverage of 75x. Leverage allows traders to amplify their potential returns by borrowing funds from the exchange to open larger positions than their initial capital would permit. For instance, with 75x leverage, a trader can control a position worth $7,500 with just $100 of their own capital. The Double-Edged Sword of High Leverage: While 75x leverage presents an enticing opportunity for significant gains, it’s crucial to understand its inherent risks: Amplified Profits: Small price movements in your favor can lead to substantial profits. Amplified Losses: Conversely, even minor adverse price movements can result in rapid and substantial losses, potentially leading to liquidation of your entire margin. Increased Volatility Risk: Highly leveraged positions are more susceptible to market volatility, requiring vigilant monitoring. Margin Calls: If the market moves against your position, you may receive a margin call, requiring you to deposit more funds to maintain your position, or face automatic liquidation. For this reason, high leverage is generally recommended for experienced traders who possess a robust understanding of market dynamics, risk management, and the specific asset they are trading. Beginners should approach such high leverage with extreme caution, if at all, and consider starting with much lower leverage levels to gain experience. Why is Binance Listing the A2Z USDT Perpetual Contract? Binance’s decision to list the A2Z USDT perpetual contract is a strategic move that reflects several market trends and objectives: Meeting Trader Demand: As the crypto market matures, there’s growing demand for diverse trading instruments. Listing new perpetual contracts caters to this evolving need, particularly for promising or highly anticipated assets like A2Z. Expanding Market Share: By offering a broader range of derivatives, Binance strengthens its position as a leading global exchange, attracting more traders to its platform. Enhancing Liquidity: New listings, especially with high leverage options, often attract significant trading volume, contributing to deeper liquidity for the underlying asset and the contract itself. Innovation and Competitiveness: Staying at the forefront of innovation is key in the fast-paced crypto industry. Introducing new trading pairs and features keeps Binance competitive. This listing signals Binance’s commitment to providing comprehensive trading solutions and its confidence in the potential of the A2Z asset within the broader crypto ecosystem. Benefits for Traders: How Can You Capitalize on This Opportunity? The introduction of the A2Z USDT perpetual contract brings several potential benefits for traders: Access to A2Z Price Action: Traders can now speculate on the price of A2Z without needing to buy and hold the actual token, making it easier to go long or short. Capital Efficiency: High leverage allows traders to control larger positions with less capital, freeing up funds for other investments. Hedging Opportunities: Existing A2Z holders can use the perpetual contract to hedge their spot positions against potential price declines, mitigating risk. Arbitrage Potential: Discrepancies between the A2Z spot price and the perpetual contract price can create arbitrage opportunities for savvy traders. 24/7 Trading: Like most crypto markets, perpetual contracts trade around the clock, offering continuous opportunities. These benefits, however, are always accompanied by the need for disciplined risk management, especially given the leverage involved. Navigating the Challenges: Essential Risk Management Strategies While the prospect of 75x leverage on the A2Z USDT perpetual contract is exciting, prudent risk management is paramount to protect your capital. Here are actionable insights to consider: Start Small: Especially if you’re new to perpetual contracts or high leverage, begin with a small portion of your capital and lower leverage. Gradually increase as you gain experience and confidence. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always set a stop-loss order to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a predetermined threshold. This limits potential losses. Understand Liquidation Prices: Be aware of your liquidation price – the point at which your position will be automatically closed by the exchange due to insufficient margin. Calculate this before entering a trade. Never Over-Leverage: Just because 75x leverage is available doesn’t mean you should use it. Choose a leverage level that aligns with your risk tolerance and trading strategy. Many professional traders use 5x or 10x leverage, even for highly liquid assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and any developments related to A2Z that could impact its price. Diversify: Avoid putting all your capital into a single highly leveraged trade. Diversify your portfolio to spread risk. Effective risk management isn’t just a suggestion; it’s a necessity for sustainable trading in the volatile derivatives market. The Future Outlook for A2Z and Derivatives Trading The listing of the A2Z USDT perpetual contract on Binance marks a significant milestone for the A2Z asset, indicating growing institutional and retail interest. Such listings often lead to increased exposure, liquidity, and potentially, greater price discovery for the underlying asset. For the broader derivatives market, it reinforces the trend of crypto exchanges continuously innovating and providing sophisticated tools for traders. As the crypto ecosystem matures, we can expect more assets to be available for derivatives trading, offering more complex strategies for market participants. However, with greater opportunity comes greater responsibility, especially in understanding the nuances of these powerful financial instruments. Conclusion: A New Chapter for A2Z Traders Binance’s upcoming listing of the A2Z USDT perpetual contract with up to 75x leverage on July 30, 2024, is a pivotal event for the cryptocurrency trading community. It not only expands the accessibility of the A2Z asset but also provides sophisticated tools for both speculative and hedging strategies. While the allure of high leverage is undeniable, success in this dynamic environment hinges on a deep understanding of market mechanics, meticulous risk management, and continuous learning. As traders prepare for this new opportunity, embracing a disciplined approach will be key to navigating the exciting yet challenging waters of crypto derivatives.

Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token.

While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token.

JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem.

Investors constantly seek clarity on the assets they hold, and changes to fundamental metrics like circulating supply can significantly impact market perception and asset valuation. Recently, a significant announcement from Upbit, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, caught the attention of the crypto community. Upbit officially stated on its website that it has updated the MAGIC crypto supply schedule, a move made at the explicit request of the project team behind the token. But what does this mean for MAGIC holders and the broader crypto ecosystem? What Exactly is Happening with the MAGIC Crypto Supply ? Upbit’s announcement is concise yet impactful. It confirms that the exchange has adjusted its records and display of MAGIC’s circulating supply plan. This isn’t just a clerical update; it reflects a revised strategy from the MAGIC project team itself. Understanding ‘circulating supply’ is fundamental here. It refers to the number of coins or tokens that are publicly available and currently in use within the market. It’s a dynamic figure, constantly changing as new tokens are minted, old ones are burned, or vesting schedules unlock previously locked tokens. For a project like MAGIC, which is integral to the TreasureDAO ecosystem, updates to its supply schedule are often tied to development milestones, ecosystem growth, or strategic adjustments to its tokenomics. These adjustments are typically designed to ensure the long-term health and stability of the project. While the specific details of the ‘why’ behind this particular request from the MAGIC team were not fully elaborated in Upbit’s initial announcement, such updates are common as projects mature and adapt to market conditions and their own developmental roadmap. Consider the following aspects of a circulating supply update: Project Team Request: This indicates a deliberate decision by the developers, not an exchange error. Transparency: Exchanges like Upbit play a vital role in relaying these updates accurately to their users. Impact on Metrics: Trading volumes, market capitalization, and perceived scarcity can all be affected. Why Does a Change in MAGIC Crypto Supply Matter to You? The circulating supply of a cryptocurrency is a critical metric that directly influences its valuation and market dynamics. Think of it like shares in a company; the more shares outstanding, the more diluted each share’s value might be, assuming all other factors remain constant. For crypto, changes to the MAGIC crypto supply can have several profound implications for investors: 1. Price Volatility and Scarcity: Increased Supply: If the update implies a higher number of tokens entering circulation sooner than expected, it could lead to inflationary pressure, potentially diluting the value of existing tokens and putting downward pressure on price. Decreased Supply or Delayed Release: Conversely, if the update signifies a reduction in the circulating supply or a delay in the release of new tokens, it could create scarcity, potentially leading to upward price pressure. 2. Investor Sentiment and Confidence: Transparency regarding tokenomics builds trust. When a project team actively communicates and adjusts its supply schedule, it can be viewed as a sign of adaptability and commitment to the project’s long-term vision. However, unexpected or poorly communicated changes can also lead to uncertainty and a decline in investor confidence. The request from the MAGIC project team to Upbit suggests a proactive approach to managing their token’s economics. 3. Market Capitalization Changes: Market capitalization (Market Cap = Price x Circulating Supply) is a key indicator of a cryptocurrency’s size and relative importance. A change in circulating supply directly impacts this figure. Investors often use market cap to compare projects and assess their overall value, so an accurate and updated supply figure is essential for informed decision-making. 4. Trading Strategies: Traders often factor circulating supply into their technical and fundamental analysis. News of an updated supply schedule can trigger adjustments in trading strategies, as participants try to anticipate market reactions. This could lead to short-term volatility as the market digests the new information. Diving Deeper: Understanding TreasureDAO and the MAGIC Ecosystem To truly grasp the significance of the MAGIC crypto supply update, it’s essential to understand its context within the broader TreasureDAO ecosystem. MAGIC is not just another token; it is the native utility and governance token of TreasureDAO, a decentralized gaming ecosystem built on Arbitrum. TreasureDAO aims to be the decentralized ‘Nintendo’ of web3, providing infrastructure and shared resources for various blockchain games and metaverses. Within this ecosystem, MAGIC serves multiple crucial functions: Staking: Users can stake MAGIC to earn rewards and participate in the ecosystem’s governance. In-game Currency: MAGIC is often used as the primary currency for transactions within games built on TreasureDAO. NFT Marketplace: It powers the Trove marketplace, where users can trade NFTs from various TreasureDAO projects. Governance: MAGIC holders have a say in the future development and direction of the TreasureDAO ecosystem. Given MAGIC’s central role, any adjustment to its supply directly impacts the economic levers of this expansive gaming metaverse. A well-managed supply ensures the long-term sustainability and vibrancy of the ecosystem, while mismanagement could lead to instability. The project team’s decision to update the supply schedule via Upbit underscores their active management of this vital asset. Factor Impact on Circulating Supply Relevance to Investors Vesting Schedules Tokens locked for teams/investors gradually unlock, increasing supply. Predicts future token releases, potential selling pressure. Token Burns Tokens permanently removed from circulation, decreasing supply. Creates scarcity, potentially driving value up.

One Altcoin Already Proving It’s Possible",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-a-100-investment-in-xrp-turn-into-10000-by-2026-one-altcoin-already-proving-its-possible/,"XRP has long captured the imagination of investors hoping to catch the next big surge, and with growing institutional support and upcoming ETF potential, speculation around its future price is heating up. Currently trading around $3.20, XRP’s path to a $10,000 return from a $100 investment would require a massive price breakout—something many believe could be fueled by regulatory clarity and wider utility of Ripple’s cross-border technology. Some analysts are eyeing 2026 as a make-or-break moment. With XRP adoption rising across banks and financial institutions, the asset could enter a period of strong upside momentum. The final approval of a U.S.-based spot ETF would likely trigger a massive inflow of institutional capital, similar to the surge seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum after their respective ETF launches. This opens the door for XRP to push toward new highs, especially if broader altcoin sentiment turns bullish. It’s within this wave of speculation that MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads. Often mentioned in the same conversations as high-upside plays like XRP, the project has gained attention as one of the few altcoins showing real potential for exponential growth. One Presale Altcoin Is Already Showing 7,800% Potential One of the biggest reasons investors are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to XRP’s early days is its explosive momentum during the presale phase. A $100 investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE could skyrocket to $10,000 after listings on top-tier exchanges go live. With over 7,800% gains already projected by some early backers, this isn’t just another hype coin—it’s a community-fueled ecosystem aiming to become the next breakout success story . The demand has already caused multiple rounds to sell out in record time, with buyers scrambling to secure early entry before prices rise. Back to XRP—if it follows the same route Ethereum took after ETF approval, and Ripple continues securing global financial partnerships, a price range of $10–$20 by 2026 is within the realm of possibility. However, for a $100 stake to reach $10,000, XRP would need to climb above $320 per coin—a level some optimists believe is achievable under extreme market conditions and institutional dominance. Still, for many investors seeking the next XRP-style ride, diversifying into fresh altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer a more realistic path to massive ROI . Conclusion: While XRP’s potential for major gains by 2026 depends heavily on regulatory and institutional developments, new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are already showing signs of explosive growth potential. For those aiming to turn $100 into $10,000 , looking beyond the usual suspects could be the smartest move right now.

The recent sentencing of a former Chinese tech executive for a staggering $19.5 million crypto embezzlement scheme serves as a stark reminder of the sophisticated challenges facing the cryptocurrency world. This case isn’t just about a large sum of money; it’s a profound narrative of digital deception, the intricate world of blockchain forensics, and the unwavering pursuit of justice in an increasingly complex financial landscape. The Anatomy of a $19.5 Million Crypto Embezzlement Scheme In a development that has sent ripples through the tech and crypto communities, a Beijing court has delivered a severe verdict: a former tech executive, identified only by the surname Feng, has been sentenced to 14 years and six months in prison. His crime? Embezzling a colossal 140 million yuan, equivalent to approximately $19.5 million USD, from his employer. But how did such a significant sum vanish, and how did cryptocurrencies become the chosen vehicle for its concealment? Feng, who held a position of considerable trust and authority, was responsible for approving incentive payouts at a prominent short video platform. This seemingly mundane task became the pivot point for his elaborate scheme. Instead of legitimate payouts, Feng orchestrated a sophisticated fraud, collaborating with external vendors to submit a barrage of fraudulent claims. These claims, devoid of any real service or product, funneled the company’s funds directly into his illicit coffers. The brazen nature of the embezzlement highlights a critical vulnerability: the exploitation of internal controls and the insidious nature of white-collar crime. From Embezzlement to Digital Obscurity: The Role of Cryptocurrency Laundering Once the funds were illicitly obtained, Feng faced the perennial challenge of all criminals: how to “clean” the dirty money and make it appear legitimate. This is where cryptocurrencies entered the picture, providing a seemingly impenetrable veil for his activities. Feng utilized the digital realm to launder the embezzled millions, channeling the funds through no less than eight overseas exchanges. This multi-platform approach was designed to obscure the money trail, making it incredibly difficult for authorities to trace the origins and destinations of the funds. A key tool in Feng’s arsenal was the use of “coin mixing tools,” often referred to as tumblers or mixers. These services aggregate various cryptocurrency transactions from multiple users, mix them together, and then send them out to their intended recipients. The goal is to break the on-chain link between the source and destination of the funds, effectively anonymizing the transactions. While legitimate privacy-enhancing tools exist, coin mixers have unfortunately become a favored method for criminals seeking to conceal illicit financial flows. This case underscores the dual-edged nature of blockchain technology: its transparency for legitimate use, and its potential for anonymity when exploited by malicious actors. Unmasking the Illicit Flow: The Power of Blockchain Analytics in Combating Crypto Embezzlement Despite Feng’s elaborate attempts to obfuscate his tracks, the long arm of the law, equipped with cutting-edge technology, eventually caught up. The authorities’ success in this case serves as a powerful testament to the evolving capabilities of blockchain analytics. These sophisticated tools and techniques are transforming the fight against financial crime in the digital age. Here’s how blockchain analytics played a pivotal role: Tracing Complex Transactions: Unlike traditional banking systems, where transactions might be siloed across different institutions, blockchain offers a public, immutable ledger. Blockchain analytics firms and law enforcement agencies use specialized software to analyze this vast amount of data. They can identify patterns, link addresses, and visualize transaction flows, even across multiple exchanges and through mixing services. Identifying Clusters and Entities: Advanced algorithms can group related addresses into “clusters” that likely belong to the same individual or entity. By cross-referencing these clusters with real-world information, such as exchange KYC data or public records, investigators can de-anonymize individuals. De-mixing Illicit Funds: While coin mixers aim for anonymity, advanced analytics can sometimes “de-mix” transactions. By analyzing the timing, amounts, and specific characteristics of mixed transactions, investigators can infer connections and reconstruct the original flow of funds, even after they’ve passed through a mixer. Collaboration with Exchanges: The fact that Feng used “eight overseas exchanges” highlights the importance of international cooperation. Many reputable exchanges now have robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies, and they often cooperate with law enforcement requests, providing crucial data that helps trace illicit funds. The successful recovery of over 90 BTC (Bitcoin) in this case is a direct result of these concerted efforts. This recovery not only represents a significant seizure of illicit assets but also sends a clear message: the digital world is not a haven for criminals. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly adept at navigating the complexities of blockchain to bring perpetrators to justice. Why Does This Case Matter for the Crypto World? The Feng case is more than just a headline; it’s a significant marker for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores several critical points: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: This incident will undoubtedly add fuel to the ongoing global debate about stricter cryptocurrency regulations. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to balance innovation with consumer protection and financial stability. Cases like Feng’s reinforce the narrative that stronger oversight is needed to prevent illicit activities. The Myth of Absolute Anonymity: For a long time, cryptocurrencies were perceived by some as completely anonymous. This case, alongside many others, shatters that myth. While privacy features exist, the inherent transparency of public blockchains, combined with advanced analytics, means that illicit transactions are increasingly traceable. Protecting Businesses and Investors: Businesses dealing with digital assets, and even traditional companies that process large sums, need robust internal controls and a clear understanding of crypto-related risks. For investors, this case highlights the importance of due diligence and understanding the regulatory environment surrounding the platforms they use. The Future of Financial Crime Fighting: Blockchain analytics is no longer a niche tool; it’s becoming mainstream in financial investigations. This case demonstrates its effectiveness in uncovering sophisticated schemes and recovering assets, setting a precedent for future enforcement actions. Lessons Learned and Actionable Insights What can we take away from this high-profile crypto embezzlement conviction? For Businesses For Individuals/Investors For Regulators/Law Enforcement Strengthen Internal Controls: Regularly audit financial processes, especially those involving large payouts or digital asset transfers. Implement multi-layered approval systems. Understand Risks: Be aware that while crypto offers privacy, it’s not absolute anonymity. Understand the regulatory standing of exchanges you use. Enhance Collaboration: Foster greater international cooperation between law enforcement agencies and cryptocurrency exchanges to share information and track illicit funds across borders. Employee Training: Educate employees on the risks of fraud, cybersecurity threats, and the importance of ethical conduct in the digital age. Verify Information: Be cautious of get-rich-quick schemes or unsolicited advice related to digital assets. Always verify the legitimacy of platforms and projects. Invest in Technology: Continue to develop and invest in advanced blockchain analytics tools and train personnel to effectively use them in investigations. Leverage Technology: Consider implementing AI-powered anomaly detection systems to flag unusual financial activities in real-time. Secure Your Assets: Use strong, unique passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Refine Regulations: Develop clear, enforceable regulations that address crypto-related crimes, including money laundering and fraud, without stifling innovation. A Landmark Case in the Fight Against Digital Financial Crime The sentencing of the former Chinese tech executive for $19.5 million crypto embezzlement and money laundering is a landmark moment. It serves as a powerful deterrent and a testament to the growing sophistication of law enforcement in navigating the intricate world of digital assets. While the allure of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities might persist for some, this case unequivocally demonstrates that the digital trail, however convoluted, can be followed. It reinforces the message that justice will ultimately prevail, even in the most complex corners of the digital economy. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, so too will the methods to safeguard its integrity and hold accountable those who seek to exploit it for personal gain. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto embezzlement? A1: Crypto embezzlement refers to the fraudulent appropriation of digital assets (cryptocurrencies) by someone to whom they have been entrusted, often within an organization or company, for personal gain. It involves using one’s position of trust to illegally divert funds in the form of cryptocurrency. Q2: How was the former tech executive caught despite using coin mixers? A2: Authorities used advanced blockchain analytics tools and techniques to trace the flow of illicit funds. While coin mixers aim to obscure transactions, sophisticated analytics can sometimes de-mix funds by analyzing patterns, timings, and leveraging data from cooperating exchanges and other sources to identify the original source and destination. Q3: Are all cryptocurrency transactions anonymous? A3: No, the idea that all cryptocurrency transactions are completely anonymous is a common misconception. While pseudonymous (linked to an address, not directly to a person), public blockchains are transparent. Every transaction is recorded and viewable. When funds interact with regulated exchanges that require Know Your Customer (KYC) information, the link between an address and a real-world identity can be established, making transactions traceable. Q4: What are “coin mixing tools” and why are they used by criminals? A4: Coin mixing tools (or tumblers) are services designed to enhance privacy by combining various users’ cryptocurrency funds and then redistributing them, making it difficult to trace individual transactions. Criminals use them to obscure the origin of illicit funds, hoping to launder money and avoid detection by law enforcement. Q5: What measures can companies take to prevent crypto embezzlement? A5: Companies can implement robust internal controls, including multi-factor authentication for digital asset transfers, strict access controls, regular audits of financial processes, comprehensive employee training on cybersecurity and ethical conduct, and leveraging advanced anomaly detection systems to flag suspicious activities. Q6: What is the significance of recovering 90 BTC in this case? A6: The recovery of 90 BTC signifies a substantial seizure of illicit assets, demonstrating the effectiveness of law enforcement and blockchain analytics in not only identifying but also reclaiming stolen digital funds. It sends a strong message that even large-scale crypto crimes can lead to asset forfeiture and severe penalties. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-reiterates-26-6-xrp-price-prediction-says-expect-the-unexpected-heres-why/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Cryptobilbuwoo0 has reiterated a long-standing XRP price target, emphasizing that the $26.60 level, which he publicly forecasted over a year ago, is now receiving broader recognition among technical analysts. In his latest post, the analyst attached a price chart illustrating the progression of XRP against the US dollar, noting a key technical zone labeled as the “1.618 Sell” level, an area he claims was once ignored but is now a primary focus among market participants. According to the chart, XRP has printed a strong upward movement, breaking beyond key historical price zones. Cryptobilbuwoo0 noted that the $26.60 level, aligned with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, has become a consensus target among traders. He emphasized that this price point, which he identified several years ago, is where many are now positioning to take profits. I've been saying this for years, and just last year, when I said my target price for XRP was $26.60, everyone ignored me. Now, all the chartists are targeting the 1.618 level, which is the level I've been talking about for a few years. The moment everyone sells at that level,… pic.twitter.com/ZrTrFqs8zU — (X)=chi (R)esurrected (P)=rho (@Cryptobilbuwoo0) July 28, 2025 Warning on Market Volatility and Timing In the accompanying message, the analyst issued a cautionary note regarding the risks associated with mass profit-taking at a commonly expected price level. He suggested that if a majority of investors execute sell orders at the $26.60 range, it could lead to a sharp drop in XRP’s price, followed potentially by a rapid and unpredictable rebound. He termed this type of reversal as one that could occur “Overnight,” suggesting that the transition could be sudden and disruptive. Cryptobilbuwoo0 warned that traders who exit their positions at this anticipated level might struggle to reacquire XRP at favorable prices if a rebound follows. He argued that market participants may become disoriented or face significant barriers to reentry, particularly in a market that is still largely unregulated and known for its unpredictability. He reinforced the notion that crypto remains in a formative regulatory stage, which adds additional uncertainty to price action and investor behavior. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Long-Term Price Zones and Market Scenarios The chart included several future scenarios, with potential upside levels plotted significantly beyond the $26.60 mark. These included references to broader conceptual targets such as a $5 trillion market capitalization zone and an upper boundary labeled “Rainbow Currency,” with implied price levels reaching as high as $589. While these values were not explicitly forecasted as imminent outcomes, their inclusion in the graphic suggests a hypothetical roadmap that envisions significant upward movement beyond the current rally. Despite the speculative nature of these upper thresholds, Cryptobilbuwoo0 underscored that the current moment should not be viewed with complacency. He remarked that although everyone may be targeting the same price area, the reality of market behavior could shift abruptly. He emphasized that the $26.60 mark represents more than a profit-taking level; it may be a crucial psychological threshold that influences market dynamics. Concluding his post, the analyst clarified that the entire setup he described constitutes a scenario rather than a guaranteed forecast. He reminded his audience that the crypto market is inherently volatile and remains subject to surprises. Cryptobilbuwoo0 urged traders to be prepared for abrupt shifts and to avoid being caught off guard by emotionally driven or herd-based market behavior.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/warning-from-crypto-analysis-platform-matrixport-fear-and-greed-index-nears-peak-what-does-it-mean-here-are-the-details/,"According to the latest chart published by crypto analysis platform Matrixport, the Fear and Greed Index, which measures market sentiment, is approaching its peak levels, while the slow moving average (SMA) has also begun to signal a peak. Matrixport: Fear and Greed Index Nears Peak, Bitcoin Consolidation Period May Begin While Bitcoin has generally performed strongly during periods when this indicator has been on the rise in the past, downtrends indicate weakening market sentiment and symbolize periods when investors should be cautious. Matrixport stated that they made an upward forecast at the beginning of July, contrary to the market consensus, but with the recent evolution of the market, they switched to a more cautious approach. The company predicts that Bitcoin will enter a period of consolidation in August. Recent trends in the Fear and Greed Index support this prediction. Despite the continued positive news, market momentum has weakened significantly. According to Matrixport analysis, the discrepancy between current sentiment and fundamental data suggests the market may enter a “cooling phase” in the short term. Therefore, investors are advised to closely monitor market trends and implement timely risk management practices. *This is not investment advice.

A Forward-Looking Investment Study,https://bitzo.com/2025/07/can-cardano-ada-and-chainlink-link-set-new-milestones-in-2025-a-forward-looking-investment-study,"As the crypto world evolves, the potential of Cardano and Chainlink to achieve remarkable growth by 2025 becomes a compelling topic. This article delves into the future prospects of these two digital assets, highlighting their growth potential. Discover which coins might be on the verge of setting new milestones and becoming the stars of the crypto space. Cardano Market Trends and Trading Levels ADA monthly gain of 39.40% contrasts with a half-year drop of 16.06% amid fluctuations. A weekly loss of 11.25% emphasizes short-term pressure even as recent rebound efforts have spurred buying activity. Price action shows swift recoveries over short windows, while longer-term results reveal a notable pullback after earlier gains. Mixed performance over one month versus six months creates a dynamic environment that challenges long-term holders and attracts active traders seeking quick shifts. Current market conditions for Cardano show price activity confined within a defined range, with trading values lying between $0.478 and $0.699. Nearest notable levels include a support area around $0.38 and a resistance near $0.83. Despite a weekly drop of 11.25%, a monthly gain of nearly 39.40% reflects fresh buying interest, while the six-month decline of 16.06% reminds market participants of past volatility. Bulls have managed to push prices upward recently, yet short-term losses indicate that bears are exerting counter-pressure. With no clear trend, traders might consider testing the lower support level around $0.38 for rebound opportunities, targeting gains up to the resistance at $0.83. Chainlink Price Dynamics: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Declines LINK recent performance shows a rise of 35.60% over the last month, even as the coin experienced a 23.22% drop over the past six months. Short-term gains highlight a burst of optimism, while the extended decline reflects lingering bearish pressure. Price movements have been volatile, with market action swinging between cautious buying and brief pullbacks. The monthly rally contrasts with the broader downtrend, leaving traders to weigh quick profits against the risk of sustained momentum loss. Currently, LINK is trading between a range of $11 and $15.70 with a key resistance at $18.03 and a higher hurdle at $22.72. Support is visible at $8.63, with a deeper level at $3.93. Recent trends show a 6.87% decline, hinting at short-term bearish pressure despite the monthly bullishness. The Relative Strength Index at 59.34 suggests a neutral to slightly optimistic stance, yet caution remains evident from sellers. No clear trend dominates as buyers and sellers compete within these levels, encouraging traders to buy near support and target breakout opportunities past the $18.03 level for further gains. Conclusion ADA and LINK show strong potential for growth by 2025. Both have unique features that attract investors. ADA focuses on building a secure and scalable ecosystem. LINK offers important solutions for connecting smart contracts with real-world data. If development continues and market conditions remain favorable, these coins could achieve significant milestones. Investors might find opportunities in these promising projects. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Key Takeaways: Algeria has criminalized all crypto-related activities, including mining and trading. Offenders face prison sentences and heavy fines under the new law. The legislation aims to protect the financial system and aligns with global anti-money laundering standards. The move is aimed at shielding the financial system and bolstering the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, according to a recent report from Algerian news and information portal Fibladi. The new legal framework, set out in Law No. 25-10 of July 24, 2025, was published in the Official Journal No. 48 and directly amends Algeria’s anti-money laundering regulations. Algeria Criminalizes All Aspects of Crypto Activity Algeria has now criminalized every facet of cryptocurrency engagement, including mining, trading, possession, promotion, and the operation of trading platforms or wallets. Article 6a, a central feature of the law, bans “any form of issuance, purchase, sale, possession, use or promotion of crypto-assets.” This provision extends to the creation or management of digital asset platforms, regardless of whether they operate domestically or online. Even indirect involvement, such as the use of intermediaries, now constitutes a punishable offense. Importantly, the ban isn’t confined to transactions. Cryptocurrency mining, once a growing activity in Algeria’s southern regions, thanks to low electricity costs, is now explicitly outlawed. The law prohibits the production, distribution, or promotion of any virtual currency, closing the door on both large-scale mining operations and individual hobbyists. The Algerian government has banned all cryptocurrency-related activities — violators face up to 1 year in prison and a fine of $7 700. https://t.co/5N4vbW627f — Constantin Kogan (@constkogan) July 29, 2025 The penalties for breaching the new rules are severe. Article 31a provides for prison sentences ranging from two months to one year, fines between 200,000 and 1,000,000 dinars, or both, depending on the circumstances. Those found guilty of operating within organized networks or in connection with financial crimes like money laundering face even stiffer penalties. Legal experts see the legislation as a preventive measure to safeguard Algeria’s financial sector from the risks linked to crypto-assets, citing concerns over their volatility and the opaque nature of many transactions. The law’s introduction aligns with international anti-money laundering standards set by bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Algeria’s Crypto Ban Bucks Global Regulatory Trend Algeria’s stance on digital assets sets it apart from the regulatory trends seen in many other countries. The United States, for instance, recently advanced the GENIUS Act , marking the first major piece of crypto legislation to clear Congress. The law lays the groundwork for clear distinctions between payment-focused and investment-oriented stablecoins, reflecting a broader shift toward integrating digital assets into the regulated financial system rather than excluding them entirely. Even in emerging markets, attitudes toward crypto are evolving. Pakistan, once firmly opposed to cryptocurrency, has signaled a change in direction with a recent softening of its policies and moves toward regulatory engagement. The reversal comes as regional players look to harness the potential of blockchain technology for financial inclusion and economic modernization.

The world’s largest asset manager purchased more than $1.2 billion worth of Ethereum ( ETH ) between July 22 and July 28, compared to just $267 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ) over the same period, according to on‑chain data from Arkham . The data shows multiple large‑block transfers of 10,000 ETH each (approximately $36–37 million) from Coinbase Prime hot wallets to BlackRock‑controlled wallets, alongside several smaller inflows, including a single 177,500 ETH transaction worth $655.9 million. https://twitter.com/arkham/status/1950304519268815214 Ethereum price performance At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,812.42, up 3.14% over the past week, while Bitcoin trades at $118,356.67, down 0.11% over the same period. The scale of these inflows adds weight to the narrative that Ethereum is emerging as a preferred institutional play. While Bitcoin remains a dominant store‑of‑value asset, Ethereum’s utility‑driven demand profile appears to be resonating with asset managers seeking diversified crypto exposure. The takeaway? BlackRock’s crypto acquisition activity reinforces the narrative of Ethereum evolving from an alternative to Bitcoin into a core holding in institutional crypto strategies.

The decision was confirmed on Wednesday by Kent Walker, president of global affairs and chief legal officer at Alphabet, who said the company supports the initiative while still flagging concerns about its long-term effects on Europe’s AI competitiveness. This move hands the European Commission a key endorsement just weeks before its sweeping AI Act comes into effect. The code, which guides how general AI models comply with the law, was designed to align with the EU’s broader digital regulatory push. According to the Financial Times , Google’s signature puts pressure on other holdouts, especially Meta, to either fall in line or continue pushing back as public and regulatory scrutiny intensifies. Google joins signatories but warns of tradeoffs Kent made it clear Google’s support isn’t unconditional. “We’re signing with the hope that this Code, as applied, will promote European citizens’ and businesses’ access to secure, first-rate AI tools as they become available,” he said. But he also warned that the EU’s approach “risks slowing Europe’s development and deployment of AI.” He pointed to three main sticking points: any divergence from existing EU copyright law, regulatory steps that might delay product approvals, and transparency requirements that could force companies to give up trade secrets. “Departures from EU copyright law, steps that slow approvals, or requirements that expose trade secrets could chill European model development and deployment, harming Europe’s competitiveness,” Kent said. The AI code is designed for companies behind powerful models like Gemini, GPT-4, and Llama. Google now joins OpenAI and French AI startup Mistral as formal signatories. Microsoft hasn’t signed yet, but company president Brad Smith said earlier this month that it was “likely” to do so. Meta stays out as Brussels faces resistance from tech and industry Meta has refused to sign. Joel Kaplan, the company’s chief legal officer, said the code brings “a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act.” He argued that the rules would block progress in Europe and limit the ability of companies to build products on top of emerging models. “This over-reach will throttle the development and deployment of frontier AI models in Europe, and stunt European companies looking to build businesses on top of them,” Joel said. The resistance goes beyond Silicon Valley. Top executives from European giants including Airbus and BNP Paribas sent an open letter to the European Commission urging a two-year pause on AI legislation. They warned that the existing regulatory approach is overlapping, unclear, and threatening to undercut the continent’s ability to compete globally in AI. The executives also pointed out that the fast rollout of new rules, without coordination or clarity, risks putting Europe at a disadvantage compared to the U.S. and China. Meanwhile, the United States government has stepped in with its own criticism. After a trade meeting on Sunday between European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and President Donald Trump, the White House released a joint statement saying the two governments “intend to address unjustified digital trade barriers.” That line was aimed squarely at Brussels’ AI and data regulations. Still, Brussels isn’t flinching. On Tuesday, a Commission spokesperson responded to U.S. pressure, saying, “We are not moving on our right to regulate autonomously in the digital space.” The EU believes the AI Act is necessary to protect consumers and creators while setting global standards for safe AI development. And with the law scheduled to take effect early next month, time is running out for further negotiation. The AI code of practice isn’t legally binding but is meant to serve as a reference point for how firms should behave ahead of enforcement. Companies that sign are expected to follow its guidelines voluntarily, aligning with the upcoming legal regime. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Starting tomorrow, July 31, the protocol will activate its fee switch, aiming to redirect 10% of daily protocol revenue to the Resolv Foundation treasury. According to the announcement, the move transforms Resolve from a pure yield product to a long-term, self-sustaining ecosystem. Resolv Labs @ResolvLabs · Follow Resolv is activating the fee switch — targeting 10% of daily protocol profits to the Foundation treasury.The rollout will be carried out from 31 July to 21 August, increasing weekly over four increments (2.5% → 5% → 7.5% → 10%). Watch on Twitter View replies 11:43 pm · 24 Jul 2025 170 Reply Copy link Read 29 replies While the shift targets long-term stability, the Resolv community remained split. Some anticipate short-term pains before benefits emerge. Remember, the fee switch will reduce direct user payouts. Nevertheless, the team confirmed they are not cutting yield. This isn’t a yield cut. It’s a transition from 100% user payouts to a shared growth model and RESOLV flywheel activation. The anticipated potential immediate impact has stirred negative sentiments, confirmed by RESOLV’s performance in the past day. The altcoin has lost more than 15% of its value as some users exit before the fee switch activation begins. Why does fee activation matter now? The protocol has delayed activating protocol fees, by design, waiting for three crucial pieces: Real traction, beyond theory: Resolve has matured with active integration, lucrative usage, and credibility among DeFi users. A decisive model for value distribution: to align rewards between the protocol, long-term contributors, and users. Proven performance: The protocol boasts more than twelve months of resilient yield without unnecessary risks. That has propelled Resolv’s growth and revenue structure. Now, it plans to share its earnings with stakers in an innovative, sustainable model. A phased rollout Rather than an overnight change, Resolv will launch the fee switch gradually within four weeks. It will redirect 2.5% of the daily returns to the protocol in the first week, then 5%, 75%, and 10% from week four. Nevertheless, the fees only apply when Resolv generates profits. No positive yield? No fees. The protocol fee applies only when a positive yield is generated. On days with zero or negative yield, no fees are collected. It’s a performance-based system – when the protocol earns, it shares. When it doesn’t, nothing is taken. RESOLV price outlook The alt trades at $0.1876 after dropping over 6% of its value in the past day. Chart by CoinMarketCap RESOLV remains poised for further declines after losing the key support zone at $0.21. Resolv’s performance reflects mixed sentiments among the community ahead of the fee activation. Some individuals have offloaded RESOLV as they wait to see how the new chapter takes shape. Nevertheless, the fee activation development positions the project for long-term stability. Thus, the altcoin will likely experience significant bounce-backs once the dust settles. Reclaiming $0.21 will open the path to the latest high near $0.235. Bullish actions here could send RESOLV prices to $0.25, an over 30% surge from current prices.

In the fascinating world of cryptocurrency, something remarkably similar just happened. A long-dormant Bitcoin whale , an address holding a substantial amount of BTC, has stirred from its slumber after an astonishing 14.5 years, making a significant transfer that has sent ripples across the crypto community. This unexpected move raises compelling questions about the intentions behind such a long-awaited awakening and its potential implications for the broader market. The Shocking Awakening of a Bitcoin Whale: What Exactly Happened? Just recently, the crypto sphere buzzed with news of an extraordinary on-chain event. An address, identified by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X (formerly Twitter), which had been dormant for an astounding 14.5 years, suddenly sprang to life. This particular address was no small fish; it held a staggering 3,963 BTC. What caught everyone’s attention was the transfer of 50 BTC, valued at approximately $5.91 million at the time of the move, to a new address beginning with ‘bc1q8c’. This seemingly simple transaction is anything but, given the history and the sheer volume of Bitcoin involved. For context, 14.5 years ago, Bitcoin was in its infancy, a niche digital experiment known only to a handful of tech enthusiasts. The value of 50 BTC then would have been negligible, perhaps just a few dollars. Today, it represents a multi-million dollar sum. The ‘bc1q8c’ prefix indicates a SegWit (bech32) address, a newer and more efficient address format, suggesting that whoever is behind this Bitcoin whale address is now interacting with modern Bitcoin infrastructure. This detail alone sparks further speculation: is this the original owner, someone who has only now regained access, or perhaps a new entity? The mystery deepens with every layer of on-chain data we peel back. Why Does a Bitcoin Whale Awakening Command Attention? When a Bitcoin whale , especially one that has been dormant for such an extended period, makes a move, it’s not just another transaction; it’s a headline event. But why is this so significant? Here are a few key reasons: Scarcity and Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins. When large amounts of BTC sit dormant for years, they are effectively removed from the circulating supply. An awakening suggests these coins might re-enter the market, potentially impacting supply-demand dynamics. Market Sentiment: Whale movements can be perceived as indicators of market sentiment. A large transfer could signal an impending sell-off, creating fear (FUD), or it could be a reallocation, suggesting strategic positioning. The psychological impact on retail investors can be considerable. Historical Context and Mystery: Wallets from Bitcoin’s early days are often associated with its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, or early adopters. The awakening of such a wallet fuels speculation and adds a layer of intrigue to the market narrative. Was the owner truly dormant, or simply biding their time? On-Chain Insights: These movements provide valuable data for on-chain analysts. By tracking such transfers, analysts can gain insights into long-term holding patterns, potential distribution events, and the overall health of the network. The 14.5-year dormancy period places this wallet firmly in the category of ‘early adopter’ or ‘Satoshi-era’ addresses, making its recent activity all the more compelling for observers and investors alike. Decoding Dormant Wallets: Insights from On-Chain Analysis Understanding the behavior of a Bitcoin whale requires delving into the fascinating world of on-chain analysis. This discipline involves examining publicly available data on the blockchain to infer market trends and participant behavior. For dormant wallets, the analysis often focuses on: Age of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs): This tells analysts how long the coins in a specific address have remained untouched. A high age indicates long-term holding. Transaction Patterns: Is it a single large transfer or multiple smaller ones? Is it moving to an exchange, a new personal wallet, or a DeFi protocol? The destination can reveal intent. Associated Addresses: Are other dormant wallets waking up simultaneously? This could indicate a coordinated move by a single entity or group. When a wallet wakes up after such a long period, there are several common hypotheses: Lost Keys Found: The owner might have finally recovered access to their private keys after years of searching or through a technological breakthrough. Strategic Reallocation: The owner, after a long period of HODLing, might be moving funds to a more secure or liquid address, or preparing for a new investment. Estate Planning/Inheritance: In some cases, the original owner may have passed away, and their heirs are now accessing the funds. Testing the Waters: Before moving a larger sum, the owner might send a smaller amount (like 50 BTC) to ensure the address is functional and the transfer process is smooth. This is a common security practice for large holders. Preparing for Sale: While less common for such a small fraction of the total holdings, a transfer to an exchange could signal an intent to sell, though the current move to a ‘bc1q8c’ address suggests a personal wallet transfer rather than an immediate sale. The fact that only 50 BTC out of 3,963 BTC was moved strongly suggests a ‘testing the waters’ scenario or a strategic internal transfer, rather than an immediate intent to liquidate the entire holdings. What Are the Potential Market Impacts of This Bitcoin Whale Move? The immediate market reaction to a Bitcoin whale awakening can be varied and often driven by speculation. While 50 BTC is a substantial sum, it represents a tiny fraction of Bitcoin’s daily trading volume and circulating supply. Therefore, its direct impact on price is likely minimal. However, the psychological effect can be significant. Potential Impact Area Description Likelihood (for 50 BTC move) Price Volatility Increased short-term volatility due to speculation and fear of large sell-offs. Low to Moderate (given small % of total holdings moved) Market Sentiment Can shift from bullish to cautious, or even fearful, depending on perceived intent. Moderate (fuels discussion and analysis) Liquidity If more coins from the dormant address move to exchanges, it could increase liquidity. Low (50 BTC is not enough to significantly impact overall liquidity) On-Chain Scrutiny Increased focus on this address and similar dormant wallets by analysts and investors. High (already a major talking point) It’s crucial for investors to understand that one transaction, even from a historically significant wallet, does not dictate the entire market trend. Broader macroeconomic factors, institutional adoption, regulatory news, and overall market demand typically exert far greater influence on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. This particular move is more a fascinating puzzle piece in Bitcoin’s ongoing narrative than a direct market mover. Navigating the Crypto Seas: Actionable Insights for Investors For those navigating the often-turbulent waters of the crypto market, the awakening of a Bitcoin whale offers several valuable lessons and actionable insights: Stay Informed, Not Alarmed: While such news is exciting, avoid making rash decisions based on single on-chain events. Always cross-reference information from reputable sources and consider the broader market context. Embrace On-Chain Analysis: Learn the basics of on-chain metrics. Tools and analysts that track dormant wallets, exchange flows, and whale movements can provide a deeper understanding beyond price charts. This helps in forming a more informed perspective. Understand Proportionality: Always consider the size of the transaction relative to the total supply and daily trading volume. 50 BTC, while a lot for an individual, is a drop in the ocean for Bitcoin’s overall market. Focus on Long-Term Trends: Short-term whale movements are often noise. Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition is driven by its fundamental technology, network effects, and increasing adoption. Practice Prudent Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and have a clear investment strategy that isn’t swayed by every piece of breaking news. This event underscores the transparency of the blockchain and the enduring mystique of Bitcoin’s earliest days. It serves as a reminder that the digital ledger holds many secrets, waiting to be unveiled by diligent on-chain explorers. Conclusion: The Enduring Mystery of the Dormant Bitcoin Whale The recent awakening of a Bitcoin whale after 14.5 years of silence and the subsequent transfer of 50 BTC is a captivating chapter in Bitcoin’s history. It highlights the incredible journey of early adopters and the unique transparency offered by blockchain technology. While the exact reasons behind this specific move remain shrouded in mystery, it serves as a powerful reminder of the vast amounts of Bitcoin held in dormant wallets, and the potential for these long-held treasures to resurface. This event, though unlikely to cause significant market shifts on its own, certainly adds to the ongoing narrative of Bitcoin’s maturation and the intriguing stories etched into its immutable ledger. As on-chain analysts continue to monitor this address, the crypto community eagerly awaits any further activity that might shed more light on the intentions of this enigmatic early holder. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to significantly influence market prices if they were to buy or sell a substantial portion of their holdings. While there’s no official threshold, holdings in the thousands of BTC are generally considered whale-sized. Why are dormant Bitcoin wallets significant? Dormant Bitcoin wallets are significant because they represent a portion of Bitcoin’s total supply that has been out of circulation for a very long time. Their awakening can spark speculation about potential supply increases, market sentiment shifts, or even the recovery of ‘lost’ early coins, adding intrigue to Bitcoin’s history. How do on-chain analysts track Bitcoin whale movements? On-chain analysts track Bitcoin whale movements by examining publicly available data on the Bitcoin blockchain. They use specialized tools to identify large addresses, monitor their transaction history, track the age of coins (UTXOs), and follow funds as they move between addresses, exchanges, or DeFi protocols. Does a 50 BTC transfer from a dormant wallet impact Bitcoin’s price? While a 50 BTC transfer is a substantial sum for an individual, it is a relatively small amount compared to Bitcoin’s total circulating supply and daily trading volume. Therefore, a single transfer of this size from a dormant wallet is unlikely to cause a significant direct impact on Bitcoin’s price. Its primary effect is often psychological, fueling discussion and speculation within the crypto community. What could be the reasons for a Bitcoin whale to move coins after 14.5 years? Possible reasons include the owner finally recovering lost private keys, moving funds to a more secure or modern address (like a SegWit address), preparing for strategic reallocation or inheritance, or simply testing the functionality of the wallet before potentially moving larger sums. It’s often not an immediate intent to sell, especially if only a small fraction of the total holdings is moved. Share this fascinating story with your network!

Located at the country’s 7 hotspots, DTMs employ DaWinKS’s trusted and true passport-scanning technology used at the airport’s immigration in Korea to ensure quick and reliable transactions. Kaia DLT Foundation (Kaia) announced that DaWinKS, a blockchain-based fintech company, supports Kaia-issued USDT on its Digital ATMs (DTM) installed across major travel spots in South Korea. In direct response to travellers and K-culture enthusiasts heading to the country, this offline on/offramp service enables cash withdrawals in real-world currencies from their Kaia USDT deposit or issues a prepaid transit card. DaWinKS ATM complete on-site KYC DTMs feature KYC methods based on DaWinKS’s passport- and face-scanning authentication solutions used at airport immigration in Korea. After completing KYC and scanning barcodes and QR codes, users can withdraw digital assets or issue a prepaid card in 85 legal currencies from 15 countries. Any remaining cash can also be exchanged for USD upon departure from the country. Digital assets are converted into real currency based on the daily exchange rate. Kaia USDT-enabled DTMs are available at seven key locations across South Korea: NSeoul Tower, Homeplus (Hapjeong and CentumCity), Lotte Mart (Gwangbok), LIFEWORK Mega Store Myeongdong, Myeongdong Money Club, and NamDaeMun Exchange Café. The service is also expanding to major Lotte Mart branches nationwide. 1 Though the service is currently available only to foreigners, domestic consumers will also be able to access it within this year. Kaia expands the usability of stablecoins DTMs have been supporting three types of digital assets—Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT—since the end of last year. Beyond supporting the native Kaia USDT, the two companies are also working on adding $KAIA to the DTM’s service boundaries. “DaWinKS is expanding the usability of stablecoins based on its experience in various fintech services, from currency exchange to cryptocurrency ATMs and QR payments,” said DaWinKS CEO Jong-myeong Lee. “The collaboration with Kaia, which partners with major Web3 and fintech companies such as Tether and LINE NEXT to expand the practical usability of stablecoins across Asia, will be of great help in DTM’s global expansion.” DaWinKS operates a digital ATM that provides direct foreign currency exchange, tax refund (city refund), and overseas remittance (custody) services for 89 legal currencies in 17 countries through non-face-to-face KYC (self-verification) fintech technology that combines ID (passport) recognition and AI facial authentication. In particular, DaWinKS provides various conveniences to foreign tourists through its own Digital ATM (DTM), Crypto ATM (CTM), QR Pay and POS, passport scanner, and other advanced blockchain-based fintech services. These services operate non-face-to-face digital ATM foreign exchange services in major domestic commercial districts, and provide prepaid transportation card (Kona DTK Card) services with Kona and tax refund services with Global Tax Free, further enhancing convenience for foreign users. “The collaboration with DaWinKS marks a significant milestone in expanding the real-world use cases of Kaia network’s native USDT and local stablecoins that will be launched on Kaia, said Dr. Sam Seo, Chairman of Kaia DLT Foundation. “We expect the demand for cross-border exchanges, deposits, and withdrawals to grow as consumer perception improves, and we will work together to expand DTM services both domestically and internationally.” Kaia is a high performance public blockchain that brings Web3 to the fingertips of hundreds of millions across Asia. Formed through the merger of the Klaytn and Finschia blockchains that were initially developed by Kakao and LINE respectively, Kaia is Asia’s largest Web3 ecosystem integrated with the Kakaotalk and LINE messengers that have a combined user base of over 250 million – all of whom can experience Web3 with the ease and speed of Web2 within their favourite messenger superapp to connect, create, collaborate, and contribute to the ecosystem.

While Ripple (XRP) battles to hold its ground, a wave of under-the-radar tokens priced under $0.50 is gearing up for what could be the top summer breakout of 2025. Among them, are Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA). Mutuum Finance costs $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. The price will increase by 14.29% to $0.04 in the following phase. The investors who invest now are guaranteed a 71.43% return on investment when the project hits the launch price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance has sold over $13.7 million and has recorded over $14,600 investors. Cardano (ADA) Navigates $0.83 – $0.85 Range Amid Bullish Signals Cardano is currently trading at $0.84, showing strength after climbing from early‑July lows near $0.62 and breaking out of a multi‑month descending channel. Momentum indicators and a recent technical breakout have analysts targeting resistance zones around $0.88–$0.90. With bullish scenarios projecting ADA could reach $1.00 to $2.00 by year‑end, ecosystem growth and institutional adoption continue. On the downside, failure to reclaim the $0.80–$0.83 zone could expose ADA to retracement toward $0.75–$0.70 support bands. All of this unfolds even as interest increasingly shifts toward emerging DeFi tokens like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum as Phase 6 Goes Live Mutuum Finance is making waves in presale, selling out the 5th phase before time. The project is already in phase 6 at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is pioneering the DeFi space by creating a scalable financial system with real-world uses. The presale has on board more than 14,600 token holders and raised more than $13.7 million. CertiK-Powered Bug Bounty Boosts DeFi Security In further efforts towards providing its transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The project team will reward a maximum of $50,000 USDT to those who identify likely vulnerabilities in the project. The purpose of the bounty program is to have a right coverage of all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is partitioned into the four severity classes; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also reflects the team’s commitment towards the security of ecosystem as well as investors’ trust. Next-Gen Dual-Lending Solutions Mutuum Finance is a top DeFi platform wherein the users are still in full control of their assets. The platform employs a double-lending process to provide flexibility as well as the effectiveness which entails Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract employs self-executing smart contracts that carry out the lending automatically with no human intervention. They are programmed to respond to changing market prices based on a floating rate of interest governed by the then-existing demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates the intermediaries and stands a possibility of being directly linked with borrowers and lenders. It is more common in meme coins like Pepe Coin because it stands a possibility of having specific terms of a loan and adaptability based on the willingness of a user and his or her willingness to take risk. $100,000 Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance has also organized a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will be given $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The giveaway is a testament to how the project is committed to building a long-term and dedicated community. Mutuum Finance has already secured $13.7 million in funding from over 14,600 investors, showing strong early conviction as Phase 6 of its presale surges ahead at $0.035. The next stage will lift the price by 14.29% to $0.04, with a guaranteed 71.43% ROI for those who enter before the token lists at $0.06.

While Bitcoin, which has been in a cooling period after the last ATH, continues to trade in a narrow range, it is stated that Bitcoin's implied volatility index (BVIV) has fallen to its lowest level since September 2023. Experts stated that this situation indicates a bullish potential in Bitcoin, citing previous data. At this point, experts pointed out that the BVIV index last reached its lowest level in September 2023, and reported that on this date, BTC started at approximately $ 26,000 and then doubled in price, increasing by almost 50%. According to the data, the 30-day implied volatility index (BVIV) for BTC has fallen to 40.84, falling below the threshold of 45. Historically, this zone has signaled periods of accumulation or local bottoms, followed by strong upward movements. Moreover, since the second half of 2022, when the BVIV remained below the 45 level at the weekly close, BTC prices have generally shown an upward trend. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could once again be preparing the ground for another upward breakout, according to the BVIV indicator. Finally, Glassnode reported that even short-term investors (STH) in the market are holding their Bitcoin, not selling it. The Market Value/Realized Value (MVRV) ratio for short-term investors currently stands at 1.19, below the cycle peak of 1.33 recorded in November 2024. This suggests that investors are avoiding speculative risk, preferring to wait for further gains rather than exit the market for small profits. *This is not investment advice.

This pivotal decision, effective July 30, signals renewed confidence in the popular decentralized perpetual exchange token and marks a crucial moment for its community. What does this mean for GMX crypto holders and the broader market? Let’s dive in. Understanding the GMX Crypto Investment Warning: What Was At Stake? For many investors, an ‘investment warning’ from a major exchange like Bithumb can be a cause for concern. These warnings are typically issued when a digital asset faces certain issues that could pose risks to traders. These issues might include: Liquidity Concerns: Insufficient trading volume or depth, making it difficult for users to buy or sell without significant price impact. Technical Instability: Problems with the blockchain network, smart contracts, or the project’s underlying technology. Regulatory or Compliance Issues: Potential non-adherence to local or international financial regulations. Lack of Transparency: Insufficient communication from the project team regarding development, tokenomics, or governance. Market Manipulation Risks: Suspected activities that could artificially inflate or deflate the token’s price. The GMX crypto , known for its innovative decentralized perpetual exchange model, found itself under such scrutiny. An investment warning often limits certain activities, like deposits, which can severely impact a token’s accessibility and perceived stability on the exchange. This is why the resolution of these concerns is a significant positive. The Resolution Revealed: Why Bithumb Greenlit GMX Crypto Again? Bithumb’s official announcement clearly stated that the previously identified concerns regarding GMX crypto had been resolved. This resolution aligns with the stringent monitoring standards set by the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA). DAXA is a self-regulatory body in South Korea comprising the country’s five major crypto exchanges – Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax. Its primary role is to enhance investor protection and ensure market integrity. While the specific details of the resolved concerns were not publicly itemized by Bithumb, such resolutions typically involve a project team actively addressing the identified deficiencies. This could mean: Enhanced Communication: Improved transparency and regular updates from the GMX team. Technical Upgrades: Implementation of fixes or improvements to the GMX protocol to ensure stability and security. Improved Liquidity Measures: Steps taken to ensure sufficient market depth and trading volume on the exchange. Compliance Reinforcement: Demonstrating adherence to DAXA’s guidelines and broader regulatory expectations. The lifting of the warning means that deposits for GMX crypto are scheduled to resume at 09:00 UTC on July 30, paving the way for renewed trading activity and increased confidence among Bithumb users. GMX Crypto ‘s Resurgence: Impact on Investors and the Broader Market This positive development for GMX crypto carries significant implications for its existing holders and the wider cryptocurrency market: Benefits for GMX Crypto Holders: Increased Confidence: The removal of the warning by a reputable exchange like Bithumb sends a strong signal of legitimacy and stability. This can help restore and boost investor trust in the token. Enhanced Liquidity: With deposits resuming, more users can bring their GMX tokens onto Bithumb, potentially increasing trading volume and market depth. This can lead to tighter spreads and easier execution of trades. Wider Accessibility: For traders who rely on Bithumb, GMX becomes fully accessible again, potentially attracting new investors to the ecosystem. Potential Price Appreciation: Positive news often correlates with upward price movement in the crypto market. The lifting of the warning could lead to a short-term price surge as confidence returns and new capital flows in. Broader Market Implications: Regulatory Clarity: This incident highlights the ongoing efforts of exchanges and self-regulatory bodies like DAXA to ensure a safer trading environment. It shows that projects can work with exchanges to resolve issues. Precedent Setting: The successful resolution for GMX crypto could serve as a case study for other projects facing similar warnings, demonstrating that proactive engagement with exchanges can lead to positive outcomes. Market Maturation: Such events underscore the increasing maturity of the crypto market, where projects are held accountable for their performance and compliance. Actionable Insights for Investors: While the news is positive, prudent investors should always exercise caution: Monitor Price Action: Observe how GMX’s price reacts post-announcement. Volatility can still be expected. Conduct Due Diligence: Even with the warning lifted, understanding GMX’s fundamentals, its role in DeFi, and future development plans remains crucial. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio is always a wise strategy. Beyond the Warning: The Future of GMX Crypto and Regulatory Trends The resolution of the investment warning on GMX crypto is more than just a single event; it’s a testament to the evolving dynamics between crypto projects, exchanges, and regulatory bodies. In South Korea, DAXA plays a vital role in fostering a secure and transparent digital asset market. Its proactive monitoring and the exchanges’ adherence to its standards are crucial for building investor trust and promoting responsible innovation. For GMX crypto itself, this development opens new avenues for growth and adoption, particularly within the South Korean market. It reinforces the project’s commitment to compliance and stability, which are increasingly important factors for institutional and retail investors alike. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, we can expect to see more such instances where projects and exchanges collaborate to address concerns, ultimately leading to a more robust and trustworthy ecosystem. The lifting of the investment warning on GMX crypto by Bithumb is undoubtedly a significant win for the token and its community. It underscores the importance of proactive compliance and robust project development in navigating the complex world of digital assets. As deposits resume, GMX stands poised for renewed growth and enhanced investor confidence, reinforcing its position as a key player in the decentralized finance space. This event serves as a powerful reminder that accountability and transparency are paramount for sustained success in the ever-evolving crypto market.

But few fully grasp what such a valuation would truly signify. At that price point, XRP’s market cap would exceed $500 billion , potentially surpassing Ethereum This kind of explosive move would likely come only with massive institutional integration—triggered by factors such as spot ETF approvals , global settlement partnerships, and formal adoption by central banks or remittance giants. In parallel, community driven altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are seeing big growth in participation as traders seek alternative potential. Regulatory clarity remains the biggest hurdle While Ripple’s partial victory against the SECmarked a turning point, full regulatory clarity remains elusive. Any sustained move toward $10 would likely require a clear legal path for XRP in the U.S. and other major markets. Institutional capital typically waits for structure—and a green light from regulators could unlock massive inflows into Ripple’s payment ecosystem. However, a rapid price surge could also spark renewed scrutiny. With retail investors piling in during parabolic moves, regulators may view sudden volatility as a cause for concern, especially given XRP’s complex history with securities law. Balancing mainstream adoption with compliance will be crucial. Viral altcoin presale draws in new wave of traders While XRP focuses on clearing regulatory hurdles, another crypto project is capturing attention for very different reasons. MAGACOIN FINANCE just posted a historic day for investor participation, with its latest presale round selling out faster than any previous stage. On-chain analysts cite explosive referral growt h, active engagement, and viral traction on X as driving forces. What separates this altcoin is its no-vesting policy and retail-first approach. Unlike legacy tokens weighed down by VC allocations, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its community from the ground up—appealing to users looking for fast access and momentum. The ongoing presale momentum suggests growing appetite for early-stage tokens that operate outside traditional institutional frameworks. Ripple effect across the altcoin market If XRP rallies toward $10, the impact could extend well beyond Ripple holders. Historically, when major tokens experience parabolic gains, early investors often rotate profits into smaller-cap assets with higher growth potential. This pattern has defined previous bull cycles, sparking renewed momentum in adjacent ecosystems. Infrastructure-focused altcoins like Stellar (XLM), Algorand (ALGO), and Quant (QNT) may benefit from renewed attention. At the same time, newer presale tokens with viral traction and strong community engagement could attract a wave of new capital which will drive the price up . For many traders, this rotation represents the best chance to catch early-stage exponential upside. Conclusion Reaching $10 would mark more than a technical milestone for XRP—it would symbolize crypto’s deeper integration into global finance. But the path there demands infrastructure maturity, institutional trust, and legal clarity. As that journey unfolds, many investors are also watching fast-moving presales with potential to define the next bull wave . With historic participation levels already recorded, some analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE’s trajectory could rival early-stage legends in the current cycle.

Price Analysis and Insights,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/bitcoin-btc-breakout-imminent-this-week-price-analysis-and-insights,"Bitcoin (BTC) is still flirting with the top of a bull flag and trend suggests that a breakout could come as soon as this week. If the breakout occurs, where could Bitcoin head to next? A message to hold strong Michael Saylor, Chairman of Strategy, announced another huge Bitcoin purchase for his company on Tuesday. This time, it was 21,021 BTC for a price of $2.46 billion. Before announcing the purchase, Saylor put out an X post with an image of himself dressed as a cowboy on a horse. The statement with the image reads: “The cowards never started, and the weak died along the way.” This quote is popularly attributed to a historic migration route in the 19th century, called the Oregon Trail. It was also used in more recent history by the Nike founder Phil Knight in his book Shoe Dog. Here it was employed to galvanize the Nike team during a particularly challenging time. By utilising this gritty message from another era, Saylor is perhaps attempting to get the average retail investor to gird their loins and hang in there as far as Bitcoin is concerned. He is potentially saying that the “cowards” are those who can’t bring themselves to jump across from the fiat/banking world and into the transactional freedom of Bitcoin. He is also perhaps labelling the “weak” as those who couldn’t hang on to their Bitcoin and who sold on any of the market downturns. On the other hand, Saylor portrays himself as a dogged cowboy who endures until the end of the trail, made stronger by the experience and gifted by the rewards of rich land. While some might sneer and say that this just an effort at self-agrandizement, and although there is very little in common with a Bitcoin investor and a hard-bitten trail blazer in an extremely unforgiving environment, the message is clear - hold on through the volatile ups and downs of the market, and your reward could be great. $BTC breakout in one to three days Source: TradingView The $BTC chart pattern is continuing to evolve. While the price bounces around inside the bull flag, a trend line that stretches from price action inside the previous bull flag is perhaps corralling the price into a narrowing space. If the price continues to respect this trendline, a breakout should come within the next one to three days. In this case, it might not be the breakout of the bull flag, as the price could drop through the trendline and continue to go sideways. Measured move to $128,000 Source: TradingView The daily chart for $BTC shows the measured move of the breakout should this come to pass. It would take the price up to just above $128,000, potentially opening the route to $150,000 and beyond. However, if this trendline does not hold up, and the price falls back down to the bottom trendline of the bull flag, it could retest the 50-day SMA (blue line) and then be in prime position for an even stronger impulse to the upside. The Stochastic RSI on the daily time frame has the indicator lines bouncing along the bottom, ready to angle up and signal an increase in upside price momentum for the breakout. Concerns for the longer term momentum indicators? Source: TradingView With the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators now showing a cross-down from the top, some might be worrying that this could be signalling the end of this long period of upside price action. Also, with the 2-week Stochastic RSI indicators starting to get near the top, even more concern might be registering. However, one only has to look left to see that in 2023 the indicators stayed at the top for nearly six months, while at the end of 2023 and into 2024, the indicators were at the top for around three months. All one needs to know is that at least for the time being, the trend is still up, and there is likely to be more price appreciation over these next three to four months. After that things become a lot more uncertain, but with a possible blow-off top in the coming weeks, this should be plenty to concentrate on. Of course, like Michael Saylor, if you are in this for the next several years at least, this is all just noise. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Trading volumes on Kraken-listed XRP perpetuals have topped $3.48 billion this month, outpacing the Solana token's tally of $3.23 billion, Kraken told CoinDesk. The exchange listed the XRP perpetual futures in 2022. XRP has also stolen the show in terms of price performance. The payments-focused cryptocurrency's price has surged over 40% this month, hitting a record high of $3.66. Meanwhile, programmable blockchain Solana's SOL has risen only 17% to $181, CoinDesk data show. Commenting on the volume, Alexia Theodorou, the head of derivatives at Kraken, said that it's a clear reflection of renewed optimism around XRP. ""It's driven by growing market confidence following the SEC lawsuit resolution and reinforced by the election of a more crypto-friendly administration,"" Theodorou told CoinDesk. ""XRP has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pro-crypto momentum shift in the U.S., with the spot price climbing from around $0.50 right before the election to a new ATH."" He added that XRP has become a key focal point for traders speculating on the trajectory of the broader crypto market. Solana rules in open interest XRP has consistently been larger than SOL in terms of market capitalization. Currently, XRP boasts a market value of $184 billion, almost double SOL's $97 billion. Still, open interest in XRP futures remains smaller than SOL, suggesting a dominance of holders in the XRP market and more speculation in SOL. Open interest refers to the number of active or open contracts at a given time. As of the time of writing, cumulative open interest in Kraken-listed SOL/USDT and SOL/USD pairs was roughly $55 million versus XRP's $34 million, according to data source Coinglass. The global open interest in XRP was $8.53 billion, trailing SOL's $10.69 billion. Bitcoin and ether were market leaders, with $83 billion and $55 billion in open interest.

Swiss crypto bank Sygnum Bank has just released its Q3 2025 Investment Outlook, and their insights suggest something many crypto enthusiasts have been eagerly anticipating: the long-awaited altcoin season . This isn’t just wishful thinking; Sygnum’s report points to several concrete factors that could ignite a significant rally for alternative cryptocurrencies, moving beyond Bitcoin’s recent dominance. Let’s dive into the details and explore what could be driving this potential market transformation. What’s Fueling the Anticipated Altcoin Season? Sygnum Bank’s optimistic outlook for an impending altcoin season is built on a foundation of three key pillars: improved regulatory clarity, growing liquidity across the crypto ecosystem, and a noticeable surge in on-chain activity. These elements are creating a fertile ground for altcoins to thrive, potentially leading to a period where they outperform Bitcoin. Improved Regulatory Clarity One of the most significant hurdles for mainstream adoption and institutional investment in the crypto space has always been regulatory uncertainty. However, Sygnum’s report highlights a positive shift. As governments and financial bodies worldwide work towards clearer guidelines for digital assets, the environment becomes more predictable and secure for investors. This clarity encourages more capital to flow into the market, not just into established assets like Bitcoin, but also into a broader range of altcoins that can now operate with greater confidence. This reduction in regulatory risk makes the entire market, especially the altcoin sector, more appealing to both retail and institutional participants. Growing Liquidity and Institutional Inflows The crypto market is seeing an unprecedented influx of capital, signaling robust growth in liquidity. A prime example is the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have collectively topped an astounding $160 billion in assets. While these ETFs primarily focus on Bitcoin, their very existence and success pave the way for similar products for other major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum. Indeed, Ethereum has already witnessed record ETF inflows, demonstrating a broadening institutional appetite beyond just Bitcoin. This increasing liquidity means there’s more capital available to be deployed across various digital assets, setting the stage for a potential altcoin season where funds rotate into promising projects. Rising On-Chain Activity Beyond price movements, the underlying activity on blockchain networks provides a crucial indicator of health and adoption. Sygnum’s report notes a significant uptick in on-chain engagement. For instance, following the Pectra upgrade, a remarkable 30% of Ethereum’s liquid supply is now staked. This indicates strong conviction among holders and a reduced selling pressure, as assets are locked up to secure the network and earn rewards. Furthermore, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have achieved a record 30% market share, processing $530 billion in volumes. This shift from centralized exchanges to DEXs underscores a growing preference for decentralized trading, often involving a wide array of altcoins. Similarly, decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols have seen their total value locked (TVL) soar past $70 billion, showcasing a vibrant ecosystem of financial applications built on blockchain technology. These metrics collectively suggest a healthy, active, and growing ecosystem, ripe for an altcoin season . Why Does Bitcoin Dominance Matter for an Altcoin Season? The concept of ‘Bitcoin dominance’ is crucial when discussing an altcoin season . Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. When Bitcoin dominance is high, it typically means capital is primarily concentrated in BTC. However, Sygnum’s report, as noted by Cointelegraph, reveals that Bitcoin (BTC) dominance has fallen more than 6% in a single month. This decline is a key signal that capital is beginning to rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. Historically, a decreasing Bitcoin dominance often precedes or accompanies an altcoin season . It suggests that investors, having secured profits or gained confidence from Bitcoin’s performance, are now seeking higher returns by investing in altcoins. These alternative cryptocurrencies, especially those with smaller market caps, often have greater potential for explosive growth during such periods. The rotation of capital indicates a maturing market where investors are increasingly comfortable exploring the broader crypto landscape beyond just the flagship digital asset. Beyond the Hype: Real-World Use Cases and DeFi’s Role in Altcoin Season One of the most compelling aspects highlighted by Sygnum is that capital is increasingly rotating into projects with tangible real-world use cases. This shift signifies a maturation of the crypto market, moving beyond speculative trading to value fundamental utility. The growth in DeFi lending, which has topped $70 billion, and the record market share of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with $530 billion in volumes, are strong indicators of this trend. These platforms are not just theoretical concepts; they are functional applications providing financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading in a decentralized manner. During an altcoin season driven by utility, projects focused on solving real-world problems – whether in supply chain, identity, gaming, or finance – are likely to attract significant investment. Investors are becoming more discerning, looking for projects with strong development teams, clear roadmaps, and a demonstrable ability to deliver value. This focus on utility over pure speculation is a healthy sign for the long-term sustainability of the altcoin market and could lead to more stable and significant gains for well-vetted projects. Navigating the Potential Altcoin Season: What to Consider? While the prospect of an altcoin season is exciting, it’s crucial to approach it with a strategic mindset. The altcoin market can be volatile, and not all projects will succeed. Here are some actionable insights and considerations: Thorough Research is Key: Before investing, delve deep into a project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and community. Understand its value proposition and how it aims to solve a problem. Look for strong fundamentals rather than just hype. Diversification: Instead of putting all your capital into one altcoin, consider diversifying across several promising projects. This can help mitigate risk and capture broader market gains. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market, especially altcoins, can experience significant price swings. Have a clear exit strategy and consider setting stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Keep up-to-date with market news, technological advancements, and regulatory changes that could impact your investments. Follow reputable sources and analysts. Understand Market Cycles: While an altcoin season suggests upward movement, markets are cyclical. Be prepared for corrections and understand that not every altcoin will reach its all-time high again. The insights from Sygnum Bank offer a compelling narrative for the potential unfolding of an altcoin season . By focusing on projects with strong fundamentals and real-world utility, and by practicing diligent risk management, investors can position themselves to potentially benefit from this exciting phase of the crypto market. Conclusion: The Dawn of a New Altcoin Era? Sygnum Bank’s Q3 2025 Investment Outlook paints a compelling picture of a crypto market on the cusp of a significant shift. The convergence of improved regulatory clarity, an influx of liquidity through ETFs and institutional interest, and a surge in on-chain activity — from Ethereum staking to record DEX volumes and DeFi lending – creates a powerful confluence of factors. These indicators suggest that the conditions are ripe for a long-awaited altcoin season , where capital rotates from Bitcoin into a diverse array of alternative cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and real-world utility. While the excitement is palpable, a cautious and well-researched approach remains paramount. The potential for explosive growth in the altcoin sector is undeniable, but it comes with inherent risks. By understanding the underlying drivers, staying informed, and employing sound investment strategies, participants can navigate this potentially transformative period. The future of the crypto market appears increasingly diversified, with altcoins poised to play a more prominent role, potentially ushering in a new era of innovation and investment opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is an “altcoin season”? An “altcoin season” is a period in the cryptocurrency market when altcoins (all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) significantly outperform Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation. It’s often characterized by a decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance as capital rotates into these alternative assets. Q2: What factors are contributing to the potential altcoin season, according to Sygnum Bank? Sygnum Bank identifies three primary factors: improved regulatory clarity, growing liquidity (including successful Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs), and rising on-chain activity such as increased Ethereum staking, record decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, and growth in DeFi lending. Q3: How does Bitcoin dominance falling impact the altcoin market? A fall in Bitcoin dominance typically indicates that investors are moving capital out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. This shift in capital allocation can drive up the prices of altcoins, signaling the beginning or continuation of an altcoin season . Q4: Are all altcoins expected to perform well during an altcoin season? While many altcoins may see price increases during an altcoin season , it’s crucial to understand that not all projects will succeed. Sygnum’s report emphasizes that capital is increasingly rotating into projects with real-world use cases, suggesting that altcoins with strong fundamentals and utility are likely to perform best. Q5: What should investors consider before investing in altcoins during this period? Investors should prioritize thorough research into a project’s fundamentals, diversify their portfolios, practice strong risk management (only invest what you can afford to lose), and stay informed about market developments and regulatory changes. Understanding market cycles is also important. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

MARA Holdings delivered a standout second quarter, with revenue rising 64% year-over-year to $238 million—beating analyst estimates of $223.7 million. This also marked a notable improvement from its Q1 revenue of $214 million. The company’s net income saw a dramatic jump, surging to $808 million compared to a net loss of nearly $200 million during the same period last year. How Did MARA Revenue Soar? The sharp rise in profit was primarily attributed to an unrealized $1.2 billion gain from Bitcoin’s appreciation. Over the three-month period ending June 30, Bitcoin rose 31%, substantially boosting MARA’s balance sheet value. Following the earnings announcement, MARA’s stock jumped as much as 7.5% in after-hours trading to a high of $17.82 before settling at $17.22. Despite closing regular trading hours on Tuesday 3.2% lower at $16.61, MARA shares have gained 58% since mid-April, though they’ve remained largely range-bound over the past several months. Second-Largest Corporate Bitcoin Holder Eyes AI Integration MARA also revealed a major milestone in its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. As of the end of Q2, the company held 49,951 BTC—up 170% year-over-year—valued at approximately $5.3 billion. Post-quarter, this figure has crossed the 50,000 BTC mark, positioning MARA as the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin . The company trails only Strategy, which holds 607,770 BTC worth around $71 billion. Operationally, MARA mined 2,358 BTC in Q2, a 3% increase from the previous quarter. Its energized hashrate rose to 57.4 exahashes per second (EH/s), up from 54.3 EH/s in Q1. The company aims to reach 75 EH/s by the end of the year. MARA announced partnerships with TAE Power Solutions (backed by Google) and PADO AI (supported by LG) to develop energy-efficient platforms for future AI infrastructure. The company is betting on the convergence of mining, energy, and AI to fuel its next phase of growth. “MARA’s diversified strategy—from mining scale and treasury management to energy partnerships and AI investment—is positioning us for sustained success,” said CEO Fred Thiel.

In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

AVAX failed to break above $27 breakout, triggering profit-taking and short setups. AVAX mirrored sector weakness. XRP, SOL, and ADA fell 3-5% as traders reduced leveraged positions. Friday’s U.S. jobs data and August 1 tariff deadlines amplified caution. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView Last month, AVAX attempted a recovery, which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to a high of $27.38. It faced strong resistance at its 3-day macro supply zone ($27.00-$27.38), a level that triggered 3 rejections since March 2025. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility is rising.

Technical analysis suggests that Avalanche is bullish, but the overextension of the technicals has forced a market correction. Fed rate decision anxiety (July 30-31) drove risk-off moves in altcoins, contributing to AVAX’s drop. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50?

According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

As ADA catches the $0.8016 and DOGE sits at $0.2300, the hype is actually surrounding a project gem that’s climbing and picking up serious steam— Remittix (RTX). Cardano, Dogecoin Still Bothering Whales Crypto whales are not just buying Lambos, they are accumulating Cardano, Dogecoin, and a handful of low gas fee cryptocurrency assets. According to recent reports, both currencies are seeing higher accumulation, even when ADA dropped by 3.52% and DOGE dropped by 4.7%. Cardano boasts a market capitalization of $28.38 Billion with over $1.17 Billion traded on a daily basis, showing tremendous staying power compared to Layer 1 blockchain rivals. Dogecoin boasts an even $34.57 Billion market capitalization and over $2.57 Billion traded on a daily basis, fueled partly by its popularity as a meme and celebrity endorsements. But as these old coins keep making the headlines, savvy investors are turning to the next altcoin to watch in 2025. Remittix Is Quietly Stealing the Spotlight Although it may not yet be as well-known as a name like Cardano or Dogecoin, Remittix (RTX) is quietly gaining traction. The cryptocurrency’s exclusive focus on worldwide payments, fiat exchange, and real-world application has established it as a top player in the next 100x crypto conversation. Remittix makes it possible to send crypto to bank accounts in 30+ countries—unifying the daily economy and DeFi. It’s not a vision map. Remittix Wallet beta will launch in Q3 2025 with live FX rates crypto-to-fiat payments. Growth figures are impressive too: Over $17.6 million raised 574 Million+ tokens sold Current presale price: $0.0876 $250,000 Remittix Giveaway is ongoing Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum Real Utility: Send crypto to 30+ fiat currencies in minutes Integrated FX: Live exchange rates within the wallet Secure & Audited: Smart contracts audited by CertiK Massive Presale: $17.6 million + already raised 50% Bonus: Active while the soft cap is reached In contrast to hype coins or meme coins, Remittix is solving a $19 trillion real-world problem: cross-border payments. This is not merely some low cap crypto gem but a crypto with utility—ideal for freelancers, global earners, and early-stage crypto investors. Crypto Search Trends Favor Real-World Projects The crypto ecosystem is filled with the next big crypto launch and best crypto project 2025 chatter. But few are based on hard infrastructure such as Remittix. As centralized exchanges crack down on limitations and DeFi projects are plagued by gas fees, RTX is a cross-chain DeFi project that puts usability first. Interest is piling up rapidly from crypto staking groups, decentralized exchange fans, and even passive income potential searching cryptos. With whales loading and the soft cap close at hand, momentum is clearly in Remittix’s favor.

This isn’t just another headline; it’s a pivotal moment signaling Japan’s deepening embrace of digital assets and a significant step towards their institutional integration. For anyone invested in the future of finance, the implications of the Osaka Exchange crypto derivatives push are profound. Why are Osaka Exchange Crypto Derivatives a Game Changer? This move by the Osaka Exchange isn’t happening in a vacuum. It reflects a global shift where major financial institutions are increasingly recognizing the legitimacy and potential of cryptocurrencies. CEO Ryosuke Yokoyama’s statement underscores a strategic intent to align Japan with international regulatory trends and market innovations. What makes this development particularly impactful for Osaka Exchange crypto derivatives ? Legitimization: It brings cryptocurrencies further into mainstream finance, enhancing their credibility among traditional investors. Institutional Capital: It opens doors for large-scale investment from hedge funds, asset managers, and other institutional players who often require regulated products. Market Maturity: The introduction of sophisticated financial instruments like derivatives contributes to a more mature and robust digital asset market. Regulatory Clarity: It provides a clearer and safer framework for participation, potentially reducing risks associated with unregulated crypto platforms. What Exactly are Crypto Derivatives and ETFs, and Why Do They Matter? Before diving deeper into the Osaka Exchange’s plans, let’s clarify what we mean by cryptocurrency derivatives and ETFs. These are not direct investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but rather financial instruments whose value is derived from these underlying assets. Cryptocurrency Futures: These are agreements to buy or sell a crypto asset at a predetermined price on a future date. They allow investors to speculate on price movements or hedge existing positions without owning the actual cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency Options: These give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a crypto asset at a specific price by a certain date. They offer flexibility and leverage, allowing for more nuanced trading strategies. Cryptocurrency ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds): These are investment funds traded on traditional stock exchanges, holding crypto assets or crypto-related derivatives. They provide a regulated and accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly managing digital wallets or navigating complex crypto exchanges. These instruments are crucial because they offer: Risk Management: Provide hedging tools for existing crypto holdings against price volatility. Price Discovery: Contribute to more efficient and transparent pricing mechanisms in the crypto market. Liquidity: Enhance market depth and trading volumes, making it easier to enter and exit positions. Accessibility: Lower barriers for traditional investors and institutions who prefer to operate within regulated frameworks. Global Trends Paving the Way for Osaka Exchange Crypto Derivatives The Osaka Exchange isn’t charting entirely new waters; it’s learning from and contributing to a growing global trend. Several major economies have already taken significant steps in integrating Osaka Exchange crypto derivatives and ETFs into their regulated financial systems. These international precedents provide valuable insights and blueprints. United States: The launch of Bitcoin futures by CME Group years ago, and more recently, the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC, have been monumental. These approvals have opened the floodgates for institutional capital, providing regulated avenues for exposure to digital assets. Europe: Various European exchanges and financial institutions have listed crypto ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) and futures, demonstrating a proactive approach to digital asset integration within existing regulatory frameworks. Canada: Was an early adopter of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, providing valuable insights into their market performance and investor reception, often ahead of its southern neighbor. These international models provide the Osaka Exchange with a robust framework for navigating regulatory complexities, ensuring investor protection, and fostering market integrity. By reviewing these successful implementations, Japan can tailor a framework that best suits its unique market dynamics while upholding global standards of financial stability and transparency. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Japan’s Digital Asset Market? While the prospect of Osaka Exchange crypto derivatives is exciting, the path forward isn’t without its complexities. Japan has historically been a leader in crypto regulation, being one of the first countries to recognize Bitcoin as legal property, which positions it uniquely to lead in this evolving space. Challenges: Regulatory Nuances: Crafting regulations that balance innovation with robust investor protection in a volatile and rapidly evolving asset class remains a delicate act. Market Volatility: Managing the inherent price swings of cryptocurrencies within a derivatives framework requires sophisticated risk management systems and clear guidelines. Technological Infrastructure: Ensuring robust, scalable, and secure systems for trading, clearing, and settlement of crypto derivatives is paramount. Investor Education: Educating both institutional and retail investors about the risks and rewards of these complex products is crucial for responsible market participation. Opportunities: Innovation Hub: Solidifying Japan’s position as a leader in financial technology and digital assets, especially within the Asian market. Capital Inflow: Attracting significant domestic and international institutional investment that has been waiting for regulated access to crypto. New Revenue Streams: For the exchange itself and for various market participants, including brokers, custodians, and technology providers. Enhanced Liquidity: Creating deeper and more robust crypto markets that can absorb larger trades with less price impact. The careful evaluation by CEO Ryosuke Yokoyama and his team signifies a thoughtful and strategic approach, aiming to leverage these opportunities while meticulously mitigating potential risks. Actionable Insights for Investors and Institutions For individual investors, this development means increased accessibility and potentially more sophisticated ways to engage with the crypto market through regulated channels. It could lead to a broader array of investment products becoming available on traditional brokerage platforms. For financial institutions, it presents new avenues for product development, client services, and portfolio diversification. Banks, asset managers, and wealth advisors will likely explore how to integrate these new offerings into their existing services, meeting growing client demand for digital asset exposure. And for the broader crypto ecosystem, it’s a powerful validation of its growing significance in the global financial landscape. Keep a close eye on the regulatory announcements from Japan; they could set new precedents for other nations considering similar moves, further accelerating global institutional adoption of digital assets. Conclusion The Osaka Exchange’s deep dive into cryptocurrency derivatives and ETFs marks a monumental stride for Japan and the global financial sector. It underscores a growing consensus that digital assets are here to stay and will increasingly integrate into traditional finance. This strategic exploration by the Japan Exchange Group is not just about new products; it’s about shaping the future of finance, fostering innovation, and ensuring Japan remains at the forefront of the evolving digital economy. The potential for the Osaka Exchange crypto derivatives to unlock unprecedented institutional engagement and market maturity is immense, paving the way for a more robust, integrated, and accessible financial future.

The country’s finance ministry also revealed that the new regulations will take effect from August 1. Indonesia has adopted digital assets over the years, which have become a popular investment option. In 2024, Chainalysis ranked Indonesia third in countries that have adopted cryptocurrencies. The country allows trading of virtual currencies, but limits their use as a means of payment. Data from the country’s regulator showed that crypto transactions reached 650 trillion rupiah ($39.67 billion) in 2024, three times that of the previous year. Indonesia also recorded over 20 million users in crypto exchanges in 2024, surpassing the number of investors in the stock market. Indonesia excludes VAT on crypto buyers The new tax rules include a 0.21% tax on the transaction value for sellers of cryptocurrencies in local exchanges, up from the previous 0.1%. Sellers in overseas exchanges will also incur a 1% tax, up from the previous 0.2%. Indonesia also scrapped the previous value-added tax (VAT) it had on buyers, which had been in effect since May 2022. The country now expects buyers to pay around 0.11-0.22% VAT. The VAT rate on mining of virtual assets in the Southeast Asian country also rose from 1.1% to 2.2%. The country also eliminated the 0.1% special income tax rate on crypto mining . Income from crypto mining activities will now be included in either personal income tax or corporate tax rates, effective in 2026. Indonesia’s crypto exchange platform Tokocrypto commended the country’s changes in crypto tax. The firm argued that the changes mirrored Indonesia’s stance in recognizing digital assets as financial assets and not as commodities. The company also proposed a grace period of around a month to give other firms time to adapt to the changes. “We also emphasize the importance of strengthening oversight and tax enforcement on crypto asset transactions conducted through foreign platforms.” -Tokocrypto. The crypto exchange also believes the crypto tax rate would be higher than the capital gains tax rate used in stock market investments. The firm suggested that Indonesia issue fiscal incentives to help boost innovation in the crypto sector. Indonesia expects an increase in crypto adoption Statista also reported that Indonesia’s cryptocurrency revenue is expected to reach $4.4 billion in 2025. The firm also forecasted an annual growth rate in crypto revenue of 3.55% between 2025 and 2026, resulting in around $4.5 billion in total revenue by 2026. Indonesia’s cryptocurrency market is projected to reach 48.87 million users by 2026. Data showed that crypto users in the country will increase at a rate of 16.56% in 2025 and reach 16.98% by 2026. Commissioner of Financial Sector Technology Innovation Hasan Fawzi expects that the growth of virtual currencies and crypto investors in Indonesia will continue to rise. The country recorded a surge in tradable cryptocurrencies from 851 to 1,444, with the OJK approving permits for 22 entities in the industry. The country appointed the Financial Service Authority (OJK) as the new crypto regulator as it revamped its regulatory framework for 2025. Tokocrypto CEO Calvin Kizana also warned that Indonesia should expect to receive fierce competition from neighboring Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam and Thailand. He called for a strong cooperation between the government, industry players, and the community to create supportive regulations to encourage crypto adoption in the nation. Kizana also urged the country’s fiscal authorities to mirror Thailand’s move to provide tax incentives to create pro-industry policies. He championed Vietnam’s legal clarity and road map for technology adoption, saying that it could inspire efforts to create a sense of security for investors and technology developers.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-its-xrps-turn-for-a-massive-bull-run-heres-why/,"Financial expert and creator of Crypto Crusaders, Levi Rietveld, has once again weighed in on the ongoing debate surrounding the utility of Bitcoin in real-world payments, particularly for businesses and institutions, compared to XRP. In a recent post on X, Rietveld stated, “Bitcoin had its run… now it’s XRP’s turn!!” He also captioned a short video in which he directly addressed remarks made by Strategy Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, about the future adoption of Bitcoin as a global standard. In the video, Rietveld focused on a statement from Saylor in which the prominent Bitcoin maximalist claimed, “You’re using Bitcoin right now. If you keep it, you’ll be insanely rich. But I think ultimately, base network is going to have 10 to 100,000 big financial institutions. Every company, every family owner should adopt the Bitcoin standard.” According to Saylor, Bitcoin will serve as the fundamental base layer for a global financial infrastructure. Rietveld responded by highlighting the operational limitations of Bitcoin’s base layer, which he noted processes a transaction roughly every fifteen minutes. He argued that the practical challenges tied to Bitcoin’s throughput prevent it from serving as an efficient layer-one financial system for the kinds of enterprises Saylor referenced. Rietveld pointed out that most companies are currently unwilling to adopt Bitcoin due to the technical and financial requirements involved in running the Lightning Network, which is Bitcoin’s layer-two scaling solution.

NOW IT'S #XRP 's TURN!! pic.twitter.com/UrKiln1bOx — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 28, 2025 Critique of the Lightning Network’s Requirements Rietveld explained that to utilize the Lightning Network effectively, businesses would need to maintain substantial reserves of Bitcoin to manage liquidity for transactions. Given the current market price of Bitcoin, he asserted that this prerequisite is cost-prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises. He argued that this requirement poses a significant barrier to broader adoption among businesses that operate on tight margins or have limited exposure to digital assets. He further emphasized that allocating capital toward holding a volatile and expensive asset, solely to facilitate payments, is not a viable strategy for most organizations. Rietveld maintained that this undermines the argument that Bitcoin can realistically serve as a global standard for everyday commerce. Comparison With XRP’s Cost and Efficiency In contrast, Rietveld presented XRP as a more feasible option for real-world adoption . He asserted that XRP offers significantly faster transaction speeds and much lower fees without requiring businesses to tie up substantial capital. According to Rietveld, the ease of integration and the low acquisition costs make XRP a more suitable candidate for payments, particularly in retail and enterprise contexts. He noted that XRP can settle transactions in seconds and at a fraction of a penny, which he argued makes it more compatible with the demands of both high-volume and micro-payment scenarios. Rietveld concluded that XRP avoids many of the logistical and financial issues from the Bitcoin base layer and its associated scaling solutions.

His assertion that “Bitcoin had its run” reflects a view that while Bitcoin may continue to function as a digital asset for holding value, it may not be the optimal technology for building scalable, low-cost payment networks. Rietveld’s comments come at a time when digital asset infrastructure is being evaluated by institutions looking for efficient settlement solutions. In this context, XRP remains positioned by advocates as a high-speed, low-cost protocol capable of meeting institutional-grade requirements. This XRP’s technical advantages over Bitcoin in payment have rekindled debate about which digital assets are best suited for real-world deployment. His critique underscores the contrast between Bitcoin’s current utility and what he characterizes as XRP’s readiness for enterprise adoption.

Key Takeaways: AML Bitcoin founder Rowland Marcus Andrade received a seven-year prison sentence for wire fraud. Andrade misled investors with false claims, including a fake Panama Canal partnership. A hearing in September will determine how much restitution Andrade must pay to victims. The US Department of Justice found that Andrade and his company misled investors between 2014 and 2019 , raising nearly $10 million through false promises about the coin’s capabilities, launch timeline, and business prospects. “The defendant made one false claim after another about a sophisticated cryptocurrency offering to create the illusion of a legitimate business,” US Attorney Craig H. Missakian said. Prosecutors: Andrade Faked Panama Canal Deal to Boost AML Bitcoin Prosecutors detailed how Andrade fabricated claims, including an alleged partnership with the Panama Canal Authority, to convince investors of AML Bitcoin’s legitimacy. “He exploited numerous investors who put their trust in him, not knowing that their hard-earned money was in fact funding his lavish lifestyle,” Missakian said. Investigators revealed that Andrade laundered and spent more than $2 million of investor funds on personal expenses, such as real estate in Texas and two luxury vehicles. His prison sentence, which begins October 31, 2025, will be followed by three years of supervised release.

Chief Judge Richard Seeborg’s sentencing also includes an order for Andrade to forfeit any ill-gotten gains, pending the outcome of the September hearing. Crypto Hacks, Scams Cost Investors $2.2B in H1 2025: CertiK Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks. Two major incidents, including Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack in February and Cetus Protocol’s $225 million exploit in May, skewed the year’s losses upward, together accounting for nearly $1.78 billion. Without these, losses align more closely with previous years at around $690 million. Ethereum remained the primary target, suffering over $1.6 billion in losses across 175 events. The report also pointed to rising sophistication of phishing schemes and ongoing risks from social engineering, urging crypto users to verify links, avoid suspicious sites, and use hardware wallets.

Recently, a transaction of staggering proportions sent ripples through the crypto community: over 116 million XRP, valued at approximately $362 million, moved from the Uphold exchange to an unidentified wallet. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a whale-sized move that prompts a myriad of questions about market dynamics, investor sentiment, and the future trajectory of one of the crypto space’s most prominent digital assets. What Exactly Happened with This Massive XRP Transfer ? On-chain analytics platform Whale Alert, known for tracking significant cryptocurrency movements, flagged a truly monumental transaction. Specifically, 116,973,599 XRP, precisely, was transferred from Uphold, a popular multi-asset digital money platform, to an address categorized simply as ‘unknown wallet.’ The sheer scale of this XRP transfer immediately caught the eye of market observers and XRP enthusiasts alike. To put this into perspective, $362 million represents a substantial sum in any financial market, let alone the often-volatile crypto sphere. Such large movements, often dubbed ‘whale transactions,’ are typically scrutinized for potential market implications. They can sometimes precede significant price action, indicate shifts in institutional interest, or even hint at strategic maneuvers by major holders. While the immediate impact on XRP’s price wasn’t dramatic, the underlying questions persist: Who is behind this massive move, and what are their intentions? Here’s a quick breakdown of the key details: Amount Transferred: 116,973,599 XRP Origin: Uphold Exchange Destination: Unknown Wallet Estimated Value: Approximately $362 million Reported By: Whale Alert Understanding these large transactions is crucial for anyone keen on the crypto market, as they often serve as early indicators of broader trends or shifts in liquidity. Why Do These Whale-Sized XRP Transfers Matter? When an amount as significant as 116 million XRP changes hands, it’s never just a minor event. These whale movements carry substantial weight and can influence various aspects of the cryptocurrency market. The anonymous nature of the receiving wallet adds another layer of intrigue and speculation, making this particular XRP transfer even more compelling. Market Impact and Liquidity A transfer of this magnitude can potentially impact market liquidity. If the XRP is moved to an exchange, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and putting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, if it’s moved off an exchange to a private wallet, it might indicate long-term holding or an Over-The-Counter (OTC) deal, reducing immediate selling pressure and potentially signaling bullish sentiment for the asset. The destination being an ‘unknown wallet’ means the immediate intent is unclear, leading to speculation. Unraveling Whale Behavior Large holders, or ‘whales,’ possess enough capital to influence market prices. Their actions are closely watched because they can often precede significant market shifts. A large XRP transfer from an exchange could mean: Accumulation: The whale is moving funds off an exchange for long-term holding, indicating confidence in XRP’s future. Distribution: The whale is preparing to sell a large portion through an OTC deal, avoiding direct market impact. Internal Rebalancing: An exchange or institutional entity is moving funds between their own wallets for operational purposes. Security Concerns: Holders are moving assets from centralized exchanges to self-custody wallets to mitigate risks. The Element of Anonymity and Transparency While blockchain technology offers transparency in tracking transactions, the identity behind an ‘unknown wallet’ remains a mystery. This dichotomy is a core feature of cryptocurrency – transactions are public, but participants can remain pseudonymous. For XRP, a project often associated with institutional adoption, such a large anonymous XRP transfer can spark debate about the balance between privacy and regulatory compliance. Is This XRP Transfer a Sign of Things to Come for Ripple? The motivations behind such a substantial XRP transfer are often complex and can be tied to broader market conditions, specific news events, or even the ongoing legal developments surrounding Ripple. While we cannot definitively state the reason, we can explore plausible scenarios that might explain this significant movement. Potential Scenarios Behind the Move: Institutional Activity: A large institution or hedge fund might be accumulating XRP for their portfolio, moving it to cold storage. This suggests long-term conviction in XRP’s utility and potential. OTC Desk Operations: Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks facilitate large trades between buyers and sellers directly, bypassing public exchanges to minimize slippage. This XRP transfer could be part of a large OTC deal. Exchange Rebalancing: Sometimes, exchanges move funds between their own hot and cold wallets for security or operational efficiency. While Uphold was the source, the ‘unknown wallet’ could still be an affiliated address. Preparation for a Major Event: Whales might be positioning themselves ahead of anticipated news, such as a favorable outcome in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, a new partnership announcement, or a major product launch. Security Enhancement: A large holder might simply be moving their assets off an exchange to a more secure, self-custodied wallet to protect against potential hacks or platform vulnerabilities. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC continues to be a significant factor influencing XRP’s market sentiment. Any large XRP transfer is often viewed through the lens of how it might relate to the case’s progress or anticipated outcomes. A positive development could encourage accumulation, while uncertainty might lead to cautious movements. Navigating the Waters: What Should XRP Transfer Observers Consider? For investors and enthusiasts tracking XRP, understanding these large transactions is vital, but reacting impulsively is often ill-advised. Here’s how to approach news of a major XRP transfer : Stay Informed, Not Reactive: While whale alerts are exciting, a single large transaction doesn’t necessarily dictate market direction. Look for patterns, multiple transactions, and broader market trends. Analyze Context: Consider the timing of the transfer. Is there any major news surrounding XRP or the broader crypto market? What has XRP’s price action been like recently? Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on one asset, even a promising one like XRP, can expose you to undue risk. Diversification helps mitigate the impact of sudden market shifts. Understand On-Chain Data Limitations: While Whale Alert provides valuable data, it doesn’t reveal the ‘why’ behind the transfer. Interpret the data with caution and combine it with fundamental and technical analysis. Prioritize Security: If a whale is moving funds off an exchange for security, it’s a good reminder for all investors to consider their own security practices, including the use of hardware wallets for significant holdings. The key takeaway is to use such information as one piece of a larger puzzle, rather than the sole determinant of your investment strategy. The crypto market thrives on information, but discerning valuable signals from mere noise is an art. The Broader Landscape: XRP Transfer and the Crypto Ecosystem The phenomenon of large crypto transfers, whether involving XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other major asset, highlights several critical aspects of the digital asset ecosystem. It underscores the transparency inherent in public blockchains, where every transaction is recorded and verifiable, even if the parties remain pseudonymous. It also emphasizes the growing sophistication of on-chain analytics tools like Whale Alert, which empower individuals to gain insights previously exclusive to institutional players. Moreover, these events serve as a constant reminder of the influence of large holders – the ‘whales’ – in shaping market sentiment and liquidity. Their movements are often a bellwether for broader market trends, reflecting confidence, caution, or strategic positioning. As the crypto market matures, the ability to track and interpret these significant XRP transfer events will become increasingly valuable for investors, researchers, and regulators alike. Ultimately, this massive XRP transfer from Uphold to an unknown wallet is a testament to the dynamic and often enigmatic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the specific intentions behind this particular move remain shrouded in mystery, it serves as a powerful reminder of the continuous flow of capital within the digital economy and the ever-present intrigue surrounding its largest participants. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Whale Activity The recent 116 million XRP transfer from Uphold to an unknown wallet is more than just a large transaction; it’s a fascinating glimpse into the mechanics of the crypto market’s biggest players. While the exact motives behind this colossal move remain speculative, it underscores the importance of on-chain data in providing transparency, even when identities are obscured. For XRP holders and crypto enthusiasts, such events highlight the need for a balanced perspective, combining vigilance with a deep understanding of market fundamentals. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, tracking these whale movements will remain a crucial aspect of deciphering market sentiment and potential future trends for assets like XRP. Stay informed, stay analytical, and remember that patience and thorough research are your best allies in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A1: In cryptocurrency, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price. Their large transactions, like this XRP transfer , are closely watched by other market participants. Q2: How are these large XRP transfers tracked? A2: Large cryptocurrency transfers are tracked using on-chain analytics platforms like Whale Alert. These platforms monitor public blockchain ledgers and flag transactions that exceed a certain threshold, providing details such as the amount, source, and destination wallet addresses. Q3: Does an ‘unknown wallet’ mean the transaction is untraceable? A3: No, an ‘unknown wallet’ simply means the owner’s identity is not publicly known or associated with a recognized entity (like an exchange). The transaction itself is fully traceable on the XRP Ledger blockchain, meaning anyone can view its details, but the real-world identity of the wallet holder remains pseudonymous. Q4: Should I be concerned about large XRP transfers? A4: Large XRP transfer events are a normal part of the crypto market. While they can sometimes precede price volatility, they don’t automatically signal a negative or positive outcome. It’s important to view them as one piece of data among many and avoid making impulsive investment decisions based solely on such alerts. Q5: What are the typical reasons for a large XRP transfer? A5: Common reasons include moving funds for long-term storage (cold storage), facilitating Over-The-Counter (OTC) deals, internal rebalancing by exchanges or institutions, preparing for a major market event, or even just consolidating funds from various sources.

This $0.035 Project Just Entered a Key Growth Phase,https://timestabloid.com/whats-the-best-cheap-crypto-to-buy-this-0-035-project/,"In a market filled with inflated valuations and stalled momentum, serious investors are searching for high-upside, undervalued projects under $0.05. One name that’s quickly gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — now in Phase 6 of its presale at just $0.035. But this isn’t just another low-cost altcoin. Behind the affordable price tag lies a sophisticated DeFi protocol engineered for sustainability, scalability, and long-term value creation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch a decentralized stablecoin system, yield-generating mtTokens, and a staking module that pays rewards via MUTM buybacks. Add to that a beta launch lined up for its mainnet listing and Layer-2 integration to drastically reduce gas fees, and it’s clear why seasoned analysts are watching this project closely. From Cheap to Powerful: DeFi Utility That Grows Demand The strength of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies not in its price, but in its structure. At the core of the ecosystem is an auto-yielding mtToken system. When users lend assets such as ETH or USDT through the protocol, they receive mtTokens (like mtETH or mtUSDT) in return. These tokens aren’t just placeholders — they grow automatically in value as interest accumulates, and can be staked in smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards distributed from protocol revenue buybacks. This mechanism creates continuous demand for MUTM as protocol earnings are used to buy back the token and reward stakers. The longer someone stakes, the more they benefit — a feature designed to attract long-term participation and reduce sell pressure. Layer-2 support is also in development, which will slash gas fees and accelerate transaction speeds for all protocol operations. Combined with the upcoming beta launch, users will soon experience real-time, low-cost DeFi lending and borrowing at scale — directly increasing activity across the platform and driving further token demand. These catalysts don’t just improve user experience — they actively grow the value proposition of MUTM as a core utility asset in the system. Early Investors are Already Gaining Just look at the numbers—they’re hard to ignore. A forward-thinking investor who reallocated just $750 from Avalanche (AVAX) into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during its Phase 1 presale at $0.01 would have secured 75,000 MUTM tokens. Once the token hits its official listing price of $0.06, that $750 investment would already be worth $4,500—a 6x return before launch. But the real upside lies ahead. Projections fueled by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s expanding decentralized lending, staking programs, and Layer-2 scalability suggest a post-launch move toward $0.15 or more. At that price, those 75,000 tokens would be worth $11,250—a staggering 15x gain, all based on real demand and product utility. This isn’t wishful thinking—it’s price movement anchored in token mechanics in the upcoming beta launch, rising TVL, and user growth across projected P2P lending and mtToken-based rewards. While older altcoins battle volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a fresh narrative with actual income generation at its core. For smart investors, this is more than an early entry—it’s a first-mover advantage in a protocol designed for long-term sustainability. Phase 6 Is Live — And the Window to Buy at a Discount Is Narrowing As of now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is deep into Phase 6 of its 11-phase presale. The token price is $0.035, with over $13.65 million already raised and more than 14,600 holders participating. Only 7% of the total token supply of this phase has been sold, which means there’s still significant room for growth — but the clock is ticking. The next phase will see a 15% price hike, and the token is scheduled to list publicly at $0.06. That means Phase 6 buyers are looking at a 71.4% price upside before even hitting the exchange. With thousands already committed, a $100,000 giveaway underway, and CertiK audit scores of 95.00 on Token Scan and 78.00 on Skynet (updated May 2025), momentum is clearly building. Social growth is also accelerating, with Twitter followers crossing 12,000 — a sign that early-stage visibility is translating into real community traction. Lending Models That Add Depth and Flexibility to the Protocol While the fundamentals are solid, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also redefine how lending is structured in DeFi. The protocol will support both P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) lending—giving users the flexibility to either tap into shared liquidity pools or negotiate loan terms directly. In the P2C model, users will lend or borrow blue-chip assets like BTC, ETH, or SOL through automated smart contracts, with dynamic interest rates based on real-time pool utilization. For instance, a lender will be able to earn a consistent 5.2% APY by lending ETH at a 60% loan-to-value ratio. This model will cater to those seeking predictable, passive income backed by secure, overcollateralized lending. Meanwhile, the P2P model will unlock higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Users will negotiate loans using volatile or speculative tokens—such as SHIB or PEPE—setting their own interest rates, collateral terms, and durations. These agreements will remain fully decentralized and protected by overcollateralization thresholds and automated liquidation triggers. With strong fundamentals, an expanding utility network, and a presale price far below its listing value, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as one of the most promising crypto projects under $0.05. For those still sitting on the sidelines, Phase 6 offers a rare opportunity to buy into a high-utility protocol before its full market debut.

As recently as June 29, CryptoQuant data showed miners were holding onto their reserves, despite declining revenues and a slight 3.5% drop in Bitcoin’s hashrate. Analysts attributed this “HODL” behavior to strong unrealized profits and expectations of further upside. However, Bitcoin’s July rally toward $120,000, just a few grand shy of its July 14 all-time high, appears to have triggered profit-taking. Taha suggested that rising operational costs and mining difficulty may also be compelling miners to liquidate some holdings to manage expenses. He stated that such large inflows to exchanges have historically preceded periods of consolidation, as selling pressure temporarily outweighs new demand: “While long-term sentiment remains bullish, this sharp inflow and capital movement may precede a period of consolidation or a local correction.” The expert also noted that Binance had recorded its largest USDC net outflow in more than two months, with $650 million exiting the platform on the same day as the BTC inflow. This stablecoin drain suggests that some traders could be shifting funds to cold storage or alternative venues, potentially reducing immediate buy-side liquidity on the exchange. Meanwhile, Binance has taken steps to adapt to shifting liquidity conditions. It recently launched Discount Buy, a feature allowing users to purchase crypto at below-market rates, potentially incentivizing accumulation during dips. Taha suggested in his analysis that the platform is once again “becoming a focal point for short-term supply and liquidity shifts.” Market Outlook At the time of this writing, BTC was trading at $117,981, down slightly by 0.7% over the past 24 hours and 0.6% over the past week, while holding an 8.8% monthly gain. The asset remains within a tight seven-day range of $115,184 to $119,568, perhaps indicating market indecision near key resistance. Despite the sell-off, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain strong. Miner reserves had been climbing since March, with addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC accumulating 65,000 BTC, their highest level since November 2024, per CryptoQuant. For now, traders are waiting to see if the flagship cryptocurrency can hold support above $115,000. If it does, analysts expect another attempt at breaking $120,000, potentially setting the stage for a retest of the all-time high.

However, CEO Ryan McInerney warns that the technology still requires clearer regulations to reach its full potential. The payment giant reported strong Q2 2025 results with $9.6 billion in net revenue, up 9% year-over-year, as it continues building stablecoin capabilities, including its first seven-day-a-week settlement system and the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform for bank partnerships. Visa Competing For Stablecoin Dominance Visa’s first VTAP pilot partner, BBVA, plans to launch a stablecoin later this year on the Ethereum blockchain. The company has invested in a stablecoin infrastructure provider, BVNK, through Visa Ventures while expanding partnerships across Africa with Yellow Card Financial. McInerney emphasized that while $200 million represents a significant milestone, it remains a tiny portion of Visa’s overall settlement volume. He identified pragmatic regulations as the key “tipping point” for broader stablecoin adoption in global commerce. The developments come as global stablecoin volume reached $27.6 trillion in Q1 2025 , surpassing Visa and Mastercard’s combined transaction volume. Source: Bitwise Major corporations, including Amazon and Walmart , are exploring stablecoin payment integration for high-volume transactions. While McInerney voiced his opinion, the GENIUS Act’s passage has established federal frameworks for USD-pegged stablecoins, creating the regulatory clarity that industry leaders believe will accelerate institutional adoption. However, Visa maintains cautious optimism while continuing infrastructure investments. Global Regulatory Frameworks Drive Stablecoin Mainstream Adoption The GENIUS Act requires non-bank stablecoin issuers to establish standalone operations and obtain Treasury oversight committee clearance, while banks must use legally distinct subsidiaries prohibited from leverage or lending activities. The legislation bans interest-bearing stablecoins and mandates rigorous asset disclosures. Circle’s Dante Disparte described the “Libra clause” as preventing tech conglomerates from dominating the stablecoin market, with issuers over $10 billion requiring national trust bank charters. A provision in GENIUS Act aims to curb the influence of tech conglomerates and major financial institutions in the US stablecoin market. #GENIUS #Stablecoins https://t.co/IE7FZdWjXw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 21, 2025 Ripple and Circle have both applied for U.S. banking licenses in response to regulatory requirements. Just yesterday, Hong Kong launched its stablecoin licensing regime , which will take effect on August 1, requiring compliance with new guidelines on supervision and anti-money laundering. The HKMA warned that misleading licensing claims could result in criminal penalties, with no licenses granted as of July 29. Similarly, Nigeria reopened its doors to stablecoin businesses after a year-long crackdown on Binance, with SEC Director-General Emomotimi Agama declaring the country “open for stablecoin business” under compliant frameworks. The Investment and Securities Act 2025 provides a regulatory foundation for digital asset oversight. While every country and region seems to be gearing for stablecoin adoption, European Central Bank advisor Jürgen Schaaf warned that euro-backed stablecoins capture only 0.15% of the $230 billion global market. ECB advisor warns Europe risks losing monetary sovereignty as euro-denominated stablecoins capture just 0.15% of $230 billion global stablecoin market. #Europe #Stablecoin https://t.co/ztXdNdvv1C — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 29, 2025 This, he explained, threatens European monetary sovereignty as dollar-dominated tokens gain mainstream adoption through major payment networks. Interactive Brokers is also exploring its own stablecoin launch to enable real-time account funding. At the same time, China Industrial Bank prioritized stablecoin research as part of its “Smart Industrial Bank” transformation strategy. Payment Giants Race to Capture Growing Institutional Market Visa partnered with Yellow Card Financial to bring stablecoin payments across Africa , starting with an unnamed country in 2025 before expanding to additional markets in 2026. Yellow Card operates across 20 African countries and has processed over $6 billion in transactions. Similarly, Circle partnered with Onafriq, Africa’s largest payments network spanning 500 wallets and 200 million bank accounts, to pilot USDC settlements and reduce cross-border payment costs. Over 80% of intra-African transactions currently route through overseas correspondent banks, generating $5 billion in annual fees. Stablecoin supply reached $225 billion with monthly transfers exceeding $4.1 trillion, driven by both retail and institutional adoption. Source: Chainalysis Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 43% of crypto volume, with Nigeria receiving $59 billion annually, primarily in transactions under $1 million. Notably, BVNK secured strategic investment from Visa Ventures while processing $12 billion in annualized volume through its stablecoin infrastructure platform. The company opened San Francisco and New York offices to expand U.S. operations following a $50 million Series B funding round. According to the Q2 earnings report, Visa’s broader strategy will continue to focus on interoperability and programmability through partnerships with financial institutions and technology providers. The company has developed enhanced fraud detection and real-time payment solutions integrated with blockchain-native infrastructure for scalable institutional adoption.

Fans and traders now ask if this playful asset can sprint past seasoned mascots like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Bonk when meme prices heat up again. Early data, lively backers and upcoming events set the scene for a high-stakes showdown in the months ahead. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005. At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits From Meme to Mainstream: Dogecoin’s Ongoing Ride Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful twist on money. Its logo shows a smiling Shiba Inu that first spread as a meme. Unlike Bitcoin, it has no hard limit. About 10,000 new coins enter the market every minute, so DOGE is always plenty. What started as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer soon blew up. In 2021 the coin jumped into the top-ten list, worth more than $50 billion. Fans on social media, led by Elon Musk tweets, turned the meme into a headline star and proved how strong an online crowd can be. Dogecoin runs on open code much like Litecoin, so moves are fast and fees stay low. The network updates every minute, making it quick enough for tips, small sales, and charity drives. Because supply keeps growing, price depends on steady demand and fresh buzz. Right now many traders hunt for light-hearted coins as bitcoin edges higher again. That mood may lift DOGE faster than older, stiffer coins. Yet its vast supply means big gains need big waves of buyers. If social media turns lively and brands adopt the dog, the coin could have another spotlight run. Shiba Inu: From Meme Pup to Ethereum Powerhouse in the 2024 Rally Shiba Inu, or SHIB, began as a playful nod to Dogecoin in August 2020. Its creator, the secretive Ryoshi, released one quadrillion tokens and sent half to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His later gift to an India Covid fund and the burn of 40% of all coins pushed SHIB into global headlines. Unlike DOGE, SHIB lives on the Ethereum chain, so it fits easily with wallets, exchanges, and smart apps. This base has already birthed ShibaSwap and could soon power an NFT market and a community-run vote system. Today, many traders scout for the next big gainer as Bitcoin cools after its recent run. SHIB’s mix of meme energy and real-world tools gives it an edge over coins that rely only on jokes. Its low unit price still draws small investors, while planned upgrades keep long-term fans excited. If the wider Ethereum scene heats up again, SHIB could ride that wave faster than older meme rivals like DOGE. BONK: The Shiba Song on Solana Rockets Past the Meme Crowd BONK is a bright new pup in the crypto park. Built on Solana, it uses a Shiba Inu face and a bold idea: give power back to everyday users, not big funds. Half of all tokens went straight to Solana NFT and DeFi fans, turning holders into a real club. When Coinbase added BONK, the price shot up more than 100%, and buzz grew louder. Fast, low-cost Solana tech lets BONK move quickly, and the coming BonkSwap gives the coin its own playground for trade and games. The market now loves stories, and BONK tells one that fits. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu proved memes can move billions, yet they lack fresh tech. BONK plugs into Solana’s rising network, so apps can add it with ease. That link may give it more bite than older meme rivals. Supply is huge and swings are wild, but if Solana keeps climbing and BonkSwap gains users, BONK could shine as the meme of this cycle. Conclusion DOGE, SHIB, and BONK remain solid, yet XYZVerse’s sport-fueled, community-led push for 20,000% gains positions XYZ as the likely breakout star of the 2025 bull run.

Michaël van de Poppe expects a stronger move the longer BTC remains rangebound. CryptoQuant data shows Bitcoin is in a neutral phase with no trend dominance yet. On-chain signals mirror 2020 patterns, hinting at a possible bull cycle end soon. Price Holds in Narrow Band Bitcoin (BTC) was priced at $118,300 at press time, down 0.2% over the week. For several weeks now, the asset has been moving in a tight zone without direction. Traders are showing caution ahead of today’s FOMC interest rate decision. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe described the current pattern as “extremely boring,” pointing to the lack of decision or momentum. Bitcoin has been holding between $116,800 and $119,500, with no clear move up or down. His chart shows that liquidity above and below this range has already been cleared. That often happens before a strong price move. He added that a break above $119,500 could open the way for a test of previous highs. If the price drops instead, the $110,000 to $112,000 range may become a key area to watch for buying. Extremely boring range for the past few weeks on #Bitcoin . Still no breakout, still no decision.

It currently stands at 44%. Notably, this number reflects several market signals, including selling activity from long-term holders, ETF inflows, and overall demand. A higher number means the market is heating up. A lower one suggests a quiet phase, often seen before prices rise.

While some profit-taking is beginning, it’s still at a controlled pace. Short-Term Cooling Continues Another CryptoQuant analyst, known as Crypto Dan, noted a small cooling period after a brief wave of short-term activity. They looked at the amount of Bitcoin held for just one day to one week and said the numbers showed signs of short-term heat earlier this month. Source: CryptoQuant Compared to the larger corrections seen in 2024 and early 2025, this phase appears smaller in both strength and length. The analyst also said the recent price increase was not large, which could limit how deep or long any correction might be. Crypto Dan suggested that traders may need to wait through this cooling period before seeing the next upward trend. Long-Term Wallet Activity Shows Familiar Pattern On-chain analyst Joao Wedson pointed out that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding more than 10,000 BTC is falling again—just like it did during the 2020–2021 bull market. During that time, the price kept rising even as large holders reduced their positions. “The same pattern is happening again,” Wedson said. He also mentioned that this may point to the final stretch of the current bull market cycle. “In my opinion, this signals that the BTC bull market has just a few weeks left.” he said This pattern is being watched closely, especially as the market continues to move within a narrow range.

While the Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged barring any major surprises, Bitcoin and altcoins are experiencing pullbacks. At this point, while sudden fluctuations are experienced in BTC and altcoins, cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment said in its latest post that investors showed intense interest in six altcoins named Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), Vine (VINE), Omni (OMNI), Tron (TRX) and Stellar (XLM) on social media. Solana: Key factors contributing to the escalation of discussions around SOL include ARK Invest’s significant staking activities, large purchases of SOL tokens, and involvement in DeFi and NFT projects. Regulatory developments such as the SEC postponing the Grayscale Solana Spot ETF decision to October 2025, ARK Invest and Invesco Galaxy applying for Solana ETFs, and comparisons with Ethereum and Base are drawing attention. Ethereum: ETH is trending for a variety of reasons. Reddit is buzzing about ETH scams, Telegram is buzzing about Ethereum, staking, DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions, and its rise to prominence as a leading smart contract platform driven by price action and ecosystem expansion, along with its growth in institutional adoption. Twitter is enthusiastically celebrating Ethereum's 10th anniversary. Vine: VINE is trending, with frequent mentions of short positions, scalping, and profit-taking signaling active speculation. This trend is driven by factors such as Elon Musk's tweets about Vine AI, significant whale buying, and the token's listing on trading platforms. VINE has seen an increase in price and trading volume, and upward momentum is noted, but caution is advised against potential short-term pullbacks. Omni: OMNI is trending due to significant trading activity and price action. OMNI's 1218% profits for some investors, a 117% increase on the ZEDXION exchange, and significant gains following its listing on Upbit are frequently mentioned. Tron: TRX is trending due to its significant role in stablecoin transactions, particularly USDT on the TRC20 network. Users are discussing Tron's market capitalization, its use for USDT trading in casinos, and its advantages like zero gas fees and fast transaction speeds. Additionally, Tron Inc.'s strategic move to establish a TRX-based crypto treasury, plans to raise $1 billion in securities, and growing institutional interest are contributing to its continued trend. Stellar: XLM is trending due to numerous discussions revolving around comparisons with other cryptocurrencies like XRP and concerns about technical analysis like golden crosses and support levels. *This is not investment advice.

Bullish momentum is fading, with MACD, RSI, and stochastics all confirming weakening bulls and rising downside risk. BITO's structure offers high yield but comes with higher risk and expenses compared to ARKB and IBIT peers. Given the elevated risk, high fees, and weak technicals, I find BITO unattractive for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has regained its mojo after Trump's election win as his administration has promised a favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. One of the ways to play Bitcoin is through the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEARCA: BITO ), but as you can see below, the fund has diverged from the underlying asset. This is due to a unique structure in which the ETF has a monstrous dividend yield and so investors can easily reinvest if they wish to do so. In the below technical analysis, it is shown that while support and resistance are relatively balanced, bullish momentum is weak and a double top suggests the potential of a bearish reversal. Near the end of this article, it is also discussed that the ETF has higher risk and expenses than peers and so I believe that BITO is unattractive for investors looking for Bitcoin exposure. Seeking Alpha Trend Lines Are Converging Yahoo Finance For today's technical analysis, I will first look at some key support and resistance zones for the ETF as well as some of the trends. Currently, BITO is in a longer term uptrend that began back in early April. That trend line was most recently support at the start of July. However, in the near term, a potential downtrend may have been forming since early to mid July. As these trend lines converge, it will be interesting to see which way the ETF breaks out. For support, there are three key levels that investors should keeps their eyes on. The area around 21.8 could come to the rescue soon as a major July gap up occurred there. The 20.8 level should also be significant support since that area was resistance back in March and April. Lastly, the 19.7s could also be support as a late March peak occurred there and an early May trough also occurred there. While there is significant support, resistance is also abundant. Just above 23, there may be resistance as that price level was a key obstacle for BITO in the second half of February. As you can see in the above chart, the next source of resistance is a double top pattern at about 23.5. This could be a sign that a bearish reversal is in the cards and so investors should be on the look out for further signs of technical weakness. Lastly, there may be considerable resistance in the 24.5s as well since a major February gap down occurred there. Momentum Is Weak Yahoo Finance In the above discussion, it was shown that the ETF had relatively balanced support and resistance. Now we turn to see how momentum is playing out for BITO. For the long term, the 50 day SMA broke above the 200 day SMA in early July for a golden cross. That indicated the arrival of a bullish period. However, the 50 day SMA's trajectory has been weak and the deviation between the SMAs has failed to expand in a strong manner. Therefore it seems that long term bulls are still hesitating as clearly momentum has not been ideal. For the near term, let's first look at the EMAs. The 9 day EMA had a bullish crossover with the 21 day EMA also in early July to show strength. After expanding, the gap between the EMAs has started to narrow and so near term bullishness is now receding. The ETF has also broken below the 9 day EMA and so there is some notable weakness in the bulls. For the MACD, a bullish crossover occurred in early July as well. The histogram was quite strong for a period but note that the past 8 bars have been red and so momentum has weakened significantly. In fact, a bearish crossover seems to be imminent to reflect near term bearishness. From the above moving averages and MACD indicator, I believe it is clear that bullish momentum is weak and near term momentum is actually at risk of turning bearish. As an aside, note that the MACD confirms the double top in BITO. At the ETF's July peak, the indicator made a much lower high than back at the ETF's high in May. Therefore, there is a good chance for a bearish reversal. We'll look at more signs of confirmation a little later. Bulls Are Still In Control - For Now Yahoo Finance The ETF broke above the Bollinger Bands midline in early July to show that the bulls have taken control. BITO actually went on to break above the upper band and so perhaps the near term downtrend could be seen as an overbought pullback. In recent days, the ETF has pulled back to near the midline and so while the bulls seem to still be in control, there should definitely be some cautiousness. The RSI shows a similar story. The indicator nearly hit 70 in the first half of July to show dominant bulls but has now receded to a reading of just 53.71. Therefore, the bulls are now only in control by a modest margin as the bears have reclaimed a significant amount of lost ground. Lastly, for the stochastics, a key bearish crossover occurred between the %K and %D in early to mid July and both lines have fallen out of the the 80+ zone to show weakened bulls. The %K is now dropping dangerously close to the 50 level. As another confirmation signal of the double top and bearish reversal, the RSI also made a lower high at the July peak than back at the May peak for the ETF. This can be seen as a top failure swing by traders. With two key indicators showing that there is potential for significant downside, investors should be aware of the technical risk. A Few Noteworthy Items As stated in the introduction, the ETF has a unique structure since it has an enormous yield. The fund is weighted towards providing income rather than capital gains. BITO also differs from competing ETFs as it uses derivatives and futures rather than investing directly into the underlying asset, Bitcoin. Risk Is Higher Vs. Peers Data by YCharts ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) are two competing funds also allowing for easy exposure to the cryptocurrency. In the the above chart you can see that the standard deviation for both of these two ETFs are much lower than for BITO. ARKB and IBIT are both rated as a D- for risk by Seeking Alpha but note that BITO is rated at an even worse rating of F. This rating involves more than just standard deviation but I believe this brief discussion shows that BITO is quite risky in the grand scheme of things. Expenses Could Be A Deterrent In addition to potentially greater risk, BITO has a significantly higher expense ratio. The median expense ratio for all ETFs is 0.50% while BITO's is at 0.95%. Note that ARKB and IBIT have expense ratios of just 0.21% and 0.25% respectively and so in comparison, BITO's expenses are rather high. This difference is likely due to the fact that derivatives need to be rolled over before expiration and so there is an aspect of active management in BITO. In short, BITO is a Bitcoin ETF that has higher standard deviation risk, has higher expenses, but provides a steady income stream in the form of dividend returns. Personally, I find that to be a poor value proposition but it is understandable that some investors prefer those kind of returns. Takeaway While the technical support and resistance levels are relatively balanced, the appearance of a double top could be ominous. In terms of momentum, it is clear that bullishness is weak and the RSI and stochastics indicators show that the bulls are starting to lose control of the ETF to the bears. Furthermore, the MACD and RSI confirm the double top with negative divergence and so there is a very real risk of downside from here. In terms of the fund itself, daily standard deviation is shown to be much higher than peers while expenses are also higher due to their derivatives strategy. BITO may appeal to income hunters but in my view, the ETF provides a poor fundamental proposition for investors looking for Bitcoin exposure.",BITO,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-30 10:13:34

The analysis focuses on institutions’ and influential traders’ digital asset allocation and trading strategies, often ahead of the curve, to unlock insights on wider narratives that move markets. Equipped with professional analysts and solutions, institutional and leading crypto investors decisions come to be known as smart money moves. Based on their holding and trading data, ETH had become an institutional crowd favorite while SOL might be reversing its course of underperformance in the current rally. The emerging theme of real-world asset (RWA) has come to dominate the DeFi narratives, prompting assets like ONDO onto a bullish track. Key Insights Smart money holds onto ETH, BTC and select altcoins: the report highlights portfolios balances of ETH, BTC, ONDO, UNI, and WLD, citing the main drivers behind each asset. The diverse holdings reflect a wide array of considerations for professional and institutional investors from DeFi trends to regulatory tailwinds. Top movements by the pros – trading highlights: Whales are piling up on ETH as SOL-related derivatives are on the rise. Key movements indicated institutional interest in a range of altcoins while AVAX suffered downward pressure. Stablecoin balances across exchanges trending down: Major cryptocurrency exchanges are recording decreasing levels of stablecoin reserves, collectively at a 3-month low.

Fagel’s comments arrive amid increasing speculation surrounding this date, which marks the due date for a joint status report on the status of the appeals. While it does not serve as a legal cut-off point for filings, Fagel believes the parties may act before that time to finalize the process. In a recent statement on X, Fagel clarified that August 15 is a reporting deadline and not a requirement for appeal dismissals to be filed by then. “I believe that’s the date for the parties to report on the status of their appeals. It doesn’t mean it’s a hard deadline by which they must file their dismissal papers, but I assume they will try to do so before then,” he wrote. Dismissals Expected but Not Yet Filed The XRP community has been closely monitoring developments following Ripple’s announcement regarding the dismissal of its appeal . CEO Brad Garlinghouse had earlier suggested that Ripple intended to drop its appeal, prompting speculation about a broader resolution. However, as of now, neither Ripple nor the SEC has submitted any formal documentation to dismiss their respective appeals. Marc Fagel has indicated that this delay is procedural rather than strategic. In his view, the necessary steps for withdrawal are in progress but not immediate. He mentioned that once the required internal approvals are completed, particularly on the SEC’s side, dismissal filings will likely follow within the typical timeframe of one to two months. I believe that’s the date for the parties to report on the status of their appeals. It doesn’t mean it’s a hard deadline by which they must file their dismissal papers, but I assume they will try to do so before then. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 28, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Drawn from the Timeline Although the community is anticipating some kind of closure or definitive movement in the case by August 15, Fagel has stressed that the date is more procedural than decisive. Nonetheless, he believes that both parties are moving in the direction of appeal dismissals and will likely finalize them before that date. While this does not guarantee a full settlement or end to the litigation, it would signal a significant shift in the lawsuit’s trajectory. As the deadline approaches, attention remains fixed on whether both Ripple and the SEC will complete the dismissal process in advance. If they do, it would indicate a major procedural milestone in the years-long legal battle. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While this figure is just a fraction of its overall settlement volume, the development marks a notable shift in the financial services giant’s long-term infrastructure strategy. The move comes as governments from the US to Hong Kong roll out stablecoin regulations, prompting payment networks and banks to speed up their crypto adoption plans. Visa’s growth coincides with stablecoin transaction volumes surging past $27.6 trillion globally in Q1 2025, eclipsing the combined transaction volumes of Visa and Mastercard. This growth has caught the attention of major corporates and regulators alike, intensifying the race to define who controls the future of programmable money. Visa’s stablecoin activity expands in Africa and the US Visa’s recent partnerships and product launches signal an effort to solidify its foothold in the stablecoin ecosystem. The company has rolled out a seven-day-a-week settlement system and introduced its Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) for bank partnerships. One of the first VTAP pilot partners, Spanish lender BBVA, is set to launch a stablecoin on Ethereum later this year. Through its venture arm, Visa Ventures, the company has invested in BVNK, a stablecoin infrastructure provider. BVNK, which processes $12 billion in annualised volume, recently opened offices in New York and San Francisco after raising $50 million in a Series B round. On the African continent, Visa teamed up with Yellow Card Financial to roll out stablecoin-powered payments. Yellow Card operates in 20 African countries and has processed over $6 billion in transactions to date. The pilot will begin in an unnamed African country in 2025, with further rollouts planned for 2026. Global regulations reshape the stablecoin landscape Regulatory momentum is helping shape the stablecoin industry’s future. In the US, the GENIUS Act has provided federal clarity for USD-pegged stablecoins, requiring non-bank issuers to operate independently under Treasury oversight and banning interest-bearing coins. Banks must issue stablecoins through separate subsidiaries barred from lending or leverage activities. The Act includes a provision barring tech giants from issuing dominant stablecoins. Stablecoin issuers with more than $10 billion in liabilities must now obtain a national trust bank charter. In response, Circle and Ripple have applied for US banking licences. Elsewhere, Hong Kong’s new stablecoin licensing regime, effective from August 1, requires strict anti-money laundering compliance. As of July 29, no licences had been issued. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also warned firms not to falsely claim regulatory approval, with penalties for non-compliance. In Nigeria, authorities have reopened the stablecoin market under the new Investment and Securities Act 2025 after a previous clampdown on Binance. SEC Director-General Emomotimi Agama said the country is now “open for stablecoin business” under regulated frameworks. Payment firms target institutional use cases Visa’s infrastructure push comes as global payment networks compete for a growing pool of institutional capital. Sub-Saharan Africa now accounts for 43% of crypto volume, with Nigeria alone receiving $59 billion in stablecoin-related flows annually, mostly in transfers under $1 million. Circle is collaborating with Onafriq, Africa’s largest payments network, to pilot USDC settlements and reduce cross-border transfer costs. Onafriq connects 200 million bank accounts and 500 wallets, offering access to real-time transaction settlement. Meanwhile, Interactive Brokers is exploring the launch of its own stablecoin to support immediate funding for brokerage accounts. China Industrial Bank has prioritised stablecoin research as part of its “Smart Industrial Bank” strategy. Despite Visa’s $200 million milestone being small relative to its total transaction flows, it represents the early phase of a much broader ambition. With enhanced fraud detection and real-time payments layered over blockchain-native infrastructure, Visa is positioning itself for large-scale stablecoin integration as global regulatory clarity sets the stage for widespread adoption. Europe lags behind as dollar-backed coins dominate While US regulations and infrastructure investment push adoption forward, Europe remains a smaller player in the market. European Central Bank advisor Jürgen Schaaf highlighted that euro-backed stablecoins account for just 0.15% of the $230 billion global market, a figure he warned could threaten European monetary sovereignty as dollar-based tokens gain traction. As governments, banks, and corporates vie for control of the next generation of money, Visa’s infrastructure investments may offer early-mover advantages in a market set to surpass trillions in monthly stablecoin transfers.

The sharp increase has drawn attention from traders and the community investors evaluating the asset’s potential impact on XRP, Ripple’s native token. Source: RippleXity RLUSD, launched earlier this year, is Ripple’s answer to USDT and USDC, with interoperability across XRPL and Ethereum networks. The minting volume in July marked the stablecoin’s fastest month of growth since inception, coinciding with integrations from Swiss banking firm AMINA and momentum around the U.S. GENIUS Act, a proposed regulatory framework for fiat-backed stablecoins. XRP Utility and Market Dynamics XRP, priced at $3.16 at time of writing, traded as high as $3.20 earlier this month, briefly touching resistance levels not seen since Q1. The token has outperformed peers such as ADA and TRX, with analysts pointing to RLUSD-linked flows as a differentiator. Source: TradingView On the XRP Ledger, RLUSD frequently auto-bridges through XRP, creating structural demand. Analysts note that increased RLUSD settlement volumes—especially across institutional payment corridors—translate to more liquidity and volume on XRPL, indirectly benefiting XRP. Navigating Market Momentum with Communications That Fit As the digital asset sector matures, firms building around utility tokens, stablecoins, or on-chain finance increasingly require PR strategies tailored to real market behavior.

Learn more about Outset PR XRP Price Outlook and Risk Factors Short-term sentiment around XRP remains constructive. With RLUSD scaling quickly and Ripple hinting at further integrations, traders are watching for a potential breakout above the $3.30–$3.50 resistance band. However, the rally could stall if new issuance flattens or if U.S. regulatory developments introduce delays. Scenario Potential Outcome Probability Continued RLUSD Growth & Integrations XRP retests 2021 highs; breakout to $3.50–$3.75 possible Moderate–High Stable RLUSD Supply (No New Catalysts) XRP stabilizes in $2.80–$3.20 range High Overextension or Regulatory Delays Pullback to $2.20–$2.50 likely Low–Moderate Key Levels to Watch: Resistance: $3.30 (2018 top), $3.50 (speculative breakout ceiling) Support: $2.80 (July breakout base), $2.50 (prior consolidation) Ripple’s strategic rollout of RLUSD—especially if paired with exchange support and liquidity farming tools—may sustain upward momentum, but traders should watch for overbought conditions and macro pressures such as stablecoin regulation enforcement. Bottom Line As RLUSD continues scaling across blockchain rails, XRP’s role as a bridge asset will remain in focus. While July’s supply surge suggests healthy institutional onboarding, traders will be watching for indicators of velocity—new custody integrations, trading pairs, and payment corridors—that could drive deeper XRP engagement. Simultaneously, projects seeking to communicate value in this fast-evolving environment may look to data-driven partners like Outset PR to match storytelling with strategy. Whether through stablecoin infrastructure or narrative construction, clarity will be key to capturing the next leg of crypto’s capital cycle.

The total volume of mortgage applications dropped 3.8% last week, even though interest rates barely moved. The biggest problem isn’t the cost of borrowing. It’s the uncertainty around the economy . That’s what’s pushing people to back away from major financial decisions. The average interest rate for 30-year fixed mortgage loans with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, inched down to 6.83% from 6.84%. Points, which include the origination fee, fell slightly too, from 0.62 to 0.60, for buyers putting 20% down. But that wasn’t enough to pull buyers in. Activity continues to slide. Purchase and mortgage refinance applications slide despite steady rates Joel Kan, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s deputy chief economist and vice president, said, “Mortgage applications fell to their lowest level since May, with both purchase and refinance activity declining over the week. There is still plenty of uncertainty surrounding the economy and job market, which is weighing on prospective homebuyers’ decisions.” Applications to buy a home dropped 6% compared to the previous week. They were 17% higher than the same time last year, but Kan pointed out that volume remains low enough to distort the year-over-year comparison. He added, “Applications for conventional, FHA, and VA purchase loans fell, despite slowing home-price growth and increasing levels of for-sale inventory in many regions.” That means buyers aren’t stepping back because homes are too expensive — they’re stepping back because the outlook is too murky. Refinancing isn’t doing much better. Refinance applications dropped 1% on the week. Compared to the same week in 2024, refis were up 30%, but activity is still near historic lows. This is the third week in a row of declining refinance volume. Mortgage rates were basically the same a year ago, only one basis point lower, so there’s no real incentive driving a wave of refis right now. Rates did dip slightly at the start of this week, but bigger moves could be coming. The next big update comes Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve announces its latest decision on interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments will be closely watched. Then, on Friday, the monthly employment report from the government is expected. That data could shape how the mortgage market moves next. Until then, borrowers are waiting, and the numbers show it. Get seen where it counts.

The plan, titled the Unified Global Events Marketing Strategy, aims to give Cardano a strong, cohesive presence at top-tier blockchain conferences such as TOKEN2049 and Consensus. Backed by nearly 80% of community voters in the initial round, the proposal has now reached its final phase: a Treasury Withdrawal vote that will determine whether it gets funded. The strategy comes at a critical time. Cardano has the technology and an active developer community, but it has often struggled with fragmented messaging and minimal visibility at major events. EMURGO’s move is an attempt to resolve that gap and raise awareness of projects like Midnight, Minswap, Claymates, and Ctrl Wallet by placing them on prominent platforms globally. EMURGO funds TOKEN2049 Singapore to start branding revamp EMURGO has already acted on its vision by paying upfront for a significant Cardano showcase at TOKEN2049 Singapore, one of the most influential Web3 conferences globally. This pre-emptive commitment signals urgency from Cardano’s founding entity to set the tone for future events. According to EMURGO, this presence will be a coordinated one, allowing Cardano builders to operate under a single, recognisable banner rather than fragmented stalls or limited exposure.

If the vote succeeds, the strategy could be extended to other events such as TOKEN2049 Dubai, Consensus 2026, WebX Asia, and Blockchain Rio. Vote could determine Cardano’s visibility at future events Without the Treasury Withdrawal vote passing, EMURGO warns that Cardano’s ecosystem will remain “fragmented” at conferences, potentially diminishing its global reach. By contrast, better-branded blockchains such as Solana and Avalanche have gained traction at such events by unifying their identity and promoting ecosystem projects together. The proposal is aimed at correcting that disparity. In addition to brand consolidation, the strategy is expected to give Cardano a stronger competitive stance in the Web3 arena. A funded campaign would help deliver consistent messaging, offer better exposure to builders, and open up new collaboration opportunities for those attending major blockchain summits under the Cardano brand. ADA vs BTC: Hoskinson cites 4,000% gain since 2017 As the ecosystem attempts to raise its profile, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has also taken the opportunity to highlight ADA’s performance in comparison to Bitcoin. In a recent interview, he pointed out that ADA has delivered a 4,000% return since 2017, while Bitcoin gained 2,400% in the same period.

Imagine a future where traditional financial instruments meet the cutting-edge efficiency of blockchain technology. This isn’t a distant dream; it’s becoming a reality as Hong Kong prepares to formalize Hong Kong tokenized bonds issuance, setting a precedent for global financial innovation. This strategic move solidifies the city’s ambition to become a leading hub for digital assets, promising a new era of efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in capital markets. The Groundbreaking Move Towards Hong Kong Tokenized Bonds Hong Kong, long recognized as a global financial powerhouse, is taking decisive steps to integrate blockchain technology into its core financial infrastructure. Financial Services and the Treasury Secretary Christopher Hui recently confirmed the government’s ambitious plan to formalize the issuance of tokenized bonds as a regular practice, targeting the 2025–26 budget cycle. This announcement, reported by JinSe Finance, marks a significant milestone in the city’s journey towards embracing digital finance. But what exactly are tokenized bonds ? Simply put, they are traditional bonds whose ownership and associated rights are represented by digital tokens on a blockchain. This innovative approach leverages the security, transparency, and immutability of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to streamline the entire bond lifecycle, from issuance and trading to settlement and redemption. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been at the forefront of this exploration, having already successfully conducted two pilot issuances of government green bonds using tokenization. These initial ventures, including a HK$800 million (approximately US$102 million) tokenized green bond in February 2023, demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of the technology. With the HKMA now preparing for a third issuance, the groundwork is clearly being laid for a comprehensive and robust framework. This progressive stance signals Hong Kong’s commitment not just to experimentation, but to the full integration of digital assets into its financial ecosystem. Why Are Tokenized Bonds a Game-Changer for Finance? The shift towards tokenized bonds isn’t just a technological upgrade; it represents a fundamental rethinking of how financial instruments are issued, managed, and traded. The benefits are multi-faceted and compelling, promising to unlock new efficiencies and opportunities for both issuers and investors. Let’s explore some of the key advantages: Enhanced Efficiency and Speed: By automating many of the manual processes involved in traditional bond issuance and settlement, tokenization can drastically reduce transaction times and operational costs. Smart contracts can automate coupon payments and redemptions, minimizing human error and administrative overhead. Increased Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear, auditable record of all transactions. This transparency can build greater trust among market participants and simplify regulatory oversight. Improved Liquidity: Tokenization can enable fractional ownership of bonds, making them accessible to a wider range of investors, including retail participants who might otherwise be excluded from large-denomination debt markets. This broader investor base can lead to increased trading activity and liquidity. Reduced Intermediary Costs: By leveraging a decentralized network, the need for multiple intermediaries in the bond issuance and trading process can be minimized, leading to lower fees and more direct interactions between parties. Greater Accessibility: Lower entry barriers and simplified processes can democratize access to bond markets, allowing smaller investors to participate and diversifying investment portfolios. These advantages collectively paint a picture of a more agile, inclusive, and cost-effective bond market, which is precisely what Hong Kong aims to achieve with its formalization efforts. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: Balancing Innovation and Protection for Digital Assets The formalization of Hong Kong tokenized bonds is not merely about technological adoption; it’s intrinsically linked to establishing a robust and comprehensive regulatory framework. As Secretary Hui highlighted, once legislation is completed, the regulatory framework will fully cover the digital asset industry. This is a critical undertaking that seeks to strike a delicate balance: Risk Management: Ensuring that the inherent risks associated with digital assets, such as cybersecurity threats, market volatility, and operational risks, are adequately identified, assessed, and mitigated. This includes establishing clear standards for platform security and data integrity. Investor Protection: Safeguarding the interests of investors, particularly retail investors, from potential fraud, market manipulation, and other illicit activities. This involves developing robust disclosure requirements, anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures, and clear dispute resolution mechanisms. Market Innovation: Fostering an environment that encourages technological advancement and new business models within the digital asset space, without stifling creativity through overly restrictive regulations. The goal is to provide regulatory clarity that allows legitimate businesses to thrive. This holistic approach to regulation is crucial for building confidence and attracting both domestic and international participants to Hong Kong’s burgeoning digital asset market. The city aims to create a regulatory sandbox that is both secure and conducive to growth, distinguishing itself from jurisdictions with less defined or more prohibitive stances on digital assets. Here’s a simplified comparison of key aspects between traditional and tokenized bonds: Feature Traditional Bonds Tokenized Bonds Issuance & Transfer Manual, paper-based or centralized digital registries Automated via smart contracts on blockchain Settlement Time T+2 or T+3 (days) Near-instant (minutes/seconds) Intermediaries Numerous (brokers, custodians, clearing houses) Fewer, potentially direct peer-to-peer Accessibility Often high minimums, limited to institutional investors Fractional ownership, broader investor base (retail) Transparency Centralized records, less real-time visibility Immutable, transparent ledger on blockchain Costs Higher operational and intermediary fees Potentially lower transaction and administrative costs What Does This Mean for the Future of Finance in Hong Kong ? The formalization of Hong Kong tokenized bonds issuance is more than just a regulatory update; it’s a powerful statement about the city’s strategic vision for its financial future. By proactively integrating digital assets into its mainstream financial system, Hong Kong is positioning itself as a global leader in the evolving landscape of digital finance. This move could have several profound implications: Strengthening Hong Kong’s Position: It reinforces Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center, attracting innovative fintech companies, blockchain developers, and global investors seeking a regulated and forward-thinking environment for digital assets. Catalyst for Broader Digital Asset Adoption: The success of tokenized bonds could pave the way for the tokenization of other asset classes, from real estate and equities to intellectual property, creating entirely new markets and investment opportunities. Increased Capital Inflows: A clear and supportive regulatory framework for digital assets is likely to attract significant capital, both from traditional financial institutions looking to innovate and from crypto-native firms seeking legitimate operational bases. Enhanced Competitiveness: As other jurisdictions grapple with how to regulate digital assets, Hong Kong’s proactive and balanced approach gives it a competitive edge, potentially drawing business away from less certain markets. This initiative underscores Hong Kong’s commitment to staying at the cutting edge of financial innovation while upholding its reputation for regulatory prudence and investor protection. It’s a bold step towards a more interconnected, efficient, and digitally-driven global financial system. In conclusion, Hong Kong’s decision to formalize tokenized bond issuance by 2025-26 is a landmark development that signals a profound shift in the global financial landscape. By meticulously crafting a regulatory framework that balances innovation with robust risk management and investor protection, Hong Kong is not merely adapting to the digital age but actively shaping its future. This pioneering move will undoubtedly serve as a blueprint for other jurisdictions, solidifying Hong Kong’s position as a vibrant and forward-thinking hub for digital finance and ushering in an exciting new chapter for capital markets worldwide.

The move is part of the firm’s broader strategy to go public, with a potential listing targeted for as early as the first quarter of 2026, according to recent reports by The Information and Bloomberg . The exchange was last valued at approximately $11 billion in 2022, and the new funding round comes as the crypto market enjoys renewed investor enthusiasm. Kraken, which processes around $1.37 billion in daily trading volume and supports over 1,100 trading pairs, still trails behind Coinbase, its largest U.S. competitor, which handles about $2.77 billion in volume with 448 pairs. IPO Momentum Grows in Crypto The timing of Kraken’s capital raise aligns with a strong wave of successful initial public offerings (IPOs) in the crypto and fintech space. Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, raised $1 billion in a public offering in June and has seen its stock skyrocket over 480% since debuting at $31. Trading platform eToro, which listed on Nasdaq in May at $52, has also experienced gains, closing recently at $60.71 — a rise of more than 16%. Meanwhile, Coinbase (COIN), which went public in 2021, is up 50% in 2025 alone. Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which offers both stock and crypto trading, has surged an impressive 162% year-to-date. Kraken’s reported IPO plans signal continued confidence in crypto’s investment potential, especially as the sector appears to be regaining favor among public markets. Regulatory Shifts Encourage Kraken Expansion Kraken’s ambitions are also buoyed by a friendlier U.S. regulatory climate. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its long-standing securities violation lawsuit against Kraken in March, reflecting a broader trend of regulatory pullbacks under the current administration. Similar relief has been observed for other crypto firms, paving the way for more public listings. Other prominent players exploring IPOs include Ripple , Gemini, Galaxy Digital, Grayscale, and Bullish — a digital asset exchange backed by Peter Thiel. In June, Kraken launched “Krak,” a peer-to-peer payments app allowing fiat and crypto transfers across borders. The company further strengthened its European presence by securing a license under the EU’s MiCA framework, giving it the green light to expand operations across the continent.

At the same time, firms like Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are tokenizing money market fund shares to enhance liquidity and preserve cash asset relevance during rising stablecoin adoption. eToro Brings US Stocks to the Blockchain eToro announced plans to launch tokenized versions of the 100 most popular US-listed stocks and ETFs as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This will help expand the scope of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization in the financial sector. Press release These blockchain-based assets will be tradable 24/5, and eToro users will eventually have the ability to transfer them off-platform into self-custody wallets or DeFi protocols. A spokesperson confirmed that the long-term goal is full user sovereignty over these tokenized stocks. eToro’s CEO, Yoni Assia, believes that tokenization has the power to remove financial boundaries and make investing more accessible and transparent. This move is yet another step forward for eToro in the RWA space, building on its 2019 launch of tokenized gold and silver. The broader trend of tokenizing real-world assets has also been accelerating across the industry. On June 30, 2025, Robinhood unveiled a new layer-2 blockchain built on Arbitrum that is designed to offer European investors access to over 200 tokenized stocks and ETFs, also tradeable 24/5 and commission-free. Around the same time, Switzerland-based Backed Finance released over 60 tokenized stocks—including major names like Netflix, Meta, Tesla, Amazon, and Coinbase—across platforms like ByBit, Kraken, and Solana-based DeFi protocols. Despite these developments, tokenized stocks are currently unavailable in the United States and other restricted jurisdictions. While their market presence is still modest, accounting for $406 million of the $21.3 billion RWA market according to RWA.xyz , many industry experts see massive growth potential. Tokenized stocks market overview (Source: RWA.xyz ) At the TokenizeThis conference in New York, STOKR CEO Arnab Naskar suggested the tokenized stock market could eventually grow into a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. With eToro’s tokenization push the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology is steadily gaining momentum. InternetX to Tokenize 22 Million Domains InternetX, a major domain registrar under the IONOS umbrella, is also taking a big leap into Web3 after announcing plans to tokenize its entire portfolio of 22 million domains using D3’s Doma Protocol. The Doma Protocol is a DNS-compliant blockchain platform that is built for domain finance, and it will make it possible for InternetX customers and partners to convert traditional web domains into blockchain-based tokens. This move is expected to unlock new use cases like crypto trading, fractional ownership, and seamless integration with decentralized applications. InterNetX logo The integration will also provide access to Web3 distribution channels, bridging domain functionality to blockchain networks including Solana, Coinbase’s Base, and Avalanche. InternetX, which has served internet service providers, telecom companies, and digital agencies since the late 1990s, sees this transition as a way to modernize and future-proof domain services. Blockchain domains offer enhanced ownership security and better interoperability with the growing decentralized web. This development was announced after similar moves in the Web3 domain space by platforms like Unstoppable Domains and the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). Unstoppable Domains has been integrating traditional .com addresses with Web3 functionality since 2023, while ENS, known for its .eth domains linked to Ethereum wallets, saw widespread adoption. It even surpassed 2 million registrations by 2022 and integrated with payment platforms like PayPal and Venmo. The tokenization of domain services is part of the broader trend of bringing real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain, a market now estimated to be worth over $25 billion . Avalanche, one of the networks InternetX plans to integrate with, recently received a $250 million boost for RWA tokenization, doubling its total tokenized asset value. Global tokenization market overview (Source: RWA.xyz ) According to Binance Research , the tokenized RWA market surged by 260% in the first half of 2025, fueled by institutional demand and clearer regulatory frameworks like the recently passed CLARITY Act and GENIUS Act. Overall, domain name systems may be the next frontier for mass adoption in the Web3 era. Tokenized Money Funds Gain Momentum Additionally, the tokenization of money market funds is emerging as a strategic move to preserve the relevance of cash-like assets during the rapid rise of stablecoins. This is according to JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho . As digital dollar usage accelerates, especially after the recent passage of the US GENIUS Act, traditional financial institutions are turning to blockchain technology to stay competitive. Institutions like Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon began tokenizing shares of money market funds, which not only enhances fund versatility but also introduces new financial utilities, like using tokenized shares as margin collateral without losing yield. This shift is taking place at a time when stablecoins are posing a potential challenge to traditional cash-equivalent instruments. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee previously warned that stablecoins could dampen banks’ appetite for Treasury bonds, potentially impacting credit expansion. Money market funds, which typically invest in short-term government securities, stand to be directly affected by this changing dynamic. However, experts like Peter Crane of Crane Data believe that fears over diminished Treasury liquidity may be overstated—unless the stablecoin market grows a lot larger. Industry voices are increasingly acknowledging the importance of embracing blockchain innovation. State Street Global Advisors President Yie-Hsin Hung recently said that if Wall Street lags in adopting tokenization, traditional cash instruments could lose their appeal. JPMorgan’s Ho shared in an interview with Bloomberg that tokenized money market funds allow for more efficient collateral management and illustrate how these traditional instruments can evolve in a digital era.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|ENS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-30 12:00:00

Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL declines below $180 Solana faced selling pressure as buyers defended immediate Fib levels. Current technical suggests a trend correction that pushed the price below $180. Currently, the price is holding momentum around $180, as the bears seek a breakdown towards the $170 level. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 52.3, showing that the retracement has put the trend back in the healthy zone but shows room for further volatility across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line declines rapidly, suggesting rising selling pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show rising bearish momentum in the market. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish momentum continues to challenge buyers The 4-hour chart for Solana revealed a steady decline as the bears aimed to hold below the $180 price level. The recent rejection plunged the SOL price toward $175 support line. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at -0.84, with the indicator showing rising selling demand with recent candles. This suggests that SOL is yet to find a support at the $180 level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) dropped to 34, indicating that Solana still has room for further movement in the downward direction across the short term and SOL needs to defend the $175 level to prevent a breakdown towards $170.

SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates minor resistance around $190. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price falls back towards $185, SOL can be expected to hold at $180, a key level that has been defended previously. However, if the price falls below the $175 level, SOL may fall to the $168 mark. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability and speed, boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down? As bulls failed to push the SOL price above $190 resistance, it triggered a decline toward the low of $175 level. Currently, price holds above $180 but the mounting bearish pressure might make that consolidation short-lived. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of $331.81. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000?

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-30 12:00:00

49235499,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76109,1753876805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CTO Explains Why Billions Not Moving On XRP Ledger Yet Despite Partnerships with 300+ Banks,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-explains-why-billions-not-moving-on-xrp-ledger-yet-despite-partnerships-with-300-banks/,"Despite Ripple’s extensive global partnerships of over 300 banks and financial institutions, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) still sees relatively modest on-chain activity. This has raised questions within the crypto community: Why hasn’t Ripple’s widespread adoption translated into billions of dollars in daily on-chain volume? Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, recently addressed these concerns in a candid and detailed post on X. His responses offer key insights into the technical, regulatory, and strategic factors that have shaped XRPL’s growth, or lack thereof, in on-chain utility. Why On-Chain Activity Remains Limited According to Schwartz, institutional hesitation is a major reason XRP isn’t yet processing massive volumes directly on-chain. “I think there are several reasons why institutions have historically preferred to use digital assets off-chain rather than on-chain,” he explained. ""Ripple has 300+ bank partnerships, but after 13 years, shouldn't there be billions in daily on-chain volume?"" I think there are a number of reasons why institutions have historically preferred to use digital assets off chain rather than on chain. I think we're close to changing… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 30, 2025 One of the biggest challenges is regulatory compliance, particularly when using decentralized exchanges. “Even Ripple can’t use the XRPL DEX for payments yet because we can’t be sure a terrorist won’t provide the liquidity for payment,” Schwartz revealed. The inability to verify the identity and legitimacy of liquidity providers makes it difficult for regulated entities to operate on fully open networks. However, that may soon change. Ripple is developing tools like “permissioned domains,” which would allow participants to ensure they’re only transacting with verified, compliant entities. Schwartz believes such innovations will open the door for institutional on-chain activity. “We’re close to changing that because institutions are starting to see the benefits of moving on chain,” he added. Addressing XRP’s Volatility and Use Case A frequent concern is whether XRP’s price volatility makes it unsuitable for enterprise payments, especially when compared to stablecoins. But Schwartz offered a different perspective. “There are use cases where volatility isn’t a minus, or is even a plus,” he said. For many users, the potential for long-term upside outweighs the short-term risks. “As long as you aren’t very risk-averse, holding it is not a disadvantage.” And for those asking why anyone would hold a bridge currency like XRP , Schwartz made a practical point: “A bridge currency only works if someone is holding it so that you can get it precisely when you need it.” In a global financial system where it’s not always clear what asset you’ll need next, it can be more efficient to hold XRP, the dominant bridge, than to juggle multiple less liquid assets. Do Stablecoins Make Bridge Assets Obsolete? Some argue that as stablecoins grow more popular, the need for bridge currencies like XRP will vanish. Schwartz disagrees, at least in a multi-currency world. “If one stablecoin wins, then no. You would just use that stablecoin as the bridge currency,” he acknowledged. “But I don’t think one stablecoin can win for several reasons, including that a stablecoin can only be stable relative to one particular fiat currency and will always have jurisdictional ties.” In a world where multiple stablecoins exist, each backed by different currencies and subject to different regulations, a neutral, decentralized bridge asset like XRP retains clear utility. Schwartz argued that XRP would remain essential for connecting “the long tail of tokenized securities, loan portfolios, and so on.” Why Institutions Might Choose XRPL Over Private Chains Another question Schwartz addressed was why major institutions, such as BlackRock , would choose to build on XRPL instead of developing their blockchains, as companies like Robinhood are doing. “I’m not sure how much that will matter so long as we have interoperability and asset portability,” he noted. In Schwartz’s view, the blockchain ecosystem will thrive not on exclusivity but on interconnection. He drew a comparison to Circle, the issuer of USDC. “Why don’t they launch USDC only on their blockchain?” he asked. The answer is obvious: doing so would limit adoption and liquidity. The same logic, Schwartz believes, applies to tokenized real-world assets. Institutions won’t want to limit their reach by confining themselves to proprietary chains. Instead, they’ll adopt open, liquid, and well-supported networks, like XRPL.

Why would foreign governments or corporations use a network connected to a U.S.-based company like Ripple? Schwartz clarified that the XRPL itself is not a U.S.-based platform. “It has never discriminated against any particular participant, and if it ever started to, I would hope people would stop using it.” While Ripple, the company, is headquartered in the U.S., it operates licensed entities globally to serve different jurisdictions. Still, Schwartz admitted that certain regions, such as North Korea or Cuba, are unlikely to use Ripple’s technology due to international sanctions and U.S. oversight. “There might be, in some cases, pushback to a U.S. company having some control over, say, payments between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” he said. Nevertheless, Ripple continues to gain trust by operating transparently, complying with regulations, and focusing on regions where adoption is welcomed. “We build trust and we make hay where the sun shines.” Final Thoughts David Schwartz’s detailed breakdown highlights why the XRP Ledger, despite Ripple’s extensive network of bank partnerships, hasn’t yet become the world’s dominant on-chain payment infrastructure. The technology is ready, but institutions remain cautious, bound by regulatory, security, and geopolitical concerns. With innovations like permissioned domains and broader acceptance of public networks, Schwartz believes the shift to on-chain settlement is not only coming, but accelerating. When it does, XRP may finally fulfill its role as the bridge that connects the global financial system. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This new crypto token presale is more than just another name on the crypto presale list, it introduces utility, simplicity, and a real solution to common onboarding problems. As presale crypto tokens gain attention for their early entry potential, WeWake stands out by eliminating gas fees and removing the complexity of wallet integrations. It’s quickly gaining attention among crypto presale projects for its ease of use and scalable design. In a world full of speculative presale cryptocurrency launches, WeWake offers thoughtful innovation and real-world application. Whether you’re a first-time investor or browsing through crypto coins on presale, this project deserves a close look. For those aiming to buy presale crypto with purpose, WeWake may be the hidden gem among today’s top crypto presales. WeWake Removes Friction from Web3 Entry WeWake is changing how people join the Web3 world. Traditional onboarding processes often confuse users with wallet setups, seed phrases, and expensive gas fees. WeWake solves all of this with a single click. The platform introduces a walletless and gasless Layer 2 blockchain. Users don’t need to manage seed phrases or pay for every transaction. They simply log in using a social account and start interacting with Web3 apps instantly. This makes WeWake one of the most accessible crypto presale tokens available today. For developers, it provides tools like smart wallets and Paymaster APIs to cover gas fees automatically. For users, the experience feels more like using a regular app than navigating complex blockchain systems. Currently, WeWake is in Stage 4 of its presale. The price is $0.0160 and will rise to $0.0175 in the next round. So far, $260K+ has been raised out of a $350K+ stage goal, clear signs of growing demand. LINK Price Holds Firm, Momentum Builds Chainlink (LINK) continues to show resilience in the market. According to CoinMarketCap, the current LINK price is $18.72 with a 24-hour trading volume of $542 million. CoinGecko shows a slightly different figure at $18.31, with a higher volume of $741 million. LINK has increased by around 3.58% over the past day and is up 3.26% over the last week. Its market cap sits at over $12.4 billion with a circulating supply of 680 million LINK tokens. This steady growth places Chainlink among the strongest established assets to watch. While it’s not part of a presale crypto phase anymore, LINK’s performance continues to validate the strength of long-term blockchain infrastructure projects. NEAR Holds Price Around $2.92 NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is trading at $2.92, with a 24-hour trading volume of $159 million. The token has posted a 2.29% gain in the last 24 hours. However, the 7-day performance shows a slight dip of -0.17%. Despite this, NEAR continues to stay in focus as a Layer 1 solution with active developer support and expanding dApp activity. Its current valuation keeps it within reach for mid-range investors, and it maintains its position as a solid part of any diversified portfolio. NEAR offers a unique model for smart contracts and scalable design, aligning with market demand for efficient ecosystems. Final Words: Why WeWake Stands Out Today WeWake is more than just a new crypto token presale , it’s a practical step forward in user experience and blockchain accessibility. While LINK and NEAR show strength in the established market, WeWake is creating space for new users through a zero-gas, no-wallet approach. As part of today’s most talked-about crypto ICO presale projects, WeWake is drawing interest from those tired of complex onboarding. It answers real problems and brings blockchain closer to everyday users. Whether you’re comparing top crypto presales or searching for crypto coins on presale that actually solve something, WeWake offers substance over noise. This is the kind of presale crypto that earns attention for the right reasons.

49235483,https://cryptonews.com/?p=401231,1753876839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/49235483.jpeg,White House Gears Up to Publish Key Report on U.S. Crypto Strategy,https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-set-to-unveil-digital-assets-policy-blueprint-mortgage-integration-401k-inclusion-on-agenda/,"A cryptocurrency task force established by President Donald Trump is expected to release its long-awaited report on Wednesday, detailing the administration’s digital asset policy objectives. According to Reuters , this will be the group’s first public update and will reflect months of behind-the-scenes coordination to craft the White House’s stance on tokenization, crypto markets, and blockchain-based financial products. The report follows Trump’s January executive order, which called for developing a comprehensive national approach to cryptocurrency regulation and innovation. Reuters reports that the policy document will offer guidance on what legislation and regulatory frameworks should be pursued to align with the administration’s pro-crypto goals. One source told Reuters the report is expected to recommend a defined role for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in regulating blockchain-based securities such as tokenized stocks and bonds. A second source indicated that the document would also reflect the administration’s position on ongoing congressional efforts to establish clearer rules for the crypto industry. Mortgage and Retirement Accounts Could Include Crypto One of the most anticipated elements of the upcoming report is the potential inclusion of digital assets in traditional financial systems, particularly mortgages and retirement savings plans like 401(k)s. If implemented, this would represent a landmark shift in how crypto holdings are treated within mainstream finance. “If the report backs the inclusion of digital assets in mortgage assessments and 401(k) plans, it would mark a significant change in how digital asset wealth is treated,” said Liat Shetret, Vice President of Global Policy and Regulation at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. Such a move could have wide-reaching effects. For homebuyers who hold substantial crypto assets, these could be counted toward their financial profile, potentially increasing mortgage access for a new class of crypto-first consumers. However, it would also introduce new challenges for banks and lenders, including how to assess, verify, and safeguard volatile and decentralized assets. Strategic Reserve and Regulatory Clarity While some in the crypto space are eyeing the possibility of a strategic bitcoin reserve or national digital asset stockpile, experts say that regulatory clarity is far more important. Shetret stresses that institutions are eager for streamlined oversight and consistency. “Many are watching closely for signals around a pro-growth and innovation-friendly federal regulatory framework that balances a commitment to making the U.S. the global center for digital assets while also maintaining financial integrity, adds Shetret. Such a framework would likely involve cross-agency coordination, with defined supervisory roles for the SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Treasury. Industry Braces for Policy Impact The release of the report could reshape the U.S. crypto landscape and send ripple effects through global markets. While speculative attention focuses on dramatic initiatives like a bitcoin reserve, the true impact may come from how the U.S. integrates digital assets into legacy financial systems, and the degree to which legal and regulatory ambiguity is resolved. Earlier this month, in a landmark week for the U.S. crypto industry, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law . The move marked a seismic shift in the regulatory framework for digital assets, particularly dollar-backed stablecoins, and indicated a broader push by the Trump administration to bring clarity and control to the sector.

According to new regulations from the Indonesian Ministry of Finance, cryptocurrency transactions will be taxed starting August 1, and transactions made on overseas exchanges will be taxed at a higher rate. The tax rate for sellers on domestic platforms will be increased from 0.1% to 0.21%, and for sellers on international platforms, the rate will be increased from 0.2% to 1%. The value added tax (VAT) on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining will also rise from 1.1% to 2.2%. Meanwhile, the value-added tax (VAT) previously imposed on buyers will also be abolished. Furthermore, the current 0.1% special income tax on mining will be phased out by 2026, with mining revenues subject to standard personal or corporate tax rates. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a popular investment option in Southeast Asia's largest economy, where they can be legally bought and sold but not used as payment. According to regulatory data, the total transaction value of cryptocurrencies is expected to triple year-on-year to over 650 trillion rupees ($39.67 billion) in 2024.

Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE) and Bonk (BONK) are analysed for best buy zones. $DOGE already at edge of buy zone Source: TradingView The daily chart for $DOGE shows that the price has just touched on support. There could well be a reverse back to the upside from here given that all the short-term Stochastic RSI indicators, including the daily, are at their respective bottoms. In fact, the current price level, or perhaps a bit lower at the 5.0 Fibonacci level, are good places for an entry. If, and it’s a big if right now, there is one more quick impulse to the downside for Bitcoin, there is the possibility that $DOGE could fall to the strong support at $0.198, which corresponds with the 0.618 Fibonacci, the ascending trendline, and possibly the 50-day SMA (blue line). Buying at the current level, and setting limit orders down into the green box could be a decent strategy. One more dip for $PEPE takes price into buy zone Source: TradingView The 12-hour chart for $PEPE reveals that the price has dipped below the ascending trendline. While this is not particularly cause for concern, the price is also possibly taking hold below the 0.5 Fibonacci, which is also a support level. If the price continues down (depending on $BTC price movement) buys could start to be made at the 0.618 Fibonacci and into the green box. Once again, all the shorter term Stochastic RSIs are at the bottom, meaning that the next upward impulse could be quite soon. $BONK hits 0.618 Fibonacci level Source: TradingView Since hitting its top after the ascending trendline breakout, the $BONK price has chopped back down and has just touched the 0.618 Fibonacci, the most important of all the levels. A bounce from this point is quite likely. That said, if there is a bit more downside to come, limit buys in the green box could be the way to go. If the price came all the way down to the 0.786 Fibonacci, or the strong support level just above, these could be considered as great retests of this strong support zone, and buys here would be ideal.

Bank of Korea Digital Division BoK has opened a new division that will monitor the cryptocurrency market, local outlet News1 reported . The regulator also renamed the Digital Currency Research Group to the Digital Currency Group. The department will focus on stablecoins pegged to the Korean won (KRW) to prevent capital outflows and reduce reliance on stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Interest in these assets in South Korea has increased amid statements by newly elected President Lee Jae-myung. He has promised to promote KRW stablecoins. Ruling party lawmaker Min Byung-deok has introduced a bill that would establish a regulatory framework for this asset class. In response, South Korean banks and payment systems have begun actively submitting applications to register tickers for stablecoins. Crypto Taxes in Indonesia According to Reuters , new tax rules for the crypto market will come into force in Indonesia on August 1. The rate for sellers on local exchanges will increase from 0.1% to 0.21%, and for transactions on foreign exchanges—from 0.2% to 1%. At the same time, buyers will no longer pay VAT, which previously amounted to 0.11–0.22%. The tax on bitcoin mining will be decreased from 2.2% to 1.1%, and the special income tax of 0.1% will be abolished from 2026.

However, the scale of his investments is considerable, as a new infographic from Cryptonews shows. Donald Trump’s personal crypto wealth has now already exceeded the $1.2 billion mark. According to the Democratic Caucus on the U.S. Congressional Financial Services Committee, Trump has systematically worked in recent months to weaken relevant regulatory authorities and stifle ongoing proceedings to build up crypto wealth secretly. According to a recent analysis, this wealth now even exceeds the total value of his real estate portfolio. As the infographic shows, Trump’s crypto wealth is spread across several asset classes and projects with a direct or indirect connection to his name. At the top is World Liberty Financial, a crypto company with close family ties, from which, according to research, Donald Trump is said to have siphoned around $390 million. This is followed by a $315 million meme coin, for which Trump licensed his name and profited from the price increase, as well as obfuscated wallets and investments valued at $430 million. He generated further income, among other things, from the sale of his own Trump NFTs. Trump’s attributed crypto wealth according to Forbes’ research. Source: Forbes . A central element of Trump’s crypto strategy is the aggressive positioning of his media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), as an institutional Bitcoin investor. As the infographic shows, the company now holds approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities—including physical holdings, options, and exchange-traded products. Notably, the remaining liquid assets amount to only around $1 billion, meaning that roughly two-thirds of the total liquidity reserve is tied up in crypto assets. Percentage of BTC and bitcoin-related securities (“Bitcoin”) in total liquidity of the Trump Media & Technology Group. Source: Trump Media & Technology Group ; With this strategy, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) is now one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. As the infographic shows, the company already ranks sixth among all publicly traded companies with Bitcoin holdings – ahead of well-known players like Tesla, Coinbase, and Galaxy Digital. Only companies like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, and Block (formerly Square) currently hold larger BTC reserves. This position among the top holders shows the importance Bitcoin has become for TMTG’s strategic financial management – and also highlights how closely intertwined Trump’s media empire is with the cryptocurrency industry. As the infographic shows, Trump Media & Technology Group’s (TMTG) Bitcoin holdings are not only large—they also represent a significant portion of the company’s overall valuation. Approximately 40% of TMTG’s current market capitalization is accounted for by BTC holdings, underscoring the company’s dependence on the Bitcoin price. Despite its massive Bitcoin holdings, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) shares have recently performed significantly weaker than the Bitcoin price itself. As the infographic shows, the stock’s performance is clearly lagging behind the crypto asset – both in the short term and over several months. Donald Trump’s family circle is also deeply involved in the crypto strategy. His sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are among the co-founders of American Bitcoin. This company has already raised $220 million in institutional capital to finance Bitcoin reserves and mining infrastructure. At the same time, all three Trump sons are co-founders of World Liberty Financial, arguably the most central crypto vehicle in the Trump network; the US President operates there as “co-founder emeritus.” Eric Trump also recently commented publicly on Ethereum. On February 4, he described ETH as a buying opportunity and recently hinted that he sees the cryptocurrency’s fair value at $8,000. The neutrality of this Ethereum forecast can at least be questioned with regard to investments from the surrounding area. According to an analysis by the Washington Post, around 20% of current Trump advisors actively hold cryptocurrencies. This raises questions about the independence of political decision-making processes – especially at a time when crypto regulation and government Bitcoin initiatives are gaining increasing importance. The high proportion of investors in Trump’s immediate circle underscores the close personal and financial ties between politics and digital assets.

49235825,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=776245,1753877268,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49235825.jpeg,The S&P 500's best rally since 2020 faces a new opponent as historically tough stretch approaches,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sp-500-heads-into-historically-tough-stretch/,"The S&P 500 is stepping into what’s been its most difficult part of the calendar, just after clocking a 28% surge over the last 75 trading days, the biggest rally since its pandemic rebound in 2020. But now it’s August, and Wall Street knows this is where things usually get shaky. Based on Bloomberg data, the index has averaged a 0.7% drop in both August and September over the past 30 years. That stands in contrast to the 1.1% average monthly gains in the rest of the year. This downturn pattern shows up every year around this time when institutional investors return from summer, reassess their portfolios, and start prepping for the next fiscal cycle. This seasonal slowdown is now colliding with some big events on the horizon. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is expected to give a major update. Everyone’s watching Jerome Powell to see if he hints at interest rate cuts or delays any moves again. The market wants clarity, but as Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research, put it : “If Powell signals no rate cuts are coming for the foreseeable future, traders will be disappointed, and it may fuel a brief selloff.” He also warned that any bad economic news right now could easily drag the stock market down. Money managers reposition as Fed meeting nears Even though the S&P 500 just came off a strong run, there’s still nervousness about how long it can hold. JPMorgan Asset Management said this is the sharpest rally in a similar stretch since the post-crash period in 2020. The gains were largely helped by a cooling of President Donald Trump’s tariff agenda , which had earlier sent markets spinning. But the break might not last. Any new pressure from tariffs, weak earnings, or soft economic data could flip the current mood in seconds. August and September are when mutual funds start clearing losses to reduce capital gains taxes, corporations revise next year’s budgets, and retail investors tend to play it safer. Deutsche Bank says equity exposure is slightly overweight but still leaves room for fresh buying. A survey by the National Association of Active Investment Managers found that US stock allocations were cut to levels last seen in late May, showing some caution. At the same time, commodity trading advisers, who usually follow price trends, are holding long equity positions in the 94th percentile. That’s the highest since January 2020. But Kevin Murphy at Deutsche Bank pointed out that while this suggests confidence, it also raises the risk of quick selloffs if the tide turns. Long-short hedge funds see returns as volatility boosts stock picking Away from index moves, hedge funds are seeing a different kind of year. Long-short equity funds, which bet on winners and losers, are bringing in new investor capital after nearly a decade of outflows. Hedge Fund Research reported $10 billion in inflows during the first six months of 2025. That comes after $120 billion in redemptions since 2016. This new momentum follows strong gains from top names in the space. Chris Hohn’s TCI, John Armitage’s Egerton, and Kintbury Capital all posted double-digit returns in the first half of the year. Investors, looking to move beyond plain index exposure, were drawn to these strategies during recent market swings caused by Trump’s “liberation day” tariff push in April. The S&P 500 drop earlier this year gave active managers more opportunities. The long-short strategy returned 3.5% in June and is up 9.2% for the year, based on PivotalPath data. Some funds outperformed even that. In the US, Lee Ainslie’s Maverick gained 14%, and Daniel Sundheim’s D1 Capital Partners topped 20%. Mala Gaonkar’s tech-heavy SurgoCap Partners rose 17% after gaining 33% in 2024. Her firm, which started in 2023 with $1.8 billion, now manages $5 billion. These funds say they’re finally benefiting from higher rates. For years, cheap money from central banks meant stocks moved together, making it hard to pick winners or short anything with conviction. That’s changed. With more scrutiny on earnings and wider market performance, stock pickers have more room to operate. So far in 2025, the equal-weighted S&P 500 has kept pace with the standard version of the index, which is up 8% year-to-date. That’s unusual, considering the past dominance of large US tech firms. European markets have even outperformed the S&P 500 in some cases, especially with defense stocks like Rheinmetall and BAE bouncing back. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

A recent declaration from U.S. President Donald Trump has sent ripples through financial markets, and it’s crucial for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors to understand its potential implications. In a direct post on Truth Social, relayed by Walter Bloomberg on X, President Trump unequivocally stated that the August 1 deadline for ongoing trade negotiations ‘stands strong’ and will not be extended. He even characterized this firm stance as ‘a great day for America.’ But what does this decisive Trump Tariff Deadline mean for the broader economic landscape, and more specifically, for the often-unpredictable crypto market? Understanding the Trump Tariff Deadline Announcement President Trump’s latest announcement regarding the August 1 Trump Tariff Deadline underscores his consistent ‘America First’ approach to trade policy. Historically, Trump’s administration has favored aggressive negotiation tactics, often employing tariffs as leverage to secure what he deems more favorable trade agreements. This particular deadline, though not explicitly detailing the specific negotiations it pertains to, signals a firm resolve to conclude or escalate ongoing trade discussions. Source of the News: The declaration was made by President Trump himself in a post on Truth Social, subsequently reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, a well-known source for rapid financial news updates. This direct communication method bypasses traditional media filters, giving the announcement immediate weight and authenticity from the President’s perspective. The Core Message: The unambiguous statement that the August 1st deadline ‘stands strong’ and ‘will not be extended’ leaves no room for speculation. It indicates a clear intention to push for a swift resolution or to proceed with consequences if demands are not met. President’s Stance: Labeling the decision as ‘a great day for America’ suggests a belief that this firm stance will ultimately benefit U.S. economic interests, potentially by securing better trade deals or protecting domestic industries. This sentiment often resonates with his political base and aligns with his broader economic philosophy. Immediate Implication: For businesses and markets, this means a period of heightened anticipation leading up to August 1st. Companies involved in international trade, particularly those with exposure to potential tariffs, will be scrambling to assess risks and adjust strategies. Historical Context: Past Trump Tariff Deadlines and Market Reactions To truly grasp the potential impact of this new Trump Tariff Deadline , it’s beneficial to look back at previous instances of President Trump’s trade-related pronouncements and their market reverberations. During his previous term, the U.S. engaged in significant trade disputes, most notably with China, but also with allies like the European Union and Canada over steel and aluminum tariffs. These periods were often characterized by a high degree of market uncertainty and volatility, as businesses and investors grappled with unpredictable policy shifts. Consider the U.S.-China trade war, which spanned several years. The imposition of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods, from agricultural products to electronics, created immense pressure on global supply chains and corporate profitability. Each announcement, each deadline, and each negotiation round triggered significant reactions in stock markets, commodity prices, and currency valuations. While the cryptocurrency market was less mature during the peak of these trade wars, it did show interesting patterns. Bitcoin, in particular, sometimes saw spikes in demand as it was perceived by some as an uncorrelated asset or a ‘digital gold’ hedge against traditional financial instability. However, as the crypto market has matured and become more integrated with traditional finance, its correlation with equities has generally increased, meaning major downturns in traditional markets are more likely to drag crypto prices down. Potential Economic Ripple Effects of the Trump Tariff Deadline A hard deadline for trade negotiations, particularly one related to tariffs, carries significant weight for the global economy. If agreements aren’t reached by the August 1 Trump Tariff Deadline , several economic ripple effects could ensue, impacting various sectors and potentially leading to broader macroeconomic shifts: Supply Chain Disruptions: New or increased tariffs could force multinational corporations to urgently re-evaluate their sourcing and manufacturing locations. This often leads to costly and time-consuming reconfigurations, resulting in delays, higher logistical expenses, and potential shortages of goods. Companies might onshore production or seek new international partners, but these transitions are rarely smooth. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, and these costs are typically passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. For example, if tariffs are imposed on raw materials, the cost of finished goods using those materials will increase. This contributes directly to inflation, eroding purchasing power and potentially leading to a decrease in consumer spending. Reduced Corporate Earnings: Businesses facing higher input costs due to tariffs, or reduced demand because their products become more expensive, may see their profit margins shrink. This directly impacts corporate earnings, which in turn can lead to lower stock valuations, reduced investment, and even job losses in affected industries. Global Economic Slowdown: Widespread trade tensions and protectionist policies can dampen global economic growth. Uncertainty discourages both domestic and foreign investment, as businesses become hesitant to expand or commit capital in an unpredictable environment. This can lead to a contraction in international trade volumes and a general slowdown in economic activity worldwide. Currency Fluctuations: Trade imbalances and policy decisions can lead to significant shifts in currency values. For instance, if a country faces new tariffs on its exports, its currency might weaken as demand for its goods falls. Such fluctuations can further complicate international trade and investment, creating additional layers of risk for global businesses and investors. How the Trump Tariff Deadline Could Influence Crypto Markets While the immediate focus of a Trump Tariff Deadline might seem squarely on traditional financial markets, the interconnectedness of the global economy means that cryptocurrencies are rarely immune to significant macro-economic shifts. The digital asset space, though decentralized, still operates within a global financial framework that reacts to major economic news. Here’s how a firm August 1 deadline could potentially influence the crypto market: Increased Volatility: Economic uncertainty is a primary driver of volatility across all asset classes, and cryptocurrencies, already known for their price swings, could experience even greater fluctuations. Traders might react impulsively to news, leading to sharp price swings as sentiment shifts rapidly between fear and opportunity. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as smaller altcoins, could see exaggerated movements. Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of global economic stress or perceived instability, investors often move away from what they consider ‘riskier’ assets towards ‘safe havens.’ While Bitcoin has sometimes been hailed as ‘digital gold’ and a hedge against inflation or traditional market instability, its correlation with traditional equities has increased significantly in recent years. This means a substantial downturn in traditional stock markets, triggered by trade tensions, could drag crypto prices down as investors liquidate assets across the board to cover losses or move to cash. Search for Alternatives and Digital Gold Narrative: Conversely, if traditional financial systems show significant signs of strain, or if fiat currencies experience substantial devaluation due to trade wars and inflation, some investors might increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value or a hedge against traditional economic instability. This could potentially drive renewed demand for assets like Bitcoin, reinforcing its ‘digital gold’ narrative, especially if the crisis is perceived to undermine the stability of national currencies. Impact on Adoption and Innovation: Prolonged economic uncertainty could either accelerate or decelerate crypto adoption, depending on how the technology is perceived amidst the turmoil. If cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, offer practical solutions to cross-border payments, remittances, or provide inflation-resistant alternatives, their adoption might grow. However, if the market is seen as too volatile and speculative, mainstream adoption might slow down as cautious investors shy away. Liquidity Shifts: Major economic events can cause capital to flow in and out of different markets. A significant shift of funds out of traditional markets could either lead to some capital finding its way into crypto, or it could drain liquidity from crypto as investors prioritize more liquid assets for immediate needs. Navigating Market Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors Given the potential for increased market volatility stemming from the Trump Tariff Deadline , prudent investors should consider adopting a strategic and informed approach. Emotional reactions to market news can often lead to poor decisions. Here are some actionable insights to help navigate these uncertain times: Stay Informed and Verify Sources: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments, economic indicators, and official announcements from credible news sources. Be wary of unverified rumors and always cross-reference information. Understanding the nuances of trade policy and its potential impacts is paramount. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your digital eggs in one basket. A diversified crypto portfolio, including a mix of established large-cap cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin and Ethereum), stablecoins, and perhaps some carefully researched altcoins, can help mitigate risks associated with single asset price swings. Consider also diversifying across different sectors within crypto, such as DeFi, NFTs, or Layer 1 solutions. Implement Robust Risk Management: Define your personal risk tolerance and stick to it. Avoid over-leveraging in speculative trades, as sudden market movements can lead to rapid liquidations. Consider setting stop-loss orders to automatically limit potential losses during sharp downturns, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: For many, cryptocurrency investing is a long-term game, focusing on the underlying technology and its potential for future adoption. Short-term market fluctuations, while unsettling, may not significantly impact a well-researched long-term strategy. Avoid emotional trading driven by daily news cycles and focus on your long-term investment goals. Utilize Stablecoins Strategically: During periods of high volatility and uncertainty, parking a portion of your funds in stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies like USD) can offer a temporary refuge from market swings. This allows you to preserve capital while waiting for clearer market signals or opportunities. Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of making large lump-sum investments, consider investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy can help smooth out the impact of volatility over time, reducing the risk of buying at a market peak. Conduct Thorough Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, thoroughly research the projects you are considering. Understand their fundamentals, use cases, team, and community. Informed decisions are always better than speculative gambles. President Trump’s firm declaration on the August 1 Trump Tariff Deadline introduces a significant variable into the global economic equation. While the immediate focus remains on international trade, the ripple effects are likely to extend into every corner of the financial world, including the dynamic and often sensitive cryptocurrency markets. Investors should prepare for potential increased volatility and remain vigilant, adapting their strategies to navigate the evolving landscape. Understanding these macro-economic shifts is not just about anticipating price movements; it’s about making informed decisions in an increasingly interconnected global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of the August 1 Trump Tariff Deadline? A1: The August 1 deadline signifies President Trump’s firm stance that ongoing trade negotiations will not be extended. This indicates a potential escalation of trade tensions or the finalization of agreements, which can have significant global economic consequences, including impacts on supply chains, inflation, and market stability. Q2: How have past trade disputes under Trump impacted financial markets? A2: Past trade disputes, particularly the U.S.-China trade war, led to considerable market uncertainty and volatility. Stock markets experienced fluctuations, global supply chains were disrupted, and there were shifts in demand for various assets. While crypto markets were less mature then, they also showed reactions, with Bitcoin sometimes acting as a perceived hedge. Q3: Why should cryptocurrency investors pay attention to trade policy announcements? A3: Global economic policies, like trade tariffs, influence overall market sentiment, investor risk appetite, and the stability of traditional financial systems. As the crypto market becomes more integrated with the broader economy, these macro-economic shifts can directly impact cryptocurrency prices, liquidity, and investor behavior. Q4: Will the Trump Tariff Deadline cause a crypto market crash? A4: While a direct ‘crash’ is not guaranteed, the Trump Tariff Deadline could contribute to increased market volatility and a potential ‘risk-off’ sentiment, which might lead to price corrections in the crypto market. The extent of the impact depends on the specific outcomes of the trade negotiations and broader market reactions. Q5: What are some strategies for crypto investors during periods of economic uncertainty? A5: Key strategies include staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, implementing robust risk management (e.g., stop-loss orders), maintaining a long-term investment perspective, strategically utilizing stablecoins, and practicing dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR). Q6: Is Bitcoin considered a safe-haven asset during trade wars? A6: Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset during trade wars is debated. While some argue it acts as ‘digital gold’ against fiat currency devaluation or traditional market instability, its correlation with traditional equities has increased. Its safe-haven status can depend on the specific economic conditions and investor perception at the time. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

49236044,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/solana-price-prediction-could-sol-reach-300-in-2025,1753877600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/49236044.jpeg,Solana Price Prediction: Could SOL Reach $300 In 2025?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/solana-price-prediction-could-sol-reach-300-in-2025,"Solana has been one of the strongest altcoins this year . Its fast transactions and low fees have kept SOL price stable, making it a top choice for DeFi apps and NFT platforms. With more users and developers joining Solana, some experts believe SOL could hit $300 by 2026. But while Solana keeps building, a new viral altcoin, “DeSoc” could steal the spotlight. Here's everything you need to know about this amazing news project. Will Solana Hold Its Position? Solana is known for its low gas fees and fast speeds. It has become the backbone for many DeFi apps and NFT markets. As crypto adoption rises, Solana’s network activity is expected to grow. Solana will likely stay in the top 10 cryptos; I will be surprised if it doesn't. Solana has all it takes, from loyal community to real life utility and a stable SOL price. But from the point of view of someone who wants profit, if SOL gets to $300 from its current price of $186, that's not even up to 2x my investment. Smaller projects with high growth potential, like DeSoc, can bring bigger returns. Chart showing the price of SOL Which Has More Upside: SOL or DeSoc? Solana’s market cap is already huge. DeSoc, on the other hand, is still in its early stages. With a low cap, strong tokenomics and a working product, DeSoc could be one of the next 10x cryptos. For investors looking for high-growth plays in 2025, DeSoc offers more upside in the short term. It’s one of the top crypto projects under $1, with a strong use case and growing community. DeSoc isn’t a direct Solana competitor, but it’s pulling in investors who want projects with clear, real-world use cases. Key Features Making DeSoc Stand Out Despite SOL $300 Prospect Despite the possibility of Solana value going up in the next few days, investors still have their sights on DeSoc for the following reasons: ● API integration with major social media platforms● Transparent blockchain data stops fake accounts● Incentivized participation through $SOCS token rewards● $SOCS used for ads, content boosts, and microtransactions● Audited smart contracts for top-tier security The Best Investment Opportunity for August We can't take away the fact that Solana is a reliable investment. It remains a top player in the DeFi space. But DeSoc is proving that smaller, utility-driven projects can rise fast. As DeSocgains traction, it could become a serious contender in 2025’s altcoin race. Both SOL and $SOCS have room to grow. Solana promises between 1.5x to 2x while DeSocpromises over 10x profit within the same time. So, for those chasing bigger gains, DeSoc might be the better bet this year.

Is Solana a Sustainable Investment? As Solana continues to grow, driven by increasing adoption and network expansion, it maintains its allure among investors. However, as an investor eyeing potential gains, the rise to $300 per SOL offers less than a double return from its current standing. In contrast, new and agile projects like DeSoc are on the radar for potentially larger returns due to their early-stage development and high-growth prospects. Distinguishing Features of DeSoc in the Cryptocurrency Landscape Amidst the speculative atmosphere on Solana's future value, DeSoc garners attention with distinct advantages: ● API Integration with major social platforms enhances accessibility and functionality.● Transparent blockchain data helps eliminate fraudulent accounts.● Incentives via $SOCS token rewards promote active participation.● $SOCS is utilized for advertising, boosting content, and facilitating microtransactions, enriching its utility.● Security is bolstered through audited smart contracts, ensuring robust protection for users. Comparative Analysis: Solana vs. DeSoc Solana's well-established market presence positions it firmly among the top ten cryptocurrencies, suggesting a secure investment. Nonetheless, DeSoc, with its burgeoning community and practical use cases, presents itself as a vibrant contender offering considerable growth potential. For those seeking high-growth investment opportunities in 2025, DeSoc offers more upside in the shorter term, standing out as one of the top crypto projects under $1. Investment Insights for 2025 As both Solana and DeSoc present unique opportunities, investors are encouraged to weigh these options based on their risk tolerance and growth expectations. Solana offers a more stable but modest growth trajectory, while DeSoc could deliver exponential returns. Explore DeSoc's presale here and tap into its potential early.

The lawyers for the pair told the court on Tuesday they intended to make fresh pleas at a hearing set for Wednesday morning. Earlier last year, the two co-founders had pleaded not guilty to charges. The co-founders of Samourai are facing up to 25 years in prison In April 2024, Samourai CEO Keonne Rodriguez and CTO William Lonergan Hill denied accusations that they were running an unlicensed money transmitting operation enabling over $2 billion in illegal transfers , including to dark web markets such as Silk Road. The two now face a single consolidated conspiracy charge to launder money with a maximum prison term of 20 years. They are also accused of running an unlicensed money-transfer business, which carries an added five-year sentence, meaning they could see as much as 25 years in prison. Federal Judge Denise Cote, in a court filing, set a Wednesday morning hearing to consider the plea changes. However, the court filing did not provide further details about how those amended pleas could influence sentencing. The trial, however, was scheduled to begin on November 3. Earlier, the defendants had attempted to dismiss the case, arguing that a memo issued on April 7 by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche suggested the DOJ would not pursue cases involving unintentional breaches of regulations by crypto mixer operators. Later, Samourai’s lawyers also claimed that the federal prosecutors had failed to disclose key advice indicating the firm didn’t need a money-transmission license—an assessment made half a year before charges were brought. Still, both attempts to derail the case fell flat. Roman Storm is still being tried for his involvement in money laundering In another case, the US court recently overturned the sanctions against crypto exchange Tornado Cash , which OFAC had blacklisted in August 2022. It ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, concluding that OFAC acted beyond its statutory authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash in 2022. In a filing, the court wrote, “It is ordered and adjudged that the judgment of the district court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion of this court.” The exchange had been sanctioned for allegedly aiding North Korea’s Lazarus Group in laundering $455 million in stolen cryptocurrency. One of its founders, Roman Storm , is currently being tried before a jury. His supporters, however, caution that a guilty verdict could criminalize open-source privacy tools and result in serious implications for DeFi innovation and digital privacy rights. Storm has been charged with the following: conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate US sanctions. He faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted of all counts. Last year, a Dutch court found Alexey Pertsev, another Tornado Cash developer, guilty of laundering $1.2 billion in illicit assets. It sentenced him to five years and four months. Pertsev had previously insisted that he shouldn’t be responsible for users’ behavior. But the court didn’t buy that defense, saying that he and the other Tornado Cash co-founders could have done more to prevent the protocol from being used improperly. Get seen where it counts.

DeSoc, Ripple and Solana are top picks right now. Each project offers different benefits. If you are looking for one altcoin that guarantees profit , you will have to consider different factors. Let’s break them down. Ripple (XRP): A Veteran Still Fighting Ripple has been in the crypto space for years. It focuses on cross-border payments for banks. In 2024, Ripple won a key court case against the SEC. This gave XRP a price bump. But the gains didn’t last long. Ripple’s price still struggles to stay above $3. Growth has been slow. While Ripple’s tech and use case is strong, it faces heavy competition from newer projects. Chart showing the price of XRP Investors are growing tired of waiting for XRP to finally take off. Solana (SOL): Fast and Cheap But Not Perfect Solana is popular for its fast transaction speeds and low gas fees. It’s viewed as a worthy Ethereum rival because NFT projects and DeFi apps prefer building on Solana. The network is cheaper and faster than Ethereum. But Solana has problems too. The network has gone offline several times. Critics say Solana is too centralized. Despite this, SOL remains a strong choice for buyers. Analysts think Solana could hit $300 in 2025 if crypto markets stay bullish. Chart showing the price of SOL DeSoc: The New Altcoin Grabbing Attention DeSoc decentralized social media platform that pays users for posting, sharing, and engaging with content. Every action is recorded on the blockchain. This stops bots and fake accounts from cheating the system. DeSoc’s $SOCS token is used for rewards, ads and content boosts. This gives it a real-world use case, not just hype. DeSoc has already raised over $10 million from early investors. A wallet app is launching soon. This has caught the attention of crypto whales, placing it as one of the next big altcoin. Why DeSoc Could Be 2025’s Breakout Altcoin Social media platforms are filled with fake likes and bot accounts. DeSoc fixes this. By recording all actions on the blockchain, DeSoc ensures every user is real. People get rewarded fairly for their content and engagement. This makes DeSoc a project with real utility . It’s not just a token with no purpose. There's buzz around the project probably because: ● Over $10M has been raised and is growing● Pays users for social media actions● Low gas fee transactions● Whales are loading up on $SOCS● Token bonuses live now for early buyers As more people seek fairer platforms, DeSoc could explode in value. Which Crypto Should You Choose? Ripple has been slow to deliver gains. On the other hand, Solana is strong but faces trust issues due to network outages. DeSoc is a fresh project solving real problems in social media. It rewards users directly and cuts out fake activity. For buyers looking for the next 10x altcoin, DeSoc could be the best pick. The $SOCS token is still early. As more users join, demand for the token will rise. DeSoc is not just another hype coin. It’s a crypto project with a clear purpose. That’s why many believe it could be the next big thing in 2025. To get started, Click This Link To Check Out TheDesoc Presale .

Our latest Proof of Reserves (PoR) audit , finalized as of June 30, 2025 , once again verifies that client assets held on our platform are backed 1:1 and beyond. The process covers major cryptoassets, including BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, USDT, XRP and ADA . We don’t expect blind trust. We don’t need it. We offer cryptographic evidence. New to PoR? Learn how it works in our beginner’s guide . What our June 2025 report shows Our PoR audit captures a complete snapshot of client assets across all services – not just spot balances. It includes margin accounts, futures holdings and staked assets , offering a full-spectrum look at customer exposure. Reserve ratios as of June 30, 2025 A quick refresher – what is Proof of Reserves? Proof of Reserves is a cryptographic process that allows clients to verify, independently and privately, that their assets are included in a third-party-audited snapshot of the platform’s liabilities. We use a Merkle tree to combine individual balances into a single cryptographic hash. Clients receive a personalized Merkle proof , which they can use to confirm inclusion without revealing personal details. An independent auditor then confirms that Kraken’s onchain holdings exceed total client balances – effectively verifying full reserves without assumptions. Why Kraken’s PoR goes further While more exchanges are now offering “PoRs” in some form, not all of them offer the same level of rigor or transparency. Here’s what sets ours apart: 1. We account for liabilities, not just assets Some platforms show what they hold – but skip what they owe. We include total client liabilities in every audit. Anything less isn’t a full proof of reserves. 2. User-level verification Every client can verify their own inclusion using our open-source Merkle verification tool. This isn’t just about trust – it’s about verification. 3. A decade of consistency We first pioneered PoR in 2014 – and we haven’t stopped. Kraken conducts PoR regularly and methodically , not just during news cycles. PoR is vital. It’s not about promises. It’s about proof – visible, cryptographic, third-party-verified proof. Kraken’s process is built to withstand scrutiny and empower users with information. What’s next – expanding scope We’re committed to publishing PoRs quarterly , alongside our financial disclosures, to ensure users have a regular window into platform solvency. We’re also actively working to expand the coverage of our PoRs to include more supported assets , giving a broader view of the reserves across our ecosystem. Since the beginning, Kraken has stood for accountability, independence and crypto-first values . We believe transparency should be an industry norm, not an afterthought. That’s why we’ll keep raising the bar. Ready to verify your account? Visit our Proof of Reserves portal .

This comes as ETH eyes a breakout against its BTC pair, which could spark a massive run for the crypto and other altcoins. Ethereum Price Eyes Rally To $9,000 This Cycle In an X post, Lourenço opined that the Ethereum price could rally to as high as $9,000 at some point in this market cycle. This came as he analyzed the weekly ETH chart. The analyst noted that, depending on how the trend on the upper side of the wedge is drawn, the altcoin may have already broken it with hard closes above. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To $20,000? ETH Is Mirroring Bitcoin’s Move From 2021 Lourenço declared that the $4,000 level is an important one and that once it flips into support, there will be additional resistance between $4,700 and $5,000. However, the analyst believes that the Ethereum price is ultimately set to go and tag between $8,000 and $9,000. He also indicated that the risk-return ratio on ETH is very hard to ignore at the moment. Crypto analyst Galaxy also echoed a similar bullish sentiment for the Ethereum price. In an X post, he said that there is a lot of potential upside for ETH on the BTC pair. The analyst noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still bottomed and that, from his perspective, the trend is just beginning. His accompanying chart showed that the RSI isn’t in overbought levels despite the fact that the Ethereum price has rallied over 60% in the past month. Notably, ETH’s RSI had surged above 60 on previous highs, including when it reached its current ATH of $4,800 in 2021. The Key Is For ETH To Break Above $4,000 In an X post, crypto analyst Ted revealed that the key is for the Ethereum price to break above the $4,000 level. He noted that since the 2021 ATH, ETH hasn’t been able to reclaim the $4,000 level. However, if that happens this time around, he declared that the ETH pump will be “unstoppable.” Related Reading: Crypto Founder Reveals What Will Drive Ethereum Price To $10,000 His accompanying chart showed that the Ethereum price could rally to $5,200 in the short term. This will mark a new all-time high for the altcoin. Crypto analyst Merlijn also hammered on the $4,000 resistance. He noted that this has been the ceiling for ETH since 2021, and it has been rejected from this level seven times. However, the Ethereum price is again looking to break above this level. Merlijn remarked that this resistance isn’t just another resistance but the “gate to price discovery.” His accompanying chart showed that ETH could reach $11,000 between now and 2026 if it breaks this resistance level. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
