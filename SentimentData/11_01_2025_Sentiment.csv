On top BlockDAG (BDAG) is surging in presale, with a collection surpassing $178.5 million, shines, especially with its LAUNCH300 offer that promises simplified portfolio expansion appealing to many. Ethereum’s potential rise to $12,000 by 2025 is propelled by its Pectra upgrade and expected regulatory clarity, reinforcing its role as a stalwart in decentralized finance. On the other hand, XRP’s trading boost to $3.8 billion indicates increasing momentum and strategic ecosystem alliances. BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 Streamlines Growth for Crypto Buyers BlockDAG’s crypto presale has been an extraordinary voyage, amassing over $178.5 million and securing the backing of over 170,000 holders. Indeed, it’s the enthusiasm and trust from an expanding community that has pushed the BDAG coin from $0.001 to $0.0248, signaling strong faith in its future. Furthermore, to enhance the experience, BlockDAG has rolled out the LAUNCH300 promotion. It’s straightforward and effective—use the code LAUNCH300 during your acquisition, and your BDAG holdings instantly triple. For example, acquiring 1,000 BDAG results in receiving 3,000 BDAG, making portfolio growth straightforward and accessible to all, whether experienced or new. Additionally, the LAUNCH300 initiative acts as a bond between BlockDAG and its community, a symbol of mutual commitment. Coupled with the presale’s achievements, it’s evident that BlockDAG is nurturing more than a blockchain—it’s cultivating a supportive, confident community. Ethereum Eyes $12K with Pectra Upgrade on the Horizon Ethereum’s value might hit $12,000 by 2025, influenced by crucial technological and governmental factors. The anticipated Pectra upgrade, scheduled for early 2025, is designed to boost Ethereum’s efficiency and minimize transaction delays, potentially bolstering its prominence in decentralized finance and smart contracts. Furthermore, political shifts, including the expected pro-crypto stance of President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, might provide clearer regulations, boosting Ethereum’s appeal. The options market is also showing signs of confidence, with a preference for call options suggesting anticipated price increases. Additionally, the percentage of long-term Ethereum holders has grown from 59% to 75% over the past year, indicating increased confidence in Ethereum’s prospects. Nonetheless, Ethereum faces challenges if Ether-based ETFs falter, as newer blockchains like Solana could present strong competition due to their speed and lower costs. These elements together forecast a positive path for Ethereum. XRP Rallies with $3.8 Billion in Trades as Market Eyes Upswing XRP’s trade volumes have surged to $3.8 billion, reflecting a significant uptick in market interest. Currently priced at $0.55, XRP has maintained stability despite general market volatility. Market analysts highlight its Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63, signaling strong momentum without being overextended, thus drawing attention from traders eyeing upcoming price shifts. Key resistance is noted at $0.60, a breach of which could significantly lift XRP’s value, while a support level at $0.50 offers a robust buffer against downward trends. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bullish trend, supported by increasing trading volumes. Additionally, XRP benefits from Ripple’s strategic partnerships and strengthening network, making it a focal point in the crypto trading arena, engaging both institutional and casual traders. Last Say The successful presale of BDAG, along with the LAUNCH300 campaign, highlights its commitment to providing value to its community. Ethereum’s anticipated Pectra upgrade and its future market influence underscore its continued impact on decentralized finance. Meanwhile, XRP’s trading activity and network growth underscore the varied opportunities available in the market.

This indicates that U.S. mining operations are becoming more important. The report also mentioned that mining profits increased in December. Bitcoin Mining Profits Increased in December This rise was mainly due to a 15% jump in Bitcoin prices, which grew faster than the network’s hashrate, which went up 6.5% during the same time. This rise in Bitcoin price helps miners, making their operations more profitable. However, the difficulty of mining is also rising, as shown by the growing network hashrate. Miners who work efficiently and have access to cheap energy will benefit the most from the higher Bitcoin prices. Meanwhile, Jefferies has lowered its price target for Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), a leading U.S. Bitcoin miner, from $24 to $20. The bank keeps a “hold” rating on MARA shares, advising caution because of increasing network difficulty and the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency prices. Shifting Focus: Bitcoin Miners Diversify to Stay Ahead The competition for resources has grown more intense, with Bitcoin miners now competing with AI developers to access power grids. AI technology needs a lot of computational power. As such, many companies are leasing their data centers to AI firms to cut costs. Companies like Hut 8 and Hive Digitals are exploring this option to ease their financial pressures. Meanwhile, others like Marathon are expanding internationally, moving to countries like Kenya and Paraguay. This is because these regions have surplus, affordable, and sustainable energy. Additionally, many companies are turning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to reduce high expenses. These sources offer stable pricing and lower reliance on the fluctuating power grid, helping to offset high mining costs. Bitcoin Records Largest Drop in Mining Difficulty As reported in May, Bitcoin mining difficulty fell by 5.7%, marking the highest negative adjustment since December 2022, when it fell by 7%. Notably, this negative difficulty adjustment is correlated with a 10% decline in Bitcoin’s hash rate since the previous adjustment on April 24. This is evidenced by a drop from a seven-day moving average of 639.58 EH/s to 578.74 EH/s. However, the average block times increased to 10 minutes and 36 seconds before the adjustment. The dip in hash rate resulted in Bitcoin’s hash price plunging to an all-time low of $50 per PH/s per day ($0.05 per TH/s per day) on April 29. Simultaneously, the BTC’s price retraced below the $63,000 level.

According to the country’s Ministry of National Treasury and Economic Planning, the draft regulations were developed through a multi-agency task force. The Kenyan Ministry of National Treasury and Economic Planning published a request for public comments on two draft legislations related to crypto. The Ministry also rolled out the Virtual Assets Service Providers bill, which is set to be tabled before parliament. Kenyan government invites the public to make comments on draft crypto regulations The Ministry of National Treasury and Economic Planning set January 2025 as the deadline for public participation in the two legislations. The first legislation is the draft policy on virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, and the second is the Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill 2024. According to the ministry, the two legislations were formulated by a multi-agency task force within the country. The ministry added that the bill and policy would be accessible to the public on its official website. The government agency highlighted that public participation was in accordance with the Statutory Instruments Act 2013. The act provides that citizens should air their views on any intended laws and regulations within the country. The ministry added it would also conduct public participation forums nationwide and outlined the schedule in the announcement. John Mbadi, Kenya’s cabinet secretary for the National Treasury and Economic Planning Ministry, appreciated the need for financial inclusion through technological advancements within the county. He also recognised the rise in virtual assets in the global space presented opportunities for innovation in the local financial system. Mbadi also acknowledged the rise of virtual assets presented challenges such as terrorism financing, money laundering, fraud and cybercrime. The cabinet secretary noted that these challenges underscored the urgent need for a legal and regulatory framework to govern virtual assets. He emphasized that the Kenyan government was committed to leveraging opportunities presented by Virtual assets and Virtual asset service providers. Mbadi added the policy was intended to create a fair market for virtual assets within the country. In the policy, the cabinet secretary commented, “The policy takes account of regulatory approaches from various jurisdictions and provides a framework that is adaptive and flexible for domestic and international cooperation, compliance, consumer protection, financial innovation and management of risks.” The ministry outlined the intended act’s objectives as providing a legislative framework to regulate virtual asset service providers and address risks associated with misusing virtual asset products and service provider services. The bill’s objectives also included establishing virtual asset service providers and issuers of initial virtual asset offerings in Kenya, licensing virtual asset service providers, and approving the issuance of initial virtual asset offerings. The ministry also specified that the agencies that would enforce the act would include the Capital Markets Authority and the Central Bank of Kenya. It stated that agencies should ensure financial stability and market integrity within the country. Kenyan government shifts position despite warnings from the Central Bank In 2015, the Central Bank of Kenya issued a press statement cautioning the public on virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. The central bank raised concerns over the public’s trading of cryptocurrencies despite being unregulated under national laws. The CBK informed the public that cryptocurrencies were not legal tender and that consumers would have no recourse if the virtual currencies failed. It raised some risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including the fact that the assets were untraceable and highly volatile. Despite the global regulatory shifts, the Central Bank of Kenya has reportedly maintained its position on cryptocurrencies over the years. The capital markets authority warned the public against crypto-related transactions; however, the agency later softened its stance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) advised Kenya to implement a regulatory framework to help address the risks presented by virtual assets. In its report, the IMF stated that crypto exchanges could not obtain licenses within the country, exposing consumers to potential fraud and financial losses.

Amid the turmoil, the protocol's USD0++ token, which represents a locked-up – or staked – version of its $1-anchored stablecoin USD0, fell briefly below 90 cents from $1 on decentralized marketplace Curve. The protocol's governance token, USUAL, plummeted as much as 17% through the day before recovering some of the losses. The selloff was caused by a change in the redemption mechanism of USD0++ token introduced by the team on Thursday that caught investors and liquidity providers off-guard. By design, USD0 is backed by short-term government securities to keep its price at $1. Stakers on Usual receive USD0++ that comes with a four-year lock-up period, meaning that investors are locking up their funds without being able to redeem in exchange for rewards earned in the form of the protocol's USD0 and USUAL tokens. Yield farmers rushed in, catapulting the protocols total value locked (TVL), a key DeFi metric, to $1.87 billion earlier this week from less than $300 million in October. However, the new feature called ""dual-path exit"" will allow investors to redeem the locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price, or at par, by giving up a part of the rewards earned, calling the 1:1 exchange rate into question. The abrupt implementation drew criticism across DeFi users for changing the design without warning. In certain liquidity pools , the token's price was hardcoded to worth $1, causing havoc among borrowers and liquidity providers. ""Did they just allow degens to jump in at 1:1 and then rug the USD0++?,"" prominent DeFi analyst Ignas said in an X post . ""They pushed for the largest USD0/USD0++ pool on Curve knowing all well that USD0++ shouldn't trade at 1:1."" ""DeFi continues learning the most important truth about pegs: a peg is a story about why two things that are not the same are interchangeable for each other,"" noted Patrick McKenzie, advisor to payments firm Stripe. The Usual team said in a statement that the design change with the early unstaking mechanism was communicated in advance from October. The protocol will also activate the revenue switch starting on Monday and start distributing the protocol's earnings to governance token holders who stake their coin for longer-term (USUALx). ""The current situation regarding USD0++ stems from a misunderstanding of the protocol’s mechanisms along with a communication that should have been better articulated,"" the statement reads. ""We apologize and we’ll continue to do our best to communicate transparent information to users."" The episode is another lesson for crypto investors about the potential risks of DeFi products that entice users with high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels. ""Users who are taking risk need to know what the exact rules are and be able to trust that they won't change, otherwise it can result in market panic,"" Rob Hadick, general partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly, told CoinDesk. ""We should be thankful this happened now, before the protocol became a risk to the broader DeFi ecosystem."" Still, USD0++ traded recently at 0.91 USD0 in the Curve pool, while the protocol's total value locked , a key DeFi metric, dropped below $1.6 billion.",Markets|DeFi|Stablecoin|Yield,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-10 22:26:55

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS.

Here Is the Pertinent Level To Watch,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-30-decline-discount/,"Recent price action has seen Dogecoin stuck in a correction path for over a month now, and the meme now finds itself trading just above the $0.3 mark. Particularly, Dogecoin has retraced by about 30% since it reached a recent multi-year peak of $0.48 in early December, and bullish traders are now patiently waiting for the next leg up. According to technical analysis, Dogecoin’s recent confluence at the $0.3 price level presents an attractive opportunity to load up more of the cryptocurrency before an upward bounce from here. Dogecoin’s $0.3 Support Zone Holds Key Significance The $0.3 price level has emerged as a critical support zone for the meme coin moving forward, with multiple analyses referencing this price point. According to a technical analysis of Dogecoin’s daily candlestick price action on the TradingView platform, this level aligns with historical support zones that have previously served as reliable demand areas during market downturns. The technical appeal of this zone is more notable due to its correlation with broader market sentiment, as the Bitcoin price is currently hovering near its own significant support level. Related Reading: What To Expect After The Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 With this in mind, Dogecoin’s retracement to $0.3 could not only serve as a potential bottom for the current correction but also as a launching pad for the next bullish wave, provided Bitcoin and other market conditions align favorably. Furthermore, it provides traders the opportunity to load up more Dogecoin tokens at a 30% discount and position themselves for maximum gains before the wider crypto market recovers and resumes its upward momentum. Is A Broader Market Recovery On The Horizon? As one of the largest cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is easily influenced by market dynamics, including things like news updates and Bitcoin’s price action. Particularly, Dogecoin’s upward momentum in the last quarter of 2024 had no reason to be derailed if not for Bitcoin’s failure to hold above the psychological $100,000 price level. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Unsurprisingly, on-chain data shows some Dogecoin whale addresses might already be capitalizing on this discount in anticipation of this market-wide recovery. Whale transactions involving Dogecoin recently surged by over 400%. Furthermore, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows that Dogecoin’s large transaction volume recently rose to over $60.9 billion in a 24-hour timeframe. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3328 and is down by about 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The $0.3 price level remains a pertinent range to keep an eye on, as a successful defense of this level paired with strengthening BTC prices could lay the groundwork for a renewed Dogecoin rally. A prudent approach would be to set stop losses below this level in case of a deeper correction, which could invalidate short-term bullish momentum.

Priced at just $0.0420 during its presale, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a rare opportunity to invest in an AI-powered platform poised to redefine digital asset management. Analysts forecast that this token could skyrocket to $1.2, positioning it as a game-changer in the crypto space.

With cutting-edge AI innovations and a robust ecosystem, WallitIQ (WLTQ) promises not only substantial returns but also practical applications that appeal to both novice and experienced investors.

WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Next Big Thing In Crypto Innovation As XRP price predictions captivate the market, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is carving out its own path to success with groundbreaking features that make it a standout token. Analysts project a staggering 30,000% growth for WLTQ, taking it from $0.0420 to $1.2 after its launch. This impressive surge potential is rooted in WallitIQ’s AI-powered platform, which delivers unparalleled functionality in digital asset management.

Currently priced around $2.450 according to CoinMarketCap, XRP’s goal of hitting $5 represents a significant 10x growth. However, while the XRP price offers stability and a promising future, its growth potential pales in comparison to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) anticipated 30,000% rally.

With AVAX experiencing swings and DOT showing steady potential, enthusiasts are keeping an eye on these significant projects. Avalanche is boosting scalability with its exciting Avalanche9000 upgrade, while Polkadot is expanding its influence in decentralized apps. In this scenario, BlockDAG stands out with its $1M Raffle, a clever way to spread BDAG coins and boost adoption. The raffle not only offers a hefty 200% coin bonus, reflecting the success of the presale, but it also sets up participants for immediate rewards and future ecosystem growth. With the mainnet launch approaching, BlockDAG (BDAG) promises not just prizes but a gateway to what’s coming. BlockDAG’s $1M Raffle: Pave Your Path to Massive Wealth BlockDAG’s $1M Raffle is more than a chance to win big—it’s a strategic initiative to increase adoption and enhance its network. Offering big prizes along with a 200% BDAG coin bonus, the raffle offers immediate benefits and motivates long-term involvement in its expanding network. This approach keeps the momentum going even when the crypto market is down, showing the project’s forward-thinking strategy. The raffle features three ticket levels, catering to various budgets. The Bronze Ticket requires a $250 BDAG buy-in for a chance at a $250,000 USDT prize, the Silver Ticket at $500 offers a shot at $500,000 USDT, and the Gold Ticket at $1000 gives participants the best chance to win the $1M USDT grand prize, positioning the raffle as an appealing option for both newcomers and long-term backers. Following a successful presale that garnered over $178.5 million and sold more than 17.8 billion BDAG coins at $0.0248 each, early participants have enjoyed a substantial 2,380% ROI. These achievements underscore the community’s confidence in the project, despite the wider fluctuations in the crypto market. With the upcoming mainnet launch, the raffle is not just an isolated event but a part of BlockDAG’s broader vision to distribute coins widely, reward its community, and establish a foundation for a decentralized future. 2025 AVAX Price Movements: Riding the Waves of Change Avalanche (AVAX) continues to capture headlines as its price movements suggest both challenges and opportunities for 2025. Currently valued at around $36.68, the coin has recently seen a 5.95% decrease due to overall market shifts. However, its prospects are bolstered by the Avalanche9000 upgrade, aimed at boosting scalability and reducing costs, ensuring its vital role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and more. Last year, AVAX reached a peak of $65.39 but fell to $17.29 in August, displaying its unpredictable nature. Analysts foresee a possible recovery, with price expectations possibly reaching up to $81 by the end of 2025, contingent on market trends and its ecosystem’s development. Avalanche’s continuous technological progress and growing use make it a focal point in this year’s crypto watchlist. Prospects for DOT: Poised for Consistent Expansion Polkadot (DOT) stands out as a formidable force for 2025, with forecasts indicating a possibility for consistent expansion. Trading at $6.65, Polkadot is enhancing its infrastructure, promoting interoperability, and facilitating decentralized applications. The network’s unique parachain auctions and increased utilization reinforce its status as a prime blockchain resource for developers and various initiatives. Despite the ups and downs of 2024, where DOT fluctuated between $10.50 and $4.30, the outlook remains guardedly positive. Estimates for DOT’s 2025 performance suggest an average price of $12.50, potentially soaring to $40, driven by heightened activity within its ecosystem and strategic alliances. As Polkadot’s presence in DeFi’s Total Value Locked (TVL) escalates, it continues to be recognized as a dependable, enduring blockchain choice amidst the crypto evolution. The Decisive Trends of 2025 As we step further into 2025, both Avalanche and Polkadot are making significant strides. AVAX’s price dynamics reveal both instability and promise, with its technological enhancements capturing market interest. On the other hand, DOT’s expected growth is supported by its broadening ecosystem and rising acceptance in DeFi sectors. Amidst these trends, BlockDAG introduces an appealing prospect with its $1M Raffle, merging immediate incentives with prospects for prolonged development. The 200% coin bonus echoes the triumph of its initial crypto presale , emphasizing its dedication to community enhancement. For those in search of ventures that offer immediate advantages while promising future opportunities, BlockDAG’s raffle stands out as a pivotal initiative this year.

The Chainlink rally has captured attention with a remarkable 18% price surge in three days, fueled by heightened whale activity. Meanwhile, Injective’s 3.0 upgrade has entered its first phase, marking the beginning of its deflationary journey and setting the stage for future growth. Among these exciting trends, Web3Bay (3BAY) , a leading decentralized e-commerce platform, has smashed several presale milestones. The platform has raised over $560,000, with more than 150 million 3BAY tokens sold, further showcasing the potential of web3 technology to revolutionize e-commerce. With such notable movements across the sector, it’s clear that the momentum for innovative blockchain solutions is stronger than ever. Surge In Whale Activity Boosts Chainlink Rally Chainlink (LINK) has been gaining attention for an impressive 18% price surge in just three days. This Chainlink rally was ignited after the token retested a critical support level near $19, drawing significant attention from crypto whales. Over 1.40 million LINK tokens were purchased within a span of four days. On-chain metrics further support this Chainlink rally, with a consistent decrease in exchange outflows, signaling that fewer investors are preparing to sell their holdings. Analysts speculate that whales are strategically positioning themselves for potential gains as the “altcoin season” approaches. New Injective Upgrade Strengthens Its Deflationary Mechanisms The latest Injective upgrade, Injective 3.0, has introduced a disruptive deflationary model, making the network more adaptable and inflation-resistant. By adjusting the token supply based on staking activity, this upgrade enhances efficiency and aims to boost the deflation rate by an impressive 400%. Currently, 56% of Injective’s token supply is staked, offering a competitive yield of 10.68%. This figure outpaces other major networks like Ethereum and Solana, signaling growing confidence in Injective’s long-term potential. Despite its progress, Injective struggles to attract significant developer activity, especially when compared to networks like Sui, Aptos, and Coinbase’s Base. 3BAY’s $550K Success Story: An E-Commerce Gamechanger Web3Bay (3BAY), a rising e-commerce platform powered by web3 technology, is setting a new standard in digital commerce by utilizing blockchain to create a secure, transparent, and community-driven platform. Built to enable seamless transactions and ensure user data remains fully protected, Web3Bay’s decentralized approach removes the limitations of centralized e-commerce platforms. At the heart of the ecosystem is the 3BAY token, which facilitates transactions, incentivizes participation, and empowers the community with decision-making capabilities. The numbers behind Web3Bay’s presale underline its growing potential and market appeal. To date, the platform has raised over $560,000, with more than 150 million tokens sold. This milestone demonstrates the confidence investors and users alike have placed in Web3Bay’s vision. The current 3BAY token price of $0.0039675 in presale stage 3 offers an attractive opportunity to invest in the future of e-commerce. Web3Bay’s strong presale performance not only reflects trust in the platform but also highlights the demand for solutions that decentralization brings to the digital marketplace. With limited tokens available at presale pricing, the opportunity to join Web3Bay during this stage shouldn’t be overlooked. The growing interest in the 3BAY token suggests that it is positioned for significant growth, potentially reaching $0.1959 at launch. For anyone buying 3BAY tokens at the current price, this translates to a potential 6,430% ROI! Unlocking The Next Chapter In Web3 Technology The Chainlink rally and the latest Injective upgrade demonstrate the growing potential of blockchain technology to redefine digital ecosystems. Chainlink’s recent surge driven by whale activity highlights its appeal to strategic investors. Similarly, Injective’s deflation-focused advancements highlight its commitment to sustainable growth. However, Web3Bay emerges as a standout platform, embodying the core principles of web3 technology through its decentralized marketplace. With over 150 million tokens sold and $560,000 raised during its presale, Web3Bay showcases its ability to attract strong market interest and build a loyal community. The current presale stage 3 price of $0.0039675 per token offers an exceptional opportunity to secure a position in this growing ecosystem before the presale closes and the 3BAY token realizes its full value.

According to a new report by The Financial Times, the CFPB – which aims to protect consumers from unfair financial practices by institutions – is proposing a new rule that would mandate crypto firms refund money stolen from customers via exploits or hacks. The report says that by proposing this new rule, the CFPB is extending the same protections traditional bank accounts have to the crypto wallets of crypto users. If the rule is accepted, it would change the definition of “funds” to include any asset used to make payments and would force crypto wallet providers to compensate users if their funds are stolen. Previously, data from market intelligence platform Chainalysis found that in 2024, crypto platforms lost a staggering $2.2 billion from hacks in 2024, a 20% increase from the previous year. Chainalysis also found that exploits significantly slowed down in the second half of 2024. However, the firm also found that in 2024, North Korean hackers stole more digital assets than ever before. According to the data, North Korean hackers stole $1.34 billion worth of crypto assets in 2024 while in 2023, they stole $660 million.

According to data insight from Santiment, the number of HODLers for these altcoins has fluctuated thus far this new year. The crypto analytics platform hinted at the implication of the HODLer count within each protocol’s ecosystem. The Ethereum and XRP Standout Santiment profiled six digital currencies, including the aforementioned Bitcoin and Chainlink. While Chainlink underperformed with 3,300 drops in hodler wallets, Ethereum and XRP stood out. The shared data showed that Ethereum had recorded a 645,000 uptick in its hodler wallets. This figure underscores its dominance as the top altcoin among retail investors. XRP followed closely with a total hodler wallet recording a 58,000 count since the start of the year. Ranking as the only meme cryptocurrency profiled by Santiment, Dogecoin has seen a 29,000 jump in investors holding it for the long term. Cardano scored the lowest figure, with just 2,800 wallets committing to long-term growth. As 2025 has kicked off with roller coastering prices for crypto’s top assets, the amount of hodlers have fluctuated wildly since the new year: Bitcoin $BTC : +102K Wallets Ethereum $ETH : +645K Wallets XRP Ledger $XRP : +58K Wallets Cardano $ADA : +2.8K Wallets… pic.twitter.com/W07x43GgW4 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 10, 2025 It is worth noting that the term ‘HODLer’ denotes token holders with plans to hold their assets in the long term. As the data provider hinted, when the hodler count grows, investors or the community will be comfortable with the project. This can aid ecosystem stability and long-term token growth. The opposite is true when the hodler count drops as investors focus on Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). Ecosystem Projects and Dogecoin Advantage Despite the ongoing bull cycle, fluctuations have shown how volatile and uncertain the market is. As reported earlier by Coingape, ETH price lost 9% of its value in under 24 hours, a trend visible in other altcoins. Amid this uncertainty, investors focus on developer activity, and other utilities focus beyond price. While Ethereum developers are working on the Pectra Upgrade, Ripple Labs launched RLUSD stablecoin to boost XRP liquidity. Input Output Global developers are also working on perfecting the Cardano community governance. In all, Dogecoin might take more of the spotlight in the altcoin market in the long term. This is based on the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), which might fuel DOGE popularity. These ecosystem trends might explain why more users are betting on the altcoin’s long-term prospects. ETH and DOGE Predictions for 2025 Amid the fluctuations of the past few weeks, experts believe the altcoin season is still ahead. Galaxy Research said the DOGE price will top $1 this year in its projections. The Mike Novogratz-associated firm tied this forecast to the D.O.G.E ties around the coin. Top experts also believe this year holds something big for Ethereum. Bitwise predicted that Ethereum would hit a new all-time high this year, and the asset manager said it is possible for Ethereum to reach $7,000 by the end of the year.

According to the report, countries such as India, Vietnam, and Indonesia made it to the top ten countries with the largest crypto-savvy population worldwide. Foresight Ventures, a crypto-focused venture capital firm and Primitive Ventures, a frontier prop investment firm, recently unveiled their “GTM in Asia” report. The report showed that the Asian region was the epicentre of global crypto activities, accounting for 60% of the world’s crypto population. The tally reveals that the Asian continent contributes the largest share of global liquidity in the crypto arena. The 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index shows Asia leads in crypto adoption The Chainalysis 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index revealed that Asia continues to dominate the global cryptocurrency landscape, with nine of the top 20 nations. According to the 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index report, five out of the top ten countries are Asian countries, including India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The report highlights the growing trend in crypto adoption among Asian countries, which is primarily driven by centralized exchanges and price-sensitive communities. Crypto is Booming in China! Asia Leads Adoption with 60% of Global Users pic.twitter.com/pHnosfuEJF — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) January 10, 2025 Indonesia emerged as the region’s stronghold, ranking third globally in crypto adoption. Between July 2023 and June 2024, the country received $157.1 billion in digital assets value, leading Southeast Asia. The Global Crypto Adoption Index report also revealed that centralized exchanges such as Upbit and Binance dominate the Asian market by facilitating crypto trading and investing activities—the exchanges operating in the region account for 37.1% of global traffic. The report also revealed that Asia–Pacific (APAC) region has a unique socio-economic diversity that fuels dominant speculative behaviors, including airdrop farming and meme-based speculation. This diversity allows Asian users to underscore on-chain opportunities for tailored crypto products. The report also emphasized that Asia’s internal trade and capital flows illuminate its global connectivity. According to the study, the region’s interconnectedness unlocks 57% of intra-regional trade and 55% of FDI inflows. The Chinese market remains active despite harsh regulatory scrutiny The study revealed that despite tough regulatory scrutiny, Chinese citizens have been active in the crypto industry. The report noted that the Chinese market thrives in OTC markets and DeFi platforms, with Hong Kong serving as the pivotal gateway for resilient Chinese crypto enthusiasts. Unlike China, Singapore has a conducive regulatory environment for crypto investors and is widely renowned as a global hub for innovation. The country has a high crypto ownership rate of 24.4%, and its progressive regulatory framework has attracted major crypto platforms such as Gemini, OKX, and Upbit, which were licensed by the Singaporean regulator. The report termed Vietnam a rising star in GameFi and blockchain education. The Vietnam Blockchain Association controls the digital asset education process alongside successful projects such as Axie Infinity. The Philippines is a leader in blockchain remittances and capitalizes on its English-speaking diaspora and strong gaming community. On the other hand, the report highlighted the South Korean market as a highly liquid market primarily controlled by retail investors. South Korea boasts native crypto platforms such as crypto exchange Upbit that are strongly integrated into the Kakao ecosystem. Wealthy individuals in the region are increasingly exploring the digital asset ecosystem. In a report, Aspen Digital revealed that 94% of wealthy investors in the region are already investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The global crypto adoption index measures how nations are interacting with crypto assets. The index considers user count, trading volume, and the growth of crypto businesses. A major driver of increased crypto adoption in developed nations was launching spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. The funds sparked a wave of Bitcoin activity, particularly in North America and Western Europe. On the other hand, lower-middle-income countries such as Nigeria turned to crypto as an alternative to their national currencies, which were often weakened by inflation or economic instability.

With less than two weeks before he steps down, the man who’s been the face of the Biden administration’s anti-crypto agenda has opened up about the toll it’s taken on him, and let’s just say, it hasn’t been a walk in the park for Gary. He admitted that the barrage of crypto-related cases during his time at the SEC left him “traumatized.” Oh, and about Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E? He thinks it’s pointless. Speaking from his Washington, D.C. office, Gary was quick to attack the crypto industry, as per usual. According to him, it is a mess — sentiment-driven, unstable, and riddled with scams. “These 10,000 to 15,000 projects—many of them will not survive,” he said, comparing the crypto space to high-stakes venture capital, except with more pump-and-dump schemes and fraud. For Gary, it was less about innovation and more about survival: of the markets, the investors, and maybe even himself. Crypto chaos and Gary’s Wild West show When Gary walked into the SEC in April 2021, Wall Street was still reeling from the GameStop short squeeze. But crypto quickly took center stage. In his first few months on the job, he was already fielding questions about how he’d deal with an industry that seemed allergic to rules. “I came in, and my predecessor, Jay Clayton, had brought 80 enforcement actions in this area. We’ve brought in about 100 in our four years,” Gary said. “It was consistent. I’ve been around finance for over four decades. And everything in the markets trade on a mixture of fundamentals and sentiment at any given time. But I’ve never seen a field that’s so much wrapped up in sentiment and not so much about fundamentals.” That might be a little bit true, but the work clearly left its mark. From the collapse of FTX and the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried to the collapse of Terra and the downfall of Hyung Do Kwon, Gary’s SEC went after crypto with the kind of vigor you’d expect from a guy who famously describes the industry as “the Wild West.” And yet, the sentiment he’s leaving with is exhaustion. Gary’s own background made his stance even more controversial. Before his time at the SEC, he taught blockchain and digital assets at MIT, leading many in the industry to believe he’d be their ally. “When you’re in academia or not in this job, you can study something and observe it. But when you’re in this job… you do what you can to protect the investing public,” he explained. In other words, teaching blockchain and regulating it are two very different ballgames. TikTok celebrations and Trump’s promise to fire him If you thought Gary was unpopular in crypto circles, wait until you hear how TikTok reacted to his resignation. The announcement started a wave of celebration on the platform, with users calling him a “demon” and celebrating the end of what they saw as his reign of terror. “This demon has been torturing companies for like three to four years,” one user said. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump made firing Gary a key part of his campaign, promising to remove him on day one of his administration. But Trump won’t get the chance. Gary announced he’d be stepping down on Inauguration Day at noon, effectively sparing himself from what would’ve likely been a high-profile dismissal. Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E: Gary isn’t buying it One of the most surprising moments in Gary’s interview was his blunt take on Trump and Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E initiative, the department that was started to cut out government spending linked to spiraling national debt. They want to remove at least $2 trillion per year, which is an insane amount of money that could break an economy. And even Elon himself has admitted that it’s impossible to achieve. When asked how the SEC would handle a staff cut, Gary said: “I think it would be unfortunate because we’re already spread too thin. We get 40 or 50,000 tips, complaints and referrals a year. It’s unnecessary.” He added that crypto accounts for roughly 18% of those cases. “At any given time, we only have the staff to maybe investigate some small portion,” he said, adding that the workload forces the SEC to triage constantly. Beyond crypto, Gary also warned about the potential risks of AI in financial markets. From robo-advisors to opaque algorithms, he argued that the rapid growth of AI could lead to conflicts of interest that harm everyday investors. He asked: “Your robo-advisor, are they giving you advice on behalf of the asset manager or you? And who are they putting first?” As he prepares to leave, Gary has already met with his presumptive successor, Paul Atkins. The two had a private conversation, but Gary shared a piece of advice he’d received from former SEC Chair Richard Breeden: “Every single day in the job is one day closer to when you will join the formers club.” Gary took that to mean he should use each day wisely—a sentiment he tried to pass on to Atkins. “It’s really about our capital markets that are 40% to 45% of the world’s capital markets,” Gary said. “You gotta keep it good disclosure, free of fraud manipulation, and really have, as best you can, competitive all-to-all trading.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",Regulation|SEC|United States,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-10 23:15:51

Some of them include Rep.Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.) and Rep.Mike Collins (R-Ga.), who have invested in cryptocurrency. Recently, Rep. Reschenthaler disclosed that he holds some cryptocurrencies, such as Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Bitcoin (BTC). His assets are worth between $1,000 and $15,000 in total. This is in line with the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which prohibits members of the United States Congress from buying and selling stocks and other cryptocurrencies. Rep. Mike Collins and others join the trend Rep. Mike Collins from Georgia revealed earlier this year that he bought Ski Mask Dog (SKI), a relatively unknown cryptocurrency. He revealed that he had invested between $1,001 and $15,000 in Ski Mask Dog (SKI). The disclosure report shows that Rep. Collins bought Ski Mask Dog three times in succession on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of December 2024. Each purchase was made in the $1,001-$15,000 range, which corresponds to the period of increasing prices of many cryptocurrencies. In the past, he revealed purchasing Ether (ETH), Velodrome (VELO), Aerodrome Finance (AERO), and The Graph (GRT). Source: US House of Representatives Others include Rep. Barry Moore (R-Al) and Rep. Jeffrey Jackson (D-NC) who also revealed high-value cryptos transactions. With interest in cryptocurrencies on the rise, the U.S. Senate is stepping in to regulate digital assets. Sen.Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) will head a new committee on digital assets. Lummis is a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency and has submitted a bill that mandates the US Treasury to buy 1 million Bitcoins in five years. Lummis has also revealed her own Bitcoin transactions, with the first one made in 2013. Donald Trump’s rising crypto portfolio Apart from Congress, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has also come under the radar regarding his crypto investments. Recent report shows that he has accumulated more than $11 million worth of crypto assets, mostly due to the Trump-based memecoin. Trump’s assets include various cryptocurrencies, including Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), USD Coin (USDC) and several memecoins. However, he has no investment in BTC, though he once expressed the desire to use it to pay off the national debt.

Ki Young Ju, market analyst and CEO of CryptoQuant, compared altcoin market performance to Bitcoin (BTC), which has doubled in value since 2021. “Only a few altcoin projects with strong use cases and narratives will survive,” Ju noted. According to Total3 — a metric representing the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) — altcoins currently hold a market cap of approximately $943 billion. The altcoin market briefly touched an all-time high of $1.1 trillion during a rally from November to December 2024, but quickly retraced to current levels. Changing Dynamics of Altcoin Seasons Ju has warned that this market cycle deviates from previous ones, where altseason was traditionally triggered by capital rotations from Bitcoin to altcoins. Instead, he suggested this altseason may rely on stablecoin liquidity and the expansion of stablecoin trading pairs. “A rise in stablecoin trading pairs suggests fresh capital entering the altcoin market and reflects true demand increases, rather than just capital rotations,” Ju added. Capital flows into Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also signify a major shift from prior cycles. These flows are siloed within the ETF ecosystem, limiting the ability to shift funds from Bitcoin and Ether investments into smaller-cap altcoins, Ju explained. Market Outlook Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, predicted in December 2024 that most altcoins would face a “slow bleed” until late January 2025. Hartmann argued there was little opportunity in altcoin investments during the current consolidation phase, suggesting the market may only pick up following its conclusion.

This data indicates that the current price range might present an ideal opportunity to add or buy more meme coins. Current Price Momentum Currently, DOGE is trading near $0.334 and has experienced a price surge of over 4.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 15%, indicating that more investors and traders are engaging with the token as sentiment appears to be quietly improving compared to the past few days. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level However, DOGE has found support at the crucial $0.31 level and is poised for upside momentum. Historically, the meme coin has bounced off this support level multiple times, each time witnessing significant upward momentum. This time, experts and analysts are speculating a similar outcome for DOGE, which explains the reason behind the 470 million accumulation. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, DOGE is currently facing minor resistance at $0.34 and appears to be struggling to breach this level. Based on recent price action, if DOGE surpasses this resistance and closes a daily candle above the $0.345 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 15% to reach the $0.40 level in the near future. RSI Signals Recovery Potential In addition, DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing the oversold area, indicating a potential recovery that could unfold in the coming days.

According to a Friday filing in the US District Court for the Northern District of Delaware, FriendliAI entered into a “confidential agreement” with Hugging Face on January 8. The company has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit “with prejudice,” which means the case cannot be brought back to court. FriendliAI filed against Hugging Face in 2023 The settlement comes almost two years after FriendliAI filed a lawsuit against Hugging Face over the infringement of one of its patents. The Korean AI startup however reached a settlement on Friday. “FriendliAI and Hugging Face hereby stipulate to dismissal … without costs and fees to any party of this case,” reads the filing. “The court shall retain jurisdiction over the parties’ settlement agreement.” Court papers. In its lawsuit, which was filed nearly two years ago, the Korean AI startup accused Hugging face of violating its patent on “batching with iteration-level scheduling.” FriendliAI also claims that the patented technology described in an application to the US Patent and Trademark Office improves the process of batching data fed into the AI system to allow the system to handle multiple requests at once. According to Tech Crunch , the patent also covers AI systems that enable finished requests from within a batch to be sent to a user and new requests to be added to the batch before the full batch has been processed. According to a complaint filed on July 28, 2023, in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, Hugging Face’s “Text Generation Inference” server for its large language model AI used the Korean AI startup’s patented method to batch incoming requests to increase the tool’s efficiency. As such, FriendliAI wanted compensation from Hugging Face, enhanced damages for willfulness, in addition to a court order preventing further infringement or awarding a licensing fee and attorney’s fees and costs. In the meantime, Microsoft releases model on Hugging Face According to a Bloomberg report, FriendliAI’s method which the startup refers to as “batching with iteration level scheduling” and markets as Periflow or Orca, enhanced the process of batching inputs to allow the AI to process multiple requests. FriendliAI also has an office in Redwood City, California. The VC-backed startup was founded in 2021 and primarily develops infrastructure solutions for the fast-growing AI tech. According to TC, Hugging Face has raised a total of $235 million from backers, including Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Intel, and Salesforce.

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 23:54:00

The recent Blockchain Roundtable held in the German Parliament brought out some of the key proposals for realizing this objective. The event included remarks from Christian Lindner, former Finance Minister of the country, and also included contributions from Patrick Hansen, the Senior Director of EU Strategy & Policy at Circle. Strategic Bitcoin initiatives Christian Lindner proposed three key measures during the roundtable discussion. The first one is the provision of government bonds on the basis of the blockchain. This could help increase the bond market’s transparency and effectiveness and potentially put Germany at the cutting edge of blockchain financial technology. Another proposal is to have the German government, or even the European Union, use Bitcoin as a reserve currency. This would align it with other governments around the world, using Bitcoin as a store of value and as an inflation hedge. The third one focuses on the possibility of launching Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the European Union. Currently, European markets do not have Bitcoin ETFs and use exchange-traded notes (ETNs) or commodities (ETCs). The entry of ETFs could offer investors regulated and institutional-grade investment avenues, thus increasing adoption and market depth. Impact of previous Bitcoin sales Germany’s interest in Bitcoin comes after its government recently auctioned off 50,000 BTC seized during an operation against the Movie2k piracy website . This sale happened in mid-2024, influencing the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin’s value decreasing from $70,000 to $56,000. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $94,806 and is still below the $100,000 mark, which market analysts say is because the asset is still in the distribution zone. Analysts expect the prices to rise again due to increasing usage and utilization of the digital asset. In December, Lindner spoke in the Bundestag, pointing to the government’s missed opportunity to harness Bitcoin’s potential and comparing Germany’s position to that of the United States. He pointed out that the US is ready to adopt cryptocurrency-friendly measures after Donald Trump’s victory in the recent election. In his campaign, Trump suggested buying Bitcoin and labeling the US as a home of cryptocurrencies. During his speech, Lindner complained about the fact that Germany did not have a strategy, arguing, “The US will use the advantages that we could also have with Bitcoin. What an omission, what opportunities are being lost to us.” Still, Lindner’s renewed interest in Bitcoin has also attracted controversy. German crypto analyst and trader Furkan Yildirim expressed his doubts on X . Stating, “The man had almost 4 years as finance minister to have the necessary debates, and now that there’s a fire, he notices? Bitcoin doesn’t need politicians. Politicians need Bitcoin.” Lindner’s recent statements come at a time when German politics are more active than usual, with a federal election scheduled for soon. Critics have suggested that Lindner’s outspoken support for Bitcoin is an attempt to re-ignite his party’s flagging popularity as the polls suggest that support for the party is waning.

This approach is designed to streamline operations, addressing issues of efficiency as transaction volumes grow. Similarly, BitTorrent (BTT) market trends reveal potential, with its integration into the BitTorrent ecosystem offering advantages in decentralized file sharing. However, challenges such as competition and token supply remain hurdles for growth. As blockchain technology continues to reshape industries, Web3Bay (3BAY) is the fresh-faced Web3 crypto project gearing up to redefine e-commerce. Having raised over $560K, with over $50K being raised in the last 24 hours, its blockchain-powered e-commerce platform emphasizes security, transparency, and accessibility. As traditional e-commerce platforms face disruption, Web3Bay is ready to claim a significant portion of the market with its decentralized approach. SOL Network Aims to Improve Efficiency The Solana network continues to address scalability challenges with its latest proposal, SIMD-215, a homomorphic hashing system designed to enhance account verification efficiency. This shift targets the longstanding issue of “state growth,” where recalculating the entire state of accounts slows network performance. By adopting incremental updates instead, Solana’s developers aim to streamline operations and reduce resource strain on nodes. Replacing the current Merkle-based hashing system, this approach could significantly improve scalability and strengthen the Solana network’s ability to handle rising transaction volumes. The proposed changes will require nodes to adopt the updated calculation methods, ensuring smoother transitions and uninterrupted operations. These advancements highlight efforts to maintain competitiveness as Solana continues to adapt within the blockchain ecosystem. BTT Market Trends Show Potential Despite Challenges BitTorrent market trends indicate a mix of opportunities and hurdles as BTT navigates its position in a competitive crypto landscape. Currently trading at a fraction of a cent, BTT has seen volatility reflective of broader market conditions. Its integration with the BitTorrent ecosystem offers a unique advantage, leveraging a massive user base for decentralized file sharing. Despite this edge, BitTorrent market trends also underscore challenges, such as a high token supply and stiff competition from bigger platforms. Strategic partnerships and technological advancements are key factors shaping BTT’s future trajectory. As interest in decentralized solutions grows, BitTorrent market trends suggest room for growth if adoption continues to rise and technological hurdles are addressed. Web3Bay Crypto Goes Viral: Presale Jumps to $560K Web3Bay is making strides toward changing the way digital commerce operates, surging past a half-a-million raised, sitting at $560K in its presale with 148 million tokens sold. Web3Bay is quickly making a name for itself as the decentralized alternative to traditional, centralized e-commerce platforms. Web3Bay integrates blockchain technology to offer secure, transparent, and cost-efficient transactions. This presents Web3Bay as a serious player set to take up some market share traditionally dominated by giants like Amazon. The appeal lies in its focus on user security and global accessibility, removing reliance on centralized online shopping systems. Web3Bay’s plans include a robust ecosystem featuring an NFT marketplace, DeFi integrations for staking and lending, and cross-chain compatibility. These features position Web3Bay as a forward-looking project combining real-world application with investment potential. At just $0.0039675 per token, traders are capitalizing on this opportunity, noting both its practical use cases and the anticipated return on investment. As the presale accelerates, it reflects a shift in how users view Web3 crypto in e-commerce — bringing efficiency to digital marketplaces while paving the way for future advancements. 2025: A Year of Huge Innovations As 2025 unfolds, all these projects illustrate how blockchain technology is fundamentally reshaping industries, setting the stage for a transformative year ahead. The Solana network tackles efficiency concerns with a proposed hashing system, potentially enhancing its scalability and performance as transactions increase. BitTorrent market trends reveal opportunities and challenges. Its integration into the BitTorrent ecosystem offers a unique edge, but the project tries to overcome the hurdles. In the e-commerce sector, Web3Bay leads the charge by blending blockchain technology with practical features to redefine e-commerce. Having raised over $560K and sold 148 million tokens, the hype around Web3Bay’s decentralized platform is evident as it emphasizes security, transparency, and affordability. 3BAY doesn’t seem to be slowing down and has made it obvious it intends to take the market share it deserves.

The Cardano whale activity has recently become a focal point in crypto circles, with substantial acquisitions exceeding 20 million ADA within just two days, igniting discussions of a potential surge pushing prices over $1. Furthermore, the affiliate program by BlockDAG (BDAG) has captured widespread attention, offering participants a prime chance to amplify their rewards within a dynamic crypto environment. Enthusiasts have embraced these incentives, propelling BlockDAG’s presale to an impressive $178.5 million. With its pioneering DAG technology and appealing rewards, BlockDAG (BDAG) is marked as a leading crypto coin to keep an eye on in 2025. Cardano Whale Activity Fuels Speculation of an ADA Surge Cardano whale activity has surged, with prominent buyers acquiring over 20 million ADA within just two days. This intense accumulation is a strong indicator of growing confidence, often viewed as a sign of upcoming market shifts. With its current price at $0.8551, Cardano is poised at a critical threshold, yet the significant purchases suggest a bullish uptrend is likely. Data shows that Cardano whales holding 1 to 10 million ADA are behind this boost, injecting considerable assets into Cardano’s market. These moves demonstrate a robust belief in ADA’s potential growth. Should this trend persist, analysts believe Cardano might soon revisit the $1 mark, sparking renewed enthusiasm for the altcoin. XRP Price Trends Predict a Rise to $15 by May 2025 XRP price trends are showing a positive outlook, encouraged by increasing adoption and a drop in selling pressure. Analyst Bobby A noted on X that XRP’s current path mirrors earlier market cycles, which saw gains reduce with each successive impulse. Predictions based on these historical cycles suggest a potential 665% increase for XRP, in line with Fibonacci predictions, targeting $15. These trends are supported by rising network use, dwindling exchange reserves, and optimistic market sentiment in derivatives. With the crypto community closely watching, the Elliott Wave analysis forecasts a promising fifth wave breakout, enhancing XRP’s appeal in the market.

The token protocol claims to build a “trustless world computer for Bitcoin,” offering solutions that address limitations in programmability, data availability and asset creation. In an X post on January 10, Nubit announced : Today, Bitcoin has 100+ asset protocols—fragmented, inefficient, and isolated. Every new feature requires building a new protocol from scratch. However, Goldinals changes everything. ~Nubit Goldinals is developed on BitVM and already works well with BRC-20, Runes and Ordinals According to Nubit, the new token protocol, Goldinals, is fully compatible with experimental token standard BRC-20 and the fungible token Runes. The token protocol is also built on BitVM, a system intended to execute complex computations and smart contracts on the BTC network. In a series of X posts, the company insisted that Goldinals is fast, secure, reliable, and fully decentralized , claiming it could help streamline the very fragmented BTC ecosystem. It added that the Bitcoin protocol can now hasten development time, working ten times faster. Moreover, Nubit argued that the protocol is programmable and interoperable and hence will address all the inefficiencies that come with Bitcoin’s ecosystem fragmentation. Developers can also specify token attributes such as supply limits or transfer rules using smart contract-style logic. All transactions are also verifiable directly on the BTC blockchain. Furthermore, Goldinals will utilize zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for on-chain validation. ZK proofs will help the protocol to trace and identify invalid transactions on the Bitcoin network, reducing the need for third-party verification. Nubit aims to revolutionize Bitcoin with programmability and trustless computing Nubit co-founder Hanzhi has maintained that the firm will prioritise programmability, arguing that Bitcoin needs “real programmability, not duct-taped chaos.” He added that with reliable foundations and standards, the Bitcoin ecosystem will evolve into a space of interoperable, win-win innovation. Nubit is also developing a compiler to convert user-friendly code into optimized BTC scripts, with formal verification to validate each program’s integrity. Additionally, the firm will continue to develop BitVM to operate Turing-complete programs on Bitcoin. The company still expects to complete the establishment of a Trustless World Computer for BTC, with support from Polychain.

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), known for its vibrant community and cultural appeal, has surged over 611% in the past month. However, analysts warn of resistance levels that could slow its climb. Meanwhile, Osaka Protocol (OSAK) focuses on true decentralization, although its price has dropped by 21% in the last month despite a sharp 60.79% increase in trading volume in the last 24 hours. Amidst these shifts, BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is capturing attention for all the right reasons. Its 90% APY staking rewards, paired with a stellar presale performance of over $5.1 million raised, have positioned it as the top pick among the best new meme coins to join now . With a P2E game and a growing Bulls Squad community, BTFD is more than just a meme coin—it’s a revolution. BTFD Coin: A Staking Reward Revolution What makes BTFD Coin ($BTFD) the hottest meme coin of the year? Start with its 90% APY staking rewards, which provide investors with unparalleled opportunities to grow their holdings. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD backs its appeal with tangible value. Currently in its 13th presale stage, BTFD is priced at $0.000142 per token. With over 63 billion tokens sold and more than 8,000 investors onboard, the coin’s momentum is undeniable. A $6,000 investment at this stage secures over 42.25 million $BTFD tokens. Once listed at $0.0006, this would yield $25,350—a jaw-dropping 322.5% return, excluding staking gains. The Bulls Squad community adds a layer of excitement, rallying around the coin’s innovative P2E game launched on January 1, 2025. Players can earn rewards through engaging gameplay, merging fun with financial gains. This fusion of entertainment and investment has cemented BTFD as one of the top contenders among the best new meme coins to join now. Getting started is simple. Set up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and connect to the BTFD buy page . A few clicks later, you’ll own the dip and join a movement that’s redefining meme coin success. Pudgy Penguins: Cultural Icon Meets Market Resistance Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is more than just a meme coin—it’s a cultural phenomenon. With over 50 billion views and millions of fans, the Pudgy Penguin brand has become a beacon of positivity and community in the crypto space. Currently trading at $0.03559, PENGU has risen by 6.7% in the last 24 hours, following an explosive 611% surge over the past month. However, the coin faces significant challenges. Analysts highlight resistance at $0.0469, which has repeatedly stalled upward momentum. If PENGU fails to hold its support level at $0.0296, a drop to $0.020 could be on the cards. Despite these hurdles, PENGU’s loyal fanbase and ongoing marketing efforts keep it in the spotlight. From major brands showcasing the Penguin to its inclusion in ETF commercials, the coin’s influence extends beyond the crypto world. For those willing to ride out the volatility, PENGU offers a blend of community vibes and speculative potential. Osaka Protocol: True Decentralization in Action Osaka Protocol (OSAK) brings a refreshing focus on decentralization, promoting the idea that ownership equals responsibility. Each holder’s influence is proportional to their stake, fostering a sense of shared accountability within the ecosystem. Trading at $0.0000001936, OSAK has seen its price dip by 1.19% in the last 24 hours and 21% over the past month. However, trading volume has soared by 60.79%, indicating growing interest despite the price decline. This paradox suggests that while the coin faces short-term challenges, its community-driven model may provide a strong foundation for future growth. For investors seeking a project with meaningful decentralization and collaborative governance, OSAK stands out. Its focus on equality and shared responsibility resonates with those who value the core principles of blockchain technology. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is the frontrunner among the best new meme coins to join now. Its unmatched 90% APY staking rewards, combined with a stellar presale performance and innovative P2E game, make it a standout choice for investors. With over $5.1 million raised and a growing Bulls Squad community, BTFD isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a game-changer.

Despite the drop, the popular meme coin still holds a bullish structure, keeping investors optimistic about its potential for recovery. However, the current levels are critical, as Dogecoin is testing key demand zones that could determine its next move. Related Reading: Key Metrics Reveal Bitcoin STH Support Levels Around $89K–$86K – Is BTC At Risk? Top analyst and trader BigCheds recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that DOGE is testing crucial demand at $0.31 on the daily time frame. This level has historically acted as a strong support zone, and holding above it could set the stage for a bounce and continuation of its bullish trend. Conversely, a failure to maintain this level might open the door to further downside. Market sentiment remains cautious following the broader crypto market’s decline, but DOGE’s ability to hold current levels could restore investor confidence. All eyes are now on whether the meme coin can defend this key support and potentially pave the way for a new rally or if additional selling pressure will lead to a deeper correction. Dogecoin Holds Pivotal Support as 2025 Begins The start of 2025 has taken a different tone for Dogecoin compared to the explosive end of 2024. Beginning in early November, DOGE experienced a massive price surge, gaining over 230% in less than three weeks. This meteoric rise saw the meme coin reach significant levels, reigniting interest and optimism among investors. However, since finding a local high, Dogecoin has entered a consolidation phase, testing critical levels of support. Currently, Dogecoin is trading around $0.31, a key daily demand level identified by top analyst BigCheds. In his recent technical analysis, BigCheds emphasizes the importance of this support zone, as it could determine the next major move for the cryptocurrency. If DOGE manages to hold above $0.31, it sets the stage for a potential breakout into higher prices, reigniting the bullish momentum seen in late 2024. This consolidation phase is being closely monitored by traders and investors, as Dogecoin’s ability to maintain its bullish structure depends on this level. A clean bounce from the $0.31 demand could trigger renewed buying pressure, propelling DOGE toward new highs. Conversely, losing this critical support might signal a deeper correction, testing lower levels before any recovery.

A successful defense of $0.31 could mark the beginning of another significant rally, solidifying DOGE’s position as a top contender in the cryptocurrency space. DOGE Eyes A Breakout Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.33, showing resilience after holding above the critical $0.31 demand level. This support has provided a foundation for DOGE to stabilize following the recent market selloff. However, the cryptocurrency remains at risk as long as it continues to trade below the $0.40 mark, a level that could reignite bullish momentum. For bulls to regain control, the price must reclaim $0.40 decisively. This would signal a shift in sentiment and provide the momentum needed to challenge the $0.43 mark. Breaking above $0.43 is a crucial milestone for Dogecoin, as it would likely trigger a significant rally into price discovery, attracting renewed interest from investors and traders. Related Reading: Solana Must Reclaim Momentum In The Coming Weeks – SOL/BTC Ratio At A Pivotal Point Conversely, failing to reclaim $0.40 in the near term keeps DOGE vulnerable to further downside. Prolonged trading below this level increases the risk of a deeper correction, potentially testing lower levels of demand. The next few days will be pivotal for Dogecoin’s trajectory, as the broader market sentiment and DOGE’s ability to reclaim key levels will determine its direction. If bulls succeed in pushing above $0.43, the meme coin could quickly gain momentum, solidifying its place as a market leader in this cycle.

On Friday, the bureau issued two proposals for public participation and feedback. One proposa l seeks ways to prevent intrusive data collection when clients make digital payments on large tech platforms. The second proposes strengthening laws protecting clients against fraud to cover those who make digital payments through gaming and other cryptos. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. When people pay for their family expenses using new forms of digital payments, they must be confident that their transactions are not tainted by harmful surveillance or errors. ~ Rohit Chopra Trump’s leadership transition sparks uncertainty over CFPB proposals It is unclear how the proposals will end as the current leadership may change upon Trump’s swearing-in on January 20. There has been speculation of Trump replacing Chopra, yet no specific name for the replacement has been tabled. Trump has taken a pro-Bitcoin stand, suggesting he wants to model the US as the world’s crypto capital. He looks forward to enabling the crypto environment than the Joe Biden administration. According to the CFPB , they proposed consumer digital payment privacy after conducting research that revealed that some payment mechanisms gather more data that is irrelevant to transactions. According to the CFPB, this data could be used to allow payment companies to facilitate personalized pricing, where a price is based on factors specific to an individual consumer. The deadline for public comment is April 11. CFPB tightens rules on big tech to protect digital payment users Some big tech companies collect too much data using their platforms as surveillance tools. Chopra felt that strengthening regulations would be critical. The CFPB’s open banking rules, released in October, curtail companies’ ability to use payment data for advertising and marketing purposes. A rule finalized in November gave the CFPB the mandate to supervise payment tools from Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and other large digital payment providers. The other proposal seeks to establish the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which shields consumers’ right to dispute payment carters for new payment systems. Although stablecoins operate around trading and settlement, they are likely to grow beyond that scope in the fullness of time. Both Stripe Inc., Visa Inc., and PayPal Holdings Inc. have stablecoin initiatives. The regulator explained that the proposals aim to reexamine marketwide expectations regarding the available payment laws through consumer lenses without seeking court orders and decisions. The deadline for the second proposal is March 31.

However, recent market trends tell a different story. The so-called ‘Trump Dump’ has led to significant market dips, with many attributing the downturn to growing uncertainty. Amidst the skepticism, the Trump Dump has surprisingly sparked a buying frenzy for Dogecoin and its emerging DOGE AI rival, RCO Finance (RCOF) . As an AI-driven decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, RCOF is drawing attention with its innovative approach and highly anticipated token presale, positioning itself as a formidable contender against established cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Woes Spark a DOGE Buying Frenzy – Is RCOF the Next Big Rival? The “Trump Dump,” a term sparked by analysts predicting market reactions to Donald Trump’s potential inauguration, has injected volatility into the cryptocurrency space. While Bitcoin’s price correction from an anticipated all-time high of $114,000 to a possible $88,000 has drawn mixed reactions, this turbulence has also triggered buying opportunities for other cryptos like Dogecoin (DOGE). Dogecoin, known for its meme appeal and enduring popularity, is now benefiting from renewed investor interest as Bitcoin’s fluctuations send ripples across the market. Analysts like Johnny the Crypto God suggest that Dogecoin could thrive during Bitcoin’s volatile movements, potentially positioning DOGE as a hedge in uncertain times. Moreover, DOGE’s correlation with market hype and its resilient community further fuel optimism. Amidst this, RCO Finance (RCOF), a DOGE AI rival, is gaining momentum. The Trump Dump may be unsettling for Bitcoin, but it seems to be presenting an unexpected boon for DOGE and its emerging competitors. Investors Pick RCO Finance (RCOF) Amidst the Trump Dump While the Trump Dump has definitely caused liquidations in the market, it has significantly triggered a buying spree for Dogecoin and the DOGE AI rival, RCO FInance (RCOF) . While investors look for high ROI on assets, RCO Finance investors are lured by its unique DeFi prepositions to improve trading with the help of AI. At the heart of RCO Finance’s offering is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, a unique tool that personalizes investment strategies for all users. This intelligent system analyzes market trends, historical data and news tickers from reputable sources like Reuters and Bloomberg to provide bespoke trading strategies and recommendations. With a 24/7 system that adapts strategies in real-time, the robo-advisor removes emotional biases and optimizes portfolio management, proving to be an indispensable tool in today’s volatile market. Another feature that distinguishes RCO Finance is its commitment to tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). This innovative approach allows users to invest in high-value assets such as real estate and art through fractional ownership. RCO Finance democratizes access to markets once reserved for institutional investors by breaking down these traditionally illiquid investments into manageable tokens. This increases liquidity and opens new avenues for portfolio diversification, making investing more accessible than ever before. Apart from trading, the platform’s dividend pools further improve its attractiveness, offering token holders consistent rewards based on their involvement within the ecosystem. Moreover, with a unique staking program, liquidity pools and DeFi lending commissions, investors are assured of a steady income stream. RCO Finance also bridges the gap between digital and traditional finance with its local Debit Card. This feature enables users to convert their crypto holdings into fiat currency instantly, facilitating everyday transactions without the hassle of complex conversions. Moreover, RCO Finance stands out for its KYC-Free Accessibility, which prioritizes user privacy. Removing KYC barriers, RCOF allows global participation in DeFi without lengthy identity verification processes. Moreover, the security and integrity of the RCOF DOGE AI rival smart contracts are assured by audits by SolidProof. Investors Target High ROI with the DOGE AI Rival RCOF Presale The presale for RCO Finance is in full swing, presenting an exceptional opportunity for early investors. Currently priced at $0.0777 per token, this presale stage offers a 25% bonus for investors using the code RCOF25. Projections indicate a potential launch price between $0.4 and $0.6, so early participants could see over 700% ROI once the DOGE AI rival hits the market. Moreover, some bullish analysts predict RCOF will surpass Dogecoin’s bull run and possibly hit $1 by Q2 2025. RCOF uses an advanced tokenomics model, offering 50% of the tokens for public sale. Moreover, the deflationary model, where unsold tokens from the presale are burned, aims to increase scarcity and potentially boost the token’s value post-listing. With the presale closing in, now is the perfect time to capitalize on this once-in-a-lifetime potential. Secure your RCOF tokens today and position yourself for higher gains once the tokens are listed in exchanges!

While Cardano is priced at $0.8577 and is nearing the completion of its price adjustment with forecasts showing a climb to $2.50 by 2025, XRP has risen by 10% in a day, aiming for $3.20, driven by positive market sentiment. Meanwhile, the success of BlockDAG’s $178.5 million presale and the integration of EVM-WASM technology underscores its position as the top crypto to buy now. Cardano Price Adjustment: Upcoming Valuations and Expectations The downward price adjustment in Cardano has fueled debates about its future potential, with current trades at $0.8577 after a 40% drop. Noted analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggests that the price range of $0.74 to $0.98 could offer a good entry point. Despite its recent dip, Cardano is seen in a generally bullish trend with projections of reaching between $2.50 and $3.00 by 2025, suggesting a promising upward journey supported by continuous developments within its ecosystem. Anticipating XRP’s Price Surge Towards $3.20 The recent 10% increase in XRP’s price has the market’s attention, now standing at $2.31. This resurgence is marked by anticipation of an uptick towards the all-time high of $3.84. Analyst ‘ The Moon Show ‘ on X social platform notes a symmetrical triangle pattern that could push XRP towards $3.20 soon, backed by solid buying activity. The optimism around XRP’s growth trajectory is palpable, and if the bullish trend holds, it might surpass $3 as early as January. BlockDAG’s Developer Support with EVM & WASM Attracts Broad Interest BlockDAG’s integration of EVM and WASM technologies is poised to significantly expand its ecosystem, setting it apart as a top choice for developers and traders. The compatibility with EVM allows for straightforward transitions of Ethereum-based dApps to BlockDAG, facilitating quick adoption and minimizing development challenges. WASM’s integration promises vast opportunities in gaming, AI, and finance, with the potential for superior flexibility and efficiency. These capabilities have fortified the platform, attracting developers from Ethereum’s active community and pushing forward BlockDAG’s growth. The remarkable presale performance, amassing $178.5 million with 17.7 billion coins sold, demonstrates BlockDAG’s strong market presence. The price of BDAG coins, currently at $0.0248 in the 27th batch, reflects a significant ROI of 2380% for early adopters. With predictions of reaching $30 by 2030, the forthcoming Mainnet launch in 2025 emphasizes BlockDAG’s potential, making it a key candidate for those looking for top crypto to buy now. Wrapping Up- Top Crypto to Buy Now As the crypto market evolves, both Cardano’s correction phase ending and XRP’s price surge signify promising investment avenues.

Billionaires Philippe Laffont, Stanley Druckenmiller, Chase Coleman, Stephen Mandel and Larry Robbins are accumulating AI-centered equities, reports The Motley Fool. The investors have specifically targeted US semiconductor and software giant Broadcom (AVGO), purchasing a total of 1,728,646 shares valued at about $1.47 billion in the third quarter of last year. The firm’s AI revenue has surged in recent months, powering a 125% rise in the stock over the last year. The wealthy investors have also purchased roughly 1,749,613 shares of Amazon, worth about $245 million, as the company’s cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) implements generative AI solutions for customers. Lastly, the billionaires have bought 621,445 shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), worth about $62 million, betting on the world’s largest chip manufacturer. The billionaires’ new plays in artificial intelligence come as analysts at PwC forecast the total addressable market for AI will hit $15.7 trillion by 2030, as the groundbreaking technology transforms business and manufacturing worldwide.

The company intends to incorporate Bitcoin into its operations by accepting it as payment and holding it as a strategic asset. This initiative positions the craft distiller as an early adopter of cryptocurrency within the craft spirits industry. Heritage Distilling Adopts Bitcoin Strategy for Treasury and E-Commerce In a recent press statement , Heritage Distilling outlined plans to integrate Bitcoin into its business model. The company will accept Bitcoin as payment through its direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform, enabling customers to purchase craft spirits using cryptocurrency. This move reflects a broader trend of businesses leveraging digital assets for seamless payment options. Heritage Distilling also plans to hold Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy. The company believes this strategy enhances its financial flexibility and broadens its consumer base. Notably, the growing adoption of Bitcoin strategy among institutional players has raised a lot of buzz in the cryptocurrency market. Most recently, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed the only scenario in which MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy could lead to bankruptcy. According to him, the company, which holds $46 billion in BTC against $7 billion in debt, faces a liquidation threshold if Bitcoin’s price drops to $16,500—a situation he deems highly improbable. Strategic Cushion Against Bitcoin Volatility Heritage Distilling emphasized its ability to mitigate potential risks associated with Bitcoin price volatility. As a producer of consumer goods, the company benefits from a margin between the cost of production and the retail price of its products. This margin is a cushion allowing the company to absorb fluctuations in Bitcoin price without impacting its stability. The company’s leadership noted that the recent updates to financial accounting standards simplify how public companies report Bitcoin holdings. This change makes it easier for businesses like Heritage Distilling to incorporate Bitcoin into their operations without accounting challenges. Leadership and Governance Behind the Initiative Heritage Distilling’s Board of Directors has established a Technology and Cryptocurrency Committee to oversee the development and implementation of its Bitcoin Strategy. Chaired by Matt Swann, a leader in technology and digital payments, the committee is tasked with crafting a formal Bitcoin Treasury Policy for board approval. According to CEO Justin Stiefel, this initiative positions Heritage Distilling as an innovator in the craft spirits industry. The company aims to attract new customers, including Bitcoin users, while leveraging the potential growth of Bitcoin as an asset. Justin Stiefel commented, “Heritage has always been an innovator and once again we are leading the way in the craft spirits space as we prepare to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for online e-commerce sales and to acquire and hold Bitcoin as an asset.” Meanwhile, another notable Bitcoin adopter, Genius Group, has boosted its Bitcoin Treasury by $5 million, bringing its total holdings to $35 million. The AI-powered education firm remains committed to its “Bitcoin-first” strategy. It leverages crypto-backed loans to fund reserves and integrate blockchain into its educational platforms. The company most recently boosted its Bitcoin Treasury by $10 million, bringing its holdings to 319.4 BTC at an average cost of $93,919 per BTC.

On Pump.fun, a meme token launchpad, only 0.4% of traders have a profit of more than $ 10,000, statistics according to recent data . According to Adam Tehc, a Dune data analyst, out of the more than 13.4 million wallets on Pump.fun, only 54,724 wallets have made profits of $10,000 or more. However, only 294 have achieved the status of “crypto millionaires” by accumulating gains of more than $1 million—this is 0.002% of all wallets. Source:X Tehc pointed out the difference between reality and perception, saying that “289 Pump.fun millionaires is very low and speaks to the gap between the timeline and reality.” This data does not include the revenues from the purchase of Pump.fun tokens after they are graduated from the platform, which happens when a token has a $100,000 market capitalization. However, they do allow for token purchases that are made after graduation as long as the initial purchase was made before graduation. The data can also be impacted by bots. Pump.fun has identified a new group of bots known as “bump bots” that make small trades to generate interest in certain tokens. Although the percentage of very profitable traders among the Pump.fun users remain low, but this figure has steadily increased. A year ago, only 70 wallets had become millionaires, while 11,936 wallets had earned $10,000 or more. Tehc pointed out that the level of profitability is rising among more experienced traders. Pump.fun is a meme coin platform that was created in January 2024 and has become popular rather quickly. Currently, the platform supports the creation of more than 5.7 million tokens with a total revenue of approximately $392 million. A November report also showed that 88% of users trade meme coins through Pump.fun either lost money or made less than $100 in profits. Pump.fun has continued its dominance in the Solana network, performing about 70% of all transactions at the beginning of the year. This spike is the highest level of activity on the platform since November. Since its launch in early 2024, Pump.fun has had great success with Solana meme coins like PNUT, GOAT, and FARTCOINs. As Cryptopolitan reported , Pump.fun is popular among teenagers and young adults, with 64% of website users being under 34. The platform attracts its audience by combining financial and investment content with news and current events. Controversies and Regulatory Scrutiny However, not all has been rosy for Pump.fun as it has been experiencing a meteoritic rise and fall at the same time. The platform quicky turned into a playground for high-risk traders, who used any means necessary to promote tokens. In 2024, a new trend of livestream stunt occurred, during which cases of animal cruelty and fake suicide took place. All these actions led the platform to suspend its live-streaming service. Shortly after, the UK-based Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a notice that advised the public against Pump.fun due to the risks it posed. In response, the platform banned UK-based traders from participating in the platform due to the bans.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU.

As innovation surges, new projects are stepping into the spotlight with game-changing features and real-world applications. This week, three names stand out: Qubetics ($TICS), Astra, and Theta. Qubetics ($TICS) is taking the lead with its Decentralized VPN feature, offering a secure, private way to navigate the digital world. Astra, a cutting-edge platform, is blending blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize data processing. And Theta is transforming video streaming with its decentralized content delivery network, empowering both creators and viewers. Let’s explore what makes these altcoins the best to join this week and how they’re shaping the future of blockchain technology. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Online Privacy with Decentralized VPNs Qubetics is making waves in the blockchain space by addressing one of the most pressing issues of our time: online privacy. Its Decentralized VPN (dVPN) is designed to provide secure, anonymous access to the internet by eliminating the reliance on centralized servers. Unlike traditional VPNs that route traffic through fixed locations, Qubetics uses blockchain technology to decentralize the process, ensuring user data stays private and untraceable. Imagine being a remote worker who regularly accesses sensitive company files while traveling. A centralized VPN might protect your data, but it’s not foolproof—server hacks and data breaches are common threats. With Qubetics’ dVPN, your connection is encrypted and routed through a global network of blockchain nodes, making it nearly impossible for anyone to intercept or track your activity. This feature isn’t just for professionals. Everyday internet users can enjoy browsing without worrying about surveillance, censorship, or intrusive ads. For example, students researching restricted topics or activists sharing critical information in oppressive regions can use Qubetics to ensure their safety and anonymity. The excitement around Qubetics isn’t just about its technology. The project is currently in its 16th presale stage, with over 409 million tokens sold to 13,900 holders, raising more than $9.1 million. At a price of just $0.0455 per token, $TICS offers an exceptional entry point for those seeking to invest in a project tackling real-world problems. Adding to its credibility, Qubetics has partnered with SWFT Blockchain, enabling seamless integration with other networks . This partnership highlights the platform’s focus on creating a robust and interoperable ecosystem. Astra: The Convergence of Blockchain and AI Astra is taking blockchain innovation to the next level by merging it with artificial intelligence (AI). As industries increasingly rely on data-driven insights, Astra’s platform offers a decentralized solution for processing and analyzing massive amounts of data, ensuring security, transparency, and efficiency. Here’s how it works: Astra leverages blockchain to store data securely and uses AI to analyze it in real-time. This combination creates a powerful tool for businesses and individuals looking to make informed decisions without compromising privacy. For example, an e-commerce company could use Astra to analyze customer data, identify trends, and personalize shopping experiences without risking data breaches. Similarly, a healthcare provider might utilize the platform to process patient information securely, ensuring compliance with regulations while delivering better care. Astra also focuses on democratizing AI. Its platform allows developers to build decentralized AI applications that are accessible to everyone, from startups to large enterprises. This inclusivity fosters innovation and expands the reach of AI-powered solutions. For those seeking the best altcoins to join this week, Astra’s blend of blockchain and AI positions it as a unique and promising investment. Its focus on solving complex data challenges ensures it remains relevant in an increasingly digital world. Theta: Revolutionizing Video Streaming with Decentralization Theta is shaking up the video streaming industry with its decentralized content delivery network. By leveraging blockchain, Theta allows users to share bandwidth and computing resources, creating a peer-to-peer network that reduces costs, improves streaming quality, and rewards participants. Picture this: A popular YouTuber uploads a video, and viewers worldwide can access it instantly without buffering. Instead of relying on centralized servers, Theta’s network distributes the content efficiently, ensuring smooth playback even during peak times. At the same time, viewers who share their bandwidth earn rewards, creating an ecosystem where everyone benefits. Theta’s platform also empowers content creators by reducing dependency on traditional streaming platforms. By using Theta, creators can distribute their work directly to audiences, bypassing intermediaries and keeping more of their revenue. This model has the potential to disrupt the current landscape, where platforms often take significant cuts from creators’ earnings. For businesses, Theta offers a scalable solution for delivering high-quality video content. Whether it’s live streaming a sporting event or hosting virtual conferences, companies can rely on Theta’s network to ensure a seamless experience for users. As video content continues to dominate the internet, Theta’s innovative approach makes it one of the best altcoins to join this week. Its focus on decentralization and user empowerment sets it apart from traditional streaming platforms. The Role of Decentralized VPNs in Blockchain Let’s dive deeper into Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN feature and why it’s a crucial innovation for the digital age. Traditional VPNs have long been the go-to solution for online privacy, but they come with limitations. Centralized servers can be hacked, tracked, or even shut down, leaving users vulnerable. Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these risks by decentralizing the entire process. When a user connects to the dVPN, their data is encrypted and routed through multiple blockchain nodes. Each node adds a layer of security, ensuring that no single entity has control over the connection. This approach has far-reaching implications. For individuals, it means browsing without the fear of being tracked or censored. For businesses, it ensures that sensitive communications remain private, even in high-risk environments. And for developers, it opens up new possibilities for creating privacy-focused applications. As the internet becomes increasingly centralized, tools like Qubetics’ dVPN are essential for protecting freedom and privacy online. This innovation highlights why $TICS is one of the best altcoins to join this week, offering both practical value and investment potential. Conclusion: Why These Altcoins Deserve Your Attention Qubetics ($TICS), Astra, and Theta aren’t just cryptocurrencies—they’re solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in the digital age. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN redefines online privacy, ensuring secure and anonymous access to the internet. Astra’s integration of blockchain and AI offers a powerful tool for data analysis and decision-making. And Theta’s decentralized video streaming network empowers creators and viewers while improving content delivery. If you’re searching for the best altcoins to join this week , these three projects stand out with their unique features, active communities, and potential for real-world impact. Whether you’re drawn to privacy, AI, or streaming innovation, Qubetics, Astra, and Theta offer opportunities you won’t want to miss. The future of blockchain is here—be part of it today.

Platforms like Polkadot, which facilitates interoperable blockchain ecosystems, and Avalanche, which enhances decentralized applications through subnets, are pioneering in their own right. However, Web3Bay (3BAY) is setting a new standard by merging blockchain’s robust security features with the operational efficiencies of e-commerce. This unique blend results in a user-centric marketplace enhanced by smart contracts and decentralized storage, offering a comprehensive solution that emphasizes data integrity, user empowerment, and scalable commerce. Decoding Polkadot’s Climb to $10: Vital Metrics for Traders Polkadot (DOT) has captured the market’s attention with its notable price movements. After surmounting initial resistance levels, it saw a retracement that provided a setup for potential growth based on market behaviors. The trading volume and Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggest a balanced momentum, and with the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio returning to equilibrium, DOT is positioned for a possible ascent towards the $10 mark, given it can navigate through the resistance levels effectively. Avalanche’s Subnet Progress Could Trigger a Rise in AVAX Prices The growth of Avalanche’s subnet capabilities signifies burgeoning potential, marked by a notable increase in both the mainnet and testnet activities. This expansion not only broadens its decentralized application capabilities but also enhances user engagement. Coupled with rising institutional interest and AVAX’s deflationary economics, the token is forecasted to reach new heights, potentially escalating to between $75 and $85 in the near future. These projections are underpinned by robust fundamentals and market resilience, highlighting a promising outlook for AVAX. Why Choose Web3Bay? Assessing Its Technical Innovations & Market Viability Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce with its state-of-the-art technology, offering unmatched security and efficiency. It uses blockchain and smart contracts to remove middlemen, ensuring direct and secure transactions. The use of decentralized storage via IPFS protects user data from cyber threats and unauthorized access, positioning Web3Bay as a sturdy, secure global trading hub. Scalability stands out in Web3Bay’s arsenal, addressing traditional blockchain constraints. With Layer-2 solutions and auto-scaling capabilities, the platform manages high volumes of transactions efficiently and affordably, guaranteeing a smooth experience for users at all times, making it a trusted platform for sellers and buyers. Against traditional marketplaces like Amazon or eBay, Web3Bay provides clear benefits through its blockchain technology by eliminating central control, enhancing user empowerment, and reducing fees. Its user-focused model promotes transparency and equity, fostering community spirit. Unlike conventional platforms that focus on profit, Web3Bay’s model returns value to its users, creating a more just marketplace. With over $580,000 already raised, demonstrating significant investor confidence, and tokens currently priced at $0.0039675 in its third presale phase, Web3Bay is marked as a key player in transforming decentralized e-commerce. Key Insights While platforms like Polkadot and Avalanche demonstrate the functional and scalable capabilities of blockchain in the commercial sector, Web3Bay distinguishes itself by directly catering to the needs of the contemporary user. It integrates sophisticated blockchain security, smart contracts, and decentralized governance to provide a transparent, empowering, and scalable solution.

Because of the magnitude of the acquisition, there have been a lot of questions and speculations floating around about what the company’s next moves are in the coming weeks or months. Related Reading: XRP Price Stays Steady: Will Consolidation End Soon? A lot of people are curious about whether or not this move indicates a new strategy or a change in the way that Ripple intends to approach the market. This large-scale transfer has certainly piqued the interest of investors and experts alike, and as a result, Ripple’s subsequent actions are something that should be actively monitored. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 300,000,000 #XRP (682,584,540 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallethttps://t.co/d5Vu4aasU6 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 9, 2025 Significant XRP Transaction The transfer occurred on January 9, 2025, and was tracked by Whale Alert. The average exchange price for each XRP was approximately $2.275. Notably, this is not the first instance of Ripple transferring such a substantial sum; merely days prior, a same volume of XRP was dispatched to a Ripple address on New Year’s Day. These movements indicate that Ripple may be up for something big. Market Responses And Speculations Historically, large Ripple transactions have greatly changed market mood. An escrow fund moved earlier this month produced a notable 15% price rise in XRP. The current activity is not an exception; traders and investors are closely monitoring how it impacts market dynamics. Although the actual objective of this latest action is unknown, observers speculate that it could be tied to Ripple’s ongoing efforts to enhance the value of XRP. Potential Changes In Regulations While Ripple negotiates these obstacles, there is also hope for potential legislative improvements under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The crypto community believes that this adjustment will help new crypto ventures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) be introduced more easily. Such changes could significantly increase institutional interest and trade volume for XRP, hence changing its long-term course. Related Reading: Bitcoin As The New S&P 500 Of Our Time?

The sudden loss of stability compounds a rough start to the year that began with Usual’s token, once a market favorite, losing its momentum. The token price already dropped by over 30% within a week. Usual was one of the eye-catching stablecoin projects that emerged in 2024, launching on Binance at the end of 2024 with great market performance. It has the backing of French MP Pierre Person’s government background and Binance’s famed launchpad. The stablecoin markets saw a boom in 2024, with at least 23 stablecoin projects securing substantial funding ranging from 2 million to 45 million in the second half of the year. How the market reacted to USD0++ losing its 1:1 peg Crypto market analysts quickly took to X to warn their audience about further price drops in the future. The question everyone is asking now is whether USD0++ is about to become another UST. The USD0++ stablecoin fell to a low of $0.89 before rising to stabilize at around $0.93—about 7% below its intended $1 peg. The dual exit system provides users with two redemption options: A conditional exit: this option allows for 1:1 redemption at the $1 peg but demands that users forfeit a portion of accrued rewards. An unconditional exit: this option allows redemption at a current floor price of $0.87, but it is set to rise gradually to $1 over a period of four years. The abrupt changes to the protocol’s official documentation shocked many users, shaking out weak hands and leaving the stronger ones gasping for clarity. Stani Kulechov, founder of Aave, shared his opinions on the situation via a post on X. In his statement, he emphasized the risks linked with immutable price feeds. His comments also reflected broader community concerns regarding the implications of new redemption mechanisms, stating his preference for GHO, an alternative stablecoin. This is another example on how things can go wrong with fully hardcoded and immutable price feeds. USD0++ depegged to $0.93 and the given USD0++ holders lock their asset for 4 years, the discounted illiquid value in reality is at $0.855. Resulting now to a bank run on Morpho,… https://t.co/ruQK6qw7EQ — Stani (@StaniKulechov) January 10, 2025 Other users have also echoed his sentiments as the market continues to react to the shocking update with significant volatility. Things got so bad that liquidity providers on platforms like Curve Finance and Pendle reportedly experienced sudden shifts that resulted in hundreds of millions in USD0++ leaving the DeFi ecosystem, raising fears of multimillion-dollar liquidations. Responding to community concerns, Usual’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has announced plans to cover any potential bad debt in non-migrable markets up to the current amount. Why did Usual settle on $0.87? There are two possible theories about why the official announcement set the unconditional exit ratio at a precise 0.87. One is the profit burning theory. Consider the possibility of the 0.87:1 ratio set in the official announcement triggering a profit evaluation among whale holders. Since the previous 1:1 guaranteed redemption strategy failed, losing the official guarantee, large holders now face the dilemma of selecting the best option among the “short ones.” If they go for conditional redemption, investors need to return part of their subsequent profits to the project. The problem is the details of this profit withdrawal have not been disclosed officially. Conversely, if they accept the unconditional redemption method, the worst-case scenario guarantees only $0.87, with the remaining $0.13 becoming the core of the game. Naturally, when either of the two exit methods offers higher returns, the more profitable one comes out on top. A well-designed mechanism should allow users the opportunity to choose rather than be “one-sided.” As such, the $0.13 gap likely means that the official has yet to disclose the portion of profits that need to be burned, allowing users to make a choice between the two methods. From the user’s perspective, if they have to pay a guaranteed cost of $0.13 later, they might as well sell at the current depegged price (currently around $0.94). USD0++ would then return to its economic essence as a bond, with $0.13 representing the discounted portion, while $0.87 reflects its intrinsic value. The other is the liquidation bottom line theory. Before the update, Usual’s mechanism allowed many large holders to safely take positions and obtain almost risk-free returns. This further increases leverage and capital efficiency via lending protocols like Morpho. Typically, these users engaging in circular lending would collateralize their USD0++, borrow a certain amount of USDC, then exchange this USDC for USD0++, and subsequently initiate a new round of circular lending. These users, who benefited from circular lending, provided Usual with considerable TVL, continuously elevating the system. However, there is a liquidation line behind the TVL “perpetual motion machine.” In the Morpho protocol, the liquidation line for USD0 is determined by the Loan-to-Value ratio (LLTV). LLTV is a fixed ratio, and when a user’s Loan-to-Value (LTV) exceeds LLTV, their position is exposed to liquidation risk. At this time, Morpho’s liquidation line is set at 86%, just a step away from the 0.87 bottom line in the official unconditional exit. The 0.87 in Usual’s official announcement is just above Morpho’s 0.86 liquidation line. It can be likened to a final barrier set by the official to prevent systemic liquidation risks. The new update means many loans are now above the liquidation threshold. The situation is worsened by a hardcoded oracle, leading to an exodus of suppliers and a spike in borrow rates. Some users have called for on-chain hedging and liquidity buffers to mitigate such risks, emphasizing the importance of risk management in DeFi. Holders await further news next week There is still a lot of panic surrounding USD0++ in the market, but a majority of people have taken a cautious approach, holding their positions and waiting to see what happens. The market’s reasonable value for USD0++ is around 0.94, but all eyes are on official channels as people expect to hear detailed information on how the “unconditional exit” will burn and how much profit will be deducted next week. If the worst happens and Usual does not burn the anticipated 13 points next week and instead chooses to burn 0.5% of USUAL, then USD0++ could quickly re-peg to around 0.995. In short, the re-pegging of USD0++ is dependent on the burning details Usual is expected to announce next week. Regardless of how the final mechanism details are determined, holders of the tokens UsualX and USUAL are expected to benefit. The market’s exit method will decrease USUAL/USD0++ TVL, driving up the price of the USUAL token.

The proposal highlights Bitcoin’s historical growth and its potential as an inflation-resistant asset compared to traditional cash and bonds. Meta Shareholder Board to Consider Bitcoin Treasury? As per the proposal, by the end of the year 2024, that is, by December 30, the price of Bitcoin had increased by 124% in a year which was even better than the average performance of bonds. In the last five years, the price of Bitcoin has risen by 1,265%, while bonds have been a distant second with an average return difference of 1,245%. Amid this announcement, Bitcoin price has seen a recovery with the price swaying between an intra-day high and low of $95,770 and $92,250, respectively. The submission also points out that cash and cash equivalents (which account for $72 billion out of $256 billion of Meta’s total assets as of September 30, 2024) are vulnerable to depreciation owing to inflation. It posits that integrating a part of these cash reserves with Bitcoin may be a way of preserving shareholder value even with the known volatility of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Adoption Among Corporations and Institutions The proposal emphasizes the transition of Bitcoin from an investment or a payment method to a treasury asset for companies and institutions. MicroStrategy, a business that acquired Bitcoin early on, claimed that its equity rose by 17,000% through using BTC in its balance sheeting strategy. Likewise, Square (now Block) was 2.5 times better than the Nasdaq index and 12 times better than Meta’s performance. Moreover, BlackRock, the second biggest Meta’s institutional investor, has introduced a Bitcoin ETF that turned into the most popular ETF in history. BlackRock has also come out in public stating that 2% of investment in Bitcoin is a good approach towards investing for the future. The Meta shareholder’s proposal is that an allocation of this kind for Meta’s treasury could demonstrate progressive financial stewardship and be consistent with other leading companies. Support from Meta Leadership and Industry Trends According to the proposal, Meta’s leadership and its stakeholders have displayed interest in Bitcoin and its ecosystem. Meta’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and its board member Marc Andreessen who is also a member of Coinbase’s board has previously supported blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The shareholder argues that Meta shareholders should receive treasury management strategies that are similar to the sophisticated financial management strategies that most probably, some of Meta’s directors and executives have used. The submission also mentions several companies and governments considering Bitcoin or already implementing it in the treasuries. For example, a bill was recently submitted to the New Hampshire legislature , which provides for the ability of the state treasury to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset together with precious metals such as gold and silver. In the same way, public firms such as Heritage Distilling Holding Company and Genius Group Ltd have also embraced Bitcoin where Genius Group Ltd for instance purchased $5 million worth of bitcoins as part of its Bitcoin-first strategy. Request for Assessment and Fiduciary Duty The proposal calls on Meta’s board to perform an assessment to find out if it would be in the best interest of shareholders to include Bitcoin in Meta’s reserve. Thus, it postulates that as a fiduciary duty, the board should consider investments that can yield a return higher than cash and bonds, even if these investments are associated with higher risks. Meta has always been known as a technology leader and a pioneer of new approaches to business. The Meta shareholder argues that this will strengthen this reputation by making Meta as one fo the first corporations to embrace Bitcoin. The request is more of a proposition but does not require a particular action, which focuses on the need to evaluate the possibility of using Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Concurrently, John Deaton, a pro crypto lawyer has pointed out that Microsoft shareholders recently rejected the idea of investing in Bitcoin after a similar motion was made. Deaton further explained that Meta shareholders might find themselves in a similar situation but pointed out that companies that are waiting for future legislation that supports Bitcoin adoption such as the State Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) provisions in the Lummis Bill might view BTC as an acquisition of strategic importance.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping $1,500 after December nonfarm payrolls (NFP) exceeded forecasts. The stronger-than-expected labor market data, coupled with lower unemployment figures, put pressure on risk assets, including Bitcoin. Markets interpreted the results as reducing the likelihood of significant Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the near future. With less aggressive rate cuts anticipated, the potential for increased liquidity flowing into Bitcoin and other crypto assets diminished. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, the probability of even a modest 0.25% rate cut at the Fed’s January meeting stood at just 2.7%. Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, commented on the market reaction, stating: “NFP comes in HOT, the UNRATE comes in cold, which is great news for the strength of the economy, so why did BTC and the broader market dump? Simple. This points to fewer FED Rate Cuts in 2025.” Alan also noted the seasonal impact on the data and speculated that the incoming Trump administration might enact policies with significant economic implications. Liquidity data on Binance highlighted $88,000 and $90,000 as key support zones for BTC/USDT. Despite the macroeconomic dip, BTC maintained a familiar trading range, with clear support and resistance levels visible. Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades advised: “Market is either up only or down only on these smaller timeframes. In the end, many get chopped up. Zooming out is my recommendation.” Analyst Rekt Capital offered a bullish outlook, pointing to a bullish divergence in Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) and highlighting historical patterns in price discovery corrections. “It is the first Price Discovery Correction of this cycle.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS.

Dogecoin’s Meme Power Fuels a Potential 45% Rally Dogecoin, the original meme coin, is once again showing its strength, with analysts predicting a potential 45% rally. DOGE’s popularity remains fueled by its active community and endorsements from high-profile figures. Recent developments, including potential integrations with popular social media platforms and new utility cases, have bolstered investor sentiment. The surge in DOGE’s price can also be attributed to growing adoption for tipping and micropayments, a niche that aligns well with its low transaction fees and high accessibility. As market enthusiasm grows, DOGE continues to showcase its resilience and ability to capture investor attention. Toncoin (TON) Gains 15% Amid Ecosystem Expansion Toncoin has been going up, rising 15% as its sys͏tem keeps growing. TON’s ability to handle more users and its aim for shared talking platforms make it a tempting pick for builders and folks looking for privacy-focused options. With its smooth connection with apps like chatting and safe deals, TON is making a special spot in the blockchain area. The new price rise shows more use of TON’s traits, mainly in places where privacy and quickness are key. Experts think that as the Toncoin group expands, its worth will draw even greater notice from businesses and everyday investors too. Lightchain AI Rising Altcoin With Strong Investor Appeal While DOGE and TON dominate short-term headlines, Lightchain AI is emerging as a game-changing altcoin with long-term potential. The project’s presale success reflects strong investor confidence in its roadmap, which focuses on solving real-world challenges through blockchain and AI integration. Lightchain AI emphasizes developer-focused initiatives, offering grants, resources, and a sandbox environment to encourage innovation. These programs aim to accelerate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps), driving the platform’s adoption and utility. Also the price of Lightchain AI’s token , LCAI, remains relatively low compared to its peers, making it an affordable entry point for investors. As the project gains traction and more partnerships are announced, analysts predict that the demand for LCAI will rise significantly.

Current price projections for prominent assets are capturing the attention of traders and the market. The Binance Coin (BNB) price forecast shows a measured optimism, with expectations to challenge the $750 resistance while holding support at $680. Concurrently, the Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction for 2025 offers a nuanced view, poised between promising growth and the looming specter of regulatory obstacles. Both digital assets demonstrate the typical market dynamics of facing challenges while spotting opportunities. Moreover, the advanced technologies of EVM and WASM are thrusting BlockDAG (BDAG) into prominence among top crypto coins for 2025. With a robust presale raising over $178.5 million and vibrant ecosystem growth, BlockDAG highlights its unique capabilities and potential for adoption. This positions BDAG as an enticing option for those seeking impactful market engagement. BNB Price Maintains Optimism Amidst Challenges The BNB price forecast reveals an optimistic yet watchful stance, with the digital currency currently valued at $708. Market analysts anticipate that a continuous upward trend might elevate BNB to between $750 and $800, assuming stability above the 21-day SMA. Yet, the $750 resistance level has consistently hindered further gains. Should downward pressures intensify, the BNB price forecast alerts to a potential drop to $635 or below if support levels falter. Recent market analysis indicates a price movement confined between $680 and $720, restricted by the prevailing moving averages. The BNB price forecast underscores the necessity for a clear surge to clarify its future direction as the market looks forward to what lies ahead. AVAX Price Outlook Reflects Promising Yet Cautious Future The Avalanche price prediction portrays a varied forecast for 2025, with analysts emphasizing factors influencing its market trajectory. Price expectations range from $50 to $150, shaped by market dynamics and how broadly the Avalanche network is embraced. Notable improvements within decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are expected to substantially bolster AVAX’s market value. The Avalanche price prediction also stresses the critical role of network scalability and compatibility. As the platform continues to attract a wider array of dApps and users, its value is anticipated to climb. However, analysts caution about the effects of competition from other blockchain platforms and the uncertainty of regulatory environments, presenting ongoing challenges. Regardless of the outcome, Avalanche is positioned as an essential asset within the crypto arena. The Catalysts Behind BDAG’s Rising Value: EVM and WASM Technologies BlockDAG is making waves with its integration of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), paving the way for potential price rises in BDAG. These technologies allow for the smooth transition of Ethereum-based dApps and expand the developer pool by supporting a variety of programming languages, including Rust and C++. This positions BlockDAG as a strong contender among top crypto coins for 2025. Currently, at a price of $0.0248, the BlockDAG crypto presale has collected $178.5 million, with 17.7 billion BDAG coins distributed since its start. Early supporters have seen an ROIof 2,380%, highlighting its strong market presence. EVM compatibility facilitates an easy switch for Ethereum developers, and WASM enhances functionality and scalability for demanding applications such as gaming and DeFi. BlockDAG’s comprehensive roadmap bolsters BDAG’s prospects for a significant price rise post-launch. Analysts predict a potential price point of $1 by 2025, a testament to its technological prowess and ecosystem expansion. With the presale’s 27th batch concluding soon, it’s a pivotal time for traders. The synergy of BlockDAG’s EVM and WASM is attracting both developers and buyers, positioning BDAG as a top crypto acquisition. Early entrants are anticipated to see substantial returns as the project approaches its $600 million funding goal. Last Verdict The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, with key assets following unique paths. The Binance Coin (BNB) price forecast shows a hopeful outlook, underlining the need to surpass resistance levels for further growth. Likewise, the Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction presents a mixed view, weighing optimistic network adoption against the hurdles of competition and regulatory concerns. Both assets illustrate the intricate journey through the crypto market of 2025. For those scouting the best crypto buys in 2025, BlockDAG distinguishes itself with a community-centric strategy, a promising ecosystem, and a direct trajectory toward a price goal of $1. BlockDAG’s integration of EVM and WASM not only solidifies its role as a burgeoning project but also furnishes utility and scalability that meet market expectations. These elements merge to offer a distinct opportunity for proactive crypto traders.

So, what are the best altcoins to buy right now? We’ve put together a shortlist of promising altcoin projects that have shown bullish price action over the last few weeks, as well as boasting strong use cases or price catalysts for the immediate future. Let’s take a look at the best altcoins in January 2025. Table of Contents What are the best altcoins to buy now? 1. Sui (SUI) 2. Bitget Token (BGB) 3. ai16z (AI16Z) 4. Tokenize Xchange (TKX) 5. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Choosing the best altcoins to buy FAQ What are the best altcoins to buy now? Before we begin, it’s worth noting that nobody can tell you which assets you should or should not invest in. What are your investment goals? What’s your risk appetite? It’s crucial to develop your own investment strategy, including profit targets and stop loss targets, before making any important financial decisions. Yes, the following altcoins could potentially be a welcome addition to the right crypto portfolio once. However, the best altcoins to buy right now are really those coins that best suit your personal trading needs! So make sure you have a clear idea of what you’re after when diving into the world of cryptocurrency altcoins. You might also like: How to build a crypto portfolio: everything you need to know 1. Sui (SUI) SUI, the native token for the Sui ( SUI ) L1 blockchain built to support dApp development, is a popular high-cap altcoin that has seen upward momentum in recent weeks. Late last year, SUI was added to the list of assets traded by the Grayscale investment firm, boosting the coin’s profile and prestige within the industry. SUI rose 31% in the past month and 13% in the last week, now standing at #13 in the market cap rankings. You might also like: Charts of the week: SUI rallies 13%, Uniswap bleeds, what to expect 2. Bitget Token (BGB) Bitget Token is seeing an excellent month with over 108% gains so far and 9% growth over the last 7 days. Bitget Token ( BGB ) benefits from its attachment to the heavy hitting Bitget Wallet project. The token also provides real-world utility within the Bitget ecosystem by offering discounted trading fees, early access to new proects, staking rewards, and free withdrawals. All of the above have contributed to healthy demand for BGB token which looks to have bullish trading activity at the time of writing. 3. ai16z (AI16Z) While we’re often loathe to include meme coins in lists like these, the Solana ecosystem meme coin ai16z gets a mention here for demonstrating strong upward momentum over the last month, capped off with a price correction in the past week. ai16z ( AI16Z ) grew 120% this month before pulling back 26% in the past week, a formidable price drop that could signal that the price is consolidating for another rally. Of course, further research is needed to identify real-time price indicators that might suit your particular trading strategy. However, the confluence of a major increase followed by a lesser pullback certainly creates some of the conditions that can, in some cases, favor a bull run.

Tokenize Xchange (TKX) One promising altcoin that may not be on everyone’s radar at the moment is the coin for the Tokenize Xchange crypto exchange based in Singapore. Tokenize Xchange ( TKX ) coin has risen 144% in the last month, with a 13% pullback in the last 7 days that potentially leaves room for another price increase. The coin offers utility by providing discounted trading fees on the Tokenized Xchange platform. This is a tried and tested method for adding value to a crypto coin, as seen with the roaring success of Binance’s native BNB token. 5. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Virtuals Protocol is a blockchain-powered AI platform that allows users to release autonomous AI ‘agents pre-programmed to handle a variety of tasks. If this rings a bell, it’s because Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) is establishing itself as a direct competitor to the immensely popular Fetch.AI project that is now collaborating with the government of Munich and making major waves in the crypto space. Virtuals Protocol is targeting a fairly niche area of the blockchain industry with few competitors and a lot of potential value, and it’s likely that the hype over the coin’s potential is behind the recent 79% jump in value over the last month, despite a 29% pullback this week. Choosing the best altcoins to buy When evaluating the right altcoin to buy, there are a few things to consider. The health and reputation of a project and its staff is always important, and can be partially gauged by checking news stories and social media posts around the project. Projects with anonymous staff, for example, are sometimes regarded with more caution due to the perceived risk of them acting in bad faith, while projects with staff that have a good track record in business might soothe some of those concerns for potential investors. The use case and viability of a project, such as the intended purpose of its native cryptocurrency and blockchain network, should arguably be the deciding factor. Projects that have demonstrated a real-world use case are often seen as more viable than projects whose product is still theoretical.

That’s the vibe as meme coins like Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) make waves, all while BTFD Coin (BTFD) emerges as the newest powerhouse with staking rewards and a presale buzz that’s hard to ignore. Meme coins aren’t just internet jokes anymore—they’ve become a cultural and financial phenomenon. While PNUT rebounds from a $0.50 low and GOAT holds steady with impressive market metrics, BTFD is taking the meme coin world by storm with a 90% APY on staking and a presale that’s raked in over $5.1 million. So, what makes these coins worth a spot in your portfolio? Let’s dive into the unique narratives driving these top new meme coins to invest in today. BTFD Coin: The Ultimate Staking Opportunity BTFD Coin—short for “ Buy The Dip ”—is more than just a catchy name; it’s a movement. Built on Ethereum, BTFD is designed to capitalize on market volatility, flipping every dip into a launchpad for gains. But what sets BTFD apart is its jaw-dropping 90% APY staking rewards. Imagine this: You invest $650 in Stage 13 of the presale, where BTFD is priced at $0.000142 per coin. That buys you over 4.57 million tokens. When BTFD hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006, your investment could balloon to nearly $2,742. Now add the potential of staking rewards. With 90% APY, your BTFD stash could double in a year, offering returns most projects can only dream about. What’s more, BTFD isn’t just about individual gains—it’s about community. With over 8000 holders already, the “Bulls” are charging ahead, turning this token into a collective force in the market. BTFD’s 90% APY Staking: A New Era of Crypto Earning BTFD Coin is turning heads with its groundbreaking 90% annual percentage yield staking program, offering investors the chance to grow their holdings exponentially. This isn’t just about holding tokens—it’s about making your crypto work for you. The process is simple: stake your BTFD tokens once claimed and start earning immediately. With rewards that compound over time, staking becomes a powerful tool for long-term growth. This program isn’t just lucrative for investors; it strengthens the BTFD ecosystem by promoting token stability and reducing sell-offs. With $5.1 million raised and over 63 billion tokens sold in its presale, BTFD’s staking feature is proving to be a key driver of its success. For anyone seeking top new meme coins to invest in today, BTFD’s 90% APY staking program is the opportunity you don’t want to miss. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): The Rebound King If there’s a meme coin to watch, it’s Peanut the Squirrel. PNUT has clawed its way back from a $0.50 dip to $0.70, fueled by significant whale accumulation. One standout transaction saw a whale snag 10 million tokens, worth $6.1 million—roughly 1% of the total supply. PNUT’s resurgence has also captured futures traders’ attention, with open interest surging 35% to $223 million. This shows that PNUT isn’t just a retail favorite; institutional players are taking notice too. And with analysts hinting at a potential rally toward the $1 mark, PNUT is proving it’s not just a flash in the pan. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): A Meme Coin with Staying Power Goatseus Maximus, or GOAT, is living up to its name. Trading at $0.54 with a market cap of $538 million, GOAT has solidified its position as a meme coin heavyweight. Its 24-hour trading volume of $128 million underscores its liquidity and active community. GOAT’s success is partly thanks to its origin story. Designed by the Truth Terminal AI, GOAT blends internet culture with cutting-edge tech. Listed on major exchanges like HTX and OKX, it’s not just surviving—it’s thriving. And while its all-time high of $1.03 may seem distant, GOAT’s steady metrics suggest it’s here for the long haul. How to Buy BTFD Ready to jump on the BTFD bandwagon? Here’s how: Set up your wallet. Get started with MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Keep your private key secure. Load your wallet. Add BNB or ETH to your wallet. Connect your wallet. Head to the presale page and link your wallet. Buy BTFD. Choose your currency, enter the amount, and confirm the transaction. Claim your tokens. Once the presale ends, claim your $BTFD coins. Stay updated. Keep an eye on staking rewards and token unlocks. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, these top new meme coins to invest in today are more than just hype. BTFD Coin stands out with its 90% APY staking rewards and a P2E game that’s redefining earning potential in crypto. Meanwhile, PNUT’s rebound and GOAT’s solid metrics make them strong contenders in the meme coin race. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio, now’s the time to consider these rising stars.

Ethereum Has Appeared To Be Moving Inside An Ascending Channel Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed a pattern that Ethereum has potentially been following recently. The pattern in question is the “Ascending Channel” from technical analysis (TA). Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Turns Red: More Decline Coming? Parallel Channels form when the price of an asset consolidates between two parallel trendlines. The upper level of the channel is drawn by connecting successive tops, while the lower one joins bottoms. This pattern can take three orientations: positive slope, negative slope, and zero slope. In the first of these, the trendlines track a phase of consolidation toward the upside, and the pattern is known as an Ascending Channel. Similarly, in the second, the price trends downward, with the formation being called a Descending Channel. The third type, where the trendlines are parallel to the time-axis, doesn’t have any particular name. Like other consolidation patterns in TA, the upper line of a Parallel Channel is likely to pose resistance to the price, while the lower one may act as a point of support. Breaks above either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction; an escape above the channel is bullish, and a fall under it is bearish. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Ascending Channel that Ethereum has possibly been trading inside during the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum price retested the upper level of this channel during the rally in the first quarter of last year. The cryptocurrency found rejection at the level and started on a downward trajectory that would eventually force it to retest the lower line. ETH spent a bit of time making multiple touches of the line during the retest, but the pattern ended up holding up as the coin achieved a rebound. The resulting rally couldn’t take the price to the upper level, however, as it, in fact, fizzled out only mid-way through the journey. The asset has since been on a decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Not Reached ‘Extreme Euphoria’ Phase Yet, Glassnode Reveals Interestingly, a similar pattern was also witnessed in 2023, where a rejection halfway through the channel led Ethereum to a retest of the bottom line, which kickstarted the bull run. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted how ETH’s upcoming price trend could look if a similar trajectory follows now as well. “If Ethereum $ETH is following an ascending parallel channel, a dip to the lower boundary at $2,800 could act as a launchpad for a move toward $6,000,” notes the analyst. From the current price of the cryptocurrency, a bull rally to this $6,000 final target would imply growth of almost 82%. ETH Price Ethereum has been unable to make any notable recovery from its recent plunge yet as its price is still trading around $3,300.

Peck indicated that Meta’s cash reserve is highly affected by inflation and could lose up to 28% of its cash assets. He urged that Bitcoin has performed well as a store of value over the past five years, beating bonds by almost 1,262%. Peck also wrote in the proposal: Mark Zuckerberg named his goats ‘Bitcoin’ and ‘Max.’ Meta director Marc Andreessen has praised Bitcoin and is also a director at Coinbase. Do Meta shareholders not deserve the same kind of responsible asset allocation for the Company that Meta directors and executives likely implement for themselves? ~Ethan Peck Peck submitted the request to Meta on behalf of its family shares Peck is not new to submitting such requests due to his professional background. He is part of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a renowned think tank in Washington, D.C., that promotes market policies to various institutions and relevant government agencies. His agency, The National Center for Public Policy Research, has submitted similar proposals, including the Bitcoin treasury shareholder proposals to Microsoft and Amazon in 2024. However, Peck has spelt out that his current proposal is submitted to Meta on behalf of his family’s shares. In his proposal, he justified his quest by leveraging submissions made by relevant entities. He said that BlackRock, Meta’s second-largest institutional shareholder, “advised that a 2% BTC allocation is reasonable.” Most traditional tech firms are uncomfortable with establishing a Bitcoin reserve The Washington, D.C. think-tank submission that recommended that Microsoft convert 1% of its $484 billion assets to Bitcoin didn’t succeed. At a December 10 meeting, Microsoft shareholders shot down the proposal via a vote. A day before the Microsoft proposal was shut down, The National Center for Public Policy Research suggested the same BTC corporate treasury diversification strategy to Amazon shareholders. The outcome of the Amazon proposal will be announced in April 2025, when shareholders will meet to discuss several issues. In the proposal, the organization argued that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) — a measure of inflation based on baskets of household goods — is a poor gauge of inflation and suggested that the true inflation rate is double the CPI. Bitcoin’s volatility might be the reason tech firms are preventing themselves from allocating part of their cash assets into Bitcoin reserves. They fear that the move is risky and that they may lose their resources if they adopt it.

Announced last December 2024, the Barcelona and Cardano collaboration aims to blend technology and sports to benefit its growing community of fans and sports enthusiasts. The initiative will cover three objectives: engage FC Barcelona’s growing fan base, boost on-chain transactions, and expand Cardano’s ecosystem. Although the initiative was first announced on LinkedIn, it was through a Twitter/X post by Frederik Gregaard that the project gained traction. In a shared post, FC Barcelona aims to build its Web 3.0 vision by leveraging blockchain, which will empower its fans. Barça x Cardano: A Game-Changing Partnership! FC Barcelona and Cardano are teaming up to reshape fan engagement & create global opportunities. What makes Barça unique?Unlike most clubs, Barça is community-owned—150K+ socis (members) & 1,200+ fan clubs (Penyes) shape… pic.twitter.com/Kdh8malZI3 — Frederik Gregaard (@F_Gregaard) January 9, 2025 Barca X Cardano Partnership Promises To Empower Fans In Gregaard’s shared post, FC Barcelona aims to improve its reach and reshape fan engagement by partnering with Cardano. Barca’s partnership with Cardano is a perfect fit since both companies are leaders and innovators in their respective industries. FC Barcelona is one of La Liga’s biggest brands with a unique selling point. Barca is community-driven, with over 150,000 members and 1,200 fan clubs or Penyes, which impact the team’s roadmap. On the other hand, Cardano is backed by a vibrant community that sets its policies and overall direction. Fans Get The Rewards The two companies’ collaboration primarily aims to engage fans and expand the crypto company’s ecosystem. In the same post, Gregaard shared that this collaboration aims to complete three objectives. First, it seeks to create employment opportunities for FC Barcelona’s young fans and supporters. Second, it promotes learning and understanding of crypto and the blockchain, which clearly benefits Cardano. Third, the collaboration can reward Barca fans with digital assets like ADA and NFTs. The project will primarily run on Cardano’s Andamio platform, which aims to support the enterprises’ adoption of the blockchain. Cardano and FC Barcelona will mainly focus on Barca Vision, a platform that aims to improve players’ engagement by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and Web 3.0. The BarcaVerse FC Barcelona and Cardano’s collaboration will ultimately create the BarcaVerse , a platform where fans can connect with their peers. As mentioned, the BarcaVerse will run on Cardano’s Andamio and works using the learn, work, and reward model. Here, fans can learn and master some skills, like gender equality and sustainability, or work on real-life FC Barcelona projects, like celebrating the club’s 125th anniversary. And for their application of skills and knowledge, they can earn rewards in the form of tokens and NFTs. The initiative will benefit both companies in the long run. Barca can connect with and re-engage its loyal fanbase. Barca fans will also be able to earn money while learning skills. For Cardano, this project will expand Andamio’s ecosystem and drive blockchain adoption.

YBIT's synthetic covered call strategy limits upside potential, resulting in flat returns since it launched despite Bitcoin's significant gains. YBIT has also lagged behind more traditional income products like T-bills and corporate bonds, questioning its viability as an income investment. Given its performance, I see no compelling reason to choose YBIT over alternative investment options for income or Bitcoin exposure. After providing Seeking Alpha readers with my favorite way to play the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rise to $100,000 per coin back in early-November, the long-awaited psychological six-figure number has come and gone not once, but twice. More recently, through coverage of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ), I've explored how close we might be to a price top for this cycle and the recent trends in network scaling and development . My current view is that Bitcoin's 2024 halving epoch has yet to reach its price climax. Today, we're going to take a different angle on Bitcoin's potential rise to new highs in 2025; how to not play that move. YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy YieldMax products have become increasingly more popular in recent years, specifically with investors who want 'high-yielding' income products. I've explored several of these products in the past and I think it would be accurate to call my coverage of these types of funds somewhat polarizing. Some of the critiques of my YieldMax fund analysis have been fair and other critiques much less so, from where I sit. In my initial coverage of the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF ( YBIT ) we'll assess whether or not the fund fails against three different strategies. First, the fund details: Inception: 4//22/24 Expense Ratio: 0.99% AUM: $110 million 30 Day SEC Yield: 1.92% Rather than simply buying and holding Bitcoin, the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF utilizes a synthetic covered call strategy to produce income for shareholders as a primary objective. The secondary objective of the fund is to offer exposure to the share price gains from the Bitcoin investment products that the fund trades through the aforementioned options. Though it should be noted that upside is limited due to the nature of the covered call strategy. Data by YCharts The fund does indeed pay out large monthly dividends to shareholders. The question is whether or not the total return to shareholders justifies investment. Performance Against BTC Income Peers YieldMax is not the only fund that aims to provide investors income from Bitcoin options strategies. Other such funds include the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF ( MAXI ), the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ), and the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ). Of these funds, YBIT is among the newest having less than a year in the market: Fund Details YBIT MAXI BTCI YBTC Inception 04/22/2024 09/29/2022 10/16/2024 01/17/2024 Expense Ratio 0.99% 6.10% 0.98% 0.95% AUM $110.17M $56.92M $49.00M $93.89M Source: Seeking Alpha One clear standout from this table is the enormous expense ratio from MAXI. As far as I can tell, this is due to that fund having a far more complex strategy than the other three products. Given such a large management fee, one might reasonably expect YBIT to outperform MAXI over time. So far, that has simply not been the case: Total Return (Seeking Alpha) Since inception, YBIT investors are flat while each of the competing high-yield Bitcoin options ETFs have generated more than a 20% total return. Not only has YBIT under-performed against MAXI since YBIT's April inception, but it has also failed to keep up with BTCI and more recently with YBTC. And again, this is showing total return, not price performance. Anyone who bought YBIT the day it was launched has essentially broken even, in spite of Bitcoin returning over 38% over the same time period. Of course, not every YBIT shareholder bought the fund the day it launched. Even for savvy investors who opportunistically bought the early-September price low, the fund has under-performed: Data by YCharts Comparing YieldMax funds to the underlying assets used in the options strategy has been a point of some contention. The chart above shows that YBIT has under-performed both Bitcoin and MAXI - the latter of which is a fund that figures to be competing with YBIT for the same type of investor. Here's an important question that I would challenge fans of these instruments to consider; if nailing bottoms in the price of the underlying asset is such an important determining factor in generating a total return that will still ultimately lag the underlying asset, what is the point of buying the income instrument? Performance Against A Simple Profit-Taking Strategy In the comments section of my last YieldMax article, Jamie Ellis had what I felt to be the most fair critique of my analysis. He and I seem to have an agreement on the very real draw-down risk of funds like YBIT. In that critique, he raised a very interesting point about how these funds compare to profit-taking strategies in the underlying assets. For instance, we know how YBIT has performed since its inception and more recently since Bitcoin's September lows. What is less obvious is whether or not YBIT total returns have outperformed a basic profit-taking strategy in a similarly weighted iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) position. The table below assumes an initial investment of $100,000 in YBIT shares at the closing price of $20.45 on April 23rd, 2024 for 4,890 shares. Our YBIT share count remains consistent, but in the far right column I'm showing the month end total value of the investment of those 4,890 shares with the cumulative dividend payouts from each month. YBIT Month End Closing Share Price Position Value YBIT Payout Share Value + Cumulative Payouts April $18.55 $90,709 $0 $90,709 May $20.57 $100,587 $0 $100,587 June $17.01 $83,178 $6,703 $89,881 July $16.28 $79,609 $5,948 $92,260 August $13.80 $67,482 $3,279 $83,411 September $13.78 $67,384 $3,529 $86,842 October $12.25 $59,902 $7,185 $86,545 November $13.85 $67,726 $6,183 $100,552 December $12.37 $60,489 $3,466 $96,781 Source: YieldMax, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations Simply taking the distributions from holding YBIT would have resulted in a small investment loss at the end of 2024 with share value and cumulative payouts totaling under $97,000 - below the initial $100,000 investment in April. And this is before any potential taxes on distributions. How would investors have performed if they instead bought $100,000 in IBIT and reduced their positions by 3% each month on the day of YBIT's ex-dividend date? In the table below, we're assuming 2,638 shares of IBIT purchased at $37.90 in April. YBIT Ex-Div Date IBIT Share Close IBIT Share Value at Ex-Date 3% IBIT Reduction New Share Count 6/6/24 $40.16 $105,963 $3,179 2559 7/5/24 $32.20 $82,412 $2,549 2480 8/7/24 $31.19 $77,358 $2,321 2406 9/6/24 $30.41 $73,161 $2,195 2334 10/3/24 $34.72 $81,024 $2,431 2264 10/31/24 $39.78 $90,047 $2,701 2196 11/29/27 $55.21 $121,225 $3,637 2130 12/27/24 $53.68 $114,330 $3,430 2066 Source: YieldMax, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations At the end of December, the remaining 2,066 shares of IBIT had a market value of over $109k dollars. This is in addition to the $22.4k in cumulative sales from our 3% reductions on YBIT's ex-divi dates. Even if we get more aggressive and reduce IBIT positions by 6% on YBIT ex-dividend days, we still get a better total return in the IBIT position: YBIT Ex-Div Date IBIT Share Close IBIT Share Value at Ex-Date 6% IBIT Reduction New Share Count 6/6/24 $40.16 $105,963 $6,358 2480 7/5/24 $32.20 $79,863 $5,098 2322 8/7/24 $31.19 $72,420 $4,345 2183 9/6/24 $30.41 $66,372 $3,982 2052 10/3/24 $34.72 $71,233 $4,274 1929 10/31/24 $39.78 $76,717 $4,603 1813 11/29/27 $55.21 $100,086 $6,005 1704 12/27/24 $53.68 $91,473 $5,488 1602 Source: YieldMax, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations The 1,602 remaining shares at the end of December have a valuation of $85k, and we've locked in over $40k in realized sales. I must stress that we're not re-investing the dividends from YBIT in this exercise. Doing so would defeat the purpose of comparing YBIT distributions to a profit-taking strategy in a spot ETF. Furthermore, if an investor was actually utilizing the dividend payments from YBIT as a genuine form of income, we shouldn't expect reinvestment anyway, in my estimation. To be fair to YBIT, trading and dividend history for this fund are limited since it is less than a year old. Additionally, most investors likely did not purchase YBIT on launch day. Some have perhaps been lucky enough to buy the lows. While we don't have the amount of data we'd likely want to draw a definitive conclusion on this, so far it has clearly made more sense to take off chunks in IBIT for income rather than holding YBIT since inception, dollars being equal. Especially if one is holding these products in a tax-advantaged account. Performance Against More Traditional 'Income' Now that we can see YBIT has under-performed against both similar products from peers and a simple profit-taking strategy through a spot ETF, we can add a third method for good measure; YBIT vs more traditional income products. To be clear, I've long-held the view that calling YieldMax products 'income investments' is generous. Rather, my view has been that these are raw speculative investments masquerading as income products. But, if we wish to consider a fund that has broken even after eight and half months of market performance to an 'income product,' let's compare YBIT to T-bills and corporate bonds: Data by YCharts The chart above shows the performance of YBIT against the WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund ( USFR ) and the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF ( HYG ). YBIT Holdings as of 1/10/25 (YieldMax) Despite more than half of the YBIT NAV currently sitting in government debt, I happen to think HYG is the far better comp here because the market price of the fund has far more fluctuation on a day-to-day basis than that of USFR. Regardless, YBIT has under-performed both corporate bonds and short term T-bills since its April inception from a total return standpoint. Closing Summary No matter which barometer you choose, YBIT has not been a lucrative investment product. I'll offer some self-reflection; I think one of the mistakes I've made in covering YieldMax products in the past is that I've come off as telling people what to do or what to think. That is not my intention. I'm just sharing what I do and how I think. Readers seemed particularly triggered by my statement that the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) was ""not suitable for income investors."" Surely, that's my opinion and other investors may feel differently. But I can't imagine income investors want their high-income investments to occasionally sniff 30% total losses within 5 months of purchase. That is the risk in funds like YBIT. The fund loses against more traditional income funds. It loses against other Bitcoin options income funds. And it loses against a scheduled profit taking strategy from longing Bitcoin through spot ETFs. I'm failing to see a good reason to long YBIT over alternatives.",BTC-USD|IBIT|YBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-11 03:58:27

Insights on Polkadot & Bitcoin Cash!,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bays-token-prices-are-climbing-fast-secure-yours-now-for-up-to-6430-returns-insights-on-polkadot-bitcoin-cash/,"What if the next evolution of online marketplaces was governed by the collective, not by corporate giants? As Polkadot’s technical enhancements capture attention and Bitcoin Cash remains a staple in the crypto dialogue, there’s a noticeable pivot towards consumer-owned e-commerce models. Leading this shift is Web3Bay (3BAY), which confronts traditional centralized platforms like eBay by offering a decentralized venue where users have a stake in the enterprise. Holding 3BAY tokens means more than shopping—it’s about influencing the future of the marketplace. With governance privileges and unique discounts, Web3Bay offers a new approach to e-commerce. These benefits are available during its presale, making now a key time to get involved. Web3Bay: A Leading Choice in Crypto Today Web3Bay is fundamentally altering the landscape of online shopping by converting every user into an investor and decision-maker. This model contrasts sharply with centralized behemoths like eBay, which restrict user input in governance. Through 3BAY tokens, Web3Bay grants its community governance rights, allowing them to steer the marketplace and benefit from exclusive purchase discounts. This fusion of consumer participation and ownership transforms the e-commerce experience, prioritizing user involvement and value. The ongoing presale of 3BAY tokens initially offered at $0.0039675 and escalating through 25 subsequent phases, represents a prime investment opportunity. To date, the sale has attracted substantial interest, evidenced by over 133 million tokens sold and more than $580,000 raised. Those who join early stand to see potentially substantial returns, with predictions of up to 6430% as token prices peak at $0.1959 in the final phase. This structured approach to the presale underscores the benefit of early participation. Beyond the sale of tokens, Web3Bay’s strategic plan includes expanding features such as governance involvement and future integrations like PayPal compatibility. More than just a marketplace, Web3Bay is cultivating a movement towards communal economic empowerment. For investors and participants looking to make an impact, this presents a timely opportunity to explore one of the best performing cryptos. Polkadot Price Prediction: What Lies Ahead for DOT? Polkadot continues to draw interest with its state-of-the-art blockchain architecture that facilitates smooth interoperability among diverse networks. A significant upgrade, Agile Coretime, has recently taken the place of the older auction protocol, enabling developers to directly acquire core network time. This adjustment boosts accessibility for various projects, underscoring Polkadot’s dedication to its ecosystem’s growth. With nearly half of DOT’s supply actively staked, the network’s stability is reinforced. Anticipations for Polkadot’s 2025 price hover between $11 and $32, potentially climbing to $40 influenced by wider market movements. Projections for 2030 estimate an average price of around $68, with the possibility of reaching up to $75, highlighting the currency’s potential for sustained growth as its ecosystem matures. Bitcoin Cash News: The Rising Profile of BCH Bitcoin Cash continues to assert its presence in the cryptocurrency arena, focusing on enhancing transaction speeds and reducing costs, distinguishing it notably from Bitcoin. Recent coverage points to its escalating appeal in South Korea, where it now ranks fifth among cryptocurrencies, even surpassing major names like Solana and Cardano in regional popularity. The shift of interest towards new tokens like 1Fuel also reflects BCH’s enduring relevance. With a current valuation of $435.97, BCH has maintained stability through fluctuating market conditions. Its broad adoption and practical applications, especially in Asia, help solidify its standing. As it continues to evolve and maintain market engagement, Bitcoin Cash represents a robust option for investors looking for utility and community support. In Conclusion Both Polkadot and Bitcoin Cash are cementing their roles within their respective sectors—Polkadot with its innovative staking and network improvements, and Bitcoin Cash with its expanding global footprint. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is revolutionizing the approach to online commerce with its community-driven, decentralized model. Having already raised substantial funds through its token presale, and with expectations for further growth, Web3Bay stands out as the best performing crypto investment today.

Grewal’s remarks came after Coinbase encountered redacted and incomplete responses from the FDIC, which raised questions about the agency’s transparency. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal Calls Out FDIC In a series of posts on X , Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal has outlined concerns about the FDIC’s process in responding to FOIA requests. He claimed that the FDIC did not perform full-text searches in its Regional Automated Document Distribution (RADD) database. In addition, the agency reportedly denied the requests for documents that were stored in collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams, thus restricting the range of the disclosed data. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal also pointed to specific guidelines in the FDIC’s instructions that required setting some documents as deliberative or attorney-client privileged, which he argues was done to avoid sharing them. Additionally, Coinbase found that at least 150 documents that are potentially related to the case were not included in the FOIA replies provided by the FDIC. Grewal pointed out these loopholes as a cause of concern in the agency’s accountability. The FDIC representatives answered saying, “Considering the increase in the scope of your requests, we shall need time to deliberate on your communication and provide our response.” Concerns About FDIC’s Use of “Pause Letters” The controversy includes the FDIC’s use of “pause letters” sent to banks, urging them to halt services to cryptocurrency clients. Coinbase alleges these letters were later redacted heavily under FOIA Exemption 8, which protects sensitive financial regulatory matters. Paul Grewal claims the exemption was misused to hide information that was not initially considered confidential. The letters allegedly focused on issues like cryptocurrency lending, stablecoins and blockchain based payment systems. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal noted that such actions posed legal risks for compliant crypto businesses since banks were not provided with explanations for the restrictions. Operation Choke Point 2.0 Allegations Resurface This has brought back the conversation about the ‘ Operation Choke Point 2.0’ which was a term used to explain the claims of regulators to deny banking services to cryptocurrency companies. The critics have ascribed the FDIC and other regulators to covertly forcing the banks to shy away from processing crypto transactions using the cover of compliance. The letters, which were written in 2022 and 2023, showed that the FDIC instructed the banks to cease services on different cryptocurrency products but had not given further instructions afterwards. Critics have claimed that this has slowed down innovation and prevented the expansion of financial services within the crypto industry. Similarly, some of the comments made by Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal have elicited reactions from other legal and political personalities such as Senator John E. Deaton. Deaton called for more supervision, and noted that the danger of officials discretionarily cutting off access to financial networks cannot be overlooked. The Coinbase CLO also pointed out that the FDIC should answer clearly as the information disclosed should be made public to ensure that all industries are treated equally, including the cryptocurrency industry.

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 04:15:00

Although the short-term price action appears messy, it’s important to understand that XRP is currently experiencing a local pullback within a broader corrective phase. While the market is consolidating, this creates an interesting scenario for possible future moves. Triangle Pattern Nearing Completion The key chart development for XRP is the triangle pattern that has been in play since December 3. After more than a month of price action, the pattern could soon complete, triggering a price move. Whether this breakout is to the upside or downside remains to be seen, but the next move could happen at any moment. Short-Term Price Action and Key Levels In a bullish scenario, XRP could see an upside breakout. However, it may still dip lower before completing the triangle pattern. On the other hand, the bearish scenario suggests a deeper pullback before confirming a breakdown. While a move down looks more like a corrective pullback, it could still present an opportunity for consolidation before an upside breakout. Key Support and Invalidation Levels The critical support area to watch lies between $2.29 and $2.23. If XRP breaks below $2.29, it could test the key invalidation level at $1.96, which corresponds to the swing low from December 20. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.33 level and is up by more than two percent in the last 24 hours. Fibonacci Levels to Watch Before testing the $1.96 level, XRP must navigate several key Fibonacci levels. These levels, between $2.23 and $2.24, are important to watch for signs of a potential bounce or further decline. A strong reaction at these levels would provide more clarity on whether XRP is setting up for a breakout or breakdown. Breakout Confirmation Levels For an upside breakout, XRP needs to break above the green line at $2.50. This would be the first confirmation level of a breakout. However, to fully confirm the breakout, XRP must surpass the high of the D-wave.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-11 04:35:13

The Office of the Attorney General for Washington State accuses T-Mobile of violating the state’s Consumer Protection Act by deceiving customers about its ability to protect their data even though the firm knew for years that its cybersecurity systems did not meet industry standards. Attorney General Bob Ferguson also alleges that T-Mobile understated the impact of the data breach by neglecting to mention all the information that had been stolen when it sent notices to customers affected by the exploit. “This significant data breach was entirely avoidable. T-Mobile had years to fix key vulnerabilities in its cybersecurity systems – and it failed.” Ferguson says that in August of 2021, T-Mobile became aware of a cybersecurity incident that compromised the data of over 79 million Americans including their phone numbers, names, addresses, driver’s license records along with other personal information. The attorney general also says the hack siphoned the data of 2,025,634 Washington residents, including 183,406 customers who had their Social Security numbers exposed. According to court documents, T-Mobile was in the dark about the hack for many months until it received a tip that its customers’ data were being sold on the dark web. Says the press release, “The data breach began in March 2021 and continued until August 12, 2021. Due to a lack of adequate security monitoring, according to the lawsuit, T-Mobile was unaware of the breach until an anonymous outside source notified the company that its customers’ data was posted for sale on the dark web.” Ferguson says before the 2021 hack, T-Mobile had witnessed “numerous cyberattacks” and knew it would continue to be a target as early as 2020 based on a U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) filing. However, he alleges that the firm did not do anything to address gaps in its systems while reassuring customers on its website that their data was safe by stating: “We’ve got your back. We’re always working to protect you and your family and keep your data secure.” The attorney general also alleges that T-Mobile used easy-to-guess passwords, making it simple for thieves to access the firm’s customer records. “The 2021 breach was enabled, in part, when the hacker guessed obvious credentials to gain access to T-Mobile’s internal databases.” Additionally, Ferguson accuses T-Mobile of misleading customers about the severity of the breach as the firm removed “critical and legally required information” when it issued notices via text messages. “Current customers whose Social Security numbers were exposed did not receive any information regarding that exposure.” The attorney general is asking the court to impose civil penalties on T-Mobile while seeking restitution for Washington residents affected by the hack. He is also seeking injunctive relief to force the firm to revamp its cybersecurity systems and be more transparent when communicating with customers.

All the Bitcoins were mined exclusively from its US-based operations. The latest figure reflects a 236% year-over-year (YoY) increase in its Bitcoin holdings. CleanSpark Hits Milestone Zach Bradford, CEO and President of the firm attributed the milestone to the company’s strategic focus on efficient and responsible scaling, emphasizing the use of American energy and workforce to support its mining operations. In a statement , Gary Vecchiarelli, Chief Financial Officer of CleanSpark, said, This achievement is not just about a number, it is a direct reflection of the success of our financial strategy and how far our industry-leading operations have come, which have evolved since we mined our first bitcoin in December 2021. By avoiding unfavorable counterparty exposure and leveraging our bitcoin to lower our cost of capital, we are positioning CleanSpark as a leader in responsible financial innovation.” According to data compiled by BitcoinTreasuries, CleanSpark trails behind other mining firms such as MARA Holdings, which holds 44,893 BTC, and Riot Platforms, with 17,722 BTC. On the other hand, CleanSpark is followed by Florida-based miner Hut 8 Mining, which currently has 10,096 BTC. Miners Prioritize Holding Bitcoin To cover operational expenses, Bitcoin miners often sell portions of their mined Bitcoin. However, firms such as MARA Holdings prioritize retaining their BTC reserves. Its CEO, Fred Thiel, recently said that retail investors should consider buying Bitcoin and just let the crypto asset appreciate in value. It recently lent 7,377 BTC to third parties, which was worth around $730 million at the time of the deal, for small yields. CleanSpark, too, appears to have followed a similar strategy. In 2024, the firm mined 7,024 BTC but sold only 12.65 BTC in December, preserving most of its holdings. This sentiment is also depicted in a recent report which indicated that Bitcoin miners have significantly slowed their sales since April 2024. While a brief uptick in exchange flows occurred in November 2024 due to a post-election BTC price surge, miners have since reduced profit-taking. With current profitability, these miners have resorted to holding their Bitcoin over selling the stash.

It’s common to assume that if a project is good enough for a venture fund, it must be good enough for a user. After all, would something so big and rich fail to perform due diligence? Sadly, money does not always equal security and some users had to find that out the hard way. Despite having access to powerful mechanisms, ‘money people’ are not usually experts in Web 3.0 security. To put it simply, they won’t know where to look. So, even if a project might be safe from a rug pull or malicious actions from within the company (that they would likely check), it might fall victim to external attacks. And these attacks may affect not just the investor and the owner – but the user too. Vulnerabilities, especially those that end in financial tragedy, often lead to loss of financing. But that’s only a part of the bigger problem. They end up hurting the industry as a whole, convincing potential investors, developers and participants, that Web 3.0 isn’t safe and can collapse at any given moment. The sooner we detect and eliminate vulnerabilities, the more chances we have to prevent incidents. This helps save the reputation of the aforementioned venture funds. To get a better understanding, let’s take a look at five well-financed projects, find out what happened to bring them down and discuss why venture funds should pay special attention to security. WazirX WazirX is a major Indian exchange platform. Founded in 2018, the company ran an extremely successful ICO in 2019-2020. The project managed to gather an impressive $2.9 million in investments. Among three notable sources, the most noticeable was Kalaari Capital – a well-known tech-focused venture capital firm. This, of course, cemented the reputation of WazirX at a rather early stage. Unfortunately, in July 2024, the company lost $230 million in digital assets. The cause for the loss was a multi-signature wallet vulnerability, due to which the attackers managed to manipulate discrepancies in transaction data. A hacker group called Lazarus Group was the main suspect, but insider involvement was not out of the question. As a result of the attack, WazirX was sued by its rival company CoinSwitch for failing to recover $9.7 million of its funds. Radiant Capital DeFi protocol Radiant Capital managed to secure $12.3 million during its investment rounds. The project promised to build a unified money market with the possibility of depositing, buying and borrowing assets across different blockchains. It’s not entirely surprising that the concept attracted hackers. The first incident occurred in October 2024 and included a flash loan attack that had cost Radiant Capital $4.5 million. But the misfortunes didn’t end there, and the second attack came soon after, leaving the project short of another $53 million. The attackers exploited the 3-of-11 multisig scheme, using malware to present false transactions for signing. The attacker then deployed their own malicious contracts on four chains, executing only those on Binance Smart Chain and ARB. Playdapp The successful South Korean platform Playdapp aimed to revolutionize the gaming industry by utilizing blockchain. That promise was enough to secure the company $3.8 million during investment rounds in 2022. With the popularity of Web 3.0 gaming, Playdapp had all the makings of an incredibly successful project and up to February 2024, this was the plan. In the span of three days, Playdapp was hit by two consecutive attacks. A private key exploit turned out to be the cause of the attack. During the first incident, the attacker’s address was added as the minter of tokens, and over 200 million PLA tokens were minted. During the second attack, an additional 1.6 billion were minted, which resulted in a total loss of $290 million. Hedgey Finance The DeFi project Hedgey Finance was founded in 2021 as a token vesting platform. The company quickly rose to popularity among large and well-known funds. The list of investors includes names such as Hiddentao Ventures, WAGMI Ventures, Blockchange Ventures and Compound. Hedgey Finance successfully raised money from 13 different funds. Alas, the story didn’t have a happy ending. Hedgey Finance was attacked on April 19, 2024. The attacker made away with approximately $2 million in ETH and additional BONUS tokens on Arbitrum ( ARB ). The cause was a vulnerability in the smart contract that allowed any user to exploit a certain command to transfer tokens from the contract to their own wallet. The Munchables The Munchables is yet another successfully funded project. The Web 3.0 gaming platform is based on Ethereum layer-two Blast. The project was launched in response to the growing popularity of GameFi projects and quickly received funding from 20 large investors. In March 2024, The Munchables fell victim to the project’s poor security measures. The attack was a result of the compromised upgradable proxy contract. The contract was used during the game’s development, and the ownership belonged to the developer. Even after the contract was upgraded, the owner still had options to manipulate the contract. This resulted in the loss of $62.5 million in ETH. What can be done Looking at the issues that caused all of the losses listed above, it’s easy to notice a pattern. Sure, the projects may have been well-funded and promising, but crucial mistakes must have been made during the audit. Multisig issues are one of the most common causes of third-party attacks on exchanges. The only effective way to eliminate them is a thorough security audit. Unfortunately, not all projects take it as seriously as they should. Many put their trust in the hands of cheap yet unreliable security companies that promise quick results and end up losing money as well as credibility. Here are some ways to avoid such situations. Research your potential auditors. Familiarize yourselves with the reviews, testimonials and the fate of the company’s previous clients. Increase the depth of a security audit by ordering not one but several audits from different reputable companies. Stay in constant communication with your auditor and take their recommendations seriously. It’s better to be overprepared than unprotected. An audit has to be performed at an early stage of the project development. Vulnerabilities never stay hidden for long and any of them may lead to financial losses. Dmitry Mishunin, CEO of HashEx Blockchain Security , excels in cybersecurity, focusing on Web 3.0 and blockchain. With a background in physics, applied mathematics and IT management, he’s a seasoned tech entrepreneur skilled in strategic management and team coaching. Under his leadership, HashEx has conducted over 1,300 audits, securing $3.8 billion in funds.

Durham County, North Carolina is opening applications this month for DCo Thrives, a guaranteed income program targeting low-income families, reports The Herald Sun. One hundred and twenty-five families will be selected to receive $750 per month to use as they wish every month for one year. DCo Thrives will be administered by the nonprofit Durham Children’s Initiative. The program, which aims to find out whether the free extra cash can improve the well-being of children and their families, will also have a control group of 125 participants. The two groups will be required to complete surveys, the results of which researchers will study. While the surveys will be conducted online, participants may be invited for an interview with the researchers. “Both groups will be asked to fill out surveys and will be compensated $100 for their survey completion. Data from the DCo Thrives pilot program will be used to help understand the effectiveness of guaranteed income programs in Durham and beyond.” The guaranteed income program is open to adults who are parenting at least one child of under 18 years of age.

A recent analysis by ShayanBTC, a contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, has shed light on key factors impacting Ethereum’s performance. In a post titled “Ethereum Faces Crossroads: Funding Rates and $3K Support Key to Sustaining Bullish Momentum,” Shayan highlights the asset’s struggles to maintain its upward trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Downswing To $2,900 Could Be A ‘Buy-The-Dip Opportunity’ – Analyst Expects Bullish Surge Funding Rates And The Importance Of The $3K Support Level According to Shayan, Ethereum’s bullish momentum has been significantly challenged by fluctuations in Funding Rates, a key indicator of demand in the derivatives market. While these rates initially rose during the recent rally in the crypto market, signaling growing confidence, there was a subsequent decline after Ethereum was rejected at the $4,000 resistance level suggesting reduced trader interest and commitment. Notably, the spike in Funding Rates during the rally pointed to cautious optimism among traders. However, the sharp decline in these rates afterward highlights a waning demand for Ethereum in the derivatives market. This shift raises concerns about the sustainability of the bullish trend, particularly in light of Ethereum’s inability to breach the $4,000 resistance. The $3,000 support level has emerged as a pivotal threshold for Ethereum. Shayan emphasized that maintaining this level is crucial for stabilizing the market and potentially reigniting bullish momentum. A failure to hold above $3,000 could trigger increased selling pressure, leading to a deeper market correction. The analyst wrote: Overall, Ethereum’s outlook depends on reclaiming higher Funding Rates and defending $3K. These factors will determine whether the market resumes its uptrend or faces further corrections. Ethereum Market Performance Meanwhile, Ethereum has continued to demonstrate downward movements, especially as the broader market has recently turned bearish. Over the past week, Ethereum’s market value has dropped by 6.2% bringing its price below $3,500. However, over the past day, there has been a slight uptick in ETH’s price as the asset records a 0.9% increase. This slight increase has pushed ETH’s price to hover above $3,200 at the time of writing marking a 33.9% decrease away from its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in November 2021.

Particularly, ETH’s daily trading volume has moved from $20 billion last Friday to now sitting at above $26 billion as of today. Given the current trend in ETH, it is worth noting that this increase in trading volume may be a result of the surge in buying pressure and selling pressure ongoing in the Ethereum market.

Two rising stars are already making headlines with their innovative strides: Algorand’ s self-sufficient L1 network and the new Rollblock GambleFi protocol have emerged as the best crypto to buy now . These dynamic developments have caught the attention of Ethereum whale , who are eyeing these frontrunners for massive returns in 2025. So, sit tight as we unravel the mystery behind their glow. Rollblock’s iGaming solution attracts $8.5M investment. The best crypto to buy now ? Rollblock’s iGaming redefinition has become every punter’s favorite, and at this point, it’s logical to see why Ethereum whales are flocking in to have a piece of the cake. Over $8.5M has been raised to support a movement that finally prioritizes fun and user security in the $500B iGaming market. At its core, Rollblock is a revolutionary AI-backed crypto casino that leverages blockchain technology to deliver tamper-proof, transparent gambling. Coupled with a sleek, user-friendly interface, the platform quickly becomes a favorite for online gambling enthusiasts. Last month was a bang! Over $1.75M was wagered, and a 600% increase in deposits and signups was realized. The excitement doesn’t stop there. Rollblock’s innovative revenue-sharing model sets it apart as the best crypto to buy now . Now priced at $0.045 during stage 9 of its presale , $RBLK is poised for significant growth in 2025. Algorand ‘s glow up: Bullish technical stoke positive sentiment For a while, Algorand has been dazzling the crypto world with its innovative blockchain development crusade. Its decentralized, self-sustaining ecosystem has now gone beyond the usual secure, scalable, and efficient network to a thriving DeFi ecosystem that fosters blockchain growth. This distinctiveness has attracted institutional interest. Last month, the Algorand Foundation partnered with the UNDP to promote Web3 literacy, following its giant strides across Africa. Bullish technicals complemented the positive fundamentals. Despite market volatility, renewed institutional interest and demand from Ethereum whale s gave wings to the ALGO price on the price chart. Thanks to growing demand, ALGO ‘s price has broken out of a bearish descending trendline. Ethereum whale sell-off: ETH nearing another bottom as MoM crashes 9.2% It’s a rollercoaster ride for Ethereum . The DeFi king saw a massive exodus that wiped out most of its New Year gains. As of press time, Ethereum has fallen 9.2% MoM to a local low below $3,350. The culprits? Ethereum whale s and even the Ethereum Foundation, whose colossal sales have created significant downward pressure. Recent on-chain data shows Ethereum whale s are jumping the sinking ship in droves. In fact, two Ethereum whale s sold off over $250M worth of altcoins on Binance, and the wave of panic selling has shattered the critical $3,500 support level. This has pushed ETH towards the next support level at $2,800. Adding to the turmoil, the Ethereum Foundation is strategically offloading its holding. Conclusion Ethereum whale s are known for their impressive foresight. Algorand’ s massive potential in blockchain development didn’t go unnoticed, nor did Rollblock’s GambleFi revolution. While Algorand seals a new partnership, Rollblock has grown over 345%, thanks to its new iGaming solution, which positions it as the best crypto to buy now . Both assets present compelling opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on disruptive technologies and growing demand.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 05:39:00

Interestingly, the trader’s attention has shifted from BTC to its forks and as a result, the prices of BitcoinCash (BCH) & Bitcoin SV (BSV) have begun to rise consistently. While BSV price has surged over 15%, BCH price is trying to follow the trend with an over 3% jump. However, these rises suggest a significant ascending trend could materialise soon. Bitcoin SV (BSV) Price Analysis Bitcoin SV has been rising consistently after rebounding from the July 2024 lows close to $30 and after rebounding from the interim lows below $50, the rally has ignited a strong rebound. The rebound was backed by a massive influx of buying pressure as the volume surged 10 times, by over 800% from $50 million to $500 million in just a few hours. With this, BSV price has become the top performer, but will the rally fight the bearish heat? As seen in the above chart, the BSV price has been surging within a rising, expanding channel and has rebounded from its lower support since July 2024. With this, the token has positioned itself within the 50-day and 200-day MA, acting as strong resistance & support. On the other hand, the conversion & base lines of Ichimoku have undergone a bullish crossover, suggesting the start of a bullish trend. Additionally, the supertrend has turned bullish and the OBV has displayed a bullish divergence. Also, the volume has surged at frequent intervals, which suggests the traders are vigilant about the price action. Therefore, the Bitcoin SV price is expected to maintain a decent upswing and rise above immediate resistance at $68.46, which may revive hopes of entering the zone between $71.16 and $72.89. This could revive a rise toward the upper resistance of the channel above $95, gaining a 3-digit figure. BitcoinCash (BCH) Price Analysis BitcoinCash has entered the top 20 crypto assets after the recent rise in its value and volume, which increased by 50%. Despite this, the value of the crypto remains below the levels it started the 2025 trade, indicating there is more room for the token to swell. Therefore, BCH’s price is more likely to double top this cycle at around $1200 if this trade plays out well. The BCH price is stuck within a narrow range, with the levels trading within an upper and lower level. As a result, the Bollinger bands have squeezed and may continue to maintain a parallel consolidation. This suggests the bulls and bears remain vigilant and exert the required pressure at the right time. Secondly, the RSI seems to be following a trend since before of maintaining a consolidated trend along the rising trend line to reach the upper threshold. Currently, the levels have rebounded from the lower threshold and are expected to possess a similar trend. Therefore, the BitcoinCash (BCH) price is believed to attract some liquidity, which may help the rally to remain elevated. However, following a horizontal consolidation, the BCH price could eventually trigger a healthy rise towards interim highs at $600.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BCH|BTC|TRADING|BSV,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-11 06:08:17
