On top BlockDAG (BDAG) is surging in presale, with a collection surpassing $178.5 million, shines, especially with its LAUNCH300 offer that promises simplified portfolio expansion appealing to many. Ethereum’s potential rise to $12,000 by 2025 is propelled by its Pectra upgrade and expected regulatory clarity, reinforcing its role as a stalwart in decentralized finance. On the other hand, XRP’s trading boost to $3.8 billion indicates increasing momentum and strategic ecosystem alliances. BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 Streamlines Growth for Crypto Buyers BlockDAG’s crypto presale has been an extraordinary voyage, amassing over $178.5 million and securing the backing of over 170,000 holders. Indeed, it’s the enthusiasm and trust from an expanding community that has pushed the BDAG coin from $0.001 to $0.0248, signaling strong faith in its future. Furthermore, to enhance the experience, BlockDAG has rolled out the LAUNCH300 promotion. It’s straightforward and effective—use the code LAUNCH300 during your acquisition, and your BDAG holdings instantly triple. For example, acquiring 1,000 BDAG results in receiving 3,000 BDAG, making portfolio growth straightforward and accessible to all, whether experienced or new. Additionally, the LAUNCH300 initiative acts as a bond between BlockDAG and its community, a symbol of mutual commitment. Coupled with the presale’s achievements, it’s evident that BlockDAG is nurturing more than a blockchain—it’s cultivating a supportive, confident community. Ethereum Eyes $12K with Pectra Upgrade on the Horizon Ethereum’s value might hit $12,000 by 2025, influenced by crucial technological and governmental factors. The anticipated Pectra upgrade, scheduled for early 2025, is designed to boost Ethereum’s efficiency and minimize transaction delays, potentially bolstering its prominence in decentralized finance and smart contracts. Furthermore, political shifts, including the expected pro-crypto stance of President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, might provide clearer regulations, boosting Ethereum’s appeal. The options market is also showing signs of confidence, with a preference for call options suggesting anticipated price increases. Additionally, the percentage of long-term Ethereum holders has grown from 59% to 75% over the past year, indicating increased confidence in Ethereum’s prospects. Nonetheless, Ethereum faces challenges if Ether-based ETFs falter, as newer blockchains like Solana could present strong competition due to their speed and lower costs. These elements together forecast a positive path for Ethereum. XRP Rallies with $3.8 Billion in Trades as Market Eyes Upswing XRP’s trade volumes have surged to $3.8 billion, reflecting a significant uptick in market interest. Currently priced at $0.55, XRP has maintained stability despite general market volatility. Market analysts highlight its Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63, signaling strong momentum without being overextended, thus drawing attention from traders eyeing upcoming price shifts. Key resistance is noted at $0.60, a breach of which could significantly lift XRP’s value, while a support level at $0.50 offers a robust buffer against downward trends. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bullish trend, supported by increasing trading volumes. Additionally, XRP benefits from Ripple’s strategic partnerships and strengthening network, making it a focal point in the crypto trading arena, engaging both institutional and casual traders. Last Say The successful presale of BDAG, along with the LAUNCH300 campaign, highlights its commitment to providing value to its community. Ethereum’s anticipated Pectra upgrade and its future market influence underscore its continued impact on decentralized finance. Meanwhile, XRP’s trading activity and network growth underscore the varied opportunities available in the market.

This indicates that U.S. mining operations are becoming more important. The report also mentioned that mining profits increased in December. Bitcoin Mining Profits Increased in December This rise was mainly due to a 15% jump in Bitcoin prices, which grew faster than the network’s hashrate, which went up 6.5% during the same time. This rise in Bitcoin price helps miners, making their operations more profitable. However, the difficulty of mining is also rising, as shown by the growing network hashrate. Miners who work efficiently and have access to cheap energy will benefit the most from the higher Bitcoin prices. Meanwhile, Jefferies has lowered its price target for Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), a leading U.S. Bitcoin miner, from $24 to $20. The bank keeps a “hold” rating on MARA shares, advising caution because of increasing network difficulty and the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency prices. Shifting Focus: Bitcoin Miners Diversify to Stay Ahead The competition for resources has grown more intense, with Bitcoin miners now competing with AI developers to access power grids. AI technology needs a lot of computational power. As such, many companies are leasing their data centers to AI firms to cut costs. Companies like Hut 8 and Hive Digitals are exploring this option to ease their financial pressures. Meanwhile, others like Marathon are expanding internationally, moving to countries like Kenya and Paraguay. This is because these regions have surplus, affordable, and sustainable energy. Additionally, many companies are turning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to reduce high expenses. These sources offer stable pricing and lower reliance on the fluctuating power grid, helping to offset high mining costs. Bitcoin Records Largest Drop in Mining Difficulty As reported in May, Bitcoin mining difficulty fell by 5.7%, marking the highest negative adjustment since December 2022, when it fell by 7%. Notably, this negative difficulty adjustment is correlated with a 10% decline in Bitcoin’s hash rate since the previous adjustment on April 24. This is evidenced by a drop from a seven-day moving average of 639.58 EH/s to 578.74 EH/s. However, the average block times increased to 10 minutes and 36 seconds before the adjustment. The dip in hash rate resulted in Bitcoin’s hash price plunging to an all-time low of $50 per PH/s per day ($0.05 per TH/s per day) on April 29. Simultaneously, the BTC’s price retraced below the $63,000 level.

According to the country’s Ministry of National Treasury and Economic Planning, the draft regulations were developed through a multi-agency task force. The Kenyan Ministry of National Treasury and Economic Planning published a request for public comments on two draft legislations related to crypto. The Ministry also rolled out the Virtual Assets Service Providers bill, which is set to be tabled before parliament. Kenyan government invites the public to make comments on draft crypto regulations The Ministry of National Treasury and Economic Planning set January 2025 as the deadline for public participation in the two legislations. The first legislation is the draft policy on virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, and the second is the Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill 2024. According to the ministry, the two legislations were formulated by a multi-agency task force within the country. The ministry added that the bill and policy would be accessible to the public on its official website. The government agency highlighted that public participation was in accordance with the Statutory Instruments Act 2013. The act provides that citizens should air their views on any intended laws and regulations within the country. The ministry added it would also conduct public participation forums nationwide and outlined the schedule in the announcement. John Mbadi, Kenya’s cabinet secretary for the National Treasury and Economic Planning Ministry, appreciated the need for financial inclusion through technological advancements within the county. He also recognised the rise in virtual assets in the global space presented opportunities for innovation in the local financial system. Mbadi also acknowledged the rise of virtual assets presented challenges such as terrorism financing, money laundering, fraud and cybercrime. The cabinet secretary noted that these challenges underscored the urgent need for a legal and regulatory framework to govern virtual assets. He emphasized that the Kenyan government was committed to leveraging opportunities presented by Virtual assets and Virtual asset service providers. Mbadi added the policy was intended to create a fair market for virtual assets within the country. In the policy, the cabinet secretary commented, “The policy takes account of regulatory approaches from various jurisdictions and provides a framework that is adaptive and flexible for domestic and international cooperation, compliance, consumer protection, financial innovation and management of risks.” The ministry outlined the intended act’s objectives as providing a legislative framework to regulate virtual asset service providers and address risks associated with misusing virtual asset products and service provider services. The bill’s objectives also included establishing virtual asset service providers and issuers of initial virtual asset offerings in Kenya, licensing virtual asset service providers, and approving the issuance of initial virtual asset offerings. The ministry also specified that the agencies that would enforce the act would include the Capital Markets Authority and the Central Bank of Kenya. It stated that agencies should ensure financial stability and market integrity within the country. Kenyan government shifts position despite warnings from the Central Bank In 2015, the Central Bank of Kenya issued a press statement cautioning the public on virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. The central bank raised concerns over the public’s trading of cryptocurrencies despite being unregulated under national laws. The CBK informed the public that cryptocurrencies were not legal tender and that consumers would have no recourse if the virtual currencies failed. It raised some risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including the fact that the assets were untraceable and highly volatile. Despite the global regulatory shifts, the Central Bank of Kenya has reportedly maintained its position on cryptocurrencies over the years. The capital markets authority warned the public against crypto-related transactions; however, the agency later softened its stance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) advised Kenya to implement a regulatory framework to help address the risks presented by virtual assets. In its report, the IMF stated that crypto exchanges could not obtain licenses within the country, exposing consumers to potential fraud and financial losses.

Amid the turmoil, the protocol's USD0++ token, which represents a locked-up – or staked – version of its $1-anchored stablecoin USD0, fell briefly below 90 cents from $1 on decentralized marketplace Curve. The protocol's governance token, USUAL, plummeted as much as 17% through the day before recovering some of the losses. The selloff was caused by a change in the redemption mechanism of USD0++ token introduced by the team on Thursday that caught investors and liquidity providers off-guard. By design, USD0 is backed by short-term government securities to keep its price at $1. Stakers on Usual receive USD0++ that comes with a four-year lock-up period, meaning that investors are locking up their funds without being able to redeem in exchange for rewards earned in the form of the protocol's USD0 and USUAL tokens. Yield farmers rushed in, catapulting the protocols total value locked (TVL), a key DeFi metric, to $1.87 billion earlier this week from less than $300 million in October. However, the new feature called ""dual-path exit"" will allow investors to redeem the locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price, or at par, by giving up a part of the rewards earned, calling the 1:1 exchange rate into question. The abrupt implementation drew criticism across DeFi users for changing the design without warning. In certain liquidity pools , the token's price was hardcoded to worth $1, causing havoc among borrowers and liquidity providers. ""Did they just allow degens to jump in at 1:1 and then rug the USD0++?,"" prominent DeFi analyst Ignas said in an X post . ""They pushed for the largest USD0/USD0++ pool on Curve knowing all well that USD0++ shouldn't trade at 1:1."" ""DeFi continues learning the most important truth about pegs: a peg is a story about why two things that are not the same are interchangeable for each other,"" noted Patrick McKenzie, advisor to payments firm Stripe. The Usual team said in a statement that the design change with the early unstaking mechanism was communicated in advance from October. The protocol will also activate the revenue switch starting on Monday and start distributing the protocol's earnings to governance token holders who stake their coin for longer-term (USUALx). ""The current situation regarding USD0++ stems from a misunderstanding of the protocol’s mechanisms along with a communication that should have been better articulated,"" the statement reads. ""We apologize and we’ll continue to do our best to communicate transparent information to users."" The episode is another lesson for crypto investors about the potential risks of DeFi products that entice users with high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels. ""Users who are taking risk need to know what the exact rules are and be able to trust that they won't change, otherwise it can result in market panic,"" Rob Hadick, general partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly, told CoinDesk. ""We should be thankful this happened now, before the protocol became a risk to the broader DeFi ecosystem."" Still, USD0++ traded recently at 0.91 USD0 in the Curve pool, while the protocol's total value locked , a key DeFi metric, dropped below $1.6 billion.",Markets|DeFi|Stablecoin|Yield,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-10 22:26:55

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS.

Here Is the Pertinent Level To Watch,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-30-decline-discount/,"Recent price action has seen Dogecoin stuck in a correction path for over a month now, and the meme now finds itself trading just above the $0.3 mark. Particularly, Dogecoin has retraced by about 30% since it reached a recent multi-year peak of $0.48 in early December, and bullish traders are now patiently waiting for the next leg up. According to technical analysis, Dogecoin’s recent confluence at the $0.3 price level presents an attractive opportunity to load up more of the cryptocurrency before an upward bounce from here. Dogecoin’s $0.3 Support Zone Holds Key Significance The $0.3 price level has emerged as a critical support zone for the meme coin moving forward, with multiple analyses referencing this price point. According to a technical analysis of Dogecoin’s daily candlestick price action on the TradingView platform, this level aligns with historical support zones that have previously served as reliable demand areas during market downturns. The technical appeal of this zone is more notable due to its correlation with broader market sentiment, as the Bitcoin price is currently hovering near its own significant support level. Related Reading: What To Expect After The Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 With this in mind, Dogecoin’s retracement to $0.3 could not only serve as a potential bottom for the current correction but also as a launching pad for the next bullish wave, provided Bitcoin and other market conditions align favorably. Furthermore, it provides traders the opportunity to load up more Dogecoin tokens at a 30% discount and position themselves for maximum gains before the wider crypto market recovers and resumes its upward momentum. Is A Broader Market Recovery On The Horizon? As one of the largest cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is easily influenced by market dynamics, including things like news updates and Bitcoin’s price action. Particularly, Dogecoin’s upward momentum in the last quarter of 2024 had no reason to be derailed if not for Bitcoin’s failure to hold above the psychological $100,000 price level. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Unsurprisingly, on-chain data shows some Dogecoin whale addresses might already be capitalizing on this discount in anticipation of this market-wide recovery. Whale transactions involving Dogecoin recently surged by over 400%. Furthermore, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows that Dogecoin’s large transaction volume recently rose to over $60.9 billion in a 24-hour timeframe. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3328 and is down by about 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The $0.3 price level remains a pertinent range to keep an eye on, as a successful defense of this level paired with strengthening BTC prices could lay the groundwork for a renewed Dogecoin rally. A prudent approach would be to set stop losses below this level in case of a deeper correction, which could invalidate short-term bullish momentum.

Priced at just $0.0420 during its presale, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a rare opportunity to invest in an AI-powered platform poised to redefine digital asset management. Analysts forecast that this token could skyrocket to $1.2, positioning it as a game-changer in the crypto space.

With cutting-edge AI innovations and a robust ecosystem, WallitIQ (WLTQ) promises not only substantial returns but also practical applications that appeal to both novice and experienced investors. As the market braces for an XRP price rally, it’s clear that WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale is the real jackpot waiting to be claimed. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Next Big Thing In Crypto Innovation As XRP price predictions captivate the market, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is carving out its own path to success with groundbreaking features that make it a standout token. Analysts project a staggering 30,000% growth for WLTQ, taking it from $0.0420 to $1.2 after its launch. This impressive surge potential is rooted in WallitIQ’s AI-powered platform, which delivers unparalleled functionality in digital asset management.

Currently priced around $2.450 according to CoinMarketCap, XRP’s goal of hitting $5 represents a significant 10x growth. However, while the XRP price offers stability and a promising future, its growth potential pales in comparison to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) anticipated 30,000% rally.

With AVAX experiencing swings and DOT showing steady potential, enthusiasts are keeping an eye on these significant projects. Avalanche is boosting scalability with its exciting Avalanche9000 upgrade, while Polkadot is expanding its influence in decentralized apps. In this scenario, BlockDAG stands out with its $1M Raffle, a clever way to spread BDAG coins and boost adoption. The raffle not only offers a hefty 200% coin bonus, reflecting the success of the presale, but it also sets up participants for immediate rewards and future ecosystem growth. With the mainnet launch approaching, BlockDAG (BDAG) promises not just prizes but a gateway to what’s coming. BlockDAG’s $1M Raffle: Pave Your Path to Massive Wealth BlockDAG’s $1M Raffle is more than a chance to win big—it’s a strategic initiative to increase adoption and enhance its network. Offering big prizes along with a 200% BDAG coin bonus, the raffle offers immediate benefits and motivates long-term involvement in its expanding network. This approach keeps the momentum going even when the crypto market is down, showing the project’s forward-thinking strategy. The raffle features three ticket levels, catering to various budgets. The Bronze Ticket requires a $250 BDAG buy-in for a chance at a $250,000 USDT prize, the Silver Ticket at $500 offers a shot at $500,000 USDT, and the Gold Ticket at $1000 gives participants the best chance to win the $1M USDT grand prize, positioning the raffle as an appealing option for both newcomers and long-term backers. Following a successful presale that garnered over $178.5 million and sold more than 17.8 billion BDAG coins at $0.0248 each, early participants have enjoyed a substantial 2,380% ROI. These achievements underscore the community’s confidence in the project, despite the wider fluctuations in the crypto market. With the upcoming mainnet launch, the raffle is not just an isolated event but a part of BlockDAG’s broader vision to distribute coins widely, reward its community, and establish a foundation for a decentralized future. 2025 AVAX Price Movements: Riding the Waves of Change Avalanche (AVAX) continues to capture headlines as its price movements suggest both challenges and opportunities for 2025. Currently valued at around $36.68, the coin has recently seen a 5.95% decrease due to overall market shifts. However, its prospects are bolstered by the Avalanche9000 upgrade, aimed at boosting scalability and reducing costs, ensuring its vital role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and more. Last year, AVAX reached a peak of $65.39 but fell to $17.29 in August, displaying its unpredictable nature. Analysts foresee a possible recovery, with price expectations possibly reaching up to $81 by the end of 2025, contingent on market trends and its ecosystem’s development. Avalanche’s continuous technological progress and growing use make it a focal point in this year’s crypto watchlist. Prospects for DOT: Poised for Consistent Expansion Polkadot (DOT) stands out as a formidable force for 2025, with forecasts indicating a possibility for consistent expansion. Trading at $6.65, Polkadot is enhancing its infrastructure, promoting interoperability, and facilitating decentralized applications. The network’s unique parachain auctions and increased utilization reinforce its status as a prime blockchain resource for developers and various initiatives. Despite the ups and downs of 2024, where DOT fluctuated between $10.50 and $4.30, the outlook remains guardedly positive. Estimates for DOT’s 2025 performance suggest an average price of $12.50, potentially soaring to $40, driven by heightened activity within its ecosystem and strategic alliances. As Polkadot’s presence in DeFi’s Total Value Locked (TVL) escalates, it continues to be recognized as a dependable, enduring blockchain choice amidst the crypto evolution. The Decisive Trends of 2025 As we step further into 2025, both Avalanche and Polkadot are making significant strides. AVAX’s price dynamics reveal both instability and promise, with its technological enhancements capturing market interest. On the other hand, DOT’s expected growth is supported by its broadening ecosystem and rising acceptance in DeFi sectors. Amidst these trends, BlockDAG introduces an appealing prospect with its $1M Raffle, merging immediate incentives with prospects for prolonged development. The 200% coin bonus echoes the triumph of its initial crypto presale , emphasizing its dedication to community enhancement. For those in search of ventures that offer immediate advantages while promising future opportunities, BlockDAG’s raffle stands out as a pivotal initiative this year.

Chainlink Rallies & INJ Gets New Upgrade,https://thecoinrise.com/150m-web3bay-tokens-sold-why-is-this-e-commerce-crypto-going-viral-chainlink-rallies-inj-gets-new-upgrade/,"The progress in the web3 space is undeniable, with various projects driving significant growth and developments. The Chainlink rally has captured attention with a remarkable 18% price surge in three days, fueled by heightened whale activity. Meanwhile, Injective’s 3.0 upgrade has entered its first phase, marking the beginning of its deflationary journey and setting the stage for future growth. Among these exciting trends, Web3Bay (3BAY) , a leading decentralized e-commerce platform, has smashed several presale milestones. The platform has raised over $560,000, with more than 150 million 3BAY tokens sold, further showcasing the potential of web3 technology to revolutionize e-commerce. With such notable movements across the sector, it’s clear that the momentum for innovative blockchain solutions is stronger than ever. Surge In Whale Activity Boosts Chainlink Rally Chainlink (LINK) has been gaining attention for an impressive 18% price surge in just three days. This Chainlink rally was ignited after the token retested a critical support level near $19, drawing significant attention from crypto whales. Over 1.40 million LINK tokens were purchased within a span of four days. On-chain metrics further support this Chainlink rally, with a consistent decrease in exchange outflows, signaling that fewer investors are preparing to sell their holdings. Analysts speculate that whales are strategically positioning themselves for potential gains as the “altcoin season” approaches. New Injective Upgrade Strengthens Its Deflationary Mechanisms The latest Injective upgrade, Injective 3.0, has introduced a disruptive deflationary model, making the network more adaptable and inflation-resistant. By adjusting the token supply based on staking activity, this upgrade enhances efficiency and aims to boost the deflation rate by an impressive 400%. Currently, 56% of Injective’s token supply is staked, offering a competitive yield of 10.68%. This figure outpaces other major networks like Ethereum and Solana, signaling growing confidence in Injective’s long-term potential. Despite its progress, Injective struggles to attract significant developer activity, especially when compared to networks like Sui, Aptos, and Coinbase’s Base. 3BAY’s $550K Success Story: An E-Commerce Gamechanger Web3Bay (3BAY), a rising e-commerce platform powered by web3 technology, is setting a new standard in digital commerce by utilizing blockchain to create a secure, transparent, and community-driven platform. Built to enable seamless transactions and ensure user data remains fully protected, Web3Bay’s decentralized approach removes the limitations of centralized e-commerce platforms. At the heart of the ecosystem is the 3BAY token, which facilitates transactions, incentivizes participation, and empowers the community with decision-making capabilities. The numbers behind Web3Bay’s presale underline its growing potential and market appeal. To date, the platform has raised over $560,000, with more than 150 million tokens sold. This milestone demonstrates the confidence investors and users alike have placed in Web3Bay’s vision. The current 3BAY token price of $0.0039675 in presale stage 3 offers an attractive opportunity to invest in the future of e-commerce. Web3Bay’s strong presale performance not only reflects trust in the platform but also highlights the demand for solutions that decentralization brings to the digital marketplace. With limited tokens available at presale pricing, the opportunity to join Web3Bay during this stage shouldn’t be overlooked. The growing interest in the 3BAY token suggests that it is positioned for significant growth, potentially reaching $0.1959 at launch. For anyone buying 3BAY tokens at the current price, this translates to a potential 6,430% ROI! Unlocking The Next Chapter In Web3 Technology The Chainlink rally and the latest Injective upgrade demonstrate the growing potential of blockchain technology to redefine digital ecosystems. Chainlink’s recent surge driven by whale activity highlights its appeal to strategic investors. Similarly, Injective’s deflation-focused advancements highlight its commitment to sustainable growth. However, Web3Bay emerges as a standout platform, embodying the core principles of web3 technology through its decentralized marketplace. With over 150 million tokens sold and $560,000 raised during its presale, Web3Bay showcases its ability to attract strong market interest and build a loyal community. The current presale stage 3 price of $0.0039675 per token offers an exceptional opportunity to secure a position in this growing ecosystem before the presale closes and the 3BAY token realizes its full value.

According to a new report by The Financial Times, the CFPB – which aims to protect consumers from unfair financial practices by institutions – is proposing a new rule that would mandate crypto firms refund money stolen from customers via exploits or hacks. The report says that by proposing this new rule, the CFPB is extending the same protections traditional bank accounts have to the crypto wallets of crypto users. If the rule is accepted, it would change the definition of “funds” to include any asset used to make payments and would force crypto wallet providers to compensate users if their funds are stolen. Previously, data from market intelligence platform Chainalysis found that in 2024, crypto platforms lost a staggering $2.2 billion from hacks in 2024, a 20% increase from the previous year. Chainalysis also found that exploits significantly slowed down in the second half of 2024. However, the firm also found that in 2024, North Korean hackers stole more digital assets than ever before. According to the data, North Korean hackers stole $1.34 billion worth of crypto assets in 2024 while in 2023, they stole $660 million.

According to data insight from Santiment, the number of HODLers for these altcoins has fluctuated thus far this new year. The crypto analytics platform hinted at the implication of the HODLer count within each protocol’s ecosystem. The Ethereum and XRP Standout Santiment profiled six digital currencies, including the aforementioned Bitcoin and Chainlink. While Chainlink underperformed with 3,300 drops in hodler wallets, Ethereum and XRP stood out. The shared data showed that Ethereum had recorded a 645,000 uptick in its hodler wallets. This figure underscores its dominance as the top altcoin among retail investors. XRP followed closely with a total hodler wallet recording a 58,000 count since the start of the year. Ranking as the only meme cryptocurrency profiled by Santiment, Dogecoin has seen a 29,000 jump in investors holding it for the long term. Cardano scored the lowest figure, with just 2,800 wallets committing to long-term growth. As 2025 has kicked off with roller coastering prices for crypto’s top assets, the amount of hodlers have fluctuated wildly since the new year: Bitcoin $BTC : +102K Wallets Ethereum $ETH : +645K Wallets XRP Ledger $XRP : +58K Wallets Cardano $ADA : +2.8K Wallets… pic.twitter.com/W07x43GgW4 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 10, 2025 It is worth noting that the term ‘HODLer’ denotes token holders with plans to hold their assets in the long term. As the data provider hinted, when the hodler count grows, investors or the community will be comfortable with the project. This can aid ecosystem stability and long-term token growth. The opposite is true when the hodler count drops as investors focus on Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). Ecosystem Projects and Dogecoin Advantage Despite the ongoing bull cycle, fluctuations have shown how volatile and uncertain the market is. As reported earlier by Coingape, ETH price lost 9% of its value in under 24 hours, a trend visible in other altcoins. Amid this uncertainty, investors focus on developer activity, and other utilities focus beyond price. While Ethereum developers are working on the Pectra Upgrade, Ripple Labs launched RLUSD stablecoin to boost XRP liquidity. Input Output Global developers are also working on perfecting the Cardano community governance. In all, Dogecoin might take more of the spotlight in the altcoin market in the long term. This is based on the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), which might fuel DOGE popularity. These ecosystem trends might explain why more users are betting on the altcoin’s long-term prospects. ETH and DOGE Predictions for 2025 Amid the fluctuations of the past few weeks, experts believe the altcoin season is still ahead. Galaxy Research said the DOGE price will top $1 this year in its projections. The Mike Novogratz-associated firm tied this forecast to the D.O.G.E ties around the coin. Top experts also believe this year holds something big for Ethereum. Bitwise predicted that Ethereum would hit a new all-time high this year, and the asset manager said it is possible for Ethereum to reach $7,000 by the end of the year.

According to the report, countries such as India, Vietnam, and Indonesia made it to the top ten countries with the largest crypto-savvy population worldwide. Foresight Ventures, a crypto-focused venture capital firm and Primitive Ventures, a frontier prop investment firm, recently unveiled their “GTM in Asia” report. The report showed that the Asian region was the epicentre of global crypto activities, accounting for 60% of the world’s crypto population. The tally reveals that the Asian continent contributes the largest share of global liquidity in the crypto arena. The 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index shows Asia leads in crypto adoption The Chainalysis 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index revealed that Asia continues to dominate the global cryptocurrency landscape, with nine of the top 20 nations. According to the 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index report, five out of the top ten countries are Asian countries, including India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The report highlights the growing trend in crypto adoption among Asian countries, which is primarily driven by centralized exchanges and price-sensitive communities. Crypto is Booming in China! Asia Leads Adoption with 60% of Global Users pic.twitter.com/pHnosfuEJF — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) January 10, 2025 Indonesia emerged as the region’s stronghold, ranking third globally in crypto adoption. Between July 2023 and June 2024, the country received $157.1 billion in digital assets value, leading Southeast Asia. The Global Crypto Adoption Index report also revealed that centralized exchanges such as Upbit and Binance dominate the Asian market by facilitating crypto trading and investing activities—the exchanges operating in the region account for 37.1% of global traffic. The report also revealed that Asia–Pacific (APAC) region has a unique socio-economic diversity that fuels dominant speculative behaviors, including airdrop farming and meme-based speculation. This diversity allows Asian users to underscore on-chain opportunities for tailored crypto products. The report also emphasized that Asia’s internal trade and capital flows illuminate its global connectivity. According to the study, the region’s interconnectedness unlocks 57% of intra-regional trade and 55% of FDI inflows. The Chinese market remains active despite harsh regulatory scrutiny The study revealed that despite tough regulatory scrutiny, Chinese citizens have been active in the crypto industry. The report noted that the Chinese market thrives in OTC markets and DeFi platforms, with Hong Kong serving as the pivotal gateway for resilient Chinese crypto enthusiasts. Unlike China, Singapore has a conducive regulatory environment for crypto investors and is widely renowned as a global hub for innovation. The country has a high crypto ownership rate of 24.4%, and its progressive regulatory framework has attracted major crypto platforms such as Gemini, OKX, and Upbit, which were licensed by the Singaporean regulator. The report termed Vietnam a rising star in GameFi and blockchain education. The Vietnam Blockchain Association controls the digital asset education process alongside successful projects such as Axie Infinity. The Philippines is a leader in blockchain remittances and capitalizes on its English-speaking diaspora and strong gaming community. On the other hand, the report highlighted the South Korean market as a highly liquid market primarily controlled by retail investors. South Korea boasts native crypto platforms such as crypto exchange Upbit that are strongly integrated into the Kakao ecosystem. Wealthy individuals in the region are increasingly exploring the digital asset ecosystem. In a report, Aspen Digital revealed that 94% of wealthy investors in the region are already investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The global crypto adoption index measures how nations are interacting with crypto assets. The index considers user count, trading volume, and the growth of crypto businesses. A major driver of increased crypto adoption in developed nations was launching spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. The funds sparked a wave of Bitcoin activity, particularly in North America and Western Europe. On the other hand, lower-middle-income countries such as Nigeria turned to crypto as an alternative to their national currencies, which were often weakened by inflation or economic instability.

With less than two weeks before he steps down, the man who’s been the face of the Biden administration’s anti-crypto agenda has opened up about the toll it’s taken on him, and let’s just say, it hasn’t been a walk in the park for Gary. He admitted that the barrage of crypto-related cases during his time at the SEC left him “traumatized.” Oh, and about Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E? He thinks it’s pointless. Speaking from his Washington, D.C. office, Gary was quick to attack the crypto industry, as per usual. According to him, it is a mess — sentiment-driven, unstable, and riddled with scams. “These 10,000 to 15,000 projects—many of them will not survive,” he said, comparing the crypto space to high-stakes venture capital, except with more pump-and-dump schemes and fraud. For Gary, it was less about innovation and more about survival: of the markets, the investors, and maybe even himself. Crypto chaos and Gary’s Wild West show When Gary walked into the SEC in April 2021, Wall Street was still reeling from the GameStop short squeeze. But crypto quickly took center stage. In his first few months on the job, he was already fielding questions about how he’d deal with an industry that seemed allergic to rules. “I came in, and my predecessor, Jay Clayton, had brought 80 enforcement actions in this area. We’ve brought in about 100 in our four years,” Gary said. “It was consistent. I’ve been around finance for over four decades. And everything in the markets trade on a mixture of fundamentals and sentiment at any given time. But I’ve never seen a field that’s so much wrapped up in sentiment and not so much about fundamentals.” That might be a little bit true, but the work clearly left its mark. From the collapse of FTX and the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried to the collapse of Terra and the downfall of Hyung Do Kwon, Gary’s SEC went after crypto with the kind of vigor you’d expect from a guy who famously describes the industry as “the Wild West.” And yet, the sentiment he’s leaving with is exhaustion. Gary’s own background made his stance even more controversial. Before his time at the SEC, he taught blockchain and digital assets at MIT, leading many in the industry to believe he’d be their ally. “When you’re in academia or not in this job, you can study something and observe it. But when you’re in this job… you do what you can to protect the investing public,” he explained. In other words, teaching blockchain and regulating it are two very different ballgames. TikTok celebrations and Trump’s promise to fire him If you thought Gary was unpopular in crypto circles, wait until you hear how TikTok reacted to his resignation. The announcement started a wave of celebration on the platform, with users calling him a “demon” and celebrating the end of what they saw as his reign of terror. “This demon has been torturing companies for like three to four years,” one user said. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump made firing Gary a key part of his campaign, promising to remove him on day one of his administration. But Trump won’t get the chance. Gary announced he’d be stepping down on Inauguration Day at noon, effectively sparing himself from what would’ve likely been a high-profile dismissal. Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E: Gary isn’t buying it One of the most surprising moments in Gary’s interview was his blunt take on Trump and Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E initiative, the department that was started to cut out government spending linked to spiraling national debt. They want to remove at least $2 trillion per year, which is an insane amount of money that could break an economy. And even Elon himself has admitted that it’s impossible to achieve. When asked how the SEC would handle a staff cut, Gary said: “I think it would be unfortunate because we’re already spread too thin. We get 40 or 50,000 tips, complaints and referrals a year. It’s unnecessary.” He added that crypto accounts for roughly 18% of those cases. “At any given time, we only have the staff to maybe investigate some small portion,” he said, adding that the workload forces the SEC to triage constantly. Beyond crypto, Gary also warned about the potential risks of AI in financial markets. From robo-advisors to opaque algorithms, he argued that the rapid growth of AI could lead to conflicts of interest that harm everyday investors. He asked: “Your robo-advisor, are they giving you advice on behalf of the asset manager or you? And who are they putting first?” As he prepares to leave, Gary has already met with his presumptive successor, Paul Atkins. The two had a private conversation, but Gary shared a piece of advice he’d received from former SEC Chair Richard Breeden: “Every single day in the job is one day closer to when you will join the formers club.” Gary took that to mean he should use each day wisely—a sentiment he tried to pass on to Atkins. “It’s really about our capital markets that are 40% to 45% of the world’s capital markets,” Gary said. “You gotta keep it good disclosure, free of fraud manipulation, and really have, as best you can, competitive all-to-all trading.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",Regulation|SEC|United States,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-10 23:15:51

Some of them include Rep.Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.) and Rep.Mike Collins (R-Ga.), who have invested in cryptocurrency. Recently, Rep. Reschenthaler disclosed that he holds some cryptocurrencies, such as Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Bitcoin (BTC). His assets are worth between $1,000 and $15,000 in total. This is in line with the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which prohibits members of the United States Congress from buying and selling stocks and other cryptocurrencies. Rep. Mike Collins and others join the trend Rep. Mike Collins from Georgia revealed earlier this year that he bought Ski Mask Dog (SKI), a relatively unknown cryptocurrency. He revealed that he had invested between $1,001 and $15,000 in Ski Mask Dog (SKI). The disclosure report shows that Rep. Collins bought Ski Mask Dog three times in succession on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of December 2024. Each purchase was made in the $1,001-$15,000 range, which corresponds to the period of increasing prices of many cryptocurrencies. In the past, he revealed purchasing Ether (ETH), Velodrome (VELO), Aerodrome Finance (AERO), and The Graph (GRT). Source: US House of Representatives Others include Rep. Barry Moore (R-Al) and Rep. Jeffrey Jackson (D-NC) who also revealed high-value cryptos transactions. With interest in cryptocurrencies on the rise, the U.S. Senate is stepping in to regulate digital assets. Sen.Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) will head a new committee on digital assets. Lummis is a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency and has submitted a bill that mandates the US Treasury to buy 1 million Bitcoins in five years. Lummis has also revealed her own Bitcoin transactions, with the first one made in 2013. Donald Trump’s rising crypto portfolio Apart from Congress, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has also come under the radar regarding his crypto investments. Recent report shows that he has accumulated more than $11 million worth of crypto assets, mostly due to the Trump-based memecoin. Trump’s assets include various cryptocurrencies, including Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), USD Coin (USDC) and several memecoins. However, he has no investment in BTC, though he once expressed the desire to use it to pay off the national debt.

Ki Young Ju, market analyst and CEO of CryptoQuant, compared altcoin market performance to Bitcoin (BTC), which has doubled in value since 2021. “Only a few altcoin projects with strong use cases and narratives will survive,” Ju noted. According to Total3 — a metric representing the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) — altcoins currently hold a market cap of approximately $943 billion. The altcoin market briefly touched an all-time high of $1.1 trillion during a rally from November to December 2024, but quickly retraced to current levels. Changing Dynamics of Altcoin Seasons Ju has warned that this market cycle deviates from previous ones, where altseason was traditionally triggered by capital rotations from Bitcoin to altcoins. Instead, he suggested this altseason may rely on stablecoin liquidity and the expansion of stablecoin trading pairs. “A rise in stablecoin trading pairs suggests fresh capital entering the altcoin market and reflects true demand increases, rather than just capital rotations,” Ju added. Capital flows into Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also signify a major shift from prior cycles. These flows are siloed within the ETF ecosystem, limiting the ability to shift funds from Bitcoin and Ether investments into smaller-cap altcoins, Ju explained. Market Outlook Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, predicted in December 2024 that most altcoins would face a “slow bleed” until late January 2025. Hartmann argued there was little opportunity in altcoin investments during the current consolidation phase, suggesting the market may only pick up following its conclusion.

This data indicates that the current price range might present an ideal opportunity to add or buy more meme coins. Current Price Momentum Currently, DOGE is trading near $0.334 and has experienced a price surge of over 4.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 15%, indicating that more investors and traders are engaging with the token as sentiment appears to be quietly improving compared to the past few days. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level However, DOGE has found support at the crucial $0.31 level and is poised for upside momentum. Historically, the meme coin has bounced off this support level multiple times, each time witnessing significant upward momentum. This time, experts and analysts are speculating a similar outcome for DOGE, which explains the reason behind the 470 million accumulation. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, DOGE is currently facing minor resistance at $0.34 and appears to be struggling to breach this level. Based on recent price action, if DOGE surpasses this resistance and closes a daily candle above the $0.345 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 15% to reach the $0.40 level in the near future. RSI Signals Recovery Potential In addition, DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing the oversold area, indicating a potential recovery that could unfold in the coming days.

According to a Friday filing in the US District Court for the Northern District of Delaware, FriendliAI entered into a “confidential agreement” with Hugging Face on January 8. The company has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit “with prejudice,” which means the case cannot be brought back to court. FriendliAI filed against Hugging Face in 2023 The settlement comes almost two years after FriendliAI filed a lawsuit against Hugging Face over the infringement of one of its patents. The Korean AI startup however reached a settlement on Friday. “FriendliAI and Hugging Face hereby stipulate to dismissal … without costs and fees to any party of this case,” reads the filing. “The court shall retain jurisdiction over the parties’ settlement agreement.” Court papers. In its lawsuit, which was filed nearly two years ago, the Korean AI startup accused Hugging face of violating its patent on “batching with iteration-level scheduling.” FriendliAI also claims that the patented technology described in an application to the US Patent and Trademark Office improves the process of batching data fed into the AI system to allow the system to handle multiple requests at once. According to Tech Crunch , the patent also covers AI systems that enable finished requests from within a batch to be sent to a user and new requests to be added to the batch before the full batch has been processed. According to a complaint filed on July 28, 2023, in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, Hugging Face’s “Text Generation Inference” server for its large language model AI used the Korean AI startup’s patented method to batch incoming requests to increase the tool’s efficiency. As such, FriendliAI wanted compensation from Hugging Face, enhanced damages for willfulness, in addition to a court order preventing further infringement or awarding a licensing fee and attorney’s fees and costs. In the meantime, Microsoft releases model on Hugging Face According to a Bloomberg report, FriendliAI’s method which the startup refers to as “batching with iteration level scheduling” and markets as Periflow or Orca, enhanced the process of batching inputs to allow the AI to process multiple requests. FriendliAI also has an office in Redwood City, California. The VC-backed startup was founded in 2021 and primarily develops infrastructure solutions for the fast-growing AI tech. According to TC, Hugging Face has raised a total of $235 million from backers, including Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Intel, and Salesforce.

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 23:54:00

The recent Blockchain Roundtable held in the German Parliament brought out some of the key proposals for realizing this objective. The event included remarks from Christian Lindner, former Finance Minister of the country, and also included contributions from Patrick Hansen, the Senior Director of EU Strategy & Policy at Circle. Strategic Bitcoin initiatives Christian Lindner proposed three key measures during the roundtable discussion. The first one is the provision of government bonds on the basis of the blockchain. This could help increase the bond market’s transparency and effectiveness and potentially put Germany at the cutting edge of blockchain financial technology. Another proposal is to have the German government, or even the European Union, use Bitcoin as a reserve currency. This would align it with other governments around the world, using Bitcoin as a store of value and as an inflation hedge. The third one focuses on the possibility of launching Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the European Union. Currently, European markets do not have Bitcoin ETFs and use exchange-traded notes (ETNs) or commodities (ETCs). The entry of ETFs could offer investors regulated and institutional-grade investment avenues, thus increasing adoption and market depth. Impact of previous Bitcoin sales Germany’s interest in Bitcoin comes after its government recently auctioned off 50,000 BTC seized during an operation against the Movie2k piracy website . This sale happened in mid-2024, influencing the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin’s value decreasing from $70,000 to $56,000. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $94,806 and is still below the $100,000 mark, which market analysts say is because the asset is still in the distribution zone. Analysts expect the prices to rise again due to increasing usage and utilization of the digital asset. In December, Lindner spoke in the Bundestag, pointing to the government’s missed opportunity to harness Bitcoin’s potential and comparing Germany’s position to that of the United States. He pointed out that the US is ready to adopt cryptocurrency-friendly measures after Donald Trump’s victory in the recent election. In his campaign, Trump suggested buying Bitcoin and labeling the US as a home of cryptocurrencies. During his speech, Lindner complained about the fact that Germany did not have a strategy, arguing, “The US will use the advantages that we could also have with Bitcoin. What an omission, what opportunities are being lost to us.” Still, Lindner’s renewed interest in Bitcoin has also attracted controversy. German crypto analyst and trader Furkan Yildirim expressed his doubts on X . Stating, “The man had almost 4 years as finance minister to have the necessary debates, and now that there’s a fire, he notices? Bitcoin doesn’t need politicians. Politicians need Bitcoin.” Lindner’s recent statements come at a time when German politics are more active than usual, with a federal election scheduled for soon. Critics have suggested that Lindner’s outspoken support for Bitcoin is an attempt to re-ignite his party’s flagging popularity as the polls suggest that support for the party is waning.

This approach is designed to streamline operations, addressing issues of efficiency as transaction volumes grow. Similarly, BitTorrent (BTT) market trends reveal potential, with its integration into the BitTorrent ecosystem offering advantages in decentralized file sharing. However, challenges such as competition and token supply remain hurdles for growth. As blockchain technology continues to reshape industries, Web3Bay (3BAY) is the fresh-faced Web3 crypto project gearing up to redefine e-commerce. Having raised over $560K, with over $50K being raised in the last 24 hours, its blockchain-powered e-commerce platform emphasizes security, transparency, and accessibility. As traditional e-commerce platforms face disruption, Web3Bay is ready to claim a significant portion of the market with its decentralized approach. SOL Network Aims to Improve Efficiency The Solana network continues to address scalability challenges with its latest proposal, SIMD-215, a homomorphic hashing system designed to enhance account verification efficiency. This shift targets the longstanding issue of “state growth,” where recalculating the entire state of accounts slows network performance. By adopting incremental updates instead, Solana’s developers aim to streamline operations and reduce resource strain on nodes. Replacing the current Merkle-based hashing system, this approach could significantly improve scalability and strengthen the Solana network’s ability to handle rising transaction volumes. The proposed changes will require nodes to adopt the updated calculation methods, ensuring smoother transitions and uninterrupted operations. These advancements highlight efforts to maintain competitiveness as Solana continues to adapt within the blockchain ecosystem. BTT Market Trends Show Potential Despite Challenges BitTorrent market trends indicate a mix of opportunities and hurdles as BTT navigates its position in a competitive crypto landscape. Currently trading at a fraction of a cent, BTT has seen volatility reflective of broader market conditions. Its integration with the BitTorrent ecosystem offers a unique advantage, leveraging a massive user base for decentralized file sharing. Despite this edge, BitTorrent market trends also underscore challenges, such as a high token supply and stiff competition from bigger platforms. Strategic partnerships and technological advancements are key factors shaping BTT’s future trajectory. As interest in decentralized solutions grows, BitTorrent market trends suggest room for growth if adoption continues to rise and technological hurdles are addressed. Web3Bay Crypto Goes Viral: Presale Jumps to $560K Web3Bay is making strides toward changing the way digital commerce operates, surging past a half-a-million raised, sitting at $560K in its presale with 148 million tokens sold. Web3Bay is quickly making a name for itself as the decentralized alternative to traditional, centralized e-commerce platforms. Web3Bay integrates blockchain technology to offer secure, transparent, and cost-efficient transactions. This presents Web3Bay as a serious player set to take up some market share traditionally dominated by giants like Amazon. The appeal lies in its focus on user security and global accessibility, removing reliance on centralized online shopping systems. Web3Bay’s plans include a robust ecosystem featuring an NFT marketplace, DeFi integrations for staking and lending, and cross-chain compatibility. These features position Web3Bay as a forward-looking project combining real-world application with investment potential. At just $0.0039675 per token, traders are capitalizing on this opportunity, noting both its practical use cases and the anticipated return on investment. As the presale accelerates, it reflects a shift in how users view Web3 crypto in e-commerce — bringing efficiency to digital marketplaces while paving the way for future advancements. 2025: A Year of Huge Innovations As 2025 unfolds, all these projects illustrate how blockchain technology is fundamentally reshaping industries, setting the stage for a transformative year ahead. The Solana network tackles efficiency concerns with a proposed hashing system, potentially enhancing its scalability and performance as transactions increase. BitTorrent market trends reveal opportunities and challenges. Its integration into the BitTorrent ecosystem offers a unique edge, but the project tries to overcome the hurdles. In the e-commerce sector, Web3Bay leads the charge by blending blockchain technology with practical features to redefine e-commerce. Having raised over $560K and sold 148 million tokens, the hype around Web3Bay’s decentralized platform is evident as it emphasizes security, transparency, and affordability. 3BAY doesn’t seem to be slowing down and has made it obvious it intends to take the market share it deserves.

The Cardano whale activity has recently become a focal point in crypto circles, with substantial acquisitions exceeding 20 million ADA within just two days, igniting discussions of a potential surge pushing prices over $1. Furthermore, the affiliate program by BlockDAG (BDAG) has captured widespread attention, offering participants a prime chance to amplify their rewards within a dynamic crypto environment. Enthusiasts have embraced these incentives, propelling BlockDAG’s presale to an impressive $178.5 million. With its pioneering DAG technology and appealing rewards, BlockDAG (BDAG) is marked as a leading crypto coin to keep an eye on in 2025. Cardano Whale Activity Fuels Speculation of an ADA Surge Cardano whale activity has surged, with prominent buyers acquiring over 20 million ADA within just two days. This intense accumulation is a strong indicator of growing confidence, often viewed as a sign of upcoming market shifts. With its current price at $0.8551, Cardano is poised at a critical threshold, yet the significant purchases suggest a bullish uptrend is likely. Data shows that Cardano whales holding 1 to 10 million ADA are behind this boost, injecting considerable assets into Cardano’s market. These moves demonstrate a robust belief in ADA’s potential growth. Should this trend persist, analysts believe Cardano might soon revisit the $1 mark, sparking renewed enthusiasm for the altcoin. XRP Price Trends Predict a Rise to $15 by May 2025 XRP price trends are showing a positive outlook, encouraged by increasing adoption and a drop in selling pressure. Analyst Bobby A noted on X that XRP’s current path mirrors earlier market cycles, which saw gains reduce with each successive impulse. Predictions based on these historical cycles suggest a potential 665% increase for XRP, in line with Fibonacci predictions, targeting $15. These trends are supported by rising network use, dwindling exchange reserves, and optimistic market sentiment in derivatives. With the crypto community closely watching, the Elliott Wave analysis forecasts a promising fifth wave breakout, enhancing XRP’s appeal in the market.

The token protocol claims to build a “trustless world computer for Bitcoin,” offering solutions that address limitations in programmability, data availability and asset creation. In an X post on January 10, Nubit announced : Today, Bitcoin has 100+ asset protocols—fragmented, inefficient, and isolated. Every new feature requires building a new protocol from scratch. However, Goldinals changes everything. ~Nubit Goldinals is developed on BitVM and already works well with BRC-20, Runes and Ordinals According to Nubit, the new token protocol, Goldinals, is fully compatible with experimental token standard BRC-20 and the fungible token Runes. The token protocol is also built on BitVM, a system intended to execute complex computations and smart contracts on the BTC network. In a series of X posts, the company insisted that Goldinals is fast, secure, reliable, and fully decentralized , claiming it could help streamline the very fragmented BTC ecosystem. It added that the Bitcoin protocol can now hasten development time, working ten times faster. Moreover, Nubit argued that the protocol is programmable and interoperable and hence will address all the inefficiencies that come with Bitcoin’s ecosystem fragmentation. Developers can also specify token attributes such as supply limits or transfer rules using smart contract-style logic. All transactions are also verifiable directly on the BTC blockchain. Furthermore, Goldinals will utilize zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for on-chain validation. ZK proofs will help the protocol to trace and identify invalid transactions on the Bitcoin network, reducing the need for third-party verification. Nubit aims to revolutionize Bitcoin with programmability and trustless computing Nubit co-founder Hanzhi has maintained that the firm will prioritise programmability, arguing that Bitcoin needs “real programmability, not duct-taped chaos.” He added that with reliable foundations and standards, the Bitcoin ecosystem will evolve into a space of interoperable, win-win innovation. Nubit is also developing a compiler to convert user-friendly code into optimized BTC scripts, with formal verification to validate each program’s integrity. Additionally, the firm will continue to develop BitVM to operate Turing-complete programs on Bitcoin. The company still expects to complete the establishment of a Trustless World Computer for BTC, with support from Polychain.

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), known for its vibrant community and cultural appeal, has surged over 611% in the past month. However, analysts warn of resistance levels that could slow its climb. Meanwhile, Osaka Protocol (OSAK) focuses on true decentralization, although its price has dropped by 21% in the last month despite a sharp 60.79% increase in trading volume in the last 24 hours. Amidst these shifts, BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is capturing attention for all the right reasons. Its 90% APY staking rewards, paired with a stellar presale performance of over $5.1 million raised, have positioned it as the top pick among the best new meme coins to join now . With a P2E game and a growing Bulls Squad community, BTFD is more than just a meme coin—it’s a revolution. BTFD Coin: A Staking Reward Revolution What makes BTFD Coin ($BTFD) the hottest meme coin of the year? Start with its 90% APY staking rewards, which provide investors with unparalleled opportunities to grow their holdings. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD backs its appeal with tangible value. Currently in its 13th presale stage, BTFD is priced at $0.000142 per token. With over 63 billion tokens sold and more than 8,000 investors onboard, the coin’s momentum is undeniable. A $6,000 investment at this stage secures over 42.25 million $BTFD tokens. Once listed at $0.0006, this would yield $25,350—a jaw-dropping 322.5% return, excluding staking gains. The Bulls Squad community adds a layer of excitement, rallying around the coin’s innovative P2E game launched on January 1, 2025. Players can earn rewards through engaging gameplay, merging fun with financial gains. This fusion of entertainment and investment has cemented BTFD as one of the top contenders among the best new meme coins to join now. Getting started is simple. Set up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and connect to the BTFD buy page . A few clicks later, you’ll own the dip and join a movement that’s redefining meme coin success. Pudgy Penguins: Cultural Icon Meets Market Resistance Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is more than just a meme coin—it’s a cultural phenomenon. With over 50 billion views and millions of fans, the Pudgy Penguin brand has become a beacon of positivity and community in the crypto space. Currently trading at $0.03559, PENGU has risen by 6.7% in the last 24 hours, following an explosive 611% surge over the past month. However, the coin faces significant challenges. Analysts highlight resistance at $0.0469, which has repeatedly stalled upward momentum. If PENGU fails to hold its support level at $0.0296, a drop to $0.020 could be on the cards. Despite these hurdles, PENGU’s loyal fanbase and ongoing marketing efforts keep it in the spotlight. From major brands showcasing the Penguin to its inclusion in ETF commercials, the coin’s influence extends beyond the crypto world. For those willing to ride out the volatility, PENGU offers a blend of community vibes and speculative potential. Osaka Protocol: True Decentralization in Action Osaka Protocol (OSAK) brings a refreshing focus on decentralization, promoting the idea that ownership equals responsibility. Each holder’s influence is proportional to their stake, fostering a sense of shared accountability within the ecosystem. Trading at $0.0000001936, OSAK has seen its price dip by 1.19% in the last 24 hours and 21% over the past month. However, trading volume has soared by 60.79%, indicating growing interest despite the price decline. This paradox suggests that while the coin faces short-term challenges, its community-driven model may provide a strong foundation for future growth. For investors seeking a project with meaningful decentralization and collaborative governance, OSAK stands out. Its focus on equality and shared responsibility resonates with those who value the core principles of blockchain technology. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is the frontrunner among the best new meme coins to join now. Its unmatched 90% APY staking rewards, combined with a stellar presale performance and innovative P2E game, make it a standout choice for investors. With over $5.1 million raised and a growing Bulls Squad community, BTFD isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a game-changer.

Despite the drop, the popular meme coin still holds a bullish structure, keeping investors optimistic about its potential for recovery. However, the current levels are critical, as Dogecoin is testing key demand zones that could determine its next move. Related Reading: Key Metrics Reveal Bitcoin STH Support Levels Around $89K–$86K – Is BTC At Risk? Top analyst and trader BigCheds recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that DOGE is testing crucial demand at $0.31 on the daily time frame. This level has historically acted as a strong support zone, and holding above it could set the stage for a bounce and continuation of its bullish trend. Conversely, a failure to maintain this level might open the door to further downside. Market sentiment remains cautious following the broader crypto market’s decline, but DOGE’s ability to hold current levels could restore investor confidence. All eyes are now on whether the meme coin can defend this key support and potentially pave the way for a new rally or if additional selling pressure will lead to a deeper correction. Dogecoin Holds Pivotal Support as 2025 Begins The start of 2025 has taken a different tone for Dogecoin compared to the explosive end of 2024. Beginning in early November, DOGE experienced a massive price surge, gaining over 230% in less than three weeks. This meteoric rise saw the meme coin reach significant levels, reigniting interest and optimism among investors. However, since finding a local high, Dogecoin has entered a consolidation phase, testing critical levels of support. Currently, Dogecoin is trading around $0.31, a key daily demand level identified by top analyst BigCheds. In his recent technical analysis, BigCheds emphasizes the importance of this support zone, as it could determine the next major move for the cryptocurrency. If DOGE manages to hold above $0.31, it sets the stage for a potential breakout into higher prices, reigniting the bullish momentum seen in late 2024. This consolidation phase is being closely monitored by traders and investors, as Dogecoin’s ability to maintain its bullish structure depends on this level. A clean bounce from the $0.31 demand could trigger renewed buying pressure, propelling DOGE toward new highs. Conversely, losing this critical support might signal a deeper correction, testing lower levels before any recovery.

A successful defense of $0.31 could mark the beginning of another significant rally, solidifying DOGE’s position as a top contender in the cryptocurrency space. DOGE Eyes A Breakout Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.33, showing resilience after holding above the critical $0.31 demand level. This support has provided a foundation for DOGE to stabilize following the recent market selloff. However, the cryptocurrency remains at risk as long as it continues to trade below the $0.40 mark, a level that could reignite bullish momentum. For bulls to regain control, the price must reclaim $0.40 decisively. This would signal a shift in sentiment and provide the momentum needed to challenge the $0.43 mark. Breaking above $0.43 is a crucial milestone for Dogecoin, as it would likely trigger a significant rally into price discovery, attracting renewed interest from investors and traders. Related Reading: Solana Must Reclaim Momentum In The Coming Weeks – SOL/BTC Ratio At A Pivotal Point Conversely, failing to reclaim $0.40 in the near term keeps DOGE vulnerable to further downside. Prolonged trading below this level increases the risk of a deeper correction, potentially testing lower levels of demand. The next few days will be pivotal for Dogecoin’s trajectory, as the broader market sentiment and DOGE’s ability to reclaim key levels will determine its direction. If bulls succeed in pushing above $0.43, the meme coin could quickly gain momentum, solidifying its place as a market leader in this cycle.

On Friday, the bureau issued two proposals for public participation and feedback. One proposa l seeks ways to prevent intrusive data collection when clients make digital payments on large tech platforms. The second proposes strengthening laws protecting clients against fraud to cover those who make digital payments through gaming and other cryptos. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. When people pay for their family expenses using new forms of digital payments, they must be confident that their transactions are not tainted by harmful surveillance or errors. ~ Rohit Chopra Trump’s leadership transition sparks uncertainty over CFPB proposals It is unclear how the proposals will end as the current leadership may change upon Trump’s swearing-in on January 20. There has been speculation of Trump replacing Chopra, yet no specific name for the replacement has been tabled. Trump has taken a pro-Bitcoin stand, suggesting he wants to model the US as the world’s crypto capital. He looks forward to enabling the crypto environment than the Joe Biden administration. According to the CFPB , they proposed consumer digital payment privacy after conducting research that revealed that some payment mechanisms gather more data that is irrelevant to transactions. According to the CFPB, this data could be used to allow payment companies to facilitate personalized pricing, where a price is based on factors specific to an individual consumer. The deadline for public comment is April 11. CFPB tightens rules on big tech to protect digital payment users Some big tech companies collect too much data using their platforms as surveillance tools. Chopra felt that strengthening regulations would be critical. The CFPB’s open banking rules, released in October, curtail companies’ ability to use payment data for advertising and marketing purposes. A rule finalized in November gave the CFPB the mandate to supervise payment tools from Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and other large digital payment providers. The other proposal seeks to establish the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which shields consumers’ right to dispute payment carters for new payment systems. Although stablecoins operate around trading and settlement, they are likely to grow beyond that scope in the fullness of time. Both Stripe Inc., Visa Inc., and PayPal Holdings Inc. have stablecoin initiatives. The regulator explained that the proposals aim to reexamine marketwide expectations regarding the available payment laws through consumer lenses without seeking court orders and decisions. The deadline for the second proposal is March 31.

However, recent market trends tell a different story. The so-called ‘Trump Dump’ has led to significant market dips, with many attributing the downturn to growing uncertainty. Amidst the skepticism, the Trump Dump has surprisingly sparked a buying frenzy for Dogecoin and its emerging DOGE AI rival, RCO Finance (RCOF) . As an AI-driven decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, RCOF is drawing attention with its innovative approach and highly anticipated token presale, positioning itself as a formidable contender against established cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Woes Spark a DOGE Buying Frenzy – Is RCOF the Next Big Rival? The “Trump Dump,” a term sparked by analysts predicting market reactions to Donald Trump’s potential inauguration, has injected volatility into the cryptocurrency space. While Bitcoin’s price correction from an anticipated all-time high of $114,000 to a possible $88,000 has drawn mixed reactions, this turbulence has also triggered buying opportunities for other cryptos like Dogecoin (DOGE). Dogecoin, known for its meme appeal and enduring popularity, is now benefiting from renewed investor interest as Bitcoin’s fluctuations send ripples across the market. Analysts like Johnny the Crypto God suggest that Dogecoin could thrive during Bitcoin’s volatile movements, potentially positioning DOGE as a hedge in uncertain times. Moreover, DOGE’s correlation with market hype and its resilient community further fuel optimism. Amidst this, RCO Finance (RCOF), a DOGE AI rival, is gaining momentum. The Trump Dump may be unsettling for Bitcoin, but it seems to be presenting an unexpected boon for DOGE and its emerging competitors. Investors Pick RCO Finance (RCOF) Amidst the Trump Dump While the Trump Dump has definitely caused liquidations in the market, it has significantly triggered a buying spree for Dogecoin and the DOGE AI rival, RCO FInance (RCOF) . While investors look for high ROI on assets, RCO Finance investors are lured by its unique DeFi prepositions to improve trading with the help of AI. At the heart of RCO Finance’s offering is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, a unique tool that personalizes investment strategies for all users. This intelligent system analyzes market trends, historical data and news tickers from reputable sources like Reuters and Bloomberg to provide bespoke trading strategies and recommendations. With a 24/7 system that adapts strategies in real-time, the robo-advisor removes emotional biases and optimizes portfolio management, proving to be an indispensable tool in today’s volatile market. Another feature that distinguishes RCO Finance is its commitment to tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). This innovative approach allows users to invest in high-value assets such as real estate and art through fractional ownership. RCO Finance democratizes access to markets once reserved for institutional investors by breaking down these traditionally illiquid investments into manageable tokens. This increases liquidity and opens new avenues for portfolio diversification, making investing more accessible than ever before. Apart from trading, the platform’s dividend pools further improve its attractiveness, offering token holders consistent rewards based on their involvement within the ecosystem. Moreover, with a unique staking program, liquidity pools and DeFi lending commissions, investors are assured of a steady income stream. RCO Finance also bridges the gap between digital and traditional finance with its local Debit Card. This feature enables users to convert their crypto holdings into fiat currency instantly, facilitating everyday transactions without the hassle of complex conversions. Moreover, RCO Finance stands out for its KYC-Free Accessibility, which prioritizes user privacy. Removing KYC barriers, RCOF allows global participation in DeFi without lengthy identity verification processes. Moreover, the security and integrity of the RCOF DOGE AI rival smart contracts are assured by audits by SolidProof. Investors Target High ROI with the DOGE AI Rival RCOF Presale The presale for RCO Finance is in full swing, presenting an exceptional opportunity for early investors. Currently priced at $0.0777 per token, this presale stage offers a 25% bonus for investors using the code RCOF25. Projections indicate a potential launch price between $0.4 and $0.6, so early participants could see over 700% ROI once the DOGE AI rival hits the market. Moreover, some bullish analysts predict RCOF will surpass Dogecoin’s bull run and possibly hit $1 by Q2 2025. RCOF uses an advanced tokenomics model, offering 50% of the tokens for public sale. Moreover, the deflationary model, where unsold tokens from the presale are burned, aims to increase scarcity and potentially boost the token’s value post-listing. With the presale closing in, now is the perfect time to capitalize on this once-in-a-lifetime potential. Secure your RCOF tokens today and position yourself for higher gains once the tokens are listed in exchanges!

While Cardano is priced at $0.8577 and is nearing the completion of its price adjustment with forecasts showing a climb to $2.50 by 2025, XRP has risen by 10% in a day, aiming for $3.20, driven by positive market sentiment. Meanwhile, the success of BlockDAG’s $178.5 million presale and the integration of EVM-WASM technology underscores its position as the top crypto to buy now. Cardano Price Adjustment: Upcoming Valuations and Expectations The downward price adjustment in Cardano has fueled debates about its future potential, with current trades at $0.8577 after a 40% drop. Noted analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggests that the price range of $0.74 to $0.98 could offer a good entry point. Despite its recent dip, Cardano is seen in a generally bullish trend with projections of reaching between $2.50 and $3.00 by 2025, suggesting a promising upward journey supported by continuous developments within its ecosystem. Anticipating XRP’s Price Surge Towards $3.20 The recent 10% increase in XRP’s price has the market’s attention, now standing at $2.31. This resurgence is marked by anticipation of an uptick towards the all-time high of $3.84. Analyst ‘ The Moon Show ‘ on X social platform notes a symmetrical triangle pattern that could push XRP towards $3.20 soon, backed by solid buying activity. The optimism around XRP’s growth trajectory is palpable, and if the bullish trend holds, it might surpass $3 as early as January. BlockDAG’s Developer Support with EVM & WASM Attracts Broad Interest BlockDAG’s integration of EVM and WASM technologies is poised to significantly expand its ecosystem, setting it apart as a top choice for developers and traders. The compatibility with EVM allows for straightforward transitions of Ethereum-based dApps to BlockDAG, facilitating quick adoption and minimizing development challenges. WASM’s integration promises vast opportunities in gaming, AI, and finance, with the potential for superior flexibility and efficiency. These capabilities have fortified the platform, attracting developers from Ethereum’s active community and pushing forward BlockDAG’s growth. The remarkable presale performance, amassing $178.5 million with 17.7 billion coins sold, demonstrates BlockDAG’s strong market presence. The price of BDAG coins, currently at $0.0248 in the 27th batch, reflects a significant ROI of 2380% for early adopters. With predictions of reaching $30 by 2030, the forthcoming Mainnet launch in 2025 emphasizes BlockDAG’s potential, making it a key candidate for those looking for top crypto to buy now. Wrapping Up- Top Crypto to Buy Now As the crypto market evolves, both Cardano’s correction phase ending and XRP’s price surge signify promising investment avenues. Nonetheless, BlockDAG remains a focal point with its unique EVM and WASM support, which ensures unmatched adaptability for developers across various sectors.

Billionaires Philippe Laffont, Stanley Druckenmiller, Chase Coleman, Stephen Mandel and Larry Robbins are accumulating AI-centered equities, reports The Motley Fool. The investors have specifically targeted US semiconductor and software giant Broadcom (AVGO), purchasing a total of 1,728,646 shares valued at about $1.47 billion in the third quarter of last year. The firm’s AI revenue has surged in recent months, powering a 125% rise in the stock over the last year. The wealthy investors have also purchased roughly 1,749,613 shares of Amazon, worth about $245 million, as the company’s cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) implements generative AI solutions for customers. Lastly, the billionaires have bought 621,445 shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), worth about $62 million, betting on the world’s largest chip manufacturer. The billionaires’ new plays in artificial intelligence come as analysts at PwC forecast the total addressable market for AI will hit $15.7 trillion by 2030, as the groundbreaking technology transforms business and manufacturing worldwide.

The company intends to incorporate Bitcoin into its operations by accepting it as payment and holding it as a strategic asset. This initiative positions the craft distiller as an early adopter of cryptocurrency within the craft spirits industry. Heritage Distilling Adopts Bitcoin Strategy for Treasury and E-Commerce In a recent press statement , Heritage Distilling outlined plans to integrate Bitcoin into its business model. The company will accept Bitcoin as payment through its direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform, enabling customers to purchase craft spirits using cryptocurrency. This move reflects a broader trend of businesses leveraging digital assets for seamless payment options. Heritage Distilling also plans to hold Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy. The company believes this strategy enhances its financial flexibility and broadens its consumer base. Notably, the growing adoption of Bitcoin strategy among institutional players has raised a lot of buzz in the cryptocurrency market. Most recently, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed the only scenario in which MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy could lead to bankruptcy. According to him, the company, which holds $46 billion in BTC against $7 billion in debt, faces a liquidation threshold if Bitcoin’s price drops to $16,500—a situation he deems highly improbable. Strategic Cushion Against Bitcoin Volatility Heritage Distilling emphasized its ability to mitigate potential risks associated with Bitcoin price volatility. As a producer of consumer goods, the company benefits from a margin between the cost of production and the retail price of its products. This margin is a cushion allowing the company to absorb fluctuations in Bitcoin price without impacting its stability. The company’s leadership noted that the recent updates to financial accounting standards simplify how public companies report Bitcoin holdings. This change makes it easier for businesses like Heritage Distilling to incorporate Bitcoin into their operations without accounting challenges. Leadership and Governance Behind the Initiative Heritage Distilling’s Board of Directors has established a Technology and Cryptocurrency Committee to oversee the development and implementation of its Bitcoin Strategy. Chaired by Matt Swann, a leader in technology and digital payments, the committee is tasked with crafting a formal Bitcoin Treasury Policy for board approval. According to CEO Justin Stiefel, this initiative positions Heritage Distilling as an innovator in the craft spirits industry. The company aims to attract new customers, including Bitcoin users, while leveraging the potential growth of Bitcoin as an asset. Justin Stiefel commented, “Heritage has always been an innovator and once again we are leading the way in the craft spirits space as we prepare to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for online e-commerce sales and to acquire and hold Bitcoin as an asset.” Meanwhile, another notable Bitcoin adopter, Genius Group, has boosted its Bitcoin Treasury by $5 million, bringing its total holdings to $35 million. The AI-powered education firm remains committed to its “Bitcoin-first” strategy. It leverages crypto-backed loans to fund reserves and integrate blockchain into its educational platforms. The company most recently boosted its Bitcoin Treasury by $10 million, bringing its holdings to 319.4 BTC at an average cost of $93,919 per BTC.

On Pump.fun, a meme token launchpad, only 0.4% of traders have a profit of more than $ 10,000, statistics according to recent data . According to Adam Tehc, a Dune data analyst, out of the more than 13.4 million wallets on Pump.fun, only 54,724 wallets have made profits of $10,000 or more. However, only 294 have achieved the status of “crypto millionaires” by accumulating gains of more than $1 million—this is 0.002% of all wallets. Source:X Tehc pointed out the difference between reality and perception, saying that “289 Pump.fun millionaires is very low and speaks to the gap between the timeline and reality.” This data does not include the revenues from the purchase of Pump.fun tokens after they are graduated from the platform, which happens when a token has a $100,000 market capitalization. However, they do allow for token purchases that are made after graduation as long as the initial purchase was made before graduation. The data can also be impacted by bots. Pump.fun has identified a new group of bots known as “bump bots” that make small trades to generate interest in certain tokens. Although the percentage of very profitable traders among the Pump.fun users remain low, but this figure has steadily increased. A year ago, only 70 wallets had become millionaires, while 11,936 wallets had earned $10,000 or more. Tehc pointed out that the level of profitability is rising among more experienced traders. Pump.fun is a meme coin platform that was created in January 2024 and has become popular rather quickly. Currently, the platform supports the creation of more than 5.7 million tokens with a total revenue of approximately $392 million. A November report also showed that 88% of users trade meme coins through Pump.fun either lost money or made less than $100 in profits. Pump.fun has continued its dominance in the Solana network, performing about 70% of all transactions at the beginning of the year. This spike is the highest level of activity on the platform since November. Since its launch in early 2024, Pump.fun has had great success with Solana meme coins like PNUT, GOAT, and FARTCOINs. As Cryptopolitan reported , Pump.fun is popular among teenagers and young adults, with 64% of website users being under 34. The platform attracts its audience by combining financial and investment content with news and current events. Controversies and Regulatory Scrutiny However, not all has been rosy for Pump.fun as it has been experiencing a meteoritic rise and fall at the same time. The platform quicky turned into a playground for high-risk traders, who used any means necessary to promote tokens. In 2024, a new trend of livestream stunt occurred, during which cases of animal cruelty and fake suicide took place. All these actions led the platform to suspend its live-streaming service. Shortly after, the UK-based Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a notice that advised the public against Pump.fun due to the risks it posed. In response, the platform banned UK-based traders from participating in the platform due to the bans.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU.

As innovation surges, new projects are stepping into the spotlight with game-changing features and real-world applications. This week, three names stand out: Qubetics ($TICS), Astra, and Theta. Qubetics ($TICS) is taking the lead with its Decentralized VPN feature, offering a secure, private way to navigate the digital world. Astra, a cutting-edge platform, is blending blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize data processing. And Theta is transforming video streaming with its decentralized content delivery network, empowering both creators and viewers. Let’s explore what makes these altcoins the best to join this week and how they’re shaping the future of blockchain technology. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Online Privacy with Decentralized VPNs Qubetics is making waves in the blockchain space by addressing one of the most pressing issues of our time: online privacy. Its Decentralized VPN (dVPN) is designed to provide secure, anonymous access to the internet by eliminating the reliance on centralized servers. Unlike traditional VPNs that route traffic through fixed locations, Qubetics uses blockchain technology to decentralize the process, ensuring user data stays private and untraceable. Imagine being a remote worker who regularly accesses sensitive company files while traveling. A centralized VPN might protect your data, but it’s not foolproof—server hacks and data breaches are common threats. With Qubetics’ dVPN, your connection is encrypted and routed through a global network of blockchain nodes, making it nearly impossible for anyone to intercept or track your activity. This feature isn’t just for professionals. Everyday internet users can enjoy browsing without worrying about surveillance, censorship, or intrusive ads. For example, students researching restricted topics or activists sharing critical information in oppressive regions can use Qubetics to ensure their safety and anonymity. The excitement around Qubetics isn’t just about its technology. The project is currently in its 16th presale stage, with over 409 million tokens sold to 13,900 holders, raising more than $9.1 million. At a price of just $0.0455 per token, $TICS offers an exceptional entry point for those seeking to invest in a project tackling real-world problems. Adding to its credibility, Qubetics has partnered with SWFT Blockchain, enabling seamless integration with other networks . This partnership highlights the platform’s focus on creating a robust and interoperable ecosystem. Astra: The Convergence of Blockchain and AI Astra is taking blockchain innovation to the next level by merging it with artificial intelligence (AI). As industries increasingly rely on data-driven insights, Astra’s platform offers a decentralized solution for processing and analyzing massive amounts of data, ensuring security, transparency, and efficiency. Here’s how it works: Astra leverages blockchain to store data securely and uses AI to analyze it in real-time. This combination creates a powerful tool for businesses and individuals looking to make informed decisions without compromising privacy. For example, an e-commerce company could use Astra to analyze customer data, identify trends, and personalize shopping experiences without risking data breaches. Similarly, a healthcare provider might utilize the platform to process patient information securely, ensuring compliance with regulations while delivering better care. Astra also focuses on democratizing AI. Its platform allows developers to build decentralized AI applications that are accessible to everyone, from startups to large enterprises. This inclusivity fosters innovation and expands the reach of AI-powered solutions. For those seeking the best altcoins to join this week, Astra’s blend of blockchain and AI positions it as a unique and promising investment. Its focus on solving complex data challenges ensures it remains relevant in an increasingly digital world. Theta: Revolutionizing Video Streaming with Decentralization Theta is shaking up the video streaming industry with its decentralized content delivery network. By leveraging blockchain, Theta allows users to share bandwidth and computing resources, creating a peer-to-peer network that reduces costs, improves streaming quality, and rewards participants. Picture this: A popular YouTuber uploads a video, and viewers worldwide can access it instantly without buffering. Instead of relying on centralized servers, Theta’s network distributes the content efficiently, ensuring smooth playback even during peak times. At the same time, viewers who share their bandwidth earn rewards, creating an ecosystem where everyone benefits. Theta’s platform also empowers content creators by reducing dependency on traditional streaming platforms. By using Theta, creators can distribute their work directly to audiences, bypassing intermediaries and keeping more of their revenue. This model has the potential to disrupt the current landscape, where platforms often take significant cuts from creators’ earnings. For businesses, Theta offers a scalable solution for delivering high-quality video content. Whether it’s live streaming a sporting event or hosting virtual conferences, companies can rely on Theta’s network to ensure a seamless experience for users. As video content continues to dominate the internet, Theta’s innovative approach makes it one of the best altcoins to join this week. Its focus on decentralization and user empowerment sets it apart from traditional streaming platforms. The Role of Decentralized VPNs in Blockchain Let’s dive deeper into Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN feature and why it’s a crucial innovation for the digital age. Traditional VPNs have long been the go-to solution for online privacy, but they come with limitations. Centralized servers can be hacked, tracked, or even shut down, leaving users vulnerable. Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these risks by decentralizing the entire process. When a user connects to the dVPN, their data is encrypted and routed through multiple blockchain nodes. Each node adds a layer of security, ensuring that no single entity has control over the connection. This approach has far-reaching implications. For individuals, it means browsing without the fear of being tracked or censored. For businesses, it ensures that sensitive communications remain private, even in high-risk environments. And for developers, it opens up new possibilities for creating privacy-focused applications. As the internet becomes increasingly centralized, tools like Qubetics’ dVPN are essential for protecting freedom and privacy online. This innovation highlights why $TICS is one of the best altcoins to join this week, offering both practical value and investment potential. Conclusion: Why These Altcoins Deserve Your Attention Qubetics ($TICS), Astra, and Theta aren’t just cryptocurrencies—they’re solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in the digital age. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN redefines online privacy, ensuring secure and anonymous access to the internet. Astra’s integration of blockchain and AI offers a powerful tool for data analysis and decision-making. And Theta’s decentralized video streaming network empowers creators and viewers while improving content delivery. If you’re searching for the best altcoins to join this week , these three projects stand out with their unique features, active communities, and potential for real-world impact. Whether you’re drawn to privacy, AI, or streaming innovation, Qubetics, Astra, and Theta offer opportunities you won’t want to miss. The future of blockchain is here—be part of it today.

Platforms like Polkadot, which facilitates interoperable blockchain ecosystems, and Avalanche, which enhances decentralized applications through subnets, are pioneering in their own right. However, Web3Bay (3BAY) is setting a new standard by merging blockchain’s robust security features with the operational efficiencies of e-commerce. This unique blend results in a user-centric marketplace enhanced by smart contracts and decentralized storage, offering a comprehensive solution that emphasizes data integrity, user empowerment, and scalable commerce. Decoding Polkadot’s Climb to $10: Vital Metrics for Traders Polkadot (DOT) has captured the market’s attention with its notable price movements. After surmounting initial resistance levels, it saw a retracement that provided a setup for potential growth based on market behaviors. The trading volume and Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggest a balanced momentum, and with the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio returning to equilibrium, DOT is positioned for a possible ascent towards the $10 mark, given it can navigate through the resistance levels effectively. Avalanche’s Subnet Progress Could Trigger a Rise in AVAX Prices The growth of Avalanche’s subnet capabilities signifies burgeoning potential, marked by a notable increase in both the mainnet and testnet activities. This expansion not only broadens its decentralized application capabilities but also enhances user engagement. Coupled with rising institutional interest and AVAX’s deflationary economics, the token is forecasted to reach new heights, potentially escalating to between $75 and $85 in the near future. These projections are underpinned by robust fundamentals and market resilience, highlighting a promising outlook for AVAX. Why Choose Web3Bay? Assessing Its Technical Innovations & Market Viability Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce with its state-of-the-art technology, offering unmatched security and efficiency. It uses blockchain and smart contracts to remove middlemen, ensuring direct and secure transactions. The use of decentralized storage via IPFS protects user data from cyber threats and unauthorized access, positioning Web3Bay as a sturdy, secure global trading hub. Scalability stands out in Web3Bay’s arsenal, addressing traditional blockchain constraints. With Layer-2 solutions and auto-scaling capabilities, the platform manages high volumes of transactions efficiently and affordably, guaranteeing a smooth experience for users at all times, making it a trusted platform for sellers and buyers. Against traditional marketplaces like Amazon or eBay, Web3Bay provides clear benefits through its blockchain technology by eliminating central control, enhancing user empowerment, and reducing fees. Its user-focused model promotes transparency and equity, fostering community spirit. Unlike conventional platforms that focus on profit, Web3Bay’s model returns value to its users, creating a more just marketplace. With over $580,000 already raised, demonstrating significant investor confidence, and tokens currently priced at $0.0039675 in its third presale phase, Web3Bay is marked as a key player in transforming decentralized e-commerce. Key Insights While platforms like Polkadot and Avalanche demonstrate the functional and scalable capabilities of blockchain in the commercial sector, Web3Bay distinguishes itself by directly catering to the needs of the contemporary user. It integrates sophisticated blockchain security, smart contracts, and decentralized governance to provide a transparent, empowering, and scalable solution.

Because of the magnitude of the acquisition, there have been a lot of questions and speculations floating around about what the company’s next moves are in the coming weeks or months. Related Reading: XRP Price Stays Steady: Will Consolidation End Soon? A lot of people are curious about whether or not this move indicates a new strategy or a change in the way that Ripple intends to approach the market. This large-scale transfer has certainly piqued the interest of investors and experts alike, and as a result, Ripple’s subsequent actions are something that should be actively monitored. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 300,000,000 #XRP (682,584,540 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallethttps://t.co/d5Vu4aasU6 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 9, 2025 Significant XRP Transaction The transfer occurred on January 9, 2025, and was tracked by Whale Alert. The average exchange price for each XRP was approximately $2.275. Notably, this is not the first instance of Ripple transferring such a substantial sum; merely days prior, a same volume of XRP was dispatched to a Ripple address on New Year’s Day. These movements indicate that Ripple may be up for something big. Market Responses And Speculations Historically, large Ripple transactions have greatly changed market mood. An escrow fund moved earlier this month produced a notable 15% price rise in XRP. The current activity is not an exception; traders and investors are closely monitoring how it impacts market dynamics. Although the actual objective of this latest action is unknown, observers speculate that it could be tied to Ripple’s ongoing efforts to enhance the value of XRP. Potential Changes In Regulations While Ripple negotiates these obstacles, there is also hope for potential legislative improvements under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The crypto community believes that this adjustment will help new crypto ventures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) be introduced more easily. Such changes could significantly increase institutional interest and trade volume for XRP, hence changing its long-term course. Related Reading: Bitcoin As The New S&P 500 Of Our Time?

The sudden loss of stability compounds a rough start to the year that began with Usual’s token, once a market favorite, losing its momentum. The token price already dropped by over 30% within a week. Usual was one of the eye-catching stablecoin projects that emerged in 2024, launching on Binance at the end of 2024 with great market performance. It has the backing of French MP Pierre Person’s government background and Binance’s famed launchpad. The stablecoin markets saw a boom in 2024, with at least 23 stablecoin projects securing substantial funding ranging from 2 million to 45 million in the second half of the year. How the market reacted to USD0++ losing its 1:1 peg Crypto market analysts quickly took to X to warn their audience about further price drops in the future. The question everyone is asking now is whether USD0++ is about to become another UST. The USD0++ stablecoin fell to a low of $0.89 before rising to stabilize at around $0.93—about 7% below its intended $1 peg. The dual exit system provides users with two redemption options: A conditional exit: this option allows for 1:1 redemption at the $1 peg but demands that users forfeit a portion of accrued rewards. An unconditional exit: this option allows redemption at a current floor price of $0.87, but it is set to rise gradually to $1 over a period of four years. The abrupt changes to the protocol’s official documentation shocked many users, shaking out weak hands and leaving the stronger ones gasping for clarity. Stani Kulechov, founder of Aave, shared his opinions on the situation via a post on X. In his statement, he emphasized the risks linked with immutable price feeds. His comments also reflected broader community concerns regarding the implications of new redemption mechanisms, stating his preference for GHO, an alternative stablecoin. This is another example on how things can go wrong with fully hardcoded and immutable price feeds. USD0++ depegged to $0.93 and the given USD0++ holders lock their asset for 4 years, the discounted illiquid value in reality is at $0.855. Resulting now to a bank run on Morpho,… https://t.co/ruQK6qw7EQ — Stani (@StaniKulechov) January 10, 2025 Other users have also echoed his sentiments as the market continues to react to the shocking update with significant volatility. Things got so bad that liquidity providers on platforms like Curve Finance and Pendle reportedly experienced sudden shifts that resulted in hundreds of millions in USD0++ leaving the DeFi ecosystem, raising fears of multimillion-dollar liquidations. Responding to community concerns, Usual’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has announced plans to cover any potential bad debt in non-migrable markets up to the current amount. Why did Usual settle on $0.87? There are two possible theories about why the official announcement set the unconditional exit ratio at a precise 0.87. One is the profit burning theory. Consider the possibility of the 0.87:1 ratio set in the official announcement triggering a profit evaluation among whale holders. Since the previous 1:1 guaranteed redemption strategy failed, losing the official guarantee, large holders now face the dilemma of selecting the best option among the “short ones.” If they go for conditional redemption, investors need to return part of their subsequent profits to the project. The problem is the details of this profit withdrawal have not been disclosed officially. Conversely, if they accept the unconditional redemption method, the worst-case scenario guarantees only $0.87, with the remaining $0.13 becoming the core of the game. Naturally, when either of the two exit methods offers higher returns, the more profitable one comes out on top. A well-designed mechanism should allow users the opportunity to choose rather than be “one-sided.” As such, the $0.13 gap likely means that the official has yet to disclose the portion of profits that need to be burned, allowing users to make a choice between the two methods. From the user’s perspective, if they have to pay a guaranteed cost of $0.13 later, they might as well sell at the current depegged price (currently around $0.94). USD0++ would then return to its economic essence as a bond, with $0.13 representing the discounted portion, while $0.87 reflects its intrinsic value. The other is the liquidation bottom line theory. Before the update, Usual’s mechanism allowed many large holders to safely take positions and obtain almost risk-free returns. This further increases leverage and capital efficiency via lending protocols like Morpho. Typically, these users engaging in circular lending would collateralize their USD0++, borrow a certain amount of USDC, then exchange this USDC for USD0++, and subsequently initiate a new round of circular lending. These users, who benefited from circular lending, provided Usual with considerable TVL, continuously elevating the system. However, there is a liquidation line behind the TVL “perpetual motion machine.” In the Morpho protocol, the liquidation line for USD0 is determined by the Loan-to-Value ratio (LLTV). LLTV is a fixed ratio, and when a user’s Loan-to-Value (LTV) exceeds LLTV, their position is exposed to liquidation risk. At this time, Morpho’s liquidation line is set at 86%, just a step away from the 0.87 bottom line in the official unconditional exit. The 0.87 in Usual’s official announcement is just above Morpho’s 0.86 liquidation line. It can be likened to a final barrier set by the official to prevent systemic liquidation risks. The new update means many loans are now above the liquidation threshold. The situation is worsened by a hardcoded oracle, leading to an exodus of suppliers and a spike in borrow rates. Some users have called for on-chain hedging and liquidity buffers to mitigate such risks, emphasizing the importance of risk management in DeFi. Holders await further news next week There is still a lot of panic surrounding USD0++ in the market, but a majority of people have taken a cautious approach, holding their positions and waiting to see what happens. The market’s reasonable value for USD0++ is around 0.94, but all eyes are on official channels as people expect to hear detailed information on how the “unconditional exit” will burn and how much profit will be deducted next week. If the worst happens and Usual does not burn the anticipated 13 points next week and instead chooses to burn 0.5% of USUAL, then USD0++ could quickly re-peg to around 0.995. In short, the re-pegging of USD0++ is dependent on the burning details Usual is expected to announce next week. Regardless of how the final mechanism details are determined, holders of the tokens UsualX and USUAL are expected to benefit. The market’s exit method will decrease USUAL/USD0++ TVL, driving up the price of the USUAL token.

The proposal highlights Bitcoin’s historical growth and its potential as an inflation-resistant asset compared to traditional cash and bonds. Meta Shareholder Board to Consider Bitcoin Treasury? As per the proposal, by the end of the year 2024, that is, by December 30, the price of Bitcoin had increased by 124% in a year which was even better than the average performance of bonds. In the last five years, the price of Bitcoin has risen by 1,265%, while bonds have been a distant second with an average return difference of 1,245%. Amid this announcement, Bitcoin price has seen a recovery with the price swaying between an intra-day high and low of $95,770 and $92,250, respectively. The submission also points out that cash and cash equivalents (which account for $72 billion out of $256 billion of Meta’s total assets as of September 30, 2024) are vulnerable to depreciation owing to inflation. It posits that integrating a part of these cash reserves with Bitcoin may be a way of preserving shareholder value even with the known volatility of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Adoption Among Corporations and Institutions The proposal emphasizes the transition of Bitcoin from an investment or a payment method to a treasury asset for companies and institutions. MicroStrategy, a business that acquired Bitcoin early on, claimed that its equity rose by 17,000% through using BTC in its balance sheeting strategy. Likewise, Square (now Block) was 2.5 times better than the Nasdaq index and 12 times better than Meta’s performance. Moreover, BlackRock, the second biggest Meta’s institutional investor, has introduced a Bitcoin ETF that turned into the most popular ETF in history. BlackRock has also come out in public stating that 2% of investment in Bitcoin is a good approach towards investing for the future. The Meta shareholder’s proposal is that an allocation of this kind for Meta’s treasury could demonstrate progressive financial stewardship and be consistent with other leading companies. Support from Meta Leadership and Industry Trends According to the proposal, Meta’s leadership and its stakeholders have displayed interest in Bitcoin and its ecosystem. Meta’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and its board member Marc Andreessen who is also a member of Coinbase’s board has previously supported blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The shareholder argues that Meta shareholders should receive treasury management strategies that are similar to the sophisticated financial management strategies that most probably, some of Meta’s directors and executives have used. The submission also mentions several companies and governments considering Bitcoin or already implementing it in the treasuries. For example, a bill was recently submitted to the New Hampshire legislature , which provides for the ability of the state treasury to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset together with precious metals such as gold and silver. In the same way, public firms such as Heritage Distilling Holding Company and Genius Group Ltd have also embraced Bitcoin where Genius Group Ltd for instance purchased $5 million worth of bitcoins as part of its Bitcoin-first strategy. Request for Assessment and Fiduciary Duty The proposal calls on Meta’s board to perform an assessment to find out if it would be in the best interest of shareholders to include Bitcoin in Meta’s reserve. Thus, it postulates that as a fiduciary duty, the board should consider investments that can yield a return higher than cash and bonds, even if these investments are associated with higher risks. Meta has always been known as a technology leader and a pioneer of new approaches to business. The Meta shareholder argues that this will strengthen this reputation by making Meta as one fo the first corporations to embrace Bitcoin. The request is more of a proposition but does not require a particular action, which focuses on the need to evaluate the possibility of using Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Concurrently, John Deaton, a pro crypto lawyer has pointed out that Microsoft shareholders recently rejected the idea of investing in Bitcoin after a similar motion was made. Deaton further explained that Meta shareholders might find themselves in a similar situation but pointed out that companies that are waiting for future legislation that supports Bitcoin adoption such as the State Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) provisions in the Lummis Bill might view BTC as an acquisition of strategic importance.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping $1,500 after December nonfarm payrolls (NFP) exceeded forecasts. The stronger-than-expected labor market data, coupled with lower unemployment figures, put pressure on risk assets, including Bitcoin. Markets interpreted the results as reducing the likelihood of significant Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the near future. With less aggressive rate cuts anticipated, the potential for increased liquidity flowing into Bitcoin and other crypto assets diminished. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, the probability of even a modest 0.25% rate cut at the Fed’s January meeting stood at just 2.7%. Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, commented on the market reaction, stating: “NFP comes in HOT, the UNRATE comes in cold, which is great news for the strength of the economy, so why did BTC and the broader market dump? Simple. This points to fewer FED Rate Cuts in 2025.” Alan also noted the seasonal impact on the data and speculated that the incoming Trump administration might enact policies with significant economic implications. Liquidity data on Binance highlighted $88,000 and $90,000 as key support zones for BTC/USDT. Despite the macroeconomic dip, BTC maintained a familiar trading range, with clear support and resistance levels visible. Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades advised: “Market is either up only or down only on these smaller timeframes. In the end, many get chopped up. Zooming out is my recommendation.” Analyst Rekt Capital offered a bullish outlook, pointing to a bullish divergence in Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) and highlighting historical patterns in price discovery corrections. “It is the first Price Discovery Correction of this cycle.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS.

Dogecoin’s Meme Power Fuels a Potential 45% Rally Dogecoin, the original meme coin, is once again showing its strength, with analysts predicting a potential 45% rally. DOGE’s popularity remains fueled by its active community and endorsements from high-profile figures. Recent developments, including potential integrations with popular social media platforms and new utility cases, have bolstered investor sentiment. The surge in DOGE’s price can also be attributed to growing adoption for tipping and micropayments, a niche that aligns well with its low transaction fees and high accessibility. As market enthusiasm grows, DOGE continues to showcase its resilience and ability to capture investor attention. Toncoin (TON) Gains 15% Amid Ecosystem Expansion Toncoin has been going up, rising 15% as its sys͏tem keeps growing. TON’s ability to handle more users and its aim for shared talking platforms make it a tempting pick for builders and folks looking for privacy-focused options. With its smooth connection with apps like chatting and safe deals, TON is making a special spot in the blockchain area. The new price rise shows more use of TON’s traits, mainly in places where privacy and quickness are key. Experts think that as the Toncoin group expands, its worth will draw even greater notice from businesses and everyday investors too. Lightchain AI Rising Altcoin With Strong Investor Appeal While DOGE and TON dominate short-term headlines, Lightchain AI is emerging as a game-changing altcoin with long-term potential. The project’s presale success reflects strong investor confidence in its roadmap, which focuses on solving real-world challenges through blockchain and AI integration. Lightchain AI emphasizes developer-focused initiatives, offering grants, resources, and a sandbox environment to encourage innovation. These programs aim to accelerate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps), driving the platform’s adoption and utility. Also the price of Lightchain AI’s token , LCAI, remains relatively low compared to its peers, making it an affordable entry point for investors. As the project gains traction and more partnerships are announced, analysts predict that the demand for LCAI will rise significantly.

Current price projections for prominent assets are capturing the attention of traders and the market. The Binance Coin (BNB) price forecast shows a measured optimism, with expectations to challenge the $750 resistance while holding support at $680. Concurrently, the Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction for 2025 offers a nuanced view, poised between promising growth and the looming specter of regulatory obstacles. Both digital assets demonstrate the typical market dynamics of facing challenges while spotting opportunities. Moreover, the advanced technologies of EVM and WASM are thrusting BlockDAG (BDAG) into prominence among top crypto coins for 2025. With a robust presale raising over $178.5 million and vibrant ecosystem growth, BlockDAG highlights its unique capabilities and potential for adoption. This positions BDAG as an enticing option for those seeking impactful market engagement. BNB Price Maintains Optimism Amidst Challenges The BNB price forecast reveals an optimistic yet watchful stance, with the digital currency currently valued at $708. Market analysts anticipate that a continuous upward trend might elevate BNB to between $750 and $800, assuming stability above the 21-day SMA. Yet, the $750 resistance level has consistently hindered further gains. Should downward pressures intensify, the BNB price forecast alerts to a potential drop to $635 or below if support levels falter. Recent market analysis indicates a price movement confined between $680 and $720, restricted by the prevailing moving averages. The BNB price forecast underscores the necessity for a clear surge to clarify its future direction as the market looks forward to what lies ahead. AVAX Price Outlook Reflects Promising Yet Cautious Future The Avalanche price prediction portrays a varied forecast for 2025, with analysts emphasizing factors influencing its market trajectory. Price expectations range from $50 to $150, shaped by market dynamics and how broadly the Avalanche network is embraced. Notable improvements within decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are expected to substantially bolster AVAX’s market value. The Avalanche price prediction also stresses the critical role of network scalability and compatibility. As the platform continues to attract a wider array of dApps and users, its value is anticipated to climb. However, analysts caution about the effects of competition from other blockchain platforms and the uncertainty of regulatory environments, presenting ongoing challenges. Regardless of the outcome, Avalanche is positioned as an essential asset within the crypto arena. The Catalysts Behind BDAG’s Rising Value: EVM and WASM Technologies BlockDAG is making waves with its integration of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), paving the way for potential price rises in BDAG. These technologies allow for the smooth transition of Ethereum-based dApps and expand the developer pool by supporting a variety of programming languages, including Rust and C++. This positions BlockDAG as a strong contender among top crypto coins for 2025. Currently, at a price of $0.0248, the BlockDAG crypto presale has collected $178.5 million, with 17.7 billion BDAG coins distributed since its start. Early supporters have seen an ROIof 2,380%, highlighting its strong market presence. EVM compatibility facilitates an easy switch for Ethereum developers, and WASM enhances functionality and scalability for demanding applications such as gaming and DeFi. BlockDAG’s comprehensive roadmap bolsters BDAG’s prospects for a significant price rise post-launch. Analysts predict a potential price point of $1 by 2025, a testament to its technological prowess and ecosystem expansion. With the presale’s 27th batch concluding soon, it’s a pivotal time for traders. The synergy of BlockDAG’s EVM and WASM is attracting both developers and buyers, positioning BDAG as a top crypto acquisition. Early entrants are anticipated to see substantial returns as the project approaches its $600 million funding goal. Last Verdict The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, with key assets following unique paths. The Binance Coin (BNB) price forecast shows a hopeful outlook, underlining the need to surpass resistance levels for further growth. Likewise, the Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction presents a mixed view, weighing optimistic network adoption against the hurdles of competition and regulatory concerns. Both assets illustrate the intricate journey through the crypto market of 2025. For those scouting the best crypto buys in 2025, BlockDAG distinguishes itself with a community-centric strategy, a promising ecosystem, and a direct trajectory toward a price goal of $1. BlockDAG’s integration of EVM and WASM not only solidifies its role as a burgeoning project but also furnishes utility and scalability that meet market expectations. These elements merge to offer a distinct opportunity for proactive crypto traders.

So, what are the best altcoins to buy right now? We’ve put together a shortlist of promising altcoin projects that have shown bullish price action over the last few weeks, as well as boasting strong use cases or price catalysts for the immediate future. Let’s take a look at the best altcoins in January 2025. Table of Contents What are the best altcoins to buy now? 1. Sui (SUI) 2. Bitget Token (BGB) 3. ai16z (AI16Z) 4. Tokenize Xchange (TKX) 5. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Choosing the best altcoins to buy FAQ What are the best altcoins to buy now? Before we begin, it’s worth noting that nobody can tell you which assets you should or should not invest in. What are your investment goals? What’s your risk appetite? It’s crucial to develop your own investment strategy, including profit targets and stop loss targets, before making any important financial decisions. Yes, the following altcoins could potentially be a welcome addition to the right crypto portfolio once. However, the best altcoins to buy right now are really those coins that best suit your personal trading needs! So make sure you have a clear idea of what you’re after when diving into the world of cryptocurrency altcoins. You might also like: How to build a crypto portfolio: everything you need to know 1. Sui (SUI) SUI, the native token for the Sui ( SUI ) L1 blockchain built to support dApp development, is a popular high-cap altcoin that has seen upward momentum in recent weeks. Late last year, SUI was added to the list of assets traded by the Grayscale investment firm, boosting the coin’s profile and prestige within the industry. SUI rose 31% in the past month and 13% in the last week, now standing at #13 in the market cap rankings. You might also like: Charts of the week: SUI rallies 13%, Uniswap bleeds, what to expect 2. Bitget Token (BGB) Bitget Token is seeing an excellent month with over 108% gains so far and 9% growth over the last 7 days. Bitget Token ( BGB ) benefits from its attachment to the heavy hitting Bitget Wallet project. The token also provides real-world utility within the Bitget ecosystem by offering discounted trading fees, early access to new proects, staking rewards, and free withdrawals. All of the above have contributed to healthy demand for BGB token which looks to have bullish trading activity at the time of writing. 3. ai16z (AI16Z) While we’re often loathe to include meme coins in lists like these, the Solana ecosystem meme coin ai16z gets a mention here for demonstrating strong upward momentum over the last month, capped off with a price correction in the past week. ai16z ( AI16Z ) grew 120% this month before pulling back 26% in the past week, a formidable price drop that could signal that the price is consolidating for another rally. Of course, further research is needed to identify real-time price indicators that might suit your particular trading strategy. However, the confluence of a major increase followed by a lesser pullback certainly creates some of the conditions that can, in some cases, favor a bull run.

Tokenize Xchange (TKX) One promising altcoin that may not be on everyone’s radar at the moment is the coin for the Tokenize Xchange crypto exchange based in Singapore. Tokenize Xchange ( TKX ) coin has risen 144% in the last month, with a 13% pullback in the last 7 days that potentially leaves room for another price increase. The coin offers utility by providing discounted trading fees on the Tokenized Xchange platform. This is a tried and tested method for adding value to a crypto coin, as seen with the roaring success of Binance’s native BNB token. 5. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Virtuals Protocol is a blockchain-powered AI platform that allows users to release autonomous AI ‘agents pre-programmed to handle a variety of tasks. If this rings a bell, it’s because Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) is establishing itself as a direct competitor to the immensely popular Fetch.AI project that is now collaborating with the government of Munich and making major waves in the crypto space. Virtuals Protocol is targeting a fairly niche area of the blockchain industry with few competitors and a lot of potential value, and it’s likely that the hype over the coin’s potential is behind the recent 79% jump in value over the last month, despite a 29% pullback this week. Choosing the best altcoins to buy When evaluating the right altcoin to buy, there are a few things to consider. The health and reputation of a project and its staff is always important, and can be partially gauged by checking news stories and social media posts around the project. Projects with anonymous staff, for example, are sometimes regarded with more caution due to the perceived risk of them acting in bad faith, while projects with staff that have a good track record in business might soothe some of those concerns for potential investors. The use case and viability of a project, such as the intended purpose of its native cryptocurrency and blockchain network, should arguably be the deciding factor. Projects that have demonstrated a real-world use case are often seen as more viable than projects whose product is still theoretical.

That’s the vibe as meme coins like Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) make waves, all while BTFD Coin (BTFD) emerges as the newest powerhouse with staking rewards and a presale buzz that’s hard to ignore. Meme coins aren’t just internet jokes anymore—they’ve become a cultural and financial phenomenon. While PNUT rebounds from a $0.50 low and GOAT holds steady with impressive market metrics, BTFD is taking the meme coin world by storm with a 90% APY on staking and a presale that’s raked in over $5.1 million. So, what makes these coins worth a spot in your portfolio? Let’s dive into the unique narratives driving these top new meme coins to invest in today. BTFD Coin: The Ultimate Staking Opportunity BTFD Coin—short for “ Buy The Dip ”—is more than just a catchy name; it’s a movement. Built on Ethereum, BTFD is designed to capitalize on market volatility, flipping every dip into a launchpad for gains. But what sets BTFD apart is its jaw-dropping 90% APY staking rewards. Imagine this: You invest $650 in Stage 13 of the presale, where BTFD is priced at $0.000142 per coin. That buys you over 4.57 million tokens. When BTFD hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006, your investment could balloon to nearly $2,742. Now add the potential of staking rewards. With 90% APY, your BTFD stash could double in a year, offering returns most projects can only dream about. What’s more, BTFD isn’t just about individual gains—it’s about community. With over 8000 holders already, the “Bulls” are charging ahead, turning this token into a collective force in the market. BTFD’s 90% APY Staking: A New Era of Crypto Earning BTFD Coin is turning heads with its groundbreaking 90% annual percentage yield staking program, offering investors the chance to grow their holdings exponentially. This isn’t just about holding tokens—it’s about making your crypto work for you. The process is simple: stake your BTFD tokens once claimed and start earning immediately. With rewards that compound over time, staking becomes a powerful tool for long-term growth. This program isn’t just lucrative for investors; it strengthens the BTFD ecosystem by promoting token stability and reducing sell-offs. With $5.1 million raised and over 63 billion tokens sold in its presale, BTFD’s staking feature is proving to be a key driver of its success. For anyone seeking top new meme coins to invest in today, BTFD’s 90% APY staking program is the opportunity you don’t want to miss. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): The Rebound King If there’s a meme coin to watch, it’s Peanut the Squirrel. PNUT has clawed its way back from a $0.50 dip to $0.70, fueled by significant whale accumulation. One standout transaction saw a whale snag 10 million tokens, worth $6.1 million—roughly 1% of the total supply. PNUT’s resurgence has also captured futures traders’ attention, with open interest surging 35% to $223 million. This shows that PNUT isn’t just a retail favorite; institutional players are taking notice too. And with analysts hinting at a potential rally toward the $1 mark, PNUT is proving it’s not just a flash in the pan. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): A Meme Coin with Staying Power Goatseus Maximus, or GOAT, is living up to its name. Trading at $0.54 with a market cap of $538 million, GOAT has solidified its position as a meme coin heavyweight. Its 24-hour trading volume of $128 million underscores its liquidity and active community. GOAT’s success is partly thanks to its origin story. Designed by the Truth Terminal AI, GOAT blends internet culture with cutting-edge tech. Listed on major exchanges like HTX and OKX, it’s not just surviving—it’s thriving. And while its all-time high of $1.03 may seem distant, GOAT’s steady metrics suggest it’s here for the long haul. How to Buy BTFD Ready to jump on the BTFD bandwagon? Here’s how: Set up your wallet. Get started with MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Keep your private key secure. Load your wallet. Add BNB or ETH to your wallet. Connect your wallet. Head to the presale page and link your wallet. Buy BTFD. Choose your currency, enter the amount, and confirm the transaction. Claim your tokens. Once the presale ends, claim your $BTFD coins. Stay updated. Keep an eye on staking rewards and token unlocks. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, these top new meme coins to invest in today are more than just hype. BTFD Coin stands out with its 90% APY staking rewards and a P2E game that’s redefining earning potential in crypto. Meanwhile, PNUT’s rebound and GOAT’s solid metrics make them strong contenders in the meme coin race. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio, now’s the time to consider these rising stars.

Ethereum Has Appeared To Be Moving Inside An Ascending Channel Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed a pattern that Ethereum has potentially been following recently. The pattern in question is the “Ascending Channel” from technical analysis (TA). Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Turns Red: More Decline Coming? Parallel Channels form when the price of an asset consolidates between two parallel trendlines. The upper level of the channel is drawn by connecting successive tops, while the lower one joins bottoms. This pattern can take three orientations: positive slope, negative slope, and zero slope. In the first of these, the trendlines track a phase of consolidation toward the upside, and the pattern is known as an Ascending Channel. Similarly, in the second, the price trends downward, with the formation being called a Descending Channel. The third type, where the trendlines are parallel to the time-axis, doesn’t have any particular name. Like other consolidation patterns in TA, the upper line of a Parallel Channel is likely to pose resistance to the price, while the lower one may act as a point of support. Breaks above either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction; an escape above the channel is bullish, and a fall under it is bearish. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Ascending Channel that Ethereum has possibly been trading inside during the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum price retested the upper level of this channel during the rally in the first quarter of last year. The cryptocurrency found rejection at the level and started on a downward trajectory that would eventually force it to retest the lower line. ETH spent a bit of time making multiple touches of the line during the retest, but the pattern ended up holding up as the coin achieved a rebound. The resulting rally couldn’t take the price to the upper level, however, as it, in fact, fizzled out only mid-way through the journey. The asset has since been on a decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Not Reached ‘Extreme Euphoria’ Phase Yet, Glassnode Reveals Interestingly, a similar pattern was also witnessed in 2023, where a rejection halfway through the channel led Ethereum to a retest of the bottom line, which kickstarted the bull run. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted how ETH’s upcoming price trend could look if a similar trajectory follows now as well. “If Ethereum $ETH is following an ascending parallel channel, a dip to the lower boundary at $2,800 could act as a launchpad for a move toward $6,000,” notes the analyst. From the current price of the cryptocurrency, a bull rally to this $6,000 final target would imply growth of almost 82%. ETH Price Ethereum has been unable to make any notable recovery from its recent plunge yet as its price is still trading around $3,300.

Peck indicated that Meta’s cash reserve is highly affected by inflation and could lose up to 28% of its cash assets. He urged that Bitcoin has performed well as a store of value over the past five years, beating bonds by almost 1,262%. Peck also wrote in the proposal: Mark Zuckerberg named his goats ‘Bitcoin’ and ‘Max.’ Meta director Marc Andreessen has praised Bitcoin and is also a director at Coinbase. Do Meta shareholders not deserve the same kind of responsible asset allocation for the Company that Meta directors and executives likely implement for themselves? ~Ethan Peck Peck submitted the request to Meta on behalf of its family shares Peck is not new to submitting such requests due to his professional background. He is part of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a renowned think tank in Washington, D.C., that promotes market policies to various institutions and relevant government agencies. His agency, The National Center for Public Policy Research, has submitted similar proposals, including the Bitcoin treasury shareholder proposals to Microsoft and Amazon in 2024. However, Peck has spelt out that his current proposal is submitted to Meta on behalf of his family’s shares. In his proposal, he justified his quest by leveraging submissions made by relevant entities. He said that BlackRock, Meta’s second-largest institutional shareholder, “advised that a 2% BTC allocation is reasonable.” Most traditional tech firms are uncomfortable with establishing a Bitcoin reserve The Washington, D.C. think-tank submission that recommended that Microsoft convert 1% of its $484 billion assets to Bitcoin didn’t succeed. At a December 10 meeting, Microsoft shareholders shot down the proposal via a vote. A day before the Microsoft proposal was shut down, The National Center for Public Policy Research suggested the same BTC corporate treasury diversification strategy to Amazon shareholders. The outcome of the Amazon proposal will be announced in April 2025, when shareholders will meet to discuss several issues. In the proposal, the organization argued that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) — a measure of inflation based on baskets of household goods — is a poor gauge of inflation and suggested that the true inflation rate is double the CPI. Bitcoin’s volatility might be the reason tech firms are preventing themselves from allocating part of their cash assets into Bitcoin reserves.

YBIT's synthetic covered call strategy limits upside potential, resulting in flat returns since it launched despite Bitcoin's significant gains. YBIT has also lagged behind more traditional income products like T-bills and corporate bonds, questioning its viability as an income investment. Given its performance, I see no compelling reason to choose YBIT over alternative investment options for income or Bitcoin exposure. After providing Seeking Alpha readers with my favorite way to play the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rise to $100,000 per coin back in early-November, the long-awaited psychological six-figure number has come and gone not once, but twice. More recently, through coverage of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ), I've explored how close we might be to a price top for this cycle and the recent trends in network scaling and development . My current view is that Bitcoin's 2024 halving epoch has yet to reach its price climax. Today, we're going to take a different angle on Bitcoin's potential rise to new highs in 2025; how to not play that move. YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy YieldMax products have become increasingly more popular in recent years, specifically with investors who want 'high-yielding' income products. I've explored several of these products in the past and I think it would be accurate to call my coverage of these types of funds somewhat polarizing. Some of the critiques of my YieldMax fund analysis have been fair and other critiques much less so, from where I sit. In my initial coverage of the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF ( YBIT ) we'll assess whether or not the fund fails against three different strategies. First, the fund details: Inception: 4//22/24 Expense Ratio: 0.99% AUM: $110 million 30 Day SEC Yield: 1.92% Rather than simply buying and holding Bitcoin, the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF utilizes a synthetic covered call strategy to produce income for shareholders as a primary objective. The secondary objective of the fund is to offer exposure to the share price gains from the Bitcoin investment products that the fund trades through the aforementioned options. Though it should be noted that upside is limited due to the nature of the covered call strategy. Data by YCharts The fund does indeed pay out large monthly dividends to shareholders. The question is whether or not the total return to shareholders justifies investment. Performance Against BTC Income Peers YieldMax is not the only fund that aims to provide investors income from Bitcoin options strategies. Other such funds include the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF ( MAXI ), the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ), and the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ). Of these funds, YBIT is among the newest having less than a year in the market: Fund Details YBIT MAXI BTCI YBTC Inception 04/22/2024 09/29/2022 10/16/2024 01/17/2024 Expense Ratio 0.99% 6.10% 0.98% 0.95% AUM $110.17M $56.92M $49.00M $93.89M Source: Seeking Alpha One clear standout from this table is the enormous expense ratio from MAXI. As far as I can tell, this is due to that fund having a far more complex strategy than the other three products. Given such a large management fee, one might reasonably expect YBIT to outperform MAXI over time. So far, that has simply not been the case: Total Return (Seeking Alpha) Since inception, YBIT investors are flat while each of the competing high-yield Bitcoin options ETFs have generated more than a 20% total return. Not only has YBIT under-performed against MAXI since YBIT's April inception, but it has also failed to keep up with BTCI and more recently with YBTC. And again, this is showing total return, not price performance. Anyone who bought YBIT the day it was launched has essentially broken even, in spite of Bitcoin returning over 38% over the same time period. Of course, not every YBIT shareholder bought the fund the day it launched. Even for savvy investors who opportunistically bought the early-September price low, the fund has under-performed: Data by YCharts Comparing YieldMax funds to the underlying assets used in the options strategy has been a point of some contention. The chart above shows that YBIT has under-performed both Bitcoin and MAXI - the latter of which is a fund that figures to be competing with YBIT for the same type of investor. Here's an important question that I would challenge fans of these instruments to consider; if nailing bottoms in the price of the underlying asset is such an important determining factor in generating a total return that will still ultimately lag the underlying asset, what is the point of buying the income instrument? Performance Against A Simple Profit-Taking Strategy In the comments section of my last YieldMax article, Jamie Ellis had what I felt to be the most fair critique of my analysis. He and I seem to have an agreement on the very real draw-down risk of funds like YBIT. In that critique, he raised a very interesting point about how these funds compare to profit-taking strategies in the underlying assets. For instance, we know how YBIT has performed since its inception and more recently since Bitcoin's September lows. What is less obvious is whether or not YBIT total returns have outperformed a basic profit-taking strategy in a similarly weighted iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) position. The table below assumes an initial investment of $100,000 in YBIT shares at the closing price of $20.45 on April 23rd, 2024 for 4,890 shares. Our YBIT share count remains consistent, but in the far right column I'm showing the month end total value of the investment of those 4,890 shares with the cumulative dividend payouts from each month. YBIT Month End Closing Share Price Position Value YBIT Payout Share Value + Cumulative Payouts April $18.55 $90,709 $0 $90,709 May $20.57 $100,587 $0 $100,587 June $17.01 $83,178 $6,703 $89,881 July $16.28 $79,609 $5,948 $92,260 August $13.80 $67,482 $3,279 $83,411 September $13.78 $67,384 $3,529 $86,842 October $12.25 $59,902 $7,185 $86,545 November $13.85 $67,726 $6,183 $100,552 December $12.37 $60,489 $3,466 $96,781 Source: YieldMax, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations Simply taking the distributions from holding YBIT would have resulted in a small investment loss at the end of 2024 with share value and cumulative payouts totaling under $97,000 - below the initial $100,000 investment in April. And this is before any potential taxes on distributions. How would investors have performed if they instead bought $100,000 in IBIT and reduced their positions by 3% each month on the day of YBIT's ex-dividend date? In the table below, we're assuming 2,638 shares of IBIT purchased at $37.90 in April. YBIT Ex-Div Date IBIT Share Close IBIT Share Value at Ex-Date 3% IBIT Reduction New Share Count 6/6/24 $40.16 $105,963 $3,179 2559 7/5/24 $32.20 $82,412 $2,549 2480 8/7/24 $31.19 $77,358 $2,321 2406 9/6/24 $30.41 $73,161 $2,195 2334 10/3/24 $34.72 $81,024 $2,431 2264 10/31/24 $39.78 $90,047 $2,701 2196 11/29/27 $55.21 $121,225 $3,637 2130 12/27/24 $53.68 $114,330 $3,430 2066 Source: YieldMax, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations At the end of December, the remaining 2,066 shares of IBIT had a market value of over $109k dollars. This is in addition to the $22.4k in cumulative sales from our 3% reductions on YBIT's ex-divi dates. Even if we get more aggressive and reduce IBIT positions by 6% on YBIT ex-dividend days, we still get a better total return in the IBIT position: YBIT Ex-Div Date IBIT Share Close IBIT Share Value at Ex-Date 6% IBIT Reduction New Share Count 6/6/24 $40.16 $105,963 $6,358 2480 7/5/24 $32.20 $79,863 $5,098 2322 8/7/24 $31.19 $72,420 $4,345 2183 9/6/24 $30.41 $66,372 $3,982 2052 10/3/24 $34.72 $71,233 $4,274 1929 10/31/24 $39.78 $76,717 $4,603 1813 11/29/27 $55.21 $100,086 $6,005 1704 12/27/24 $53.68 $91,473 $5,488 1602 Source: YieldMax, Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculations The 1,602 remaining shares at the end of December have a valuation of $85k, and we've locked in over $40k in realized sales. I must stress that we're not re-investing the dividends from YBIT in this exercise. Doing so would defeat the purpose of comparing YBIT distributions to a profit-taking strategy in a spot ETF. Furthermore, if an investor was actually utilizing the dividend payments from YBIT as a genuine form of income, we shouldn't expect reinvestment anyway, in my estimation. To be fair to YBIT, trading and dividend history for this fund are limited since it is less than a year old. Additionally, most investors likely did not purchase YBIT on launch day. Some have perhaps been lucky enough to buy the lows. While we don't have the amount of data we'd likely want to draw a definitive conclusion on this, so far it has clearly made more sense to take off chunks in IBIT for income rather than holding YBIT since inception, dollars being equal. Especially if one is holding these products in a tax-advantaged account. Performance Against More Traditional 'Income' Now that we can see YBIT has under-performed against both similar products from peers and a simple profit-taking strategy through a spot ETF, we can add a third method for good measure; YBIT vs more traditional income products. To be clear, I've long-held the view that calling YieldMax products 'income investments' is generous. Rather, my view has been that these are raw speculative investments masquerading as income products. But, if we wish to consider a fund that has broken even after eight and half months of market performance to an 'income product,' let's compare YBIT to T-bills and corporate bonds: Data by YCharts The chart above shows the performance of YBIT against the WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund ( USFR ) and the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF ( HYG ). YBIT Holdings as of 1/10/25 (YieldMax) Despite more than half of the YBIT NAV currently sitting in government debt, I happen to think HYG is the far better comp here because the market price of the fund has far more fluctuation on a day-to-day basis than that of USFR. Regardless, YBIT has under-performed both corporate bonds and short term T-bills since its April inception from a total return standpoint. Closing Summary No matter which barometer you choose, YBIT has not been a lucrative investment product. I'll offer some self-reflection; I think one of the mistakes I've made in covering YieldMax products in the past is that I've come off as telling people what to do or what to think. That is not my intention. I'm just sharing what I do and how I think. Readers seemed particularly triggered by my statement that the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) was ""not suitable for income investors."" Surely, that's my opinion and other investors may feel differently. But I can't imagine income investors want their high-income investments to occasionally sniff 30% total losses within 5 months of purchase. That is the risk in funds like YBIT. The fund loses against more traditional income funds. It loses against other Bitcoin options income funds. And it loses against a scheduled profit taking strategy from longing Bitcoin through spot ETFs. I'm failing to see a good reason to long YBIT over alternatives.",BTC-USD|IBIT|YBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-11 03:58:27

Insights on Polkadot & Bitcoin Cash!,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bays-token-prices-are-climbing-fast-secure-yours-now-for-up-to-6430-returns-insights-on-polkadot-bitcoin-cash/,"What if the next evolution of online marketplaces was governed by the collective, not by corporate giants? As Polkadot’s technical enhancements capture attention and Bitcoin Cash remains a staple in the crypto dialogue, there’s a noticeable pivot towards consumer-owned e-commerce models. Leading this shift is Web3Bay (3BAY), which confronts traditional centralized platforms like eBay by offering a decentralized venue where users have a stake in the enterprise. Holding 3BAY tokens means more than shopping—it’s about influencing the future of the marketplace. With governance privileges and unique discounts, Web3Bay offers a new approach to e-commerce. These benefits are available during its presale, making now a key time to get involved. Web3Bay: A Leading Choice in Crypto Today Web3Bay is fundamentally altering the landscape of online shopping by converting every user into an investor and decision-maker. This model contrasts sharply with centralized behemoths like eBay, which restrict user input in governance. Through 3BAY tokens, Web3Bay grants its community governance rights, allowing them to steer the marketplace and benefit from exclusive purchase discounts. This fusion of consumer participation and ownership transforms the e-commerce experience, prioritizing user involvement and value. The ongoing presale of 3BAY tokens initially offered at $0.0039675 and escalating through 25 subsequent phases, represents a prime investment opportunity. To date, the sale has attracted substantial interest, evidenced by over 133 million tokens sold and more than $580,000 raised. Those who join early stand to see potentially substantial returns, with predictions of up to 6430% as token prices peak at $0.1959 in the final phase. This structured approach to the presale underscores the benefit of early participation. Beyond the sale of tokens, Web3Bay’s strategic plan includes expanding features such as governance involvement and future integrations like PayPal compatibility. More than just a marketplace, Web3Bay is cultivating a movement towards communal economic empowerment. For investors and participants looking to make an impact, this presents a timely opportunity to explore one of the best performing cryptos. Polkadot Price Prediction: What Lies Ahead for DOT? Polkadot continues to draw interest with its state-of-the-art blockchain architecture that facilitates smooth interoperability among diverse networks. A significant upgrade, Agile Coretime, has recently taken the place of the older auction protocol, enabling developers to directly acquire core network time. This adjustment boosts accessibility for various projects, underscoring Polkadot’s dedication to its ecosystem’s growth. With nearly half of DOT’s supply actively staked, the network’s stability is reinforced. Anticipations for Polkadot’s 2025 price hover between $11 and $32, potentially climbing to $40 influenced by wider market movements. Projections for 2030 estimate an average price of around $68, with the possibility of reaching up to $75, highlighting the currency’s potential for sustained growth as its ecosystem matures. Bitcoin Cash News: The Rising Profile of BCH Bitcoin Cash continues to assert its presence in the cryptocurrency arena, focusing on enhancing transaction speeds and reducing costs, distinguishing it notably from Bitcoin. Recent coverage points to its escalating appeal in South Korea, where it now ranks fifth among cryptocurrencies, even surpassing major names like Solana and Cardano in regional popularity. The shift of interest towards new tokens like 1Fuel also reflects BCH’s enduring relevance. With a current valuation of $435.97, BCH has maintained stability through fluctuating market conditions. Its broad adoption and practical applications, especially in Asia, help solidify its standing. As it continues to evolve and maintain market engagement, Bitcoin Cash represents a robust option for investors looking for utility and community support. In Conclusion Both Polkadot and Bitcoin Cash are cementing their roles within their respective sectors—Polkadot with its innovative staking and network improvements, and Bitcoin Cash with its expanding global footprint. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is revolutionizing the approach to online commerce with its community-driven, decentralized model. Having already raised substantial funds through its token presale, and with expectations for further growth, Web3Bay stands out as the best performing crypto investment today.

Grewal’s remarks came after Coinbase encountered redacted and incomplete responses from the FDIC, which raised questions about the agency’s transparency. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal Calls Out FDIC In a series of posts on X , Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal has outlined concerns about the FDIC’s process in responding to FOIA requests. He claimed that the FDIC did not perform full-text searches in its Regional Automated Document Distribution (RADD) database. In addition, the agency reportedly denied the requests for documents that were stored in collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams, thus restricting the range of the disclosed data. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal also pointed to specific guidelines in the FDIC’s instructions that required setting some documents as deliberative or attorney-client privileged, which he argues was done to avoid sharing them. Additionally, Coinbase found that at least 150 documents that are potentially related to the case were not included in the FOIA replies provided by the FDIC. Grewal pointed out these loopholes as a cause of concern in the agency’s accountability. The FDIC representatives answered saying, “Considering the increase in the scope of your requests, we shall need time to deliberate on your communication and provide our response.” Concerns About FDIC’s Use of “Pause Letters” The controversy includes the FDIC’s use of “pause letters” sent to banks, urging them to halt services to cryptocurrency clients. Coinbase alleges these letters were later redacted heavily under FOIA Exemption 8, which protects sensitive financial regulatory matters. Paul Grewal claims the exemption was misused to hide information that was not initially considered confidential. The letters allegedly focused on issues like cryptocurrency lending, stablecoins and blockchain based payment systems. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal noted that such actions posed legal risks for compliant crypto businesses since banks were not provided with explanations for the restrictions. Operation Choke Point 2.0 Allegations Resurface This has brought back the conversation about the ‘ Operation Choke Point 2.0’ which was a term used to explain the claims of regulators to deny banking services to cryptocurrency companies. The critics have ascribed the FDIC and other regulators to covertly forcing the banks to shy away from processing crypto transactions using the cover of compliance. The letters, which were written in 2022 and 2023, showed that the FDIC instructed the banks to cease services on different cryptocurrency products but had not given further instructions afterwards. Critics have claimed that this has slowed down innovation and prevented the expansion of financial services within the crypto industry. Similarly, some of the comments made by Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal have elicited reactions from other legal and political personalities such as Senator John E. Deaton. Deaton called for more supervision, and noted that the danger of officials discretionarily cutting off access to financial networks cannot be overlooked. The Coinbase CLO also pointed out that the FDIC should answer clearly as the information disclosed should be made public to ensure that all industries are treated equally, including the cryptocurrency industry.

Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 04:15:00

Although the short-term price action appears messy, it’s important to understand that XRP is currently experiencing a local pullback within a broader corrective phase. While the market is consolidating, this creates an interesting scenario for possible future moves. Triangle Pattern Nearing Completion The key chart development for XRP is the triangle pattern that has been in play since December 3. After more than a month of price action, the pattern could soon complete, triggering a price move. Whether this breakout is to the upside or downside remains to be seen, but the next move could happen at any moment. Short-Term Price Action and Key Levels In a bullish scenario, XRP could see an upside breakout. However, it may still dip lower before completing the triangle pattern. On the other hand, the bearish scenario suggests a deeper pullback before confirming a breakdown. While a move down looks more like a corrective pullback, it could still present an opportunity for consolidation before an upside breakout. Key Support and Invalidation Levels The critical support area to watch lies between $2.29 and $2.23. If XRP breaks below $2.29, it could test the key invalidation level at $1.96, which corresponds to the swing low from December 20. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.33 level and is up by more than two percent in the last 24 hours. Fibonacci Levels to Watch Before testing the $1.96 level, XRP must navigate several key Fibonacci levels. These levels, between $2.23 and $2.24, are important to watch for signs of a potential bounce or further decline. A strong reaction at these levels would provide more clarity on whether XRP is setting up for a breakout or breakdown. Breakout Confirmation Levels For an upside breakout, XRP needs to break above the green line at $2.50. This would be the first confirmation level of a breakout. However, to fully confirm the breakout, XRP must surpass the high of the D-wave.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-11 04:35:13

The Office of the Attorney General for Washington State accuses T-Mobile of violating the state’s Consumer Protection Act by deceiving customers about its ability to protect their data even though the firm knew for years that its cybersecurity systems did not meet industry standards. Attorney General Bob Ferguson also alleges that T-Mobile understated the impact of the data breach by neglecting to mention all the information that had been stolen when it sent notices to customers affected by the exploit. “This significant data breach was entirely avoidable. T-Mobile had years to fix key vulnerabilities in its cybersecurity systems – and it failed.” Ferguson says that in August of 2021, T-Mobile became aware of a cybersecurity incident that compromised the data of over 79 million Americans including their phone numbers, names, addresses, driver’s license records along with other personal information. The attorney general also says the hack siphoned the data of 2,025,634 Washington residents, including 183,406 customers who had their Social Security numbers exposed. According to court documents, T-Mobile was in the dark about the hack for many months until it received a tip that its customers’ data were being sold on the dark web. Says the press release, “The data breach began in March 2021 and continued until August 12, 2021. Due to a lack of adequate security monitoring, according to the lawsuit, T-Mobile was unaware of the breach until an anonymous outside source notified the company that its customers’ data was posted for sale on the dark web.” Ferguson says before the 2021 hack, T-Mobile had witnessed “numerous cyberattacks” and knew it would continue to be a target as early as 2020 based on a U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) filing. However, he alleges that the firm did not do anything to address gaps in its systems while reassuring customers on its website that their data was safe by stating: “We’ve got your back. We’re always working to protect you and your family and keep your data secure.” The attorney general also alleges that T-Mobile used easy-to-guess passwords, making it simple for thieves to access the firm’s customer records. “The 2021 breach was enabled, in part, when the hacker guessed obvious credentials to gain access to T-Mobile’s internal databases.” Additionally, Ferguson accuses T-Mobile of misleading customers about the severity of the breach as the firm removed “critical and legally required information” when it issued notices via text messages. “Current customers whose Social Security numbers were exposed did not receive any information regarding that exposure.” The attorney general is asking the court to impose civil penalties on T-Mobile while seeking restitution for Washington residents affected by the hack. He is also seeking injunctive relief to force the firm to revamp its cybersecurity systems and be more transparent when communicating with customers.

All the Bitcoins were mined exclusively from its US-based operations. The latest figure reflects a 236% year-over-year (YoY) increase in its Bitcoin holdings. CleanSpark Hits Milestone Zach Bradford, CEO and President of the firm attributed the milestone to the company’s strategic focus on efficient and responsible scaling, emphasizing the use of American energy and workforce to support its mining operations. In a statement , Gary Vecchiarelli, Chief Financial Officer of CleanSpark, said, This achievement is not just about a number, it is a direct reflection of the success of our financial strategy and how far our industry-leading operations have come, which have evolved since we mined our first bitcoin in December 2021. By avoiding unfavorable counterparty exposure and leveraging our bitcoin to lower our cost of capital, we are positioning CleanSpark as a leader in responsible financial innovation.” According to data compiled by BitcoinTreasuries, CleanSpark trails behind other mining firms such as MARA Holdings, which holds 44,893 BTC, and Riot Platforms, with 17,722 BTC. On the other hand, CleanSpark is followed by Florida-based miner Hut 8 Mining, which currently has 10,096 BTC. Miners Prioritize Holding Bitcoin To cover operational expenses, Bitcoin miners often sell portions of their mined Bitcoin. However, firms such as MARA Holdings prioritize retaining their BTC reserves. Its CEO, Fred Thiel, recently said that retail investors should consider buying Bitcoin and just let the crypto asset appreciate in value. It recently lent 7,377 BTC to third parties, which was worth around $730 million at the time of the deal, for small yields. CleanSpark, too, appears to have followed a similar strategy. In 2024, the firm mined 7,024 BTC but sold only 12.65 BTC in December, preserving most of its holdings. This sentiment is also depicted in a recent report which indicated that Bitcoin miners have significantly slowed their sales since April 2024. While a brief uptick in exchange flows occurred in November 2024 due to a post-election BTC price surge, miners have since reduced profit-taking. With current profitability, these miners have resorted to holding their Bitcoin over selling the stash.

It’s common to assume that if a project is good enough for a venture fund, it must be good enough for a user. After all, would something so big and rich fail to perform due diligence? Sadly, money does not always equal security and some users had to find that out the hard way. Despite having access to powerful mechanisms, ‘money people’ are not usually experts in Web 3.0 security. To put it simply, they won’t know where to look. So, even if a project might be safe from a rug pull or malicious actions from within the company (that they would likely check), it might fall victim to external attacks. And these attacks may affect not just the investor and the owner – but the user too. Vulnerabilities, especially those that end in financial tragedy, often lead to loss of financing. But that’s only a part of the bigger problem. They end up hurting the industry as a whole, convincing potential investors, developers and participants, that Web 3.0 isn’t safe and can collapse at any given moment. The sooner we detect and eliminate vulnerabilities, the more chances we have to prevent incidents. This helps save the reputation of the aforementioned venture funds. To get a better understanding, let’s take a look at five well-financed projects, find out what happened to bring them down and discuss why venture funds should pay special attention to security. WazirX WazirX is a major Indian exchange platform. Founded in 2018, the company ran an extremely successful ICO in 2019-2020. The project managed to gather an impressive $2.9 million in investments. Among three notable sources, the most noticeable was Kalaari Capital – a well-known tech-focused venture capital firm. This, of course, cemented the reputation of WazirX at a rather early stage. Unfortunately, in July 2024, the company lost $230 million in digital assets. The cause for the loss was a multi-signature wallet vulnerability, due to which the attackers managed to manipulate discrepancies in transaction data. A hacker group called Lazarus Group was the main suspect, but insider involvement was not out of the question. As a result of the attack, WazirX was sued by its rival company CoinSwitch for failing to recover $9.7 million of its funds. Radiant Capital DeFi protocol Radiant Capital managed to secure $12.3 million during its investment rounds. The project promised to build a unified money market with the possibility of depositing, buying and borrowing assets across different blockchains. It’s not entirely surprising that the concept attracted hackers. The first incident occurred in October 2024 and included a flash loan attack that had cost Radiant Capital $4.5 million. But the misfortunes didn’t end there, and the second attack came soon after, leaving the project short of another $53 million. The attackers exploited the 3-of-11 multisig scheme, using malware to present false transactions for signing. The attacker then deployed their own malicious contracts on four chains, executing only those on Binance Smart Chain and ARB. Playdapp The successful South Korean platform Playdapp aimed to revolutionize the gaming industry by utilizing blockchain. That promise was enough to secure the company $3.8 million during investment rounds in 2022. With the popularity of Web 3.0 gaming, Playdapp had all the makings of an incredibly successful project and up to February 2024, this was the plan. In the span of three days, Playdapp was hit by two consecutive attacks. A private key exploit turned out to be the cause of the attack. During the first incident, the attacker’s address was added as the minter of tokens, and over 200 million PLA tokens were minted. During the second attack, an additional 1.6 billion were minted, which resulted in a total loss of $290 million. Hedgey Finance The DeFi project Hedgey Finance was founded in 2021 as a token vesting platform. The company quickly rose to popularity among large and well-known funds. The list of investors includes names such as Hiddentao Ventures, WAGMI Ventures, Blockchange Ventures and Compound. Hedgey Finance successfully raised money from 13 different funds. Alas, the story didn’t have a happy ending. Hedgey Finance was attacked on April 19, 2024. The attacker made away with approximately $2 million in ETH and additional BONUS tokens on Arbitrum ( ARB ). The cause was a vulnerability in the smart contract that allowed any user to exploit a certain command to transfer tokens from the contract to their own wallet. The Munchables The Munchables is yet another successfully funded project. The Web 3.0 gaming platform is based on Ethereum layer-two Blast. The project was launched in response to the growing popularity of GameFi projects and quickly received funding from 20 large investors. In March 2024, The Munchables fell victim to the project’s poor security measures. The attack was a result of the compromised upgradable proxy contract. The contract was used during the game’s development, and the ownership belonged to the developer. Even after the contract was upgraded, the owner still had options to manipulate the contract. This resulted in the loss of $62.5 million in ETH. What can be done Looking at the issues that caused all of the losses listed above, it’s easy to notice a pattern. Sure, the projects may have been well-funded and promising, but crucial mistakes must have been made during the audit. Multisig issues are one of the most common causes of third-party attacks on exchanges. The only effective way to eliminate them is a thorough security audit. Unfortunately, not all projects take it as seriously as they should. Many put their trust in the hands of cheap yet unreliable security companies that promise quick results and end up losing money as well as credibility. Here are some ways to avoid such situations. Research your potential auditors. Familiarize yourselves with the reviews, testimonials and the fate of the company’s previous clients. Increase the depth of a security audit by ordering not one but several audits from different reputable companies. Stay in constant communication with your auditor and take their recommendations seriously. It’s better to be overprepared than unprotected. An audit has to be performed at an early stage of the project development. Vulnerabilities never stay hidden for long and any of them may lead to financial losses. Dmitry Mishunin, CEO of HashEx Blockchain Security , excels in cybersecurity, focusing on Web 3.0 and blockchain. With a background in physics, applied mathematics and IT management, he’s a seasoned tech entrepreneur skilled in strategic management and team coaching. Under his leadership, HashEx has conducted over 1,300 audits, securing $3.8 billion in funds.

Durham County, North Carolina is opening applications this month for DCo Thrives, a guaranteed income program targeting low-income families, reports The Herald Sun. One hundred and twenty-five families will be selected to receive $750 per month to use as they wish every month for one year. DCo Thrives will be administered by the nonprofit Durham Children’s Initiative. The program, which aims to find out whether the free extra cash can improve the well-being of children and their families, will also have a control group of 125 participants. The two groups will be required to complete surveys, the results of which researchers will study. While the surveys will be conducted online, participants may be invited for an interview with the researchers. “Both groups will be asked to fill out surveys and will be compensated $100 for their survey completion. Data from the DCo Thrives pilot program will be used to help understand the effectiveness of guaranteed income programs in Durham and beyond.” The guaranteed income program is open to adults who are parenting at least one child of under 18 years of age. The household income of the potential participants must fall below 30% of the median income in Durham and Chapel Hill. Participants will be selected randomly. According to Spectrum News 1, Durham County’s first experiment of a guaranteed income program, known as StepUp Durham, was focused on ex-convicts. StepUp Durham started in March of 2022 and offered $600 a month to 109 previously incarcerated people for one year.

A recent analysis by ShayanBTC, a contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, has shed light on key factors impacting Ethereum’s performance. In a post titled “Ethereum Faces Crossroads: Funding Rates and $3K Support Key to Sustaining Bullish Momentum,” Shayan highlights the asset’s struggles to maintain its upward trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Downswing To $2,900 Could Be A ‘Buy-The-Dip Opportunity’ – Analyst Expects Bullish Surge Funding Rates And The Importance Of The $3K Support Level According to Shayan, Ethereum’s bullish momentum has been significantly challenged by fluctuations in Funding Rates, a key indicator of demand in the derivatives market. While these rates initially rose during the recent rally in the crypto market, signaling growing confidence, there was a subsequent decline after Ethereum was rejected at the $4,000 resistance level suggesting reduced trader interest and commitment. Notably, the spike in Funding Rates during the rally pointed to cautious optimism among traders. However, the sharp decline in these rates afterward highlights a waning demand for Ethereum in the derivatives market. This shift raises concerns about the sustainability of the bullish trend, particularly in light of Ethereum’s inability to breach the $4,000 resistance. The $3,000 support level has emerged as a pivotal threshold for Ethereum. Shayan emphasized that maintaining this level is crucial for stabilizing the market and potentially reigniting bullish momentum. A failure to hold above $3,000 could trigger increased selling pressure, leading to a deeper market correction. The analyst wrote: Overall, Ethereum’s outlook depends on reclaiming higher Funding Rates and defending $3K. These factors will determine whether the market resumes its uptrend or faces further corrections. Ethereum Market Performance Meanwhile, Ethereum has continued to demonstrate downward movements, especially as the broader market has recently turned bearish. Over the past week, Ethereum’s market value has dropped by 6.2% bringing its price below $3,500. However, over the past day, there has been a slight uptick in ETH’s price as the asset records a 0.9% increase. This slight increase has pushed ETH’s price to hover above $3,200 at the time of writing marking a 33.9% decrease away from its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum: Analyst Says $7,000 Target ‘Is Looming’ As Price Retests Crucial Level Interestingly, despite the descent in ETH’s price in the past week, the asset’s daily trading volume has faced an opposite trend over the same period. Particularly, ETH’s daily trading volume has moved from $20 billion last Friday to now sitting at above $26 billion as of today. Given the current trend in ETH, it is worth noting that this increase in trading volume may be a result of the surge in buying pressure and selling pressure ongoing in the Ethereum market.

Two rising stars are already making headlines with their innovative strides: Algorand’ s self-sufficient L1 network and the new Rollblock GambleFi protocol have emerged as the best crypto to buy now . These dynamic developments have caught the attention of Ethereum whale , who are eyeing these frontrunners for massive returns in 2025. So, sit tight as we unravel the mystery behind their glow. Rollblock’s iGaming solution attracts $8.5M investment. The best crypto to buy now ? Rollblock’s iGaming redefinition has become every punter’s favorite, and at this point, it’s logical to see why Ethereum whales are flocking in to have a piece of the cake. Over $8.5M has been raised to support a movement that finally prioritizes fun and user security in the $500B iGaming market. At its core, Rollblock is a revolutionary AI-backed crypto casino that leverages blockchain technology to deliver tamper-proof, transparent gambling. Coupled with a sleek, user-friendly interface, the platform quickly becomes a favorite for online gambling enthusiasts. Last month was a bang! Over $1.75M was wagered, and a 600% increase in deposits and signups was realized. The excitement doesn’t stop there. Rollblock’s innovative revenue-sharing model sets it apart as the best crypto to buy now . Now priced at $0.045 during stage 9 of its presale , $RBLK is poised for significant growth in 2025. Algorand ‘s glow up: Bullish technical stoke positive sentiment For a while, Algorand has been dazzling the crypto world with its innovative blockchain development crusade. Its decentralized, self-sustaining ecosystem has now gone beyond the usual secure, scalable, and efficient network to a thriving DeFi ecosystem that fosters blockchain growth. This distinctiveness has attracted institutional interest. Last month, the Algorand Foundation partnered with the UNDP to promote Web3 literacy, following its giant strides across Africa. Bullish technicals complemented the positive fundamentals. Despite market volatility, renewed institutional interest and demand from Ethereum whale s gave wings to the ALGO price on the price chart. Thanks to growing demand, ALGO ‘s price has broken out of a bearish descending trendline. Ethereum whale sell-off: ETH nearing another bottom as MoM crashes 9.2% It’s a rollercoaster ride for Ethereum . The DeFi king saw a massive exodus that wiped out most of its New Year gains. As of press time, Ethereum has fallen 9.2% MoM to a local low below $3,350. The culprits? Ethereum whale s and even the Ethereum Foundation, whose colossal sales have created significant downward pressure. Recent on-chain data shows Ethereum whale s are jumping the sinking ship in droves. In fact, two Ethereum whale s sold off over $250M worth of altcoins on Binance, and the wave of panic selling has shattered the critical $3,500 support level. This has pushed ETH towards the next support level at $2,800. Adding to the turmoil, the Ethereum Foundation is strategically offloading its holding. Conclusion Ethereum whale s are known for their impressive foresight. Algorand’ s massive potential in blockchain development didn’t go unnoticed, nor did Rollblock’s GambleFi revolution. While Algorand seals a new partnership, Rollblock has grown over 345%, thanks to its new iGaming solution, which positions it as the best crypto to buy now . Both assets present compelling opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on disruptive technologies and growing demand.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 05:39:00

Interestingly, the trader’s attention has shifted from BTC to its forks and as a result, the prices of BitcoinCash (BCH) & Bitcoin SV (BSV) have begun to rise consistently. While BSV price has surged over 15%, BCH price is trying to follow the trend with an over 3% jump. However, these rises suggest a significant ascending trend could materialise soon. Bitcoin SV (BSV) Price Analysis Bitcoin SV has been rising consistently after rebounding from the July 2024 lows close to $30 and after rebounding from the interim lows below $50, the rally has ignited a strong rebound. The rebound was backed by a massive influx of buying pressure as the volume surged 10 times, by over 800% from $50 million to $500 million in just a few hours. With this, BSV price has become the top performer, but will the rally fight the bearish heat? As seen in the above chart, the BSV price has been surging within a rising, expanding channel and has rebounded from its lower support since July 2024. With this, the token has positioned itself within the 50-day and 200-day MA, acting as strong resistance & support. On the other hand, the conversion & base lines of Ichimoku have undergone a bullish crossover, suggesting the start of a bullish trend. Additionally, the supertrend has turned bullish and the OBV has displayed a bullish divergence. Also, the volume has surged at frequent intervals, which suggests the traders are vigilant about the price action. Therefore, the Bitcoin SV price is expected to maintain a decent upswing and rise above immediate resistance at $68.46, which may revive hopes of entering the zone between $71.16 and $72.89. This could revive a rise toward the upper resistance of the channel above $95, gaining a 3-digit figure. BitcoinCash (BCH) Price Analysis BitcoinCash has entered the top 20 crypto assets after the recent rise in its value and volume, which increased by 50%. Despite this, the value of the crypto remains below the levels it started the 2025 trade, indicating there is more room for the token to swell. Therefore, BCH’s price is more likely to double top this cycle at around $1200 if this trade plays out well. The BCH price is stuck within a narrow range, with the levels trading within an upper and lower level. As a result, the Bollinger bands have squeezed and may continue to maintain a parallel consolidation. This suggests the bulls and bears remain vigilant and exert the required pressure at the right time. Secondly, the RSI seems to be following a trend since before of maintaining a consolidated trend along the rising trend line to reach the upper threshold. Currently, the levels have rebounded from the lower threshold and are expected to possess a similar trend. Therefore, the BitcoinCash (BCH) price is believed to attract some liquidity, which may help the rally to remain elevated. However, following a horizontal consolidation, the BCH price could eventually trigger a healthy rise towards interim highs at $600. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a recent Bloomberg interview , Long noted that the evolving regulatory landscape in the U.S. presents favorable conditions for cryptocurrency-based financial products, particularly spot ETFs. The anticipation surrounding XRP ETFs has intensified following multiple applications from prominent financial institutions. Asset manager Bitwise began the trend in early October 2024 with its filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an XRP ETF Subsequently, established firms including Canary Capital and 21Shares submitted their applications, demonstrating growing institutional interest in XRP-based investment vehicles. These developments, combined with Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election, contributed to XRP’s notable performance in November when the digital asset rose by over 300%, positioning it as one of the leading performers among the top assets. When Will the SEC Approve XRP ETFs Long elaborated on the timeline for XRP ETF approvals, suggesting that these products would likely follow the established precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum offerings. The potential approval of XRP ETFs is a significant milestone in the broader adoption of digital assets and could help XRP hit a new all-time high just like Bitcoin. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously described XRP ETFs as inevitable , and Long believes XRP is “next in line” for ETF approval. She expects the new administration to accelerate the approval process.

The company’s domestic operations have demonstrated notable momentum, with Long revealing unprecedented growth in 2024. Ripple’s businesses doubled in 2024, indicating strengthening market confidence in blockchain-based financial solutions, and Long believes 2025 will be a big year for crypto overall.

Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/will-ethereum-bounce-back-crypto-analysts-discuss-potential-price-recovery/,"In the past week, Ethereum (ETH) has dropped 9.3%, falling from $3,630 on January 3 to $3,235 at the time of writing. While ETH is striving to defend the psychologically significant support level at $3,000, some crypto analysts remain confident that the digital asset’s long-term price trajectory is bullish. Can Ethereum Recover? Analysts Weigh In While the current crypto bull market saw Bitcoin (BTC) create multiple historical new all-time highs (ATH), Ethereum’s price action remained relatively muted. Notably, ETH’s ATH of $4,878 recorded in November 2021 remains intact. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say However, ETH’s subpar price action during the current market cycle has not dampened crypto analysts’ hopes for a bullish trend reversal. For instance, several analysts are closely monitoring the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forming on the 3-day Ethereum chart. While a standard head-and-shoulders pattern is typically bearish, an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is considered bullish, signaling a potential reversal in the asset’s price trend. Analyst MikyBull recently highlighted this formation in a post on X. Crypto analyst Wolf, corroborated MikyBull’s bullish prediction. In their analysis, Wolf highlighted that a successful completion of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern could propel ETH to as high as $7,200. Seasoned cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez added that a downswing to $2,900 would be “very bullish for Ethereum,” creating an excellent buying opportunity before ETH climbs to new ATHs. Martinez further noted that if ETH continues to follow its ascending parallel channel, a dip to $2,800 could provide a solid foundation for the next upward move. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency and forex trader Merlijn The Trader identified a bullish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal on Ethereum’s 4-hour chart. This indicates that momentum could be shifting from bearish to bullish. According to Merlijn, this momentum shift might push ETH to the $3,700 price level. Will ETH Hit A New ATH In 2025? At the time of writing, ETH is trading approximately 33% below its ATH price. However, the rising institutional interest in the digital asset – particularly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETF) – could provide ETH the required momentum to eye new ATH. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-Reward Ratio Is Now Attractive, Brokerage Firm Explains A recent report by Steno Research predicted that ETH is poised to outperform BTC in 2025, with price projections as high as $8,000. However, not all are convinced of a bullish 2025 for ETH. To conclude, Ethereum must first surpass the critical resistance level at $4,000 before it can set its sights on achieving new ATHs. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,235, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

33767162,[object Object],1736577014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"XRP Kicks 2025 Off With Adoption: Holder Count Up By 58,000",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-kicks-2025-off-with-adoption-holder-count-58000/,"On-chain data shows XRP has started the year with a strong adoption wave as its Total Amount of Holders has registered a notable increase. XRP Has Seen Fastest 2025 Adoption Among Top Coins In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared how the trend in the Total Amount of Holders has compared the various top cryptocurrencies during these starting days of 2025. The “ Total Amount of Holders ” here refers to an indicator that, as its name suggests, keeps track of the total number of addresses on a given network that is carrying some non-zero balance. When the value of this metric rises, it can suggest new investors are joining the blockchain or old ones that had sold earlier are investing back into it. The trend can also appear when existing users create new addresses for purposes like privacy . In general, all of these factors are at play at once to some degree whenever the Total Amount of Holders registers an increase, so some net adoption of the coin could be assumed to be occurring. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies some of the investors are clearing out their wallets, potentially because they have decided to exit from the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for six popular digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Chainlink (LINK): As displayed in the above graph, Chainlink is the only cryptocurrency in this list that has seen a negative change in its Total Amount of Holders; LINK holders are down 3,300 or 0.5% as compared to the start of the year. In terms of pure numbers, Ethereum has seen the most number of investors join the network at 645,000. ETH’s user base is massive, however, meaning that this jump is only equivalent to a 0.5% increase. Bitcoin is second with 102,000 new addresses, with a balance popping up on the network, and XRP is third at 58,000. While the latter’s number may seem small, its situation is the opposite of ETH’s: the size of its holder base means that this figure represents a growth of 1% for the blockchain, making its Total Amount of Holders uptrend the sharpest out of the lot. The surge in the metric that XRP has seen this year so far is merely a continuation of the trend that the cryptocurrency closed 2024 off with. Thus, it seems the asset has been gaining some decent adoption recently, with its investor influx showing no signs of slowing down yet. The remaining two assets in the list, Dogecoin and Cardano, have seen the Total Amount of Holders change by 29,000 and 2,800, respectively. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.3, down more than 4% over the last seven days.",XRP|XRP Adoption|XRP holders|XRP Total Amount of Holders|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|ZK|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-11 06:30:14

While Solana and Dogecoin have historically been good bets, a new contender has been highlighted as being likely to outperform both in 2025. This rising star, Rollblock ($RBLK), takes a modern approach to both iGaming and DeFi, blending the best of both together to offer an advanced GambleFi platform. So how will Dogecoin, Solana, and Rollblock perform in the next quarter? Rollblock Smashes Past $8.4 Million Raised In Presale Rollblock is quickly emerging as a game changer in the DeFi and iGaming markets. This advanced GambleFi platform offers users an engaging casino with an intelligently designed native token at its center. Rollblock excels above traditional platforms by tackling issues around transparency and trust that have long plagued iGaming platforms. It achieves this by building the casino on blockchain infrastructure, ensuring that bets are fully immutable, and cannot be tampered with after they have been placed. This focus on trust and security has contributed to an immense influx of platform users. Rollblock’s offering is comprehensive, with a roster of over 7,000 games, ranging from traditional table top games to modern virtual experiences. There is also a thriving sportsbook offering both niche and mainstream events. Rollblock sports a generous revenue sharing model which is a further draw for investors. This model means that 30% of platform profits are used to purchase RBLK tokens back from marketplaces. Of these tokens, some are burned to introduce scarcity while the remaining tokens are redistributed to token holders as staking rewards. This model rewards early adopters while promoting the long term growth of Rollblock’s ecosystem. Rollblock is currently powering through stage 9 of its presale, with tokens on offer for a ripe price of $0.045. The platform’s unique melding of iGaming and DeFi, as well as its sophisticated blockchain design, have led analysts to project a steep 800% price increase during presale and further growth post-launch. Solana Down 7.6% In A Month Solana (SOL) has historically been a strong bet though its trajectory in 2025 remains unclear. Solana (SOL) has seen a net 7.6% dip in the last month, with a similar decrease in the last week. Solana (SOL) has spent recent quarters fine tuning its infrastructure for maximum scalability. Developers and users alike continue to be drawn to Solana’s high throughput and relatively low fees. These metrics have both been improved on with the release of the alternative validator client, Firedancer. With this release, Solana’s transaction throughput shot past 65,000 transactions per second. Solana (SOL) continues to set the benchmark high in this domain, though its recent performance has caused worry among many Solana (SOL) enthusiasts. Dogecoin Sees Significant Decline Dogecoin (DOGE) has also endured a poor start to 2025, with a 12.5% loss in the last month and a 2% decrease in the last week. Many Dogecoin (DOGE) enthusiasts thought that in the build-up to Trump’s taking of the U.S. office on Jan 20th, Dogecoin (DOGE) might see a preemptive spike, but this has not transpired. This philosophy stemmed from the fact that Dogecoin (DOGE) was seemingly endorsed by Trump and Elon Musk, with the conception of a ‘Department of Governmental Efficiency’, abbreviated to DOGE. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) has not yet seen these gains. Rollblock Set To Dominate DeFi And iGaming In 2025 Rollblock (RBLK) is quickly emerging as a major player with its advanced GambleFi solution. As its presale progresses, Rollblock’s momentum is undeniable. As it captures the attention of both iGaming and DeFi enthusiasts, Rollblock is well on its way to dominate these spaces in 2025.

As of now, Ethereum has sold off by about 25%, and its current price is around $3,300, marking a 20% drop from its cycle high. While confirmation is not yet complete, higher lows and lower highs suggest a potential breakout in either direction. The broader trend remains bullish, and the current price movement appears to be a correction within that larger uptrend. Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the market, holding 55% dominance. However, Bitcoin’s dominance is starting to cool off, which is positive for Ethereum and altcoins. Resistance Level to Watch Ethereum faces important resistance between $3,370 and $3,613. A breakout above this range would signal the end of the correction and could indicate the start of a new bullish trend. Short-Term Bearish Scenarios Wave Structure: One possible bearish scenario is that Ethereum could be following a corrective wave pattern, with a potential five-wave decline forming. However, this would be a short-term bearish outlook. As long as Ethereum remains above $2,400, the overall uptrend could still continue. Altcoins Impact: Many altcoins are showing signs of weakness, which could put additional pressure on Ethereum’s price. Triangle Pattern Potential Ethereum may also be forming a triangle pattern. If this is the case, more sideways movement may occur before a breakout. A breakout above $3,613 would suggest the development of a bullish triangle pattern, potentially leading to a strong upward move. Bullish Scenario Ethereum might be in a “one-two” setup, with a potential bottom already established. If Ethereum breaks above $3,613, it would invalidate the bearish scenario and increase the likelihood of a bullish breakout.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-11 06:40:24

As AVAX price displays weakness and Tron (TRX) price attracts marginal gains, SUI price has a huge opportunity to enter the top 10 cryptos . Meanwhile, this may consume more time than expected as the road to $20 billion appears to be a challenging task. The Sui price chart is one of the strongest charts among the other cryptos in terms of price movements and also the volume concentration. The volume of the platform has been maintained above the average since the second half of 2024, which has kept the token volatile. Besides, the monstrous moves of the token have kept the traders highly vigilant. Therefore, the SUI price is speculated to continue with a bullish trend and mark fresh highs. As mentioned above, the SUI price is trading within a rising parallel channel, which is considered the most bullish pattern as the cryptos follow a disciplined ascending price action. The Bollinger band formations suggest another bullish wave is fast approaching, as it has already expanded a couple of times within the channel and is ready for another one. Secondly, the RSI movement is one of the major reasons to be bullish on SUI, as it has not dropped below the average since August 2024. Therefore, the SUI price, which has gained huge attention in recent times, is believed to flow according to the pattern and eventually test the upper resistance of the channel. Besides, the current trade setup suggests the next ATH for the SUI price rally could be somewhere around $6.02, which may be achieved in the first few days of the coming week. However, to enter the top 10, the SUI price is required to achieve a $10 milestone that may happen later this year. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum often steal the spotlight, altcoins are quietly making waves, delivering staggering returns to those who recognise their potential early. Recent news about regulatory clarity, innovative upgrades, and groundbreaking partnerships has amplified the buzz around altcoins. But the real question is: which ones should you add to your portfolio for 2025? This is where Qubetics ($TICS) takes centre stage. Positioned as a game-changer, $TICS offers solutions to real-life problems that have plagued earlier blockchain technologies. Its unique focus on interoperability and decentralised applications has positioned it as a favourite among analysts and early adopters. Add to that the likes of XRP and Cardano, and you’ve got a list of altcoins that are too tempting to ignore. Let’s dive deeper into why these three stand out as the best coins to buy in January 2025. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Interoperability and Decentralised Finance Qubetics is rewriting the rules of blockchain interoperability, connecting disparate networks seamlessly. Its presale, now in its 16th stage, has already raised over $9.1 million, selling more than 409 million tokens to over 13,900 holders. The current token price of $0.0455 is expected to jump by 10% after the weekend, creating a sense of urgency for investors. Analysts predict a whopping 448% ROI by the end of the best crypto presale , with projections of $10-$15 per token post-mainnet launch. The platform recently unveiled its cutting-edge decentralised VPN service, a solution tailored to Central Asian users grappling with censorship and privacy concerns. Imagine a small business in Uzbekistan conducting cross-border transactions securely without worrying about data breaches. With $TICS, this isn’t a hypothetical scenario; it’s the future. Applications: Interoperability at Its Best Interoperability is no longer a buzzword; it’s a necessity. Qubetics enables seamless communication between blockchains, simplifying complex transactions for businesses and individuals. For instance, a freelancer in Kyrgyzstan can now receive payments from a client in Europe without the usual exchange rate hassles or delays. Similarly, larger enterprises in Kazakhstan can leverage Qubetics to streamline supply chain management, ensuring data consistency across various networks. Why did this coin make it to this list? With a clear roadmap, unparalleled technology, and massive ROI potential, $TICS is a no-brainer for anyone looking to tap into the next big thing in crypto. 2. XRP: The Cross-Border Payments Powerhouse XRP has been riding high following its partial victory against the SEC in 2024, solidifying its position as a legitimate asset in the United States. This regulatory clarity has triggered renewed interest, driving its price upward despite market volatility. Currently trading at [current XRP price], XRP has seen [percentage change] in the last 24 hours, reflecting strong investor sentiment. Ripple, the company behind XRP, recently announced a partnership with major financial institutions in Asia, leveraging its technology for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. This development couldn’t be timelier for Central Asian users who often face exorbitant remittance fees when transferring money abroad. Picture this: a migrant worker in Tajikistan wants to send money to their family in Russia. Traditional banks charge up to 10% in fees, not to mention the three-day waiting period. With XRP, those fees drop to under 1%, and transactions are completed within seconds. It’s a game-changer for the region’s unbanked and underbanked populations. Why did this coin make it to this list? XRP’s proven utility, combined with regulatory clarity and global adoption, makes it one of the top altcoins to buy for 2025. 3. Cardano: The Sustainable Blockchain Revolution Cardano continues to stand out as one of the most robust and environmentally sustainable blockchains. Its latest upgrade, Hydra, promises enhanced scalability and transaction speeds, attracting developers looking to build decentralised applications (dApps). Trading at [current Cardano price], ADA has seen [percentage change] recently, bolstered by positive market sentiment and institutional adoption. What’s even more exciting is Cardano’s focus on real-world applications. The blockchain recently partnered with educational institutions in Africa to provide secure, tamper-proof certification systems. Imagine a university in Turkmenistan issuing digital diplomas that are globally verifiable—that’s the kind of innovation Cardano brings to the table. Cardano’s emphasis on scalability and low energy consumption makes it a perfect fit for regions like Central Asia, where resources are often limited. For example, a small tech startup in Armenia can launch its dApp on Cardano without worrying about high fees or excessive energy usage, making blockchain technology more accessible than ever. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cardano’s commitment to sustainability, innovation, and real-world utility solidifies its position as one of the best coins to buy in January 2025. Conclusion Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics ($TICS) , XRP, and Cardano are not just promising investments but pivotal players shaping the future of blockchain technology. Whether it’s Qubetics’ focus on interoperability, XRP’s dominance in cross-border payments, or Cardano’s sustainable approach, each of these altcoins offers a unique value proposition for 2025 and beyond. Don’t wait until the market catches on. Dive into these opportunities now, and watch your portfolio soar as these altcoins redefine the crypto landscape. Ready to make your move? The time is now.

As Rippe (XRP) and Chainlink (LINK) face corrections, their whales are investing in a new altcoin called Remittix (RTX) . Remittix is emerging as a beacon of potential, bringing a unique way to global payments with its frictionless crypto-to-fiat transfers. Backed by its PayFi technology and over $2.4 million raised in presale funds, Remittix offers security, speed, and financial inclusiveness. Remittix Transforming Global Payments The world of finance is experiencing significant change, and Remittix is at the forefront of this transition. By fusing blockchain technology with conventional fiat cross-border payments, Remittix sets the stage for a piece of the $183 trillion global banking market. Remittix is a platform that empowers people and businesses by bridging the divide between cryptocurrencies and conventional banking systems. It lets users rapidly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currency and deliver it to any bank account. This remarkable method allows crypto investors to experience the speed and efficiency of blockchain transactions while maintaining the everyday ease of fiat payments. Remittix stands out in an increasingly competitive market from major players such as Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase. Unlike its competitors, Remittix allows customers to send funds using crypto, which is then easily converted and sent to a bank account. For businesses, Remittix is similarly transformational. Through its unique Pay API, companies may accept crypto payments from clients while settling transactions in fiat currencies straight into their specified bank accounts. This improves business payment choices and speeds the process of transforming digital assets into useable currency. Additionally, Remittix offers merchant accounts to companies so that they can have complete control over how they handle and pay out their crypto holdings. Companies can operate flexibly and efficiently with support for over 30 fiat currencies and 50+ cryptocurrency pairs. By merging blockchain’s speed and security with fiat’s worldwide accessibility, Remittix is creating a future where global transactions are faster, simpler, and more inclusive. Major Factors Impacting Chainlink’s Price Growth in 2025 With many game-changing elements laying the groundwork for significant development, Chainlink looks set to deliver a remarkable performance in 2025. Chainlink’s expanding importance in decentralized finance (DeFi) is a major factor driving this trend. The demand for LINK tokens is anticipated to rise as DeFi initiatives depend increasingly on Chainlink’s reliable Oracles for precise off-chain data. This increasing uptake supports the platform’s potential for price growth. Adding to its features, Chainlink’s launch of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a big milestone. This innovation improves asset exchanges across blockchains, providing an effortless multi-chain experience for individuals and platforms. Chainlink is establishing itself as a vital facilitator in the growing cryptocurrency ecosystem by dismantling network restrictions, which will probably attract even more attention from investors. Chainlink also benefits from the positive mood of the larger market. It traded for $20.39 and experienced a 6% decline in 24 hours. Despite this downward trend, whales are prepared to stick to the altcoin while accumulating faster growing bags like Remittix. Will XRP Maintain Its Bright Start in 2025? XRP is beginning 2025 with hopeful signals of development and resilience. Currently trading at $2.32, it has registered a modest gain of 0.20%. While recent market trends have posed some obstacles, XRP’s outlook remains overwhelmingly favorable, driven by vital events that might push XRPs price higher in the coming months. The debut of RLUSD, a new stablecoin linked to the U.S. dollar, is making waves in the market. By improving liquidity and facilitating transactions, RLUSD pulls more users into the Ripple ecosystem, generating even more demand for XRP. Investor interest is also growing as XRP positions for a bull run, signifying heightened expectations for substantial price swings. Adding to the excitement is the coming of a crypto-friendly U.S. government, which might open the way to approve additional crypto-focused projects. Why Remittix is the Whale’s Choice Investor interest in $RTX is booming with an impressive $2.5 million raised in just a few weeks. Currently in the third block of its ICO, RTX Tokens are now valued at $0.0199 after it recorded a 32% jump from its initial listing price of $0.015. With projections of an 800% surge by the presale’s completion and a projected 5,000% following the project’s launch, Remittix presents itself as an excellent opportunity to join a project set to advance global payments.

Usual Protocol’s stablecoin USD0 recently lost its peg to $1. Starting next week, Usual Protocol will enable a 1:1 early payout option. This feature allows users to give up a portion of their accumulated rewards and use their assets at a 1:1 ratio. The payback period covers a maximum of six months, which the developers claim offers flexibility while addressing liquidity concerns. The protocol has decided to activate its revenue distribution mechanism earlier than planned. Starting Monday, Usual will distribute revenues to USUALx holders weekly, in USD0. The protocol estimates that monthly revenues will be around $5 million, which corresponds to an annual percentage rate (APR) of over 50% in current conditions.

The recent warning by the Fed of a potential rate hike and their intention to maintain a heightened interest rate regime has cast a shadow on the future of various sectors, especially those that thrive on low interest rates. What’s Unfolding? Federal Reserve’s Stance: The Fed has adopted a hawkish tone. Their plan for one more rate hike this year and the projection that the inflation rate will reach the desired 2% target after 2026 is causing concerns. Tech and Crypto Impact: Higher interest rates often negatively impact high-growth sectors. Technology and consumer discretionary sectors are particularly vulnerable. The cryptocurrency space, already known for its volatility, is expected to be more unpredictable, with leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Dogecoin, and BNB likely to experience significant price fluctuations. Yield Alarms: Post the statement from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in September, U.S. Treasury Note yields have surged to levels not seen since the mid-2000s. Such rapid yield growth often serves as a harbinger of an impending recession, a cause for concern among investors. Oil Prices and Inflation: The rise in crude oil prices for Brent crude and Western Texas Intermediate crude could add to inflationary pressures. Higher transportation costs from increased oil prices could elevate the general price levels, complicating the Federal Reserve’s task to curb inflation. U.S. Dollar Index: The ICE U.S. Dollar Index touching its highest intraday level since late 2022 indicates the dollar’s strength, which may have implications for U.S. exports and the broader global economy.

In December 2024, their initiative gained support from MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor, who noted Bitcoin’s robustness against inflation. However, in its submission to Meta, the National Center cited examples of successful corporate Bitcoin adoption, including MicroStrategy , whose stock has surged by 2,191% in the past five years. The proposal also pointed to the increasing institutional recognition of Bitcoin, with developments such as BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF gaining traction. Aligning with Meta’s Vision Meta has long been recognized for its forward-thinking approach to technology. The proposal notes the alignment of Bitcoin adoption with Meta’s innovative legacy. The company’s leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg and board member Marc Andreessen, has previously shown interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. The shareholder proposal argues that adopting Bitcoin would further Meta’s reputation as a leader in innovation and financial resilience.

The decision, issued on January 7, 2025, was shared on X by Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal. It also stays district court proceedings while the appellate court considers the matter. The SEC initiated its lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging that certain digital assets listed on the platform qualify as securities under federal law. Coinbase, however, has consistently challenged the SEC’s position, asserting that the assets in question do not meet the criteria of an “investment contract” as defined by the Howey test. The Interlocutory Appeal An interlocutory appeal allows a party to seek an appellate review of specific legal questions before the case proceeds to trial. In this instance, Coinbase’s appeal focuses on the critical question of whether an “investment contract” under U.S. securities law requires the existence of a contractual agreement between parties. This issue lies at the heart of Coinbase’s case and broader disputes involving the regulatory classification of digital assets. The court’s decision to grant the appeal is noteworthy, as interlocutory appeals are rarely approved. According to well-respected attorney Jeremy Hogan, “The granting of an interlocutory appeal is rare and indicates that the trial level judge thinks there is ‘something there.’” Big news in the legal crypto space. The judge in the SEC v. Coinbase case has stayed the lawsuit until the appellate court rules on whether an ""investment contract"" requires an actual contract. This is also the main point of contention in the Ripple appeal. The granting of an… https://t.co/33SIVaSepx — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) January 7, 2025 Implications for the Crypto Market The court has halted further discovery and proceedings until the appellate court resolves the appeal by staying the district court litigation. This pause allows the appellate court to provide clarity on the definition of an investment contract. This could significantly influence this case and the SEC’s broader regulatory efforts in the cryptocurrency space. However, Coinbase’s decision has long been criticized by other attorneys. The SEC has appealed part of the July 2023 ruling that determined that XRP itself is not a security and programmatic token sales are not investment contracts. In early 2024, Bill Morgan noted that Coinbase losing the appeal would strengthen the SEC case against Ripple. Now that Coinbase’s interlocutory appeal has been granted, the crypto world awaits a favorable outcome. However, things could take an entirely different turn, as the SEC will soon be under a new crypto-friendly administration. Experts including Hogan believe the new administration will dismiss the Ripple lawsuit and similar non-fraud lawsuits and provide proper regulation for the crypto market to foster growth and innovation.

On Friday, North Dakota lawmakers submitted a House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) proposing the inclusion of digital assets and precious metals in the state treasury’s portfolio, citing inflation risks. New Hampshire State Representative Keith Ammon also pushed for adding digital assets to their state treasury . New Hampshire introduces a tech-neutral bill to push for digital asset allocation North Dakota introduced HCR 3001, which requires part of state funds to be invested in digital assets and precious metals. The resolution already has 11 sponsors, including State Reps. Nathan Toman, Matthew Heilman, Jared Hendrix, Daniel Johnston, SuAnn Olson, Todd Porter and Senators. Jeff Barta, and Bob Paulson. These sponsors expect that future digital asset allocation could protect against inflation and other economic uncertainties. New Hampshire also proposed legislation for the inclusivity of digital assets, led by State Representative Keith Ammon. New Hampshire could have up to $360 million in crypto in its reserves if the bill is passed . While the legislation is similar to North Dakota’s, it does not address Bitcoin by name. Dennis Porter, CEO and Co-Founder of Satoshi Action Fund, even commented on the move: “It’s not a ‘sneaky’ way. Some states will require us to develop tech-neutral bills, which is very common in policy. It’s a way to reduce political friction.” ~ Dennis Porter Texas, Alabama, and Pennsylvania are also considering holding Bitcoin In addition to New Hampshire and North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Alabama have already introduced legislation to establish future Bitcoin reserves. State Representative Mike Cabell proposed establishing a Bitcoin reserve for Pennsylvania on November 14, 2024. He suggested an initial BTC holding of up to 10%, however, he did say the state could begin with a smaller percentage, maybe between 1% and 5%. He even added that the state’s $7 billion emergency fund could be used to buy Bitcoin to hedge against inflation. Rep. Giovanni Capriglione also pushed for Texas to start accepting taxes, fees, and donations in BTC. Alabama’s Andrew Sorell also encouraged the start of Bitcoin reserves in the state. He claimed that since crypto is already here and reshaping markets globally, the state should at least profit from it.

You’ve got all the classics like Dogecoin and BabyDoge, but this month, there’s a new contender for your attention—and it’s bringing something special to the table. Enter BTFD Coin, a meme coin that’s doing more than just catching attention with its catchy name. Let’s talk numbers. BTFD Coin’s presale is already creating waves—over $5.1 million has been raised, with 63 billion coins sold, and over 8,000 “Bulls” already on board.

Trump’s inauguration could act as a strong catalyst An expert said Bitcoin could hit a major target in 2025. Bitcoin has made a slight rebound, now trading above the $94,000 mark after a drop that rattled the entire cryptocurrency market. At this point, the key question is whether the most recent low will hold. If it does, the $94,000 level could serve as a springboard for further gains. However, looking back to December 4, Bitcoin had already hit $100,000 and even reached a high of $108,268 on December 17, sparking excitement among investors. This milestone was seen as a major psychological barrier for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, had been on the rise since Donald Trump was re-elected as U.S. president. What’s driving this surge? Trump announced he would nominate Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Atkins has experience in crypto policy and has been involved in organizations like the Token Alliance and the Chamber of Digital Commerce, which work on best practices for digital assets… The post Core DAO Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Surging to $200K in 2025 appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CORE,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-01-11 07:22:06

The question now is whether XRP and DOGE will rebound swiftly, given the massive purchases completed by the so-called whales. It was a rollercoaster of a week for the entire crypto market, with BTC surging past $102,000 at the start of it only to dump by more than ten grand within two days to a multi-week low. The altcoins followed suit, as DOGE, for example, stood close to $0.4 at one point this week but then plunged toward $0.31, representing a 22% retracement. XRP went above $2.5 briefly on January 4 and to $2.47 on January 7, but the market-wide correction pushed it to a low of $2.2 on January 9 before it calmed to around $2.33 in the past 24 hours. Such enhanced fluctuations tend to scare off certain investors, especially retail, but that has not been the case with whales. Data from Santiment, shared by Ali Martinez, show that XRP and DOGE whales went on an accumulation spree amid this market uncertainty. Those holding the largest meme coin by market cap increased their stash by adding more than 470 million DOGE in 48 hours alone. In USD terms, this would put the total accumulation at about $150 million, with an average price of $0.33 per token. The XRP case is even more bullish as whales purchased more than a billion tokens within the same timeframe. An average price of around $2.3 puts this two-day acquisition at $2.3 billion. Whales bought roughly 1 billion $XRP in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/XUlibpXkz5 — Ali (@ali_charts) January 10, 2025 It’s worth noting that both assets reacted to this market-wide crash in a less painful manner compared to the previous one at the end of 2024, when BTC slumped toward $91,000 once again. Back then, XRP tumbled hard , slipping below $2 on a couple of occasions. So far, during this correction, the token’s low was 10% higher at $2.2, perhaps assisted by the aforementioned large purchases. DOGE’s scenario was similar as it plummeted to just over $0.26 on December 30, while its bottom now came at over $0.31. Consequently, it’s safe to say that the whale accumulations helped both assets during the crash, and they could have an even greater effect if they continue and the market rebounds in the next few days.

As Donald Trump takes charge as President on January 20, the crypto industry has high hopes from Sacks with expectations of more crypto-friendly policies. Crypto Ball to Have Exclusive VIP Reception With David Sacks Next Friday, BTC Inc. along with Stand With Crypto will host the inaugural Crypto Ball event featuring a VIP reception hosted by MAGA Inc., a Trump-aligned super PAC. AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks will be leading the event, reported Fox Business’ crypto journalist Eleanor Terret. A Closer Look Into The Development Citing sources familiar with the matter, Terret also stated that President-elect Donald Trump won’t be attending the event. The tickets for the exclusive VIP reception are currently priced at $100,000 each. For those seeking a premium experience, a $1 million package is also available, which includes four reception tickets and a single ticket to a future dinner with President Trump. With the Inaugural Crypto Ball event , crypto industry leaders are likely to assert more influence in Washington DC. The Trump administration is likely to be the most overtly pro-crypto in history, with plans to implement industry-friendly policies. This also includes a comprehensive overhaul of financial regulations to address the sector’s key priorities. Crypto Czar David Sacks In Focus The role of crypto czar David Sacks would be crucial in crypto-policy framing as he will serve as the bridge between the Trump administration and the crypto industry. Market analysts believe that he would play a crucial role in removing excessive regulations and bringing conducive policies for the crypto industry to function in sync with the traditional financial industry. This would also pave the way for building a strategic US Bitcoin reserve . Besides, the anticipation over the reserve is also soaring as Paul Atkins is also scheduled to succeed the current US SEC Chair Gary Gensler later these months. These are among the top crypto events for January alongside Donald Trump’s inauguration. Industry Leaders Extend Support Some of the top crypto industry firms like MicroStrategy, Coinbase, MetaMask, Metaplanet, and Galaxy Digital, have joined as sponsors of the Crypto Ball event. Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital recently joined the list of sponsors for the event. Chairman and CEO of MARA Holdings, Fred Thiel stated: “Bitcoin represents the future and America is primed to lead the charge, empowering a new era of economic growth, national security, and freedom. MARA is proud to sponsor the Inaugural Crypto Ball in Washington DC, hosted by David Sacks and David Bailley”. The industry will be watching the first major crypto event directly in association with the lawmakers from the White House. This would help to fast-track crypto policies and help in realizing Trump’s dream of making America the crypto capital of the world.

Let’s explore how bearish sentiment could set the stage for a bullish turnaround! Ready?

On Tuesday, January 7, the market witnessed a severe single-day drop of 5.69%. On the second-to-last day of the week, the market plummeted to a low of $3.16T. On Friday, January 10, though buyers attempted to push the price higher, the 2.21% growth achieved was far less than the 11.07% growth required to recover from the correction suffered. Almost all the top ten cryptos have witnessed a decline in the last seven days. Bitcoin has dropped by 3.9%, Ethereum by 9.8%, XRP by 4.6%, BNB by 3.6%, Solana by 14%, Dogecoin by 14.9%, and Cardano by 14.9%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Forks, BCH & BSV Propel as Bitcoin Price Consolidated Within a Narrow Range—A 15% Upswing Seems Imminent , Rising Crypto Selling Interest: What It Means Reports indicate that the crypto market decline has triggered a sharp rise in selling interest among crypto traders.

Source : Santiment Crypto Market Bearish Sentiment and Historical Trends During the Q4 bull rally, heightened bearish sentiment preceded price surges.

The accused raised more than $9 million during his fraudulent days. According to the records published by the Department of Justice (DOJ), Travis Ford tricked around 2,800 investors who invested almost $9.4 million between January and August 2023. The DOJ further said that Travis Ford, who came out as a sophisticated investor, lied to his victims that he could help generate “1-2%” daily returns, which average 547% annually. Travis Ford used social media and other online platforms to lure and con his victims The Department of Justice highlighted that the accused targeted investors through his firms, the Wolf Capital website, social media platforms, and several online promotion sites. However, when investors submitted the funds as investments, Travis Ford diverted them for his personal gains. The funds were never allocated as intended but were funneled into Ford’s private accounts and those of his accomplices. Ford misused and redirected investor funds to benefit himself and his co-conspirators, causing significant financial losses to the investors. In a public statement, the DOJ noted that Ford admitted it was impossible to deliver the high returns he had promised. The court has not scheduled a sentencing date for Wolf’s co-founder. Ford’s charges of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and his plea could land him a maximum penalty of five years. Several countries are actively weeding out crypto scams Ford’s case follows a wider crackdown on crypto fraudsters in different locations globally. On January 5, four crypto fraudsters were apprehended by Vietnamese authorities for engaging in a crypto mining scam that led to more than 200 people losing 4 billion Vietnamese dongs ($157,300). At the same time, authorities in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the US, alerted the public about an increase in Bitcoin and blockchain-related frauds. The advisory stated that crypto ATM scams were on the rise but acknowledged that the fraudsters are using several techniques. Part of the statement read : “The scams have many different variations, but one in particular directs a person to a cryptocurrency machine to insert and send money to the scammer. If you receive a phone call with someone demanding a payment in cryptocurrency or bitcoin, please hang up.” On January 9, PeckShield security firm released a report outlining how $3 billion was lost to crypto criminals in 2024.

Regardless of the lack of significant momentum, recent insights from analysts have brought attention to key trends and accumulation opportunities for BTC. These perspectives provide a deeper understanding of Bitcoin’s market structure and offer strategies for navigating its current environment. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Current Struggles Could Set the Stage for a Major Comeback—Here’s Why Short-Term Losses Indicate Accumulation Potential A contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, MAC.D, highlighted an ongoing trend in a post titled “Short-term SOPR Below 1: A Good Time for Accumulation.” The analysis emphasized that current market conditions, though challenging for short-term investors, may represent an opportune moment for long-term accumulation. Short-term SOPR below 1, a good time for accumulation “As short-term investors experience more pain, it often presents better opportunities for accumulation.” – By @MAC_D46035 Further details 👇https://t.co/gNGhFcp7DB pic.twitter.com/BOUJjBFzGp — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 10, 2025 MAC’s analysis focused on the Short-Term Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a metric that reflects the sentiment of investors holding Bitcoin for less than six months. Currently at 0.987, the metric suggests that these investors are selling Bitcoin at a loss. Historical patterns show that such behavior often precedes market recoveries, making these periods favorable for accumulation. The analysis also pointed to broader cycle indicators, such as Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), and the Puell Multiple. These metrics indicate that the ongoing market correction does not signal the end of Bitcoin’s upward cycle. MAC argued that as short-term investors continue to sell at a loss, long-term investors could benefit by acquiring Bitcoin at reduced prices. Mac noted: If there is further decline from the current price, smart investors will likely accumulate the coins sold cheaply by short-term investors. Therefore, selling coins at this juncture might prove to be a very unwise decision.

The couple initiated a substantial AUD 90,000 transfer, equivalent to approximately USD 58,000, to the Bank of Melbourne in June. However, their story takes a perplexing turn. According to reports by the Daily Mail, the initial transfer bounced back, leaving the couple bewildered. But the real shock came during their second attempt to transfer the funds when the money seemingly evaporated into thin air. In response to their financial nightmare, Houston and Murphy filed a formal complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, emphasizing the severe impact of the loss. Houston expressed her distress, stating, “We’ve got evidence and money transactions going into that account. We can show the transactions when we were last getting paid, and then we transferred the money into our savings account. We can show them screenshots of our account sitting on $96,000. But from their end, it’s blank. They won’t help us.” However, the Commonwealth Bank has countered their claims, asserting that the screenshots provided by the couple do not align with their records. The bank further contends that the couple’s account balance has yet to reach the claimed $90,000 mark. The bank’s statement reads, “On examination of the images of the receipts provided, the documents differ from genuine CBA receipts, and the receipt numbers do not exist in CBA’s records… CBA confirms that the screenshots do not match CBA’s records of your accounts or the balance held in your accounts. No transactions of $90,000 were attempted on either 30 June or 4 July.” Adding to the situation’s complexity, the bank explained that the funds in question were held in a savings account and could not be directly transferred to external banks. This ongoing dispute has jeopardized the couple’s dream of purchasing land near New South Wales. To navigate their financial crisis, they have had to rely on an existing loan to retain property ownership. As Houston lamented, “My partner and I have been together since we were 15 years old. We’ve saved for so long for this land, and our goal was always to pay it off before putting a house on it so we could travel. And now, it feels like everything’s been taken from under us.” The Bank of Melbourne, which is said to be the receiving bank in this transaction, has chosen not to comment publicly on the matter, leaving the young couple’s financial ordeal shrouded in uncertainty.",Crypto News|Australian Financial Complaints Authority|Commonwealth Bank|Financial Dispute,EN,0,0,FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-01-11 08:00:21

In an interview on the Mr. M Podcast, Hougan says that the price of Bitcoin could rise exponentially if the crypto king is adopted as a reserve asset by various countries across the globe. “There’s this question of whether we will see governments around the world starting to add Bitcoin to their own balance sheets. I would say that that possibility is not priced into the market at all. Like zero. If that becomes a reality, I think you’re talking about Bitcoin being many hundreds of thousands of dollars. There’s just not enough Bitcoin in the world to support, to facilitate that kind of demand without prices going substantially higher. So I think this is a real sea change. I think investors have underestimated it. I think it’s going to have a long-tail effect. It will extend the bull market substantially in 2025 and potentially beyond.” According to Hougan, the number of new Bitcoin expected to be mined in 2025 will be inadequate to meet the demand that he expects to come online. “The Bitcoin Network is going to produce about 160,000, 170,000 Bitcoin [in 2025]. Corporations bought 270,000 [BTC] last year, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) bought 400,000 – 500,000 [BTC]. Governments are talking about buying hundreds of thousands. Any one of these sources is more than all the net new Bitcoin that comes out of the market. And that means, just from a simple perspective, that in order to satisfy that demand, which I think is unstoppable, I think you’re going to see all three sources buy hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin. People who hold Bitcoin today have to sell. Maybe they’re willing to sell at $100,000. But if they’re not, what is the next level at which enough of them will sell? Is it $125,000? Is it $150,000? Is it $200,000? I think the market could sort of find itself in an air gap where people are unwilling to sell until it gets to a new major level. And that move could be very violent.” Bitcoin is trading at $94,744 at time of writing.

Lawmakers recently introduced a resolution aimed at including digital assets and precious metals in the state treasury to protect against inflation and economic uncertainties. Proposal to Diversify State Investments On January 7, North Dakota legislators presented House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) 3001. The resolution suggests that the State Treasurer and Investment Board invest in digital assets and precious metals to safeguard key funds, including the state general fund budget stabilization fund, and legacy fund. This step is seen as a way to strengthen the state’s financial future and mitigate risks posed by inflation. However, the proposal, sponsored by six Representatives and two Senators, focuses on creating a more diversified and strong treasury. While the resolution does not require immediate action, it shows a growing interest among lawmakers in adopting innovative financial tools. Transparency and Broader Trends To ensure transparency, the resolution calls for copies to be sent to the State Treasurer and Investment Board members. Interestingly, the proposal does not directly name Bitcoin, following a trend where state legislation uses “tech-neutral” language. For example, in New Hampshire, a bill introduced on January 9 advocates for digital asset investments, specifically allowing only cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $500 billion. This criterion effectively makes Bitcoin the primary candidate. Other States Embracing Crypto Too North Dakota isn’t alone in this push. States like Pennsylvania, Texas, Alabama, and Florida have recently explored creating Bitcoin strategic reserves. These efforts reflect the growing acceptance of Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. With support from organizations like the Satoshi Action Fund, states are exploring digital assets to enhance financial stability. If North Dakota moves forward with this proposal, it could set an example for other states, demonstrating how digital assets can play a role in strengthening public finances while addressing economic challenges.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-11 08:13:23

Pantoja shared a screenshot of Wall Street Journal’s predictions, showing Bitcoin at $183,587, Ethereum at $17,032, XRP at $1,046, and Litecoin at $982. Pantoja was specifically interested in XRP. The resurfacing of this prediction sheds light on the dynamic and speculative nature of cryptocurrency valuations. Few remember that in 2017 the @WSJ predicted $XRP to $1000. Back the we didn't talk much about ""market cap"" as a limiting factor. That's relatively new in crypto, brought in by stock market traditionalist to scare you away. pic.twitter.com/au6odwEgnO — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) January 8, 2025 In 2017, cryptocurrencies were experiencing unprecedented growth, fueled by increased mainstream interest and speculation. XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, saw a significant price increase, eventually peaking at $3.84 in January 2018. Pantoja highlighted an intriguing dynamic that has changed in the market and price predictions. Pantoja stated, “Back then we didn’t talk much about “market cap” as a limiting factor.” The Debate About XRP’s Market Cap XRP is currently trading at $2.32, with a market cap of $134.02 billion. If the asset maintains its current circulating supply of 57.44 billion tokens, a pride of $1,046 would send its market cap to $60.08 trillion. Some analysts have projected lofty targets of around $3 trillion , but this level eclipses those by a wide margin. Critics of overly optimistic predictions often cite market cap as a limiting factor, arguing that extreme price targets would require valuations that rival the economies of the entire world. Many of these detractors have criticized high targets for XRP. As the entire crypto market is currently valued at $3.29 trillion, they believe reaching such a high market cap is infeasible. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, in 2017, discussions around market capitalization were less prominent, and the focus was often on adoption potential, partnerships, and technological advancements. XRP’s valuation was frequently tied to its utility in facilitating cross-border payments, a market that remains a core focus for Ripple. Will the Market Cap Limit XRP’s Growth? The cryptocurrency market entered a phase of maturity in 2017. XRP, in particular, has faced challenges, including a high-profile lawsuit between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite these obstacles, XRP maintains a notable presence in the market and remains a widely traded asset. Following XRP’s rally of over 300% in November, discussions about its market cap have dwindled. Less than a year ago, many detractors did not believe that XRP could reach $1, but in December 2024, it crossed $2 for the first time since 2018. A veteran analyst recently said XRP could reach a $502 billion market cap . If the market keeps growing at its unprecedented pace, XRP could hit even higher prices sooner than its community members expect.

However, the bulls maintained the value above the $0.70 mark. This resulted in the altcoin experiencing a positive bounceback. Will the crypto bulls maintain their optimistic sentiments, to help the FTM crypto price reclaim its $1 mark this month? In this article, we have covered the short-term market sentiment, price analysis, and possible short-term price targets of the Fantom (FTM) crypto token. FTM Price Records Bullish Reversal! The Fantom price has jumped over 3% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $228.57 million, a change of +4.89%. Notably, this altcoin has displayed a significant price action over the past few days, highlighting increased price action. TradingView: FTM/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) constantly acts as a resistance to the FTM price chart in the daily time frame. This suggests an increase in the selling-over-buying pressure in the crypto market. On the other hand, the MACD indicator shows a constant decline in the red histogram. Further, its averages hint at a potential bullish convergence. This highlights a mixed price sentiment for the altcoin during the upcoming week. Will FTM Price Hit $1? If the bullish sentiment sustains, the Fantom coin price could retest its resistance level of $0.80. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for this altcoin to head toward its target price of $1 this month. On the contrary, if the bears regain momentum, the FTM crypto price could record a bearish reversal. This could result in the price of Fantom plunging toward its crucial support trendline of $0.60.

Both tokens are facing significant losses, with SHIB’s price falling by over 35%, and Ethereum is clinging to its $3,000 support. Amid this market dip, FXGuys ($FXG) has gained attention for its utility-driven DeFi token. Here are the full details of these intriguing trends! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Shiba Inu Suffers Setback as DeFi Coin Price Drops In recent weeks, the SHIB DeFi coin price has declined by over 35% from its December 2024 high. As of the first week of January 2025, SHIB’s price stands at $0.00002131 . This steep drop comes amid a larger market dip that has impacted various tokens. SHIB’s DeFi coin price is being pressured by a declining burn rate. Shibburn reports that the burn rate has fallen, which could worsen SHIB’s performance in the near term. This reduction in burning activity is linked to the underperformance of the Shibarium ecosystem, which plays a key role in burning SHIB. At its current pace, experts suggest that SHIB may dip further, potentially reaching a support level of $0.00001082. This would mark a 50% drop from its present price as the ongoing market dip continues to weigh on the token. In contrast to SHIB’s struggles, the new DeFi coin , $FXG, is gaining traction with a clear utility-focused roadmap. Ethereum Struggles in 2025: Market Dip Digs Deep as the $3,000 Support Beckons Ethereum’s DeFi coin price faltered at the start of 2025, marked by a sharp decline. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation has sold 100 ETH as its first transaction of the year. This sale, which exchanged the ETH for 329,463 DAI, was done to fund ongoing research and development projects. Despite the clear intention behind the move, Ethereum’s price dropped from $4,076 to $3,326 between December 2024 and January 2025, marking a notable loss. The market dip has provided an advantage to Ethereum bears, as the demand for ETH to maintain its price appears weak. Reduced commitment from traders in the derivatives market has resulted in insufficient buying pressure, leading to the drop. According to experts, if the ETH DeFi coin price fails to maintain its crucial $3,000 support level, the market might face further corrections. With both Shiba Inu and Ethereum facing notable price struggles, crypto enthusiasts are finding solace in the bullish outlook of the new DeFi coin—$FXG.

Looking ahead, a crypto expert predicts a bullish trend for ETH in both the short and long term. While other cryptos struggle to see a rebound, Ether could rally further, encouraged by an emerging ascending channel and technical indicators. Short-Term Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis The ETH price today trades at $3,234, with a 1% decrease in the past 24 hours as the broader crypto market trades sideways. Ethereum’s short-term outlook hints significant volatility and potential upside. According to the analyst, if the Ethereum price is accepted into this composite value area zone, the next price targets include $3,400, $3,500 & $3,600. In the case of a massively bullish scenario, projections hint at a target of $4,000 in the short term, potentially at the end of January 2025. The analysis favors a bullish outlook due to the double purge setup. This technical formation features a liquidations of a long position as price crashes. This drop attracts short positions, which are also liquidated as price bounces after tagging key support levels. The double purge previously acted as a strong buy signal, leading to a quick rally to $3,800. Source- X However, rejection at the composite’s lower level, where Ethereum currently trades, could trigger a pullback to two key support levels of $3,100 and $3,000, respectively. On-chain Data Shows It is a Good Time to Buy ETH Ethereum’s 30-day MVRV ratio suggests a high probability of a price reversal at current levels. The MVRV ratio has served as a key metric for identifying overbought or oversold conditions in the market. When the ratio aligns with significant support levels, it often signals potential accumulation by large investors. Supporting this observation, multiple indicators are reportedly converging, reinforcing the likelihood of increased buying activity. These conditions highlight a possible accumulation phase, with analysts pointing to whale activity as a precursor to upward momentum. This aligns with prior market trends where MVRV dips were followed by significant rebounds. #ETH ‘s 30-day MVRV history shows the probability of reversal here is high!

Analysts highlight an ascending parallel channel, indicating a critical support zone near $2,800. If the trend persists, the Ethereum price prediction could see significant upside potential, aligning with bullish market sentiment. Source: Tweet In summary, the Ethereum price is poised for growth, with short-term targets at $3,600 and $4,000 if current levels holds.

Despite the recent bearish outlook, this impressive milestone underscores SOL’s growing competitiveness and influence within the DeFi ecosystem. Shiba Inu’s price also plummeted toward $0.000022 on Wednesday, marking a monthly dip of over 17%. Shiba Inu’s technical indicators have also pointed out a bearish outlook as Remittix (RTX) presale momentum heats up. Remittix’s price is set to hit the $1 target in 2025, having already surged to $0,0193, with the next target being $0.0207 in the coming days. Solana Outshines Base and Ethereum in DEX Volume Amid Its Bearish Outlook According to DefiLiama , Solana-based DEXs recorded nearly $3.8B in trading volume on January 6, dwarfing ETH’s $1.7B and Base’s $1.2B. Solana’s remarkable growth in the DeFi sector has also been reflected in its total value locked, which surged from $1.4B in 2024 to around $8B at the beginning of 2025. This growth highlights the increasing liquidity and investor confidence in Solana’s ecosystem. Solana’s success can be attributed to its low fees, active community, and fast execution. Traders looking for explosive gains usually flock to meme coins and AI-related tokens. According to Grayscale research , the Solana ecosystem excels in these two sectors. However, despite its impressive milestone, Solana’s price movement continues to dip as it hovers above its critical support level of $190 . This level represents a key test for Solana’s price as it seeks to solidify a bullish trajectory. Technical indicators also point to a bearish outlook, with the RSI at 43. Shiba Inu Price Forecast: Will The SHIB Price Regain a Bullish Outlook Shiba Inu’s price has experienced a significant downtrend momentum this week. This bearish performance for the SHIB token mirrors the general crypto market, with the likes of Solana and Bitcoin also booking considerable losses. The dip in the price of Shiba Inu also marks a sharp correction within the weekly timeframe, reflecting bearish pressure that has persisted since the start of the year. The downtrend in SHIB price movement has been driven by hawkish expectations from the US Federal Reserve, which led traders to scale back exposure to high-risk assets, including meme coins like Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu’s attempts to stabilize around the $0.000023 level on Monday faltered as sellers intensified mid-week, pushing the SHIB price closer to its critical support level of $0.000020. The price action indicates a consolidation phase just above the $0.000020 level , with volatility set to persist in the short term. However, despite the recent dip, Shiba Inu wallets’ holding balance surged to 1.38M as of January 7, marking an ATH for this tier of addresses. Remittix’s PayFi Ecosystem Could Be the Next Big Innovation Within The Crypto Market Unlike traditional payment platforms in today’s market, Remittix (RTX) is a financial technology project that will enable international fiat currency transfers using advanced payment systems. It seamlessly connects digital currencies with traditional ones, allowing users to instantly convert cryptos into fiat currency and send the funds directly to any bank account globally. Recipients will receive the payments in their chosen fiat currency without even realizing that the transaction started from cryptocurrency. This will give users complete control and flexibility in transferring and managing funds. Moreover, the perks also extend by ensuring the transactions are processed without foreign exchange fees.

Due to its parabolic rally, many traders are shorting the token, hoping to profit from its downfall. However, data shows that short positions worth nearly $80 million will face liquidation if the price overcomes a critical resistance level. Ripple (XRP) Shorts’ Liquidation Risk: $80M on the Line Ripple (XRP) is at a crucial point, with the weekly and monthly charts presenting consolidation behavior. Presently, the token trades at $2.335 with $134B in market capitalization, showing massive user interest. CoinGlass data shows that with such interest comes heightened speculation, as nearly $80 million XRP short positions will face liquidation if the price overcomes the $2.40 resistance level. This means that short positions will be forcibly closed at a loss. Out of the $80 million, $8.08 million short sellers are from Bybit, $2.51 million, and $8.42 million are from OKX and Binance, respectively. The rest of the short positions belong to various popular cryptocurrency exchanges . High leverage is likely when volatility drops. Investors are often open positions with the expectation of massive gains on the breakout. As noted by MAXPAIN analyst, XRP is getting squeezed in a symmetrical triangle setup, awaiting a breakout rally. $XRP TA – price squeezed in symmetrical triangle = preapring for breakout – Bollinger Band Width (BBW) = Approaching local low = breakout imminent – but symmetrical triangle = no bias = could breakout in any direction – exaggerate bullish divergence = breakout likely bullish pic.twitter.com/g4uGjS5pLB — MAXPAIN (@Mangyek0) January 10, 2025 A Crash or Rally: What’s Next for XRP? If the price crosses above $2.40, it would liquidate nearly $80 million in XRP shorts. Typically, when short positions are closed either due to stop loss or margin call, the tokens are bought, creating buying pressure. If buyers time themselves, it could lead to a massive spike in bullish momentum that triggers a parabolic rally. But is that the case for XRP now? Unlikely. The four-hour RSI shows a downtrend as it struggles around the 50 mean level. A move above this level could result in a rejection, giving bearish momentum a chance to take over. Such a development could indicate a drop in the price. This outlook seems more likely considering the lower highs XRP has produced since the start of December 2024. If such an outlook unfolds, some key support levels to watch are $2.07, $2, and even $1.9, per crypto analysts’ predictions . A previous CoinGape XRP price prediction also hints at the price crash to $1.5 before forming a massive rally. After a bullish trajectory, XRP comes at a critical point with the Ripple news. This predicts the liquidation of the $80M worth of short positions if Ripple overcomes the $2.40 resistance level. Eventually, this could fuel a rally, triggering a breakout to the upside. In such a case, $2.90, $3, and $3.5 are key resistance levels to watch.

This has increased the spotlight on Sui, just days after the token hit a new all-time high. However, many investors have more faith in Propichain, citing its power to offer streamlined profit opportunities in the housing market. Read on to see why experts prefer Propichain to Sui. Experts Celebrate Sui’s Willingness to Partner with OpenAI The founder of Mysten Labs, the development team behind Sui, has released exciting news that confirms a possible mega AI collaboration in the future. The network founder highlighted the importance of pursuing AI to AI collaborations between Sui and OpenAI. Such a partnership could provide significant momentum for Sui’s growth, making it an attractive prospect for investors. Sui currently trades at $4.71, falling by 12.29% from its all-time high of $5.35. With talks of a possible collaboration with top AI companies like OpenAI, Sui could remain a top performer, rising to $7 in early February. Propichain: Creating Technology-Backed Investing Solutions for the Housing Market Propichain is an AI altcoin ecosystem that focuses on clearing the regular blocks in the traditional housing sector. It also prioritizes lowering investment costs and streamlining investor access to quality opportunities. Propichain’s first investing solution is fractional asset ownership. This innovative ownership model allows investors to acquire stakes in housing assets instead of purchasing them whole. This increases participation opportunities for lower-budget investors, providing opportunities that would have been unavailable in the traditional housing sector. After breaking down investment barriers with its fractional asset ownership model, Propichain further enhances its offerings by providing AI-driven tools designed to boost investing efficiency. Propichain’s AI-driven tools empower investors with advanced market analysis, trend assessment, and asset valuation. This makes it easier to discover investment properties that align with your financial goals. It also allows you to easily find market opportunities that match your investing ambitions. You can also tailor property searches to focus on specific types of housing assets. For instance, you can search for investing opportunities with high ROI potential. Even better, you can enjoy higher investing efficiency provided by Propichain’s automated trading features. Investors can complete deals using buy or sell orders that are completed automatically. These trade commands are activated based on the conditions you set. For instance, you can purchase a housing asset using a buy command that is only activated when the asset’s price falls to your preferred level. This takes investor convenience to another height. Propichain seamlessly integrates AI-powered insights with its metaverse-based services, giving investors access to both advanced analysis and global housing markets—all within a single platform. Propichain exposes investors to more housing opportunities via virtual tours that empower users to check out housing assets worldwide. Propichain investors can leverage this feature to scout housing properties in distant markets, all from the comfort of their homes. For instance, using these virtual tours, a London-based realtor can explore penthouse suites in Abu Dhabi without changing their location. Propichain also ensures that trades are backed by smart contract technology that guarantees high efficiency. These smart contracts provide near-instant transactions, allowing users to complete housing deals without the delays associated with the traditional housing sector. Propichain’s smart contracts can also be used to create specialized agreements for rental and leasing transactions.This ensures a seamless P2P trading experience, maximizing transaction speed and reliability. Sui and Propichain: Which Token Offers Better Returns? As Propichain’s AI altcoin gains momentum, it is being compared to leading digital assets like Sui, a token known for its innovation in the digital asset space. Interestingly, Propichain has won over many investors with two key moves. Firstly, its BlockAudit security certification has shown investors that its ecosystem is safe for real estate transactions. Propichain has also gone live on CoinMarketCap, further fueling belief in its long-term growth potential. Some analysts now claim that $1,000 worth of PCHAIN tokens could grow to $60,000 by Q2 2024. Propichain’s Presale: What You Stand to Gain As Propichain’s innovative features like fractional ownership and AI-driven tools gain traction, investors are flocking to the ongoing presale to purchase PCHAIN at an early, advantageous price. Investors who joined Propichain at the start of its presale have now earned a 208.17% interest from PCHAIN’s entry to round two of its presale. PCHAIN now trades at $0.011. However, round three of its presale will bring 108.93% to $0.023. This growth will continue until PCHAIN reaches its official launch price of $0.032. Don’t miss your chance to join the Propichain presale and secure PCHAIN at an early, advantageous price—before its value rises again.

The New Hampshire bill, championed by Representative Keith Ammon, opts for the broader term “digital assets” instead of explicitly naming Bitcoin. This careful phrasing, according to Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, aims to avoid political hurdles while clearly targeting Bitcoin. States Eye Strategic Bitcoin Reserves On the same day, North Dakota followed suit, with its bill spearheaded by Representatives Nathan Toman, Josh Christy, and Senator Jeff Barta. With 11 sponsors already on board, the North Dakota proposal appears to have strong bipartisan support. These states join Pennsylvania, which introduced similar legislation in November. Pennsylvania Representative Mike Cabell described Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, citing economic instability as a driving factor for considering such measures. The Satoshi Action Fund has played a pivotal role in shaping these legislative efforts, highlighting the growing interest among states to diversify their treasuries with Bitcoin. Trump’s Crypto Vision Fuels Momentum The push for state-level Bitcoin reserves has gained traction against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s pro-crypto campaign promises. Throughout his presidential bid, Trump vowed to position the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency and even hinted at directing the Treasury Department to amass significant Bitcoin reserves. Now, with Trump set to take office, industry leaders and policymakers alike are eager to see if these promises will materialize. Strike CEO Jack Mallers has speculated that Trump could sign an executive order on his first day in office, declaring Bitcoin a reserve asset. However, skepticism persists. Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz and other observers caution against high expectations, arguing that creating a national Bitcoin reserve may face considerable regulatory and logistical challenges. On Polymarket, bettors place the likelihood of Trump establishing a Bitcoin reserve within his first 100 days at just 27%, down from 45% in November. A New Chapter for Crypto in the U.S. The introduction of Bitcoin reserve legislation in multiple states signals growing confidence in cryptocurrency as a financial safeguard. While Trump’s upcoming presidency has sparked excitement among crypto advocates, the practical implementation of such bold measures remains uncertain. Still, the combined efforts of state legislators and federal promises suggest that Bitcoin’s role in the U.S. economy may soon expand in unprecedented ways.

The funds are going directly to the first responders battling California’s relentless wildfires. Ripple said it’s evaluating additional ways to help. California is burning. The wildfires ripping through Los Angeles have left behind destruction on an unimaginable scale. At least 11 people are dead, though the real toll is likely higher as authorities comb through obliterated neighborhoods. Over 12,000 structures are gone, and entire streets have been wiped out. These fires are raging in areas where wildfires are almost unheard of. Dry weather and unrelenting winds have fueled five major blazes, leaving firefighters scrambling to contain them. Just two days ago, Ripple announced that Chainlink would now provide real-time RLUSD pricing data, making it easier for decentralized finance (DeFi) developers to integrate the stablecoin into lending, trading, and other applications. Users can also connect smart contract apps to off-chain APIs through Chainlink’s decentralized data feeds, a move Ripple says will boost RLUSD’s use cases. Fires stretch resources to the limit The Palisades Fire has already burned through 21,000 acres. As of now, it’s only 8% contained, with evacuation orders spreading to Encino. Over in Pasadena, the Eaton Fire has scorched 14,000 acres and is barely 3% under control. Officials are bracing for even more powerful winds early next week, a development that could push the situation from catastrophic to apocalyptic. Governor Gavin Newsom is furious. Firefighters faced water pressure failures at hydrants, and water supplies from the Santa Ynez Reservoir didn’t show up when they were needed most. Newsom has called for an independent investigation, demanding answers for why California’s resources failed during one of its worst fire seasons ever. Personal tragedies are stacking up as fast as the fire spreads. Two residents were killed trying to save their homes. Another victim, a man who couldn’t evacuate because his son had cerebral palsy, perished alongside his child. One story stands out for how brutally these fires can upend lives. A 70-year-old woman lost her home and, with it, her entire life savings. Her nephew shared the heartbreaking details on X. The woman’s savings were in crypto, and her private key—the only way to access her holdings—was written on a piece of paper stored in the house. That paper, along with her funds, went up in flames. Her crypto holdings were mostly in Bitcoin, and without backups, they’re permanently gone. Hollywood is also throwing its weight behind relief efforts. Celebrities are writing checks, using their platforms, and rallying the entertainment industry to help wildfire victims.

Raoul Pal explained the phases of the ‘banana zone’. The CEO addressed the speculation about BTC retesting $75,000 levels. Bitcoin has moved into the green zone, rising above $94,000 after briefly dipping below $92,500. Many are now questioning its uncertain movement and what might happen next. Amid the market uncertainty, founder of Real Vision Raoul Pal, on a recent podcas t opened up about the concept of the “Banana zone.” The CEO also took to X (formerly Twitter) and wrote, “we are still in the Banana Zone.” What Is the Banana Zone? Raoul Pal explained the Banana Zone as a sequence of phases Bitcoin undergoes within its market cycles. The first stage typically involves a rapid surge in price, as we saw when Bitcoin soared from $50,000 to $100,000. After such a sharp increase, the market tends to correct, often causing panic among investors.

This has dwindled the chances of a Fed rate cut coming in March this year, which could further delay the chances of a BTC price rally to $200K this year. Fed Rate Cuts Delayed To June 2025 Following December’s employment data, top market analysts stated that the stronger-than-expected jobs market is likely to have stick inflation going ahead which would prevent the Fed from announcing rate cuts soon. The U.S. economy added 256,000 jobs in December, surpassing expectations of 164,000. On the other hand, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, better than the projected 4.2%. Goldman Sachs economists, led by Jan Hatzius, now anticipate Fed rate cuts in June and December 2025, as well as June 2026. This revises their earlier forecast of cuts in March, June, and September while maintaining their projection for a terminal rate of 3.5%-3.75%. According to a new report, Bank of America economists led by Aditya Bhave wrote : “After a very strong December jobs report, we think the cutting cycle is over. The conversation should move to hikes”. Economists Andrew Hollenhorst and Veronica Clark at Citigroup stated in a note that they are “not overly concerned about scenarios where the Fed refrains from cutting rates this year”. They added: While employment “is holding up better than we had expected, price and wage inflation are both cooling and should have officials comfortable cutting even in a still-strong economy”. BTC Price Recovery to See Delays? Following the all-time highs in December last month, the Bitcoin price has continued to stay under selling pressure slipping under $95,000 levels. However, with the Fed rate cuts, analysts are concerned that it could further delay BTC price recovery from here amid the absence of fresh liquidity. However, Bill Barhydt, founder of Abra Global, has forecasted the return of quantitative easing (QE) and looser bank balance sheet policies as necessary measures to address the 30-year U.S. Treasury bubble. In a statement, Barhydt asserted that upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts alone will not be sufficient to tackle the issue. “QE is coming. Fed rate reductions will not prick the 30-year Treasury bubble. Only QE and looser bank balance sheet policies will do that. Buckle up,” he said. Furthermore, Wall Street analysts are confident of a Bitcoin price recovery along with the expansion of the global M2 money supply. With Donald Trump’s inauguration just 10 days from now, the crypto industry is also hoping for the Trump effect to kick in. Bitcoin Chop Won’t Last Long Crypto analyst IncomeSharks has suggested that Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase may be shorter and more bullish compared to previous cycles. “Just be lucky we don’t have to chop for 7 months this time,” the analyst noted. However, the analyst noted that the current 2 to 3 months of consolidation could lead to capitulation for many investors. Source: IncomeSharks Despite this, IncomeSharks described the ongoing market movement as a “more bullish consolidation pattern than before,” signaling potential optimism for Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming months.

Market Stirring With Anticipation As Presale Nears End appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News This bull run is all about meme coins. New ones are popping up and making astronomical gains. Each falls distinctly into one of two categories. Either they emulate Dogecoin’s appeal and make (feeble) attempts to challenge it or pursue a unique image. Not DOGE2014 though. Instead of making false promises to dethrone the king of memes, it pays tribute to it. As Dogecoin hits 10 years of age, DOGE2014 offers people to relive its younger years. Its presale has been on fire and with just a couple of days left before it ends, the fever is reaching crescendo. Presale Ending, Celebrations Starting DOGE2014 is all about paying homage to the original meme coin, Dogecoin. Riding the popularity wave, the tribute-paying coin has been running a presale that offers the tokens at extremely steep discounts. While this has attracted meme coin lovers from every edge of the world, the demand has reached a fever pitch. Why? Because people are realizing the nostalgia that it offers. Dogecoin was a sarcastic jab in its early days and not taken seriously. But once it exploded, people regretted not getting in early. DOGE2014 takes people back a decade and offers to relive that again: Super cheap DOGE2014 in its presale . Speaking of the presale, the dash to grab the tokens has reached new heights. Over $800,000 worth of tokens have been snapped up. Why, you ask? Didn’t we tell you, the presale is about to end! The presale is slated to end on January 13th. That means there are just a couple of days left. Post-sale, the DOGE2014 community will start the real celebrations as they get their hands on the massive cheap assets along with bonuses and FREE Dogecoin. Wait, Free Dogecoin? Yes, you heard it right, presale participants are grabbing up free Dogecoin too. While DOGE2014 breaks down entry barriers by allowing small entrants too, the free Dogecoin is set aside for VIP members. Interested in the free DOGE? You still have time to enter the presale with a minimum of $1,000 to claim those as a VIP. But there is more to it than just free Dogecoin. DOGE2014 is also giving out prizes, with current prize potential as much as $20,000. Three lucky winners have already been paid, and if you take part, so can you! Take the plunge and see if you can make it on the leaderboard . While this gives you free Dogecoin and the chance to grab some cash winnings, your position on the leaderboard also serves to elevate you within the DOGE2014 community. Winnings and social status… what else could you ask for? Explosive Gains On The Cards DOGE2014 has set the token holders up for some big gains. A deflationary token, the increasing demand, and limited supply will push up the price in the long run, giving the same euphoria as Dogecoin does for early investors. The upward pressure will kick off as soon as the presale ends, for the DOGE2014 team will instantly burn away half of the token supply, making the tokens you hold worth so much more.

Chainlink’s Oversold Indicators Suggest Potential Rebound Chainlink (LINK) has been under some downward pressure, with the price fluctuating between $20.81 and $25.18. Over the past week, the price decreased by nearly 10%, and over the past month by about 12%. However, over six months, LINK has seen a significant increase of over 50%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below 30, which suggests that the token is oversold. This could indicate that the selling pressure is easing, and a reversal might be on the horizon. If the price breaks above the nearest resistance level at $26.8, LINK could target the next resistance at $31.18. This would represent potential gains of approximately 20% to 40% from the current price. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is slightly below the 100-day average, hinting at possible bullish momentum building up. Technical indicators like the Stochastic oscillator are also signaling oversold conditions. If market conditions improve, LINK might see a strong upward movement in the near future. Conclusion While LINK and other established tokens remain strong, XYZVerse’s unique blend of sports and meme culture positions it for significant growth in the current bull run.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS.

While retail investors panic, three major institutions have purchased BTC worth nearly $100 billion in 2024. Will these developments serve as a perfect storm to kickstart a bull run? Institutional Buying Spree Snaps Up Nearly $100 Billion BTC Institutions have been aggressively buying Bitcoin since the ETF approval. According to data platform Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock, MicroStrategy, and Fidelity have collectively purchased ~$100B worth of BTC. Specifically, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, alone bought $50B, while MicroStrategy, a software giant, managed to accumulate $24B worth of BTC. Fidelity stands on the low end after acquiring BTC worth $20B. This significant buying pressure, even with OTC deals, could impact BTC’s price in the ongoing bull run.

However, the 30-day percent change in long-term holder supply suggests that the distribution rate has likely peaked, aka coming to an end. This development indicates that long-term holders are likely done selling Historically, when long-term holders finish distributing their coins, the price of BTC tends to reverse the downtrend and kickstart a rally. LTH Long/Short-Term Holder Supply Ratio Retail Capitulation Reaches Peak CryptoQuant’s data on retail investors’ demand change shows peak capitulation from short-term holders. This indicator tracks retail investor volume, ranging from $0 to $10K. This indicator hit –22%, and history shows that such a steep decline in retail demand often indicates retail capitulation, which is where markets tend to bottom. BTC Retail Investor (Volume $0 to $10K by USD) Demand 30D Change All in all, the outlook of Bitcoin looks massively bullish, but a majority of retail investors are always caught on the wrong side. These signs often signal and allow smart traders to position themselves before a massive rally kickstarts. What’s Next for BTC Price in 2025? Here’s a crypto analyst’s take on why Bitcoin price could be forming a bottom around $90K to $91K, signaling the next leg of bull run. Is Bitcon Bottom In? Most likely. January 9's swing low ($91,151) could be the bottom. If not, then a sweep of $90,835 with a bullish swing failure pattern could suggest that a bottom is imminent. https://t.co/H2Spj0mvEM pic.twitter.com/ohZ0zmlIsB — MAXPAIN (@Mangyek0) January 10, 2025 If this outlook is true, and Bitcoin is forming a bottom, it could be preparing to resume the uptrend and explore new highs. Here are some targets for this next phase as noted in our 2025’s bold Bitcoin price predictions , the cycle top could form anywhere between $150,00 to $250,000. “CMT Analyst Adrian Zduńczyk is a firm believer that Bitcoin will peak at around $225,000 this cycle and is expecting BTC to transition from optimism to a belief phase.” Furthermore, several institutions and banks are also expecting a similar move from BTC in 2025. “Standard Chartered expects BTC price to hit a peak of $250,000 in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s head of digital asset research, noted that spot Bitcoin ETF flows could hit $50 to $100 billion by 2026. Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Tom Lee also shares this outlook.” Conclusion The convergence of institutional buying, long-term holders finishing their distribution, and retail investors’ capitulation is a perfect storm, signaling a bottom and an impending significant Bitcoin price rally. As institutions continue to invest in BTC, the stage is set for a potential bull run, with some analysts predicting a cycle top between $150,000 and $250,000.

Microsoft submits a complaint about an abuse of its services In its complaint, Microsoft highlighted that the defendants, which it refers to under the legal pseudonym ‘Does’ violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a law under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The company also alleged that the individuals broke a federal racketeering law by illegally accessing and using its software and servers to create harmful and illegal content. However, Microsoft has refused to enter into the details of the contents which it claimed were harmful and illegal. The company highlighted in its complaint that it discovered in July 2024 that some users with Azure OpenAI API Keys, a string of characters that is used to approve an app or user, were being illegally used to generate content that was not in line with the company’s acceptable use policy. According to the filing, Microsoft discovered that the users came in contact with the API Keys illegally through some users. In its statement, Microsoft claimed the way they got the keys remains unknown, but it strongly believes the defendants stole the keys. “The precise manner in which Defendants obtained all of the API Keys used to carry out the misconduct described in this Complaint is unknown, but it appears that Defendants have engaged in a pattern of systematic API Key theft that enabled them to steal Microsoft API Keys from multiple Microsoft customers,” the statement read. Legal verdict and future solutions According to Microsoft, the defendants particularly targeted United States users, with the company claiming that the group used the stolen Azure OpenAI Service API keys to create a scheme it called ‘hacking-as-a-service’. The complaint mentioned that the defendants created a tool called De3u, which works on the client side. They also created another software that processed and routed communication from De3u to the company’s systems. The firm noted that De3u leveraged the stolen API credentials to enable users to generate images using DALL-E, one of the OpenAI services open to users. However, the twist is that they can do so without writing their own codes. The filing also alleged that De3u also tried to stop the Azure OpenAI Service from reviewing prompts used to create images. The complaint mentioned that this only happens in a case where a prompt contains words that trigger the content filtering system on its platform. A repo containing the De3u code, which was noted on Microsoft-owned GitHub had been removed at the time of writing. Microsoft noted that the combination of the stolen Azure OpenAI Service API keys and the tools allowed the defendants to circumvent its content measures. “These features, combined with Defendants’ unlawful programmatic API access to the Azure OpenAI service, enabled Defendants to reverse engineer means of circumventing Microsoft’s content and abuse measures,” the company said. Meanwhile, the company, in a recent blog post , has mentioned that the court has approved its plea to seize a website integral to the defendants’ operations. Microsoft will use the opportunity to gather evidence and figure out how the service is being monetized in order to remove any technical infrastructure that is still remaining. The firm said it has put in measures to plug the gap, noting new safety measures for the Azure OpenAI Service. The company is also seeking injunctive and other equitable reliefs and damages.

Here’s what this could imply for the cryptocurrency’s price. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Pointing At ‘Neutral’ The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Ethereum Rally To $6,000 This metric uses the data of the following five factors to calculate its value: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. When the indicator has a value greater than 53, it means the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. On the other hand, it being under 47 implies the dominance of fear in the market. All values in the range lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two ‘extreme’ ones called the extreme fear and extreme greed. The former occurs at or above 75 and the latter at or under 25. Now, here is how the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is looking at the moment: As displayed above, the indicator has a value of 50, which implies the overall sentiment in the market is exactly in the balance. This is a stark change from yesterday, when the index was sitting at 69. The below chart shows how the Fear & Greed Index has seen its value change over the past twelve months. Just a few days ago, the indicator’s value was even higher at 78, meaning that the market held a majority sentiment of extreme greed. The sharp drop in the investor mentality since then is a result of the Bitcoin recovery rally fizzling out and turning into a price crash. This is the first time since the first half of October that the index has dropped into the neutral territory. Between then and now, the market only carried an optimistic atmosphere as the asset’s price was following an upwards trajectory. With this reset, though, it appears the investors are now unsure about the future of the cryptocurrency. If history is anything to go by, this may not actually be a bad thing. Bitcoin and other digital assets have generally tended to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the crowd; extreme greed is where major tops have occurred, including the one from last year, and extreme fear is where bottoms have taken place.

While the market hasn’t become fearful yet, the fact that there is no longer an excess of hype could still be something that can help the price find a reversal. It now remains to be seen how BTC and the market sentiment would develop in the coming days. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $94,200, down almost 4% in the last seven days.

Recently trading on the U.S. OTCQX market, the Company does not have a long track record and its shares are thinly traded in the U.S. Until the company differentiates itself from its competitors, U.S. investors are better off investing in one of the U.S. domiciled Bitcoin holding companies. Tokyo-based Metaplanet Inc. ( OTC:MTPLF ) (the "" Company "") is a Japanese investment firm following the Michael Saylor /MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ("" Bitcoin "") playbook (as describe herein, the "" Saylor Playbook ""). Originally a firm with diverse business interests, the firm has scrapped its prior business model and shifted its focus to Bitcoin. The "" Our History"" section of the Company's website discusses the shift: Metaplanet boasts over a decade of diversified business engagement. With deep roots in Japan, our dynamic team comprises seasoned professionals with expertise in finance, trading, real estate, and Bitcoin. In response to the pandemic-induced investment landscape, Metaplanet comprehensively restructured its diverse assets and businesses, paving the way for a strategic pivot towards a Bitcoin-centric vision."" Moreover, the Company is clearly all-in when it comes to Bitcoin, including a literal manifesto on its website. The manifesto states that: Metaplanet Inc., a publicly traded company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (3350), has embarked on a strategic transformation. By leveraging Bitcoin as its principal treasury reserve asset, Metaplanet will utilize excess cash flow and implement accretive corporate governance, including financial management strategies such as debt and equity financing, to further its Bitcoin accumulation. This strategic pivot is driven by Bitcoin’s unique attributes, including its absolute scarcity and apolitical monetary policy."" As reconstituted, the Company's core business segments are 1) Bitcoin investment, 2) Bitcoin Consulting, and 3) Real Estate. I will briefly discuss each of these business segments below in reverse order. Real Estate : With respect to its real estate portfolio, it appears to primarily consist of interests in hotels, including The Royal Oak Gotanda , a hotel located in the heart of Tokyo. In 2024, per a December 18, 2024 Earnings Forecast disclosure (the "" Forecast Disclosure ""), the Company advised that the hotel business performed well in 2024 with high occupancy and room rates. Specifically, for 2024, the Company has projected revenue of 370 million yen and operating profit of 135 million yen . Consulting : The Bitcoin consulting segment assists other businesses in adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, including related services. As far as I can tell, revenue from this segment is currently de minimis . Bitcoin Investment : The goal of the Company's Bitcoin Investment segment is ""to enhance shareholder value through strategic, perpetual Bitcoin accumulation, aligned with a proven long-term, value-accretive vision. Through this approach, Metaplanet is able to develop business verticals that align with the overarching mission of adopting a corporate Bitcoin standard."" The investment strategy involves financial engineering, including ""equity financing considerations and long-dated fiat currency market arbitrage, all executed within a Bitcoin-centric framework."" According to management, the strategy is currently working, even when unrealized appreciation in the price of its Bitcoin holdings is removed from the equation. For example, per the Forecast Disclosure: [I]ncome from selling Bitcoin put options, introduced during the current fiscal year [2024], is expected to generate 520 million yen in revenue. Combined with the strong performance of the hotel business, even though the SG&A expenses were expected to be about 385 million yen, the company is on track to record consolidated operating profit for the first time since FY2017."" Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the firm has announced a new initiative : The initiative seeks to leverage “long-term debt and periodic equity issuances to continually accumulate Bitcoin as an alternative to holding a weakening yen. This also includes tapping convertible bonds and other financial instruments to stack even more satoshis."" As of December 23, 2024, per its Notice-of-Additional-Purchase-of-Bitcoin (the "" Purchase Disclosure ""), the Company held 1,761.98 Bitcoin. At the time of writing, this translates into roughly $175 million worth of Bitcoin (assuming a Bitcoin price of $99,000). This compares to 141 Bitcoin held by the Company on June 30, 2024 and 399 Bitcoin held by the Company on September 30, 2024. The Company has clearly accelerated its acquisition of Bitcoin over the past few months. Bitcoin Yield Following MicroStrategy's lead, the Company utilizes the key performance indicator ("" KPI "") of bitcoin yield ("" BTC Yield ""). BTC Yield is a measure of the percentage change from one period to the next of the ratio of the Company's Bitcoin holdings and its assumed diluted shares outstanding (including potential shares from raising equity and convertible debt). The Company uses this KPI to assess the performance of its Bitcoin investment strategy. If successful, the strategy is accretive to shareholders in Bitcoin terms (e.g., each share of the Company represents a higher fraction of Bitcoin). In the second half of 2024 the strategy has been successful, as noted in the Company's recent Purchase Disclosure: The firm highlights that its newly implemented BTC Yield, a key performance indicator ((KPI)), is up from 41.7% between July and September 2024 to 309.82% between Oct. 1 and Dec. 23."" Of course, as a shareholder of the Company, an increasing BTC Yield is great so long as the price of Bitcoin continues to rise, in which case the high BTC Yield demonstrates management's ability to leverage equity and debt financing. If the Bitcoin price were to fall by 50% or more in the next downturn (not unrealistic based on past history, in which case the Company is like to fall by even more), then the additional Bitcoin accreting to shareholders will be of less value since no one wants to own more of a depreciating asset. [Of course, true believers in Bitcoin will simply ride the storm, believing that the asset will recover quickly and soar to greater heights in the future.] New Initiatives While the Company is clearly following the Saylor Playbook, I give it credit insofar as management is really trying to move the needle to advance Bitcoin. For example, the Company is launching a magazine , Bitcoin Magazine Japan, and rolling out some Bitcoin benefit options for shareholders, among other plans. Balance Sheet Operating as a foreign issuer, the Company is not subject to the same disclosure laws as public companies domiciled in the United States. A summary of the most recent balance sheet for the period ending September 30, 2024 is shown below. (Thousands of Yen) December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 Cash & Deposits 553,175 1,966,394 Total Current Assets 599,412 2,146,987 Bitcoin Assets -- 4,507,081 Total Non-Current Assets 1,066,725 5,629,873 Total Assets 1,666,137 7,819,250 Total Current Liabilities 378,125 2,413,501 Long Term Borrowing 130,501 135,515 Total Non-Current Liabilities 135,924 143,451 Total Liabilities 514,049 2,556,953 Shareholder Equity 1,152,087 5,262,297 The Company's current ratio declined from 1.58 at 2023 year end to 0.89 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. This is indicative of greater short-term leverage, and not a positive factor in my few. Moreover, while the total assets to total liabilities ratio was 3.06 on September 30, 2024, that ratio declined compared to total assets exceeding total liabilities of 3.24 on December 31, 2023. This suggests to me that management is adding risks that might not be fully appreciated by investors. Other risks of owning shares in the Company are analyzed below. Analysis of Certain Risks 1) A long-term investor should consider whether they should simply acquire Bitcoin directly rather than investing in a Bitcoin holding company like Metaplanet Inc. Investing in the Company requires confidence in management's ability to engage in successful financial engineering transactions. Such analysis of management competence is unnecessary when an investor simply buys Bitcoin directly. Moreover, management might put its own interests ahead of the interests of shareholders. Buying Bitcoin directly avoids such risk. 2) Bitcoin is a high beta investment. Investing in leveraged Bitcoin holding companies like the Company will only amplify the volatile ride, which many investors may not be equipped to manage successfully. 3) For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, per the Forecast Disclosure linked above, the majority of the Company's revenue (520 million yen ) came from its exercise of certain Bitcoin put option strategies, giving the Company a hedge fund vibe versus being an actual operating company. 4) The Company's operations utilize the Japanese yen , which has declined materially over the last five years. The chart below shows the performance of the yen via the Invesco CurrencyShares® Japanese Yen Trust ETF ( FXY ) and the US Dollar Index ( DXY ). Seeking Alpha Needless to say, ownership of the Company includes material foreign currency risk associated with the yen . 5) While the Company started trading on the U.S. OTCQX market on December 19, 2024 , it is ultimately hard to see how the Company, as a foreign issuer with yen exposure and a limited track record, will differentiate itself to U.S. investors in the near term. Investors can buy Bitcoin directly or they can buy a U.S. domiciled Bitcoin holding company like MicroStrategy, which, notably, is now included in the Nasdaq 100 index and the beneficiary of passive flows and high trading volumes. The Company on the other hand has very low trading volume in the U.S. (e.g., per Seeking Alpha , less than 500 shares exchanged hands on January 8, 2025). Conclusion Based on the foregoing analysis, I see no reason for U.S. investors to acquire shares of the Company at this time. I'll check back in on the Company later in the year to see if the story has changed. For now, I am staying on the sidelines. Of course, do your own due diligence.",BTC-USD|MSTR|MTPLF,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-11 09:32:44

Despite the waning momentum in the market, the cryptocurrency sector in 2025 is simmering with presales that are chock full of promise. These presales provide an opportunity to invest in projects that will define the development of blockchain, including Decentralized Finance and other spheres. Aureal One is one of the top picks for having been established to offer a unique convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain solutions. Aureal One is among the promising crypto presale you should consider now with incredible possibilities for early entrants. Let’s pick some of the high-potential crypto examples of the best crypto presale that are unique and capable of growing exponentially. 6 Best Crypto Presale Aureal One (DLUME) DexBoss (DEBO) yPredict (YPRED) Meta Masters Guild (MEMAG) BlockDAG (BDAG) SolarChain (SLC) All of these projects exist to meet different goals and wants. When it comes to presales, something new and extraordinary is happening across multiple industries, and these are exciting for anyone who is seeking promising crypto presales. Aureal One (DLUME) The core areas of interest for Aureal One are gaming, metaverse, and blockchain. This one supports Darklume Metaverse and the Clash of Tiles games. DLUME is the only cryptocurrency of the Aureal One ecosystem whose purpose is to finance the ecosystem. It can assist in exporting its products free of charge and even subsidize those who operate under its mechanism. It includes the integration of Zero-Knowledge Rollups, which is a solution to the need to overcome severe limitations of present blockchains in heavily populated industries such as gaming. This makes it the best crypto presale, with mega-profits expected in this bull run. Click here to know more about Aureal One Tokenomics Current Price: $0.0011 Listing Price: Projected at $0.005 Presale Allocation: 23.36 billion DLUME Funds Raised: $2.4 million (as of January 10, 2025) Roadmap Aureal One has laid out a detailed roadmap for its development and adoption: Phase One (Q4 2024): Transfer presale DLUME tokens which are tokenized on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) Phase Two (Q1 2025): Blockchain construction of Aureal One starts. Phase Three (Q2 2025): Some game concepts for the Alpha release, including Clash of Tiles. Phase Four (Q3 2025): Total swap of the tokens and launch of DLUME coin. DexBoss (DEBO) The DEBO token behind DexBoss is rather popular in the cryptocurrency community due to its take on DeFi and its vast expansion potential. DexBoss is a new simple Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that wishes to revolutionize the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. This transformation also allows for a link between high liquidity, transaction clearing using centralized exchanges immediately, and safe and accurate decentralization. Some of the fees are paid in DEBO tokens, which are then used in a ‘deflationary’ manner by ‘reclaiming’ the DexBoss tokens, which may only be appreciated over time. DEBO has a rather low presale price at $0.011, while its expected listing price is $0.0505. Due to that, DexBoss is suitable as a high-potential crypto for the best crypto presale. DexBoss Tokenomics Current Price: $0.011 Listing Price: $0.0505 (a projected 400% increase). Presale Allocation: 65% of 1.53 Billion DEBO tokens. Funds Raised: $360K (as of January 10, 2025) Roadmap To Success DexBoss has direction, starting from the concept of the beta platform in Q3 2025 to the fiat on and off-ramp in Q4. From a liquidity farming perspective, applying semantically enriched trading instruments, these attributes define the platform environment necessary for sustainable and long-lasting existence. yPredict (YPRED) yPredict is an artificial intelligence based on predicting results and provides the real signal of the market and forecast to the trader for appropriate decision making. Its method is quite different from other ones because this tool is targeted at market analytics mainly. However, one cannot dismiss its potential; thus, YPRED should be a candidate for the list of the best crypto presales at any time by any investor. Meta Masters Guild (MEMAG) MEMAG gains a spot among the best crypto presales as it is perfect for gamers. This decentralized gaming ecosystem is a collection of Web3 games that gives out NFTs and tokens and is devoted to delivering beneficial NFTs and tokens to players. The ecosystem will operate on MEMAG, the platform’s token, which will be used to purchase in-game assets, trade NFTs, and stake tokens for a chance at rewards. Meta Masters Guild will also create a marketplace where players can purchase, sell, and exchange the game’s NFTs. Currently, Meta Masters Guild is among the top cryptos that investors should consider buying during the presale project because it offers massive returns and ensures investors make the right investment decision in the market. BlockDAG (BDAG) The BlockDAG (BDAG) uses a needed and fancy feature which is the DAG, meaning Directed Acyclic Graph, with the mission of trying to make the transaction processing as fast as possible. As a large number of fast transactions becomes even more necessary, BlockDAG is the ultimate blockchain innovation. This new project will give investors another chance to participate in the blockchain sector at one of the lowest token prices in a network that has great potential for its widespread adoption by many businesses. With rapid throughput, blockchain, and efficient economic throughput, in addition to being scalable for 2025 blockchain growth, this architecture makes it one of the best crypto presales to purchase to record potentially high gains. SolarChain (SLC) In investment, SolarChain combines the blockchain with that process permitting users to tokenize solar projects. This green energy initiative is an article concerning different green ways of investment and distinguishing between investment courses with the standard investment processes. Under the presumption that the SLC token is currently at $0.04 before the presale, it will attract all who want a good profit and a good deed all in one. Over time, as more renewable energy sources are harnessed, SLC might crop up among the next crypto to hit the $1 mark. This position makes the token gain a place among the best crypto presales in the ever-growing space. Conclusion Aureal One truly stands out as a new approach to scaling and metaverse integration, so it is a good investment that should be considered. Its core technology allows it to become a member of the blockchain universe, while its presale strategy is one of the most successful ones. However, many other promising projects can demonstrate high potential thanks to rather interesting innovations such as DexBoss, yPredict, and Meta Masters Guild. But wait—it is time you grab these best crypto presales, especially Aureal One , which is waiting to provide great returns to investors who want to ride this bull cycle in profits.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-11 09:34:43

In his X post , Willy Woo wrote: “Risk is peaking for the first time in this cycle, and there’s a ton of profit in coins that have been selling and plenty more profit-taking to go before we are properly reset.” Analyst calls for caution in the coming months since Bitcoin market may soon reverse Willy Woo maintains that despite the market’s seeming uber-bullish, traders should not go in deeply in the months ahead; rather, they should be cautious. He pointed to his Bitcoin local risk model, which suggests very high-risk levels that have not been experienced since 2023. Other sources, including the Fear and Greed index , indicate the overall crypto market is still bullish. The Fear and Greed index has always measured market sentiments for cryptocurrency and altcoins. The index currently scores 69, which is 19 points up from January 10, when it was neutral at 50. Bitcoin has already retraced its trading above $100,000 and is now holding at $94,212 , down 3.92% over the last week. This is a testament that reversing may soon be significant and may hurt most investors. Other analysts and crypto traders believe the drop in Bitcoin price won’t last Although Woo’s advice should be considered, not all analysts agree. Some believe the drop will be a short-term bear moment. Anonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital, in his X post on January 10, feels otherwise. Rekt Capital said the 15% drop from Bitcoin’s all-time high on December 17 is similar to previous patterns Bitcoin has shown. He further clarified that the timing of the drop is in line with historical tendencies. It may, therefore, begin growing sooner than anticipated. On the other hand, Jan3 CEO Samson Mow told his 327,000 X followers that all dips are fake if you know how to comprehend the Macro landscape. He further claimed that dips are a creation meant to reduce Bitcoin prices for rich players to purchase.

Allegedly, these platforms that help hide the sources of transactions were used by hackers for crypto-currency laundering of money received from ransomware attacks, virtual currency thefts, and other unlawful activities. The accused are Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, 55, and Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, 44, detained on December 1, 2024. The third defendant, Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov, 32, is still on the loose. Blender.io and Sinbad.io: Key allegations Blender.io lasted from 2018 to 2022 and marketed itself as a platform which respects user anonymity and does not retain any transaction or user details. After the shutdown of the original site, Sinbad.io appeared, providing the same Bitcoin-mixing services. According to investigators, both offered users a service that would mask trader identities for a fee, suggesting that cybercriminals from around the world flocked to the platforms to wash ill-gotten gains. Sinbad.io was taken down in November 2023 in an action led by the Dutch police and the FBI in cooperation with the Finnish police. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : K-pop’s Cube Entertainment CEO Accused of Misleading Investors in Crypto Scam , Links to Global Cybercrime The two have been recognized by the OFAC – the United States Department of Treasury Office. Blender.io was found to have connectivity to North Korea’s Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) where it engaged in the facilitation of the laundering of siphoned cash and also extension of patronage to ransom hackers. Likewise, the newly identified domain Sinbad.io has links to DPRK-backed cyber actors and other cybercrimes. Cryptocurrency mixer services, such as Blender.io and Sinbad.io remain a thorn in cybersecurity because they provide anonymity to criminal transactions. The charges on the criminals include conspiracy to engage in money laundering and conducting business via an unlicensed money transmitting business. Both defendants can receive up to 20 years for the conspiracy to money laundering, and another five years for each company operated without a license. The defendants will stand trial and will be sentenced according to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutory factors by federal district court judges. On the other hand, apprehension of Tarasov is still ongoing and the police do not let up in chasing and eradicating such operations internationally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In less than a month since launching its presale, Solaxy has already raised $9.4 million from early investors. Solaxy is Solana’s first-ever Layer 2 blockchain, and is establishing a reputation as the next go-to platform for meme coin trading. In a year that should see meme coins continue the explosive run that began in 2024, Solaxy’s potential to ease congestion and increase transactional efficiency may be the catalyst that keeps the supercycle alive well into 2025. SOLX functions as both Solaxy’s native token and a multi-chain coin, and is designed to link Ethereum’s massive $65 billion DeFi TVL with Solana’s speed and cost-effectiveness. With its presale eyeing the $10 million funding milestone, SOLX looks ready to ride the wave of high demand once it lists on major exchanges. You might also like: Solaxy presale raises $4.5M for Solana Layer 2 solution – next crypto poised to explode How Solaxy could set the stage for a meme coin supercycle The meme coin market surged from about $20 billion at the start of last year to more than $120 billion by December 2024. This was a massive 6x growth in just around 12 months. Although a short dip in late December briefly shook investor confidence, the new year has witnessed many new meme coins surging again. Meme coin sector market cap — CoinMarketCap SPX6900 (SPX) recently hit a billion-dollar market cap, while other projects like Akuma Inu (AKUMA) and ShibaBitcoin (SHIBTC) are also looking to approach this milestone. In many ways, 2024’s momentum shows no sign of easing, and analysts expect 2025 to bring even more significant gains. With Solana already being one of the hottest chains for hosting new meme coins, it occasionally struggles under heavy usage and scalability issues. This is where Solaxy steps in. It’s the first Solana Layer 2 chain, and is already becoming known for its low fees and lightning-fast transaction processing. What makes Solaxy stand out? Solaxy boosts Solana’s throughput by routing off-chain activities through its Layer 2 protocol, and settling on the main chain in organized batches. It addresses some of Solana’s biggest hurdles: network congestion, random transaction failures, and scaling difficulties. Solaxy’s dev team believes it could surpass Lattice-based hashing systems in terms of efficiency. The immediate result will be seamless, near-instant trade confirmations, and a strong foundation for decentralized apps. Such an upgrade is especially useful for meme coin traders, who rely on speed to capitalize on market pumps. Given how rapidly meme coins can skyrocket, being able to trade them quickly is crucial. If speculation on 2025’s meme coin supercycle heats up even more, SOLX and the entire Solaxy infrastructure can cater to the increasing demand. Is SOLX the next SOL? As a multi-chain token, SOLX unlocks the best advantages of both Ethereum and Solana, drawing on Ethereum’s liquidity while deploying on Solana’s high-speed, low-fee mainnet. As the Solaxy network’s native cryptocurrency, SOLX will be used for governance, staking, transaction fees, and more. The top Layer 2 tokens in the crypto market carry valuations above $1 billion. Should Solaxy live up to its hype, SOLX could rank alongside them. Popular crypto analysis portals like 99Bitcoins have already identified SOLX as a coin with a possible 10x trajectory. Solana famously emerged as a potential “Ethereum killer” in 2020, and has risen from about $2.85 in August 2020 to nearly $195 today. That climb has awarded exponential gains to early supporters. This is why many investors regret missing Solana’s early days – and now, SOLX might be their next big opportunity. If Solaxy becomes a popular destination for meme coin projects building on Solana, it may well be on its way to replicate SOL’s historic gains. Having raised $9.4 million through its ICO in just a few weeks, SOLX is proving that its demand could spike even higher once it debuts on exchanges. How to join the SOLX presale With the SOLX presale nearing $10 million in total funds raised, early buyers can still buy SOLX at its discounted presale price (currently $0.001596). To join the presale, head over to Solaxy’s official website and buy SOLX using ETH, USDT, BNB, or a bank card. A crypto wallet is needed to the presale’s interface. One of the most popular choices that’s free to use is Best Wallet – although the presale also accepts Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, and Wallet Connect. Right after buying, users can stake their SOLX via Solaxy’s staking protocol, which currently offers an APY of 372%. For more information, visit the Solaxy token presale website .

The SolidProof audit gives it credibility, making investors trust it. LHUNT is quickly turning into a top crypto for passive income. Should the market condition remain bullish, the token could find its way to $0.005 at the time of listing. 2. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera Hashgraph is a next-generation distributed public ledger platform for enterprise usage. The platform uses a particular consensus algorithm known as the Hashgraph consensus that provides high-speed transactions, low fees, and high security. Hedera also notably launched HashAxis, an NFT marketplace that leverages the network for low-cost, scalable NFT minting and trading. In addition to that, Hedera has teamed up with Filecoin to further Web3 interoperability, idealizing the combination of distributed ledger offerings with decentralized storage solutions. 3. Aave (AAVE) Aave is a DeFi (decentralized finance) protocol that allows users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on multiple cryptocurrencies. It runs on several chains, Ethereum and a Polygon, with various assets and liquidity pools. Aave’s most unique features include flash loans, which allow people to borrow assets with no collateral and just one transaction, and rate switching, allowing borrowers to change between a fixed or variable interest rate. In recent days, Aave’s growth appears to have broken the record, with net deposits surging to $33.4 billion, the most so far. The growth is also indicative of the growing acceptance of DeFi platforms and just how important Aave is in the shifting financial landscape. 4. Filecoin (FIL) Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that lets users rent out unused storage and obtain data in a safe and economical way. The goal is to develop a peer-to-peer storage marketplace, which will cut the dependence on central cloud storage providers. Filecoin’s network is built upon the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed filesystem and peer-to-peer network for storing and accessing data created by friends that you may know or don’t know. In recent news, Filecoin has enlisted with Hedera Hashgraph to lead in Web3 interoperability by using the distributed ledger solution with a decentralized storage capability. Furthermore, Filecoin initiatives like Filecoin Green have been introduced to measure and reduce the environmental impact of the network. 5. Mantle (MNT) Mantle is a scalable, efficient blockchain network for dApps with a near-zero transaction fee and high throughput. In recent times, Mantle has introduced massive developments like the implementation of zk Validity Rollups, which means the network wouldn’t have to deal with each transaction on its own, increasing its performance. This improvement improves the performance and the scalability of the whole platform, thus making it more attractive to developers in the space of decentralized finance (DeFi). Also, Mantle has been working actively on developing excellent partnerships to help push its ecosystem further and grow adoption. Why LuckHunter Is the Best Pick: Top Cryptos To Buy Now In the crypto market, volatility is still the norm, and holding the right crypto newly added to your collection can help you make significant returns. Lagging behind such projects as Hedera (HBAR), Aave (AAVE), and Filecoin (FIL) in their respective niches, LuckHunter (LHUNT) is a ray of uniqueness. Using blockchain, combining a blockbuster VR game with a flourishing metaverse, LuckHunter brings utility, transparency, and earning potential to the world of gamblers and cryptocurrency investors alike while positioning itself as a top pick. LHUNT is preselling, and it has far raised over $1.12 million with a target listing price of $0.005.

Table of Contents Super Trump Lightchain AI Why Lightchain AI stands out compared to STRUMP As the cryptocurrency market evolves, investors are increasingly prioritizing innovation and utility over hype. While Super Trump (STRUMP) has gained attention for its meme-inspired origin, Lightchain AI has emerged as a preferred choice for long-term value. With $8.5 million raised in its presale and a token price of $0.004875, Lightchain AI is capturing the attention of savvy investors. Super Trump Super Trump jumped into the meme coin space with a splash, drawing comparisons to heavyweights like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu . With vibrant branding, fun, and clever social media campaigns, STRUMP has captured the attention of short-term traders and daring investors looking to cash in on its high-risk, high-reward appeal. However, STRUMP faces hurdles that might challenge its long-term success. Like many meme coins, its value heavily depends on market sentiment, online hype, and community activity. The absence of tangible utility raises doubts about its ability to sustain momentum.

Tickets for the reception are going for $100,000 each or… https://t.co/yP8ByHh1VV — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 11, 2025 As reported by Cryptopolitan, the event, organized by BTC Inc. and Stand With Crypto, will take place on January 17 at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. In her post, Terret also noted that tickets for the reception are priced at $100,000 each. Attendees can also opt for a package of four tickets for $1 million, which includes a single ticket to a future dinner with President Trump. Crypto industry takes over Washington Industry leaders believe the Crypto Ball is a significant shift in the cryptocurrency sector’s relationship with Washington. The event, sponsored by Trump affiliates and known associates, is a signal that the incoming administration could become the most pro-crypto government in US history. Policy experts anticipate the administration will push for regulatory changes aligned with the sector’s interests, including a focus on creating a crypto-friendly environment for innovation and financial access. Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano’s IOHK, confirmed that representatives from his organization would attend the event. We got 5 people, i believe, going — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 11, 2025 Prominent crypto companies such as MicroStrategy, Coinbase, Marathon Digital, Galaxy Digital, and MetaMask have joined as sponsors, underscoring the industry’s enthusiasm for the event. The Crypto Ball’s announcement initially saw tickets priced at $2,500. However, demand has driven the cost up to $5,000. Organizers expect attendance to include industry heavyweights, policymakers, and crypto advocates eager to network and discuss the future of cryptocurrency under the Trump administration. US crypto regulation is changing: From outsiders to influencers Jack Posobiec, a prominent MAGA podcaster and one of the event’s organizers, described the Crypto Ball as a “spiritual successor” to the 2017 DeploraBall. “ Before, we were the outsiders looking in, and now we’re walking in the front door, ” Posobiec said. “ This is a regime change .” Trump’s views on crypto are a stark contrast to the Biden administration’s regulatory stance, which many in the industry viewed as restrictive. The 47th US President’s inauguration signals a shift toward fostering American leadership in cryptocurrency, given his appointments of crypto-friendly SEC Chair Paul Atkins and White House Crypto Czar David Sacks. On the campaign trail, Trump branded himself as the “crypto president,” courting the industry with pledges of a supportive regulatory environment. Insiders expect the administration to issue a series of executive orders to deliver on these pledges. The president-elect made several promises , including the creation of a national bitcoin reserve. He also vowed to push regulators to allow crypto firms have access to banking services, and establish a dedicated crypto council. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, echoed the administration’s commitment to reversing what he called a bureaucratic effort to stifle innovation. “ President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto, ” Hughes reiterated. Trump is now the clear “pro-crypto” candidate. The Democrats made him it by default. They gave him a free, easy and growing political win with almost zero downside, purely by following Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden on their anti-crypto crusade. pic.twitter.com/mdFHjFoimn — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) May 26, 2024 While most crypto executives are optimistic, some analysts remain cautious of Trump’s crypto policies. Jonah Crane, a partner at the financial firm Klaros Group, pointed out that federal bank regulators operate independently, limiting the immediate impact of executive orders. “ They are not going to change policy on the ground on day one, ” Crane said. “ But they will tell you what direction this administration wants to head. ” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|ADA|BTC Inc|Coinbase|Galaxy Digital|IOHK|Marathon Digital|MetaMask|MicroStrategy|Stand With Crypto|USD,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-11 10:01:09

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK.

(Rating Upgrade),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4748872-mara-holdings-stock-should-shorts-be-worried?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary MARA Holdings has aggressively bought Bitcoin, raising over $2.1 billion through zero-interest convertible notes, significantly increasing its BTC-backing per share. The company mined 2,514 BTC in Q4-24, with potential annualized revenue of $1 billion at a $100k BTC price. MARA's high short interest and reliance on Bitcoin price increase create a potential short squeeze setup should BTC's price generate a new high. While MARA's strategy mimics MicroStrategy's, its success likely hinges on perpetual Bitcoin appreciation and investor appetite for share price volatility. In the three months since my prior Seeking Alpha article covering MARA Holdings ( MARA ) was published at just under $18 per share, the company has seen the stock price explode up near $30 and fall back down under $18 again - all while it has closed two separate rounds of convertible senior notes at zero percent. Far from the only company jumping on the bandwagon, MARA has been on a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) buying spree reminiscent of what we've seen from Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) in recent months. In this update, we'll look at MARA's aggressive Bitcoin buying in Q4-24, the company's mining production, and the seemingly increasing potential for a short squeeze in MARA shares. The Saylor Way MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has created a monster. Borrowing dollars at low or even zero-interest to buy an asset that has generally appreciated in nominal dollars during its 16-year existence is just one part of the game. The real product that has made MSTR's moonshot such an interesting story is that the company is basically selling large investors price volatility in its common stock shares. So far, it has created a feedback loop that is equal parts fascinating and potentially dangerous, from where I sit. Zero-interest or not, levering up to buy an asset that can fall in price by as much as 10% in a matter of just a few minutes is a bold treasury strategy and that is likely even more true for a Bitcoin miner like MARA. The underlying business that MARA has operated since I've been covering the stock is Bitcoin mining. I doubt I need to explain this, but typically miners are in the business of selling Bitcoin to cover things like operating costs, capex, and SG&A. In a theoretically efficient operation, miners should be able to pay all-in costs with mined coins and still have some production left over to 'stack sats' for long term shareholder value and for funding growth. Bitcoin Treasury Additions 2024 Mined 9,457 Purchased 22,065 Total 31,522 Source: MARA Holdings In practice, growth and operations have generally been funded through capital raises and shareholder dilution. The economics of mining are so challenging long term, that we've even seen mining companies shift to buying Bitcoin in addition to the coins that they mine. MARA bought more than twice as many Bitcoins as it mined in 2024 and most of those purchases came in the last several weeks of the year with roughly 15k BTC bought between late November and the end of the year: MARA Holdings BTC Stack (BitcoinTreasuries) As mentioned earlier, the funding from those purchases has come through convertible note offerings. Going back to the summer, MARA has closed three such offerings: Convertible Notes Rate Maturity Raised August 2024 2.125% 2031 $300 million November 2024 0% 2030 $1 billion December 2024 0% 2031 $850 million Source: MARA Holdings Over the course of just four months, MARA Holdings has raised over $2.1 billion through convertible notes. On paper, this has been highly beneficial to shareholders when judging purely by the Bitcoin-backing of the company's shares: MARA Sats Per Share (MARA, Author's Calculations) At the end of December, MARA's 339.4 million common shares were supported by just under 44.9k BTC. The math on that is 13,227 'sats per share' backing MARA shares. This is the largest sat-backing MARA shares have had in at least the last three years. Even when adjusting for the company's assumed dilution through convertible notes, the BTC-backing per share has increased year over year. MARA Holdings 12/31/2023 9/30/2024 12/31/2024 Bitcoin Holdings 15,174 26,747 44,893 Assumed FD Shares Outstanding (000s) 254,888 341,932 463,400 BTC per 1,000 Shares 0.0595 0.0782 0.0969 Source: MARA Holdings, Author's Calculation Using the assumed fully diluted shares outstanding, there is 0.0969 BTC per FD MARA share - dubbed the 62.7% 'BTC yield.' This gives MARA a $9.20 fully diluted share value in Bitcoin alone at $95k BTC. At the non-diluted 339.4 million shares outstanding figure, MARA's 13,227 sats/share give MARA shares a $12.53 BTC-backing currently. Which could be interpreted as the market assigning just a $5.33 per share valuation to the company's actual mining business if one assumes the BTC purchased through convertibles won't have to be liquidated to meet the company's obligations. Q4 Production During the month of December, MARA mined 890 BTC on an energized hash rate of 53.2 EH/s. That final month take gave MARA 2,514 BTC mined during the quarter: Monthly Production (MARA, Author's Chart) For the three month period, MARA mined an average of 838 BTC per month. At a $100k BTC price, MARA averaged slightly over $1 billion in annualized revenue from mining BTC. Though the ceiling for this company may be much higher. For instance, if we take the view that BTC will hit $200k this cycle, MARA's Q4 mine production implies an annualized revenue rate of $2 billion. That puts the current price of MARA at just 3x forward sales. And again, the share value backing of MARA through just its Bitcoin holdings would put a floor bid under MARA of roughly $25 at that Bitcoin valuation - a nearly 40% premium over current shares. To be clear, this is just guessing. I'm not even sure BTC will get to $200k per coin. But it may not even have to given the potential squeeze dynamics in MARA shares if BTC simply breaks out to a new high. Short Squeeze Setup? Of the top 5 US-listed Bitcoin mining equities, no company has a higher percentage of shares outstanding sold short than MARA Holdings: Data by YCharts At 23%, the only mining company that even comes close to this metric is CleanSpark ( CLSK ). How does this short interest compare with MSTR? Data by YCharts Consider that MARA and MSTR have had a fairly close correlation in percent of shares outstanding sold short going back to 2021. That changed in 2024 with MARA heading higher and MSTR's short percent dropping. Now, MARA Holdings is utilizing the MSTR Treasury management strategy. Will it have the same impact on those betting against the stock? Time will tell. Risks The obvious risk to me is MARA has made itself even more reliant on the success of Bitcoin than it already was. Unlike MicroStrategy, which operates a separate software business, MARA's core business is exposed to Bitcoin prices - giving the company's stock price no real insulation should the price of BTC go down. And the economics of that business are dubious long term. Mining is capital intensive and MARA's estimated break-even price is higher than current Bitcoin levels. Furthermore, miners buying BTC to add to Treasury stacks is not a new concept. Bitfarms ( BITF ) did something similar shortly after the market top in November 2021. Following the collapse of Terra in May 2022, Bitfarms quickly sold down its BTC Treasury stack from over 6,000 BTC in May down to about 400 by December. The company's share price ended 2022 96% off its stock price high from November 2021. Likewise, borrowing to maximize returns from what may feel like a winning strategy has been seen before as well. Back before it was converted to a spot ETF, 3AC used debt to play the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) NAV rate arbitrage and went bust when the NAV rate went deeply negative. The point is, there are no sure things. Closing Summary For Bitcoiners, it's hard to argue with MARA implementing the MicroStrategy ' infinite money ' strategy. MARA has essentially given itself a floor price through its Bitcoin holdings and was able to raise nearly $2 billion through zero interest convertibles. If you believe Bitcoin will continue to appreciate in price, taking a shot on MARA might not be that bad of a bet, in my opinion. But this is all reliant on the price of Bitcoin increasing essentially in perpetuity and investors' willingness to buy share price volatility through convertible notes. I'm not sure either can continue forever. But for now, I think it's a tough trade to fade.",BTC-USD|MSTR|MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-11 10:05:23

The altcoins continue to struggle as SOL, ADA, and AVAX have charted 4% daily declines. BTC Calms at $94K It was nothing short of a volatile rollercoaster of a week for the primary cryptocurrency. It all started quite promising after the most recent MicroStrategy purchase on Monday, as the asset flew past $100,000 for the first time this year and kept climbing on Tuesday morning to over $102,000. However, that’s when the landscape changed, and BTC slumped hard later that day, and on Wednesday, it slumped to $96,000. Although that was a painful correction on its own, bitcoin kept plunging in the following days to $91,200 (on Bitstamp) on Thursday, which became its lowest price tag in over a month. The bulls managed to intervene at this point and pushed BTC north. More volatility ensued with several big moves that eventually pushed the asset to $96,000. However, it failed there and has lost almost two grand since then to trade at $94,000 as of now. Its market cap has risen to just under $1.870 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is up to 54.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView ADA, SOL Struggle Most altcoins are in the red today as well. Ethereum slipped below $3,200 on Thursday, and even though it managed to recover some ground since that low is close to breaking below it now after a 2.3% daily decline. XRP is among the few alts with minor gains today. In contrast, SOL, ADA, SUI, AVAX, and LINK continue to lose value, with losses of up to 4%. SOL is well below $190 now, while ADA is just over $0.9. More painful losses come from OM, ICP, and RNDR from the larger cap alts. The total crypto market cap has lost some steam since yesterday and is down to $3.43 trillion on CG.

These new coins (running on their own native blockchain) are called altcoins or alternative coins. One popular altcoin is Dogecoin. It can be bought, sold and traded, just like Bitcoin. It can also be mined! This article will explore how to cloud mine Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies cloud mining What is Dogecoin cloud mining? Dogecoin cloud mining is the process by which cloud mining service providers are rewarded with new Dogecoins by checking transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain. It seems simple, but it is not that easy! Cloud mining service providers process the same block of transactions through many computers at the same time, but only one computer can win the reward of new coins. The one that earns new coins is when a node adds a new block of transactions to an old block. This is done using a complex mathematical equation. The node that solves the math problem first wins! It can then append the newly confirmed block of transactions to the rest of the blockchain. This is how most cryptocurrency mining happens. However, Dogecoin mining differs from other coins in a few important areas. These areas are: Algorithms: Each cryptocurrency has a set of rules for mining new coins. These rules are called mining or hashing algorithms. Block time: This is the average length of time it takes to check a new block of transactions and add it to the blockchain. Difficulty: This is a number that represents how difficult it is to mine each new block of currency. Mining difficulty can go up or down, depending on how many miners there are. The coin's protocol also adjusts the difficulty to ensure that block time remains constant. Reward: This is the amount of new currency awarded to the miner for each new block. How to do Dogecoin cloud mining Choose a cryptokeying cloud mining service provider.

As Polkadot makes waves with its innovative upgrades and Bitcoin Cash cements its relevance in the crypto scene, a quiet revolution in e-commerce ownership is underway. Web3Bay (3BAY) is at the center of this shift, presenting a decentralized alternative to platforms like eBay and handing control back to the people. Owning 3BAY tokens isn’t just about shopping—it’s about having a say in the marketplace’s direction. Offering governance participation and exclusive discounts, Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce. With these advantages linked to the presale phase, now’s the time to consider getting on board. Web3Bay: Transforming Online Shopping & Investment Web3Bay isn’t just another online marketplace—it’s a rethink of how e-commerce should work. Unlike centralized platforms where decisions are made behind closed doors, Web3Bay gives users a voice through its 3BAY tokens. These tokens don’t just grant governance rights but also offer exclusive shopping discounts, creating a marketplace where shoppers have a say in its future. Right now, Web3Bay’s presale is generating buzz. At $0.0039675 per token in Stage 3, prices are set to climb across 25 more phases. So far, over 148 million tokens have been sold, pulling in more than $560,000. Early adopters stand to benefit the most, with potential returns estimated at 6430% by the time the final stage hits $0.1959. The phased presale rewards quick action, making now an enticing moment to explore this opportunity. Web3Bay’s plans extend far beyond token sales. Future integrations, including PayPal compatibility, aim to enhance usability, while the platform’s decentralized framework ensures it remains aligned with community interests. For those seeking the best crypto coins to buy now, Web3Bay provides an opportunity to join a user-driven movement poised to redefine online shopping. Polkadot Price Prediction: What’s the Outlook for DOT? Polkadot continues to capture attention with its advanced blockchain infrastructure, enabling seamless communication between networks. A recent update, Agile Coretime, simplifies access for developers by replacing the auction model with direct purchases of core time. This change lowers barriers for projects of all sizes and reinforces Polkadot’s commitment to usability. With 49% of DOT’s supply staked, the network appears strong and well-supported. Looking forward, price predictions for 2025 suggest that DOT could range between $11 and $32, with possible highs of $40, depending on broader market conditions. By 2030, analysts project an average price of $68, with optimistic scenarios reaching up to $75. As Polkadot’s ecosystem evolves, these numbers highlight its potential for sustained growth. Bitcoin Cash News: Why BCH Remains Relevant Bitcoin Cash has carved out a steady position in the crypto market with its focus on speed and low fees. Recent updates show growing traction in South Korea, where BCH ranks as the fifth most popular cryptocurrency, surpassing notable names like Solana and Cardano. This surge reflects the coin’s appeal among active users and investors exploring emerging opportunities, such as 1Fuel tokens. Currently priced at $435.97, BCH demonstrates resilience even amid market volatility. Analysts credit its steady adoption, particularly in Asia, as a key factor bolstering its position. For those seeking a crypto with real-world utility and a dedicated user base, Bitcoin Cash offers a compelling option. Wrapping It Up Polkadot’s price forecasts suggest a promising trajectory, while Bitcoin Cash continues to prove its relevance with practical use cases and growing popularity. Both projects remain strong contenders in their respective niches. On the other hand, Web3Bay is shaking up the e-commerce model with its decentralized, community-first approach. With over $560,000 raised in its presale and 128 million tokens sold, Web3Bay is setting the stage for significant growth. Its unique blend of governance participation and user benefits makes it one of the best crypto coins to buy now —and potentially investing in—as the next stages of its presale unfold.

Some analysts remain bullish ahead of Trump’s inauguration, while others have warned that the cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum could be in danger if the current levels are lost. Related Reading: Ethereum: Analyst Says $7,000 Target ‘Is Looming’ As Price Retests Crucial Level Solana Holds Key Support Zone Amid the market retrace, Solana has also lost its New Year highs, falling to its lowest price since the late December retrace. On Monday, SOL registered a 17.3% increase from its yearly opening after retesting the $220 mark. However, its bullish momentum was halted after Bitcoin’s price dropped nearly 8% in 24 hours. After hovering between the $190-$199 prince zone, Solana fell below the zone’s lower range, dropping to its current low of $182 on Thursday. In the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency bounced above the $190 range before dipping to the $185 support zone again. A crypto investor pointed out that, despite the latest drop, Solana still holds the price target of $325, as it didn’t fall to the previous low of $175. The investor suggested that “as the downtrend is sharp, the uptrend is likely to be sharp as well,” adding that a “V-shaped rebound is likely to occur. The target price may be reached faster than the time shown in that pattern.” Trader Crypto General noted that SOL has tested the previous breakout level during the “much-needed correction.” Ahead of the post-election pump, the $180-$185 zone served as a key resistance level, which was later broken when Solana climbed above $200. Moreover, this level was retested as support during the late December retraces, serving as a bounce zone for the cryptocurrency. Crypto General suggested that the following days will be “very bullish for the market,” citing Trump’s upcoming inauguration as a potential catalyst. With Trump taking the oath, markets are expected to start a parabolic season, taking sol also along with them. My target is around $285. Analyst Warns Of These Levels For SOL Crypto analyst Ali Martinez warned investors about SOL’s current levels, stating that the cryptocurrency “must not break below $180.” A potential drop below this support zone could send Solana into a 20% to 30% decline. Martinez stated that the $150 to $130 range, not seen since September and October, would become “a likely target.” Similarly, analyst Jelle recently stated it would be “Worth keeping an eye on SOL/BTC for the coming weeks.” According to the post, SOL’s trading pair against Bitcoin has been at a key zone, suggesting that Solana should reclaim the 0.0022 level soon to continue its bullish momentum, as it currently sits at 0.0020. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Potential Rebound To $98,600, But Analyst Suggests Caution Meanwhile, another market watcher noted that SOL’s performance during Q1 could be dampened due to “over-saturated positioning, a cooling off of pump fun metas, and the looming FTX SOL unlocks that was sold some time ago and have started unlocking, with the biggest unlock coming in March.” However, he considers that “from Q2 onwards,” Solana will be a “major winner” due to the possible launch of Solana-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the “potential for new Pump.fun metas” reigniting its bull case. Based on this, the analyst predicts that SOL could hit $400-$500 this year. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $191, a 3.3% increase in the daily timeframe.

The event, reported by Cointelegraph on X, has sparked widespread debate within the cryptocurrency community regarding blockchain fee mechanisms and Solana’s inefficiencies. The transaction involved interacting with the Bloom Router program to transfer 4.5 SOL ($877.30) and swap 495.5 SOL ($96,600.73). The exorbitant fee raised eyebrows, especially as Solana is known for its typically low fees, averaging fractions of a cent.

One user touted Algorand’s capabilities, stating it cost $0.0003 per transaction, had no failed transactions, a transaction time of 2.8 seconds, and more. He also emphasized Algorand’s network reliability, adding, “No downtime since 2019.” Solana has suffered multiple network outages over the past few years. These have questioned the network’s reliability in the highly competitive crypto market. A separate comment speculated on the root cause of the issue, suggesting , “Someone must have mistaken microlamports with lamports when setting the fee.” Lamports are the smallest denomination of SOL, akin to Satoshis in Bitcoin. An error in configuring Lamport-based fees could explain such an anomaly.

With Solana’s troubles, it may soon start losing investors to XRP and similar ecosystems that aren’t plagued with downtimes or fee errors. Broader Context of High Fees This incident follows a similar event on the Bitcoin network in December 2024, where a user paid $790,000 in fees to transfer just $13,000. Such occurrences often arise from user errors, software bugs, or malicious intent. Solana has experienced its share of scrutiny in recent years, primarily concerning network stability and performance. Despite its reputation for low fees and high throughput, occasional outages and anomalies like this one highlight the challenges faced by high-speed blockchain networks. The event may prompt developers and validators to revisit how fees are calculated and ensure safeguards against such anomalies. Transparency and education around fee structures could also help prevent user errors. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the plea on January 10 , highlighting Ford’s role in deceiving approximately 2,800 investors with promises of unrealistically high returns. Ford marketed himself as a “sophisticated investor” capable of delivering daily returns of 1-2%, amounting to an astonishing 547% annually. Ford Lured Investors Using Wolf Capital’s Website Ford used Wolf Capital’s website, social media, and other online platforms to lure investors between January and August 2023. However, instead of utilizing the funds as promised, Ford redirected the money for personal gain, enriching himself and his co-conspirators. The DOJ stated that Ford “misappropriated and diverted investor funds to benefit himself and his co-conspirators, to the financial detriment of investors.” Wolf Capital Co-Founder Pleads Guilty to $9.4M Fraud Offering 547% Returns !

Ford’s guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a potential maximum sentence of five years in prison. A sentencing date has not yet been set. This case is part of a broader crackdown on fraudulent crypto schemes. On January 5, Vietnamese authorities arrested four individuals accused of running a crypto mining scam that defrauded over 200 victims of nearly $157,300. Similarly, police in Springfield, Massachusetts, issued warnings about a surge in crypto-related scams, particularly those involving cryptocurrency ATMs. Crypto Industry Lost $1.49B to Hacks and Fraud in 2024 As reported, the crypto industry witnessed losses totaling $1.49 billion in 2024 due to hacks and fraud, marking a 17% decrease from 2023. According to a report by blockchain security platform Immunefi, hacks were overwhelmingly the primary cause, accounting for $1.47 billion or 98.1% of the total losses across 192 incidents. Fraud, including rug pulls and scams, represented just 1.9% of the losses at $28 million, though this category saw a 72% increase year-on-year. The decline in total crypto losses reflects improved security measures, as the number of successful attacks also fell by 27.5%, from 320 in 2023 to 232 in 2024. Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange suffered a $305 million private key breach in May, while WazirX, India’s top crypto exchange, lost $235 million in July after hackers compromised its Ethereum-based multisig wallet. Together, these two events accounted for 36% of the total losses. Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols remained prime targets, representing 51.4% of the losses, while centralized finance (CeFi) platforms accounted for 48.6%. Notably, CeFi losses surged by 77.5% year-on-year, reaching $726 million. Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain were the most attacked blockchains, with Ethereum facing 104 incidents that led to 44% of total chain losses.

In a January 10 post on X, Woo highlighted that Bitcoin’s local risk model is at its highest point since January 2023, urging traders to adopt a cautious stance despite prevailing bullish sentiment. Cautious Optimism in Bitcoin Markets “Risk is peaking for the first time in this cycle,” Woo stated, emphasizing that significant profits in the market are yet to be realized, leading to more profit-taking before the market resets. The broader market mood, as measured by the Fear and Greed Index, supports Woo’s observations . The index currently stands at a “Greed” score of 69, reflecting elevated optimism compared to a “Neutral” score of 50 just days earlier. Following its brief rally past the $100,000 psychological level on January 8, Bitcoin has retreated and is now trading at $94,120, marking a 3.92% dip over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Mixed Opinions on Market Reversal While Woo advises prudence, not all analysts are convinced the current pullback signifies prolonged bearishness. Pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital noted in a January 10 post that Bitcoin’s 15% correction from its all-time high of $108,000 on December 17 aligns with historical trends observed in previous market cycles. “The timing of this retrace is in line with historical tendencies,” Rekt stated, expressing confidence in a potential market recovery. Similarly, Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, dismissed the current dip as “manufactured” to suppress prices for institutional players. “If you understand the macro landscape, you understand that all dips are fake now,” Mow asserted to his 327,000 followers. Macro Factors Add Complexity Adding to the uncertainty, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest nonfarm payroll (NFP) data exceeded expectations, showcasing a robust labor market. This data, coupled with lower-than-expected unemployment rates, has exerted downward pressure on risk assets, including Bitcoin. While Bitcoin remains a focal point for both retail and institutional investors, the divergence in analyst opinions highlights the complexity of navigating the current market. Traders are left balancing optimism fueled by historical patterns and skepticism rooted in macroeconomic factors.

The decision came amid a wave of crypto industry layoffs that have impacted several high-ranking crypto firms. Eric Turner, Messari’s CEO, said that the latest layoffs were part of an organizational restructuring intended to enhance the firm’s efficiency. These modifications involved further streamlining Messari’s operational structure. The downsizing actions revealed the growing need for crypto companies to adapt to market conditions and prioritize core competencies swiftly. Messari undergoes ‘déjà vu’ layoffs as history repeats itself . @MessariCrypto lays off roughly 15% of staff amid industry-wide cuts, CEO Turner confirms https://t.co/hZo71LXH4u pic.twitter.com/sy5OTHYZQB — ICO Drops (@ICODrops) January 11, 2025 Messari founder Ryan Selkis led the firm’s first layoff of 15% of its employees in 2023 when he was still the CEO. Last year, he stepped down for Turner following a series of ‘caustic incidents’ on social media. One of the many confrontations included an admittedly intoxicated Selkis saying he hoped Trump’s opponents would ‘die in a f—-g fire’ during the aftermath of the Republican candidate’s attempted assassination. Selkis engaged in several social media arguments over topics like cancel culture and immigration, among other conservative talking points. He decided to step aside as CEO, pointing out that it was the first time in 6.5 years that his politics and rhetoric had put the Messari team in ‘harm’s way’. Selkis was notably one of the vocal high-profile crypto commentators who supported Trump’s reelection and attended at least one gala at Mar-a-Lago. He described his terminal discussions with the firm as ‘tough love’. Messari’s latest downsizing reflected a broader trend of workforce optimization prevalent in the crypto industry. The current series of job cuts in the crypto industry affected stablecoin issuer Paxos, the U.S.-based exchange Kraken, and Axie Infinity game developer Sky Mavis. “We made some changes to our organizational structure earlier this week to streamline the business and double down on the growth we’ve seen across our core product lines.” ~ Eric Turner The company has seemingly not made the news public, but a source familiar with the ongoing developments disclosed that the firm will not renew several contractors this year. 2025 witnesses tech industry layoffs continued from 2024 According to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi , 2024 saw more than 150K job losses across 545 tech companies. Four tech companies had already laid off more than 430 employees in 2025 alone. In January, Altruist cut down its workforce by 10% after laying off 37 of its employees amid ‘aggressive hiring’. Jason Wenk, founder and CEO of Altruist, said the firm parted ways with 37 of its 460 employees in a strategic effort to align every role with the company’s mission and long-term goals. One of the staffers claimed that the shocking and abrupt layoff was delivered in a manner that ‘lacked empathy’. Aqua Security announced on January 7th that it was in the process of laying off dozens of its 450 global employees, including 20 in Israel, as part of its strategic reorganization. In a statement, Aqua Security said the layoffs were aimed at focusing on ‘customer needs and flattening the organization’. SolarEdge Technologies went public on January 6th when Reuters reported that it was planning to lay off 400 employees worldwide, its fourth job cut within 12 months. The company expected to record charges of about $3 million to $5 million and save about $9 million to $11 million due to the layoffs. The company is dealing with excess inventory amid weak demand in major markets like Europe. The fintech startup Level abruptly shut down earlier this year, although Employer.com has a new offer under consideration to acquire the company post-shutdown. CEO Paul Aron emailed to explain that the company’s closure was due to an unsuccessful attempt to find a buyer.

With XRP holding steady above the crucial $2 support zone, the asset is consolidating near the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, a zone commonly associated with bullish trend reversals, according to an analysis by The Great Mattsby in an X post on January 10. In this case, a breakout above the 0.886 Fibonacci level at $2.36 could serve as a launchpad for XRP to surge toward its all-time high. The analysis highlighted XRP’s current strength, which remains above the Ichimoku Cloud, a key indicator that signals a bullish trend. The cloud acts as a support zone, helping to cushion XRP against potential downward price movements. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/The Great Mattsby Additionally, XRP is trading above the Conversion Line ($2.33) and Base Line ($2.31), reinforcing the strong upward momentum and overall trend stability. The Conversion Line represents short-term price momentum, while the Base Line indicates longer-term price equilibrium, supporting a bullish outlook when the price is above them. Regarding the next price movement, the trading expert noted that XRP might briefly revisit the upper boundary of the Ichimoku Cloud around $2.35 before making its decisive move upward. Should the price break above $2.36, it could ignite a rapid rally to new all-time highs, which he believes might be just days away. “This daily chart suggests that $XRP might just be weeks, if not days away from a breakout towards all-time highs,” the analyst stated. XRP’s price path to $3 Meanwhile, the bullish outlook is also shared by another cryptocurrency trading analyst, pseudonymously known as Captain Faibik , who, in an X post on January 11, suggested that the Ripple -affiliated token might target $3.66. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Captain Faibik This optimism is backed by the fact that XRP has broken out of a descending channel, signaling a bullish shift in momentum. The breakout follows weeks of consolidation just above the $2 mark, with XRP now trading near the channel’s upper boundary. Similarly, on-chain data could offer hints about what’s next for XRP. Specifically, data shared by prominent analyst Ali Martinez on January 10 noted that XRP whales have been on a significant buying spree, accumulating approximately 1 billion tokens in just 48 hours. XRP whale transactions. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts Historically, such accumulation often signals increased confidence in an asset and has frequently preceded major price breakouts. It’s worth noting that XRP has previously struggled to breach the $3 resistance zone despite breaking out of a prolonged consolidation period below $1. This earlier move was spurred by optimism about Donald Trump’s election and his perceived positive impact on the cryptocurrency space. To this end, market players believe XRP could extend gains under the Trump administration amid anticipation of crypto-friendly policies and regulators that might lead to more use cases for XRP through its parent company, Ripple. For instance, Ripple’s ability to power transactions could find more applications after David Stryzewski, CEO of Sound Planning Group, claimed that Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) had been using XRP for 100% of its internal transactions. XRP price analysis At the time of reporting, XRP was trading at $2.36, having rallied by almost 2% in the past 24 hours. Notably, the token has been weighed down by the general bearish cryptocurrency market sentiment on the weekly chart, plunging 3.5% over the same timeframe. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Finbold As things stand, XRP exhibits a bullish bias, considering the asset shows moderate volatility at 5.20% and remains above the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.14. This bias extends to the long-term outlook, as the value remains well above the 200-day SMA of $0.96. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) sits at 54.46, indicating neutral momentum. However, XRP could face some volatility in the coming weeks as Ripple plans another periodic unlock of the asset , with almost $700 million worth of XRP set to hit the market in January.

In a new report, JPMorgan says the US dollar has defied gravity in 2024 and could continue doing so amid increasing disparities in global growth. The bank’s analysts say a strong US economy may push inflation well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target and force policymakers to pause rate cuts. “The US economy is projected to grow by 2.7% in 2024, outpacing the 1.7% growth forecast for all developed markets. This is driven by superior productivity growth, higher business investment and fewer labor supply issues compared to other developed markets. Such robust growth, which has contributed to inflation remaining above 2%, may lead the Fed to halt rate cuts sooner than expected. This makes a dollar weakening unlikely in the short term.” Should the Fed continue to pursue its easing cycle, JPMorgan says rate cuts will likely be minimal this year due to a strong US economy. “The increasing divergence in global growth has led to a greater disparity in central bank policies worldwide… These differentials may remain elevated, as markets are currently pricing in only a limited number of Fed cuts next year [amounting to] 44bps (basis points), compared to 110bps for the ECB (European Central Bank) and rate hikes of 47bps in Japan.” JPMorgan also says President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes could send the US dollar higher. “The upcoming administration’s focus on boosting domestic manufacturing, increasing tariffs and deregulating industries could spur business growth and sustain higher interest rates, supporting the dollar.” But while the largest bank in the US is bullish on the dollar, it says the country’s excessive reliance on foreign-made products could stifle USD’s growth. “The U.S.’s persistent trade balance deficit, at 4.2% of GDP as of September 2024, poses a long-term constraint, highlighting a structural challenge that could eventually pressure the currency.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

CFPB expands “funds” definition, applying traditional consumer protections to digital assets. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has put forth a proposal that would require crypto firms to reimburse users for losses caused by hacks or exploits. This proposed rule aims to extend the protections of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to cover digital assets, including stablecoins. If this passes, it could significantly change how crypto firms deal with security breaches. It would offer a new layer of protection for people affected by crypto theft.

The scammers prey on the desperation of the city’s residents, offering them various remote jobs and failing to keep their promises. The criminals told the job seekers to deposit a certain amount in digital assets into an account to help them secure the jobs. According to a statement by the New York Attorney General, Letitia James, the unsuspecting victims were targeted via sophisticated schemes. The New York AG mentioned that the scammers told the users to purchase stablecoins and deposit them into their wallets to secure their positions. In the statement, AG James noted that the case was a joint investigation effort with the Queens County District Attorney’s office, the office of the Attorney General, and the United States Secret Service. New York Attorney General wants to recover stolen loot According to the statement, the Attorney General already filed a lawsuit to retrieve the digital assets pooled into various wallets by New York residents. Aside from recovering the loot, which has been frozen since the alarm was raised, she wants the scammers to face the law and pay restitution. She noted that it was a very cruel thing that the criminals did, taking advantage of people trying to secure jobs to support their families. She also said it was unacceptable and she would do everything in her power to recover the funds. “Deceiving New Yorkers looking to take on remote work and earn money to support their families is cruel and unacceptable,” AG James said. She highlighted that the scammers stole funds in excess of $2 million from people across the country. According to her suit, a New York victim lost $100,000 to the scammers. She also urged people to be careful and report strange calls to her office. “The cryptocurrency that has been frozen, thanks to my office, will be available to help residents defrauded by this scam. I urge all New Yorkers to be cautious of text messages from unknown senders claiming to offer jobs or other opportunities, and to report any scams to my office,” AG James added. The scammers asked victims for USDT and USDC According to reports, the scammers asked their unsuspecting victims to send the funds in USDT and USDC stablecoins. The victims were guided by the scammers to make purchases on various licensed and registered exchanges, including Coinbase , Crypto.com, and Gemini. After the purchase, the scammers asked them to send the stablecoins to unhosted wallets. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the crime occurred across several jurisdictions in the country. The scammers majorly targeted people looking for remote jobs. They also promised to compensate their victims if they signed up on some crypto website and deposited funds on it. Victims were also told to write several reviews on some fake products that were made to appear legitimate. The scammers told the victims that the reviews would help generate market data which would bring in buyers. The scammers also told them that they did not need to purchase the products as their reviews were helping to make the data legitimate. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz noted that the criminals lured victims to deposit funds using sophisticated technology before they stole them. “In this case, the perpetrators used advanced technology to lure victims into depositing cryptocurrency and stole millions of dollars in the form of stablecoins,” she said. She mentioned that her office was able to trace about $2 million that went into some crypto wallet. Katz claimed that after the wallets were identified, she worked with AG James’ office to have the wallets frozen. The funds will remain frozen until they can figure out a way to return them to the rightful owners. She bemoaned the effect of the scam on the job market, noting that it would shatter people’s trust.

This momentum puts XRP among the top three cryptocurrencies. Analysts believe it might soon cross its critical resistance point and hit $5. Despite XRP’s bullish movements, investors are eyeing two strong competitors vying for the same market position. One is Rexas Finance (RXS), which gained traction during the presale campaign. How Is Rexas Finance (RXS) Different? Rexas Finance seeks to merge blockchain technology and more conventional finance practices by creating digital representations of real-world assets such as property and sophisticated artworks. This strategy first allows RXS to present itself as a leader in digitizing investment assets. The Rexas Launchpad offers a democratized environment that safely facilitates token sales of numerous blockchain-based projects for those seeking funding. Moreover, creators who have recently launched projects in the NFT market can use Rexas GenAI to generate high-end digital artwork using AI’s power. Rexas DeFi promotes effortless crypto trading across multiple networks in the decentralized finance industry, enabling users to have liquidity and ease of access. In addition to all these features, Rexas plans to upgrade its visibility status by being listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGeo and securing a security audit by Certik, improving its reliability. RXS Presale Success Commands a Bullish Movement The project’s presale success has been extreme as the tokens rose from $0.03 to $0.175, demonstrating a promise in investors’ minds. Rexas sold 392.4 million tokens in the eleventh stage, raising more than $35 million. All the while, market analysts have a hungry view of the potential of RXS, some even estimating a 2,000% growth compared to its presale valuation soon after launch on the major exchanges. The price could quickly exceed the $1 threshold and spike to $5 in the coming months. Such growth would be more than a considerable return, making RXS a hot choice for investors looking for low-risk, high-reward options in the crypto world. What Drives RXS’s Success? Strategic Partnerships and Institutional Interest Due to other projects grabbing the attention of institutional investors, Rexas Finance is beginning to gain mainstream attention. It captivates whales with its use cases and values. Moreover, this institutional participation gives the project a strong performance with the capital rendered and augurs well for the project. Scarcity and Strong Tokenomics RXS’s supply is capped at one billion tokens, with limited neutral supply and increased demand, which gives it an excellent appreciation forecast. The token’s value is further enhanced by its myriad functions, including—but not limited to—governance and staking functions and as a medium of transaction, making it enjoyable to long-term holders. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme to Movie Star Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency that has managed to find its place despite other similar competing cryptocurrencies. Even though it launched in 2020, Shiba penetrated the cryptocurrency world easily, earning itself the name of Doge Killer. In 2021 this coin was quite a top performer as it reached a remarkable 70%, allowing it to be in the top twenty most popular cryptocurrencies. Over the past few days, its price has seen slight appreciation, with the last 24 hours trading volume pegged to 398$ and the market price standing at 0.00002209$. Shiba is more aggressive than its fellow cryptocurrencies, especially XRP. Its ShibaSwap exchange and Layer 2 Blockchain Infrastructure have transformed the crypto ecosystem. The token has been very volatile, as is familiar with meme coins, but Shiba still holds a firm foothold in crypto. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem’s products, ShibaSwap and Shibarium, attempt to overcome the classic meme coin reputation, making Shiba Inu competitive in the ever-changing market. This greater leverage also means that having good community support and ongoing developments will single-handedly drive its value forward. Conclusion While established cryptocurrencies like XRP are slowly gaining momentum and progressing toward hitting key milestones, with the expectation that their appreciation trajectory will be exponential, other coins such as RXS and SHIB present potential better avenues for return. While the cryptocurrency market keeps expanding towards new frontiers, XRP investors increasingly see the light at the end of the tunnel. Rexas Finance (RXS) remains a key player alongside XRP, with the prospect of gaining substantial returns aided by some impressive preselling alongside an ingenious approach.

The concept of a central bank digital currency predates crypto’s most recent down market. However, it has steadily gained momentum as governments recognize the need to modernize payment systems while addressing various economic and technological challenges. There are currently some 134 nations and currency unions that have explored or are exploring the use of CBDC, of which three have already launched: Jamaica, Bahamas, and Nigeria. You might also like: The rise of CBDCs is inevitable but not risk-free | Opinion These nations and currency unions have different yet sometimes overlapping motives for wanting to explore the option of digitizing their money, and they may not always be in the public’s best interest. On the positive side, however, many governments seek to strengthen financial inclusion by providing unbanked individuals with an accessible digital payment option while enabling easy transfer of funds, such as welfare payments, for example. They do so in the hope of reducing reliance on banks to handle transactions, enabling ordinary people to send remittances easily and affordably, and allowing for streamlined international trade. Additionally, exploring CBDCs can enhance economic transparency due to blockchain’s immutability, which would combat laundering, tax evasion, and other financial crimes. CBDCs would also promote the further expansion of the fintech sector by future-proofing the economy and encouraging advanced financial innovation. Ethiopia, Africa’s second-largest nation and fifth-biggest economy, has made headlines following the approval of an updated monetary policy framework by the National Bank of Ethiopia that, among other things, includes a plan for a CBDC. Economists believe this move would be a major boost for financial inclusion and efficiency in a country once seen as a growing economic power before a recent civil war disrupted momentum. As the country rebuilds after the 2022 peace agreement, the NBE sees an opportunity to liberalize the economy and attract foreign investments. Ethiopia hopes to reform its economy, and much of its success may depend on how it implements a CBDC. CBDCs can undoubtedly unlock economic advantages that could help developing and underdeveloped countries improve their financial standing while playing a larger role on the global stage. However, whether a specific CBDC is for retail, wholesale, or a hybrid, the development of these digital currencies can enable governments to assert more control over financial systems. From a crypto perspective, if CBDC adoption becomes the norm, it could disrupt the blossoming decentralized finance space. For one, CBDCs could threaten privately issued stablecoins, which serve an infrastructural role, facilitating DeFi activity. For countries like Ethiopia who are strongly considering issuing CBDCs, Nigeria’s use case should serve as a cautious tale. When Nigeria’s Central Bank issued the eNaira , it used the open-source Hyperledger Fabric protocol, which is secure and can process up to 3,000 transactions per second. However, CBN never connected eNaira to existing or developing financial infrastructure. Ultimately, CBN controls all nodes and blocks outside access to blockchain data, raising concerns about centralized authoritarian control. Since its launch in late 2021, the eNaira has not been widely adopted and is viewed as a failure. If CBDCs are about future-proofing national economies, they must be compatible with all digital financial systems, including interoperability with public blockchains. In this case, technical and regulatory considerations are relatively simple to implement; it comes down to the policies and vision of financial decision-makers. Any CBDC program must collaborate with all licensed banks operating in the country while working with fintech and blockchain technology providers to ensure the CBDC is interoperable with traditional financial systems, DeFi, and other digital payment rails. Kima, an interoperability protocol that bridges crypto and fiat, represents the type of technological infrastructure that can enable CBDCs to facilitate real economic advancements. Last year, Kima participated in a pilot project administered by the Bank of Israel to assess the feasibility of adopting a CBDC. As part of the project, Kima successfully demonstrated a transfer of a tokenized stock via a digital shekel. Showcasing its protocol’s utility, Kima built a demo trading platform to facilitate an atomic swap of the tokenized stock. Kima’s decentralized settlement layer handled the transaction, linking the buyer interested in purchasing the share using digital shekels with the seller, who held the tokenized stock in a crypto wallet. The seller received the payment directly into their bank account in the form of regular shekels. Utilizing two API calls, Kima ensured the transaction was safe and verified as it took place instantly without any intermediaries or smart contracts. This process—linking a CBDC, tokenized asset, digital wallet, and bank account—is what governments need to envision as the goal of any CBDC initiative. If they intend to future-proof their economies, governments must use CBDCs to bridge old financial systems with modern digital financial tools in a secure and accessible way.

XRP dominates Japanese banks amid reclaiming its throne as 3rd largest crypto According to Coin Telegraph, XRP has reclaimed its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, surpassing USDT . 2025 is already looking to be a noteworthy year for XRP, as it edges other cryptocurrencies while challenging Bitcoin in general acceptance. More than half of Japanese banks are incorporating XRP into their banking systems. Leading this project is SBI Holdings, which supports XRP’s On-Demand Liquidity solution, which uses XRP to enable quick and reasonably priced foreign transfers. Emphasizing XRP’s use for international remittances, SBI Group CEO Yoshitaka Kitao — a significant participant in Japan’s banking industry — has shown great support for XRP. Using XRP widely, Japanese banks might improve their foreign exchange and cross-border payment systems, increasing consumer efficiency and transaction speed. XRP’s influence extends beyond Japan. Financial institutions — including CIBC in Canada, Santander in the UK, Itaú Unibanco in Brazil, and Kotak Mahindra Bank in India—have collaborated with XRP to expedite their cross-border operations. Japanese banks continue to support crypto despite Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC. If the SEC revokes its appeal, XRP’s status as a non-security would be clearer, increasing its possibilities for ETF acceptance. Under Trump’s presidency, this scenario may change, mainly since pro-crypto SEC Chair Paul Atkins will replace Gary Gensler this month. XRP’s price is $2.43, and its ATH is $3.84, raising questions about the feasibility of the $50 target. Nonetheless, Lunex’s target of $1 is more feasible considering its increasing adoption.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 11:42:55

On the other hand, new contenders like 1Fuel are appearing and providing creative decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions. 1Fuel differs from other coins due to its features, which include private trade, smooth cross-chain transactions, and passive income prospects. Remarkably, 1Fuel tokens are currently trading at $0.015 while 1Fuel’s presale has raised almost $1.2 million. As the crypto market evolves, investors are anticipating to see which token will be the next big token to buy. 1Fuel is Redefining Utility in the Crypto Market 1Fuel is becoming more well-known as a noteworthy upstart in the cryptocurrency market, especially in the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. 1Fuel distinguishes itself from other tokens that depend on hype by emphasising useful, real-world applications that aim to enhance the cryptocurrency trading experience. Its features, such as private trading choices, cross-chain transactions, and passive income opportunities, are intended to appeal to today’s cryptocurrency investors seeking utility and efficiency. One of the key factors driving interest in 1Fuel is its highly successful presale. The first stage of the presale began with tokens priced at just $0.01. Since then, the project has raised over $2 million, with over 125,000 tokens sold. This rapid growth during the presale stage has caught the eye of investors who see potential for significant returns. Analysts are particularly optimistic about its launch, with some predicting up to 50x gains for early adopters once the token becomes publicly available. What makes 1Fuel particularly intriguing is its focus on utility over hype. By addressing practical issues for traders, 1Fuel is creating a niche in a market dominated by highly volatile tokens. One of its main selling points is its ability to provide private trading and smooth cross-chain transactions, which solves some of the main issues users encounter in the DeFi market. Long-term holders will find the token’s passive income features even more alluring. Analysts have been vocal about 1Fuel’s potential to disrupt the market. Many believe its strong use case and growing momentum could set it apart from other new tokens. As more investors join in to benefit from its early-stage pricing, the continuous success of the presale is evidence of this rising confidence. 1Fuel is becoming a more popular option for investors wishing to diversify their investments with a high-utility coin. As 1Fuel continues to gain traction, its focus on solving real-world problems could help it secure a lasting place in the crypto ecosystem. With a strong presale performance and features that address key user needs, it’s a token worth keeping an eye on in 2025. Bitcoin Stands Strong with Promising Price Movements Bitcoin has seen some price swings lately. In December 2024, the price hit over $100,000, driven by excitement over President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly policies. But this year, Bitcoin’s value dropped to $92,500 due to market liquidations and new rules from the Federal Reserve. Right now, Bitcoin is priced at $92,822, a small drop of 1.57% from yesterday. The lowest point today was $91,791, while it peaked at $95,338. Analysts believe the drop in the price of Bitcoin is partly because of the strong US dollar and rising Treasury yields. Even with these fluctuations, Bitcoin is still expected to be a top crypto token in the market and investors are watching closely as the economy changes. Bitcoin Holders Can Count on 1Fuel for Huge Returns Bitcoin remains a top crypto token in the crypto market, with strong growth potential in 2025. However, 1Fuel stands out as an exciting new project with great future potential. Its focus on real-world DeFi applications and impressive presale performance makes it a token worth watching. While Bitcoin has secured its position, 1Fuel offers an opportunity for those looking for the next big token to buy.

The findings indicate that 56% of respondents are now more inclined to invest in crypto due to the results of the 2024 U.S. election. Surge in Crypto Allocation and Interest The study , conducted between November 14 and December 20 last year, asked 430 financial advisors about their views on crypto. In a January 9 post on X, Bitwise emphasized that the outcome was “more bullish than ever.” “If you had any doubt that 2024 was a massive inflection point for crypto, this year’s Bitwise/VettaFi survey dispels it,” said Matt Hougan, the firm’s chief investment officer. He added that professionals are increasingly recognizing the potential of cryptocurrency, leading to unprecedented levels of allocation. Digital asset apportionments have also doubled year-over-year, reaching an all-time high. According to the survey, 22% of consultants reported allocating crypto to client accounts in 2024, a major increase from 11% in 2023. Client interest in the asset class is also at an all-time high, with 96% of wealth managers receiving inquiries from customers about it last year. Furthermore, there was a tendency to retain such investments, with 99% of those who currently have allotments in customer accounts planning to either maintain or raise the amount in 2025. The report also revealed that financial consultants are more inclined to make initial purchases for their customers. Of those who have not yet ventured into the sector, 19% are “definitely” or “probably” planning to do so in 2025 compared to the 8% reported the previous year. Many consumers are also making crypto investments independently. 71% of the advisors reported that “some” or “all” of their clients are adding them to their portfolios without their involvement. Meanwhile, when asked about their preferred form of investment for 2025, the experts overwhelmingly favored crypto equity ETFs. Entry Barriers Persist Despite this growing interest, entry into crypto remains a challenge. Only 35% of respondents reported being able to buy it in client accounts, meaning two-thirds still lack access to such options for their users. Hougan emphasized this gap, noting that portfolio managers are still restricted from offering virtual currency products. However, he expressed confidence that this difference would be narrowed in 2025 as mainstream adoption in the sector grows. On a more positive note, regulatory uncertainty, while still a concern, has eased. In the survey, 50% cited it as the top obstacle to future growth. This figure marks a notable decrease from previous results, which ranged between 60% and 65%. Bitwise, which proposed a new exchange-traded fund to invest in companies holding more than 1,000 BTC in their corporate treasuries, previously shared an optimistic outlook for 2025, claiming it would usher in the “Golden Age of Crypto.” The post Trump Victory Spurs More Financial Advisors to Consider Crypto Investments: Survey appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitwise|Crypto ETF|Donald Trump|United States,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-11 11:46:53

Let’s take a closer look at the factors driving this bold claim about this viral altcoin, DTX Exchange (DTX). Solana’s Roadblock: Can the Price Break the $200 Barrier? A closer look into Solana’s (SOL) recent price activity indicates a combination of exciting possibilities and obstacles. Even if the cryptocurrency market has recovered from the negative wave that ended in December, SOL has seen a significant decline of 15% in the last 30 days. This can be attributed to the recent dip in Bitcoin’s price below $95,000. There are questions regarding whether the SOL price can rise above $200 given that it is now trading below that mark. Technical signs suggest that there will be additional price adjustments. As SOL drops out of the overbought area, the Relative Strength Index presents a warning. Analysts remain hopeful, however. They think there may be bullish potential at the point of convergence of the 100 and 200 EMA lines. Solana’s DeFi ecosystem is exceptional, with a total value locked (TVL) of around $9 billion. However, it’s still unclear if it will hit $300 this year. Solana’s DeFi ecosystem is exceptional, with a total value locked (TVL) of around $9 billion. However, it is unclear if it will hit the $300 level this year. Ripple’s Legal Wins Fuel Investor Optimism: What’s Next for XRP? On January 9, 2025, XRP is trading at around $2.27, showing a decline from its previous highs. Experts’ predictions on XRP’s performance in 2025 vary, some suggest that Ripple’s XRP is all set for a major bull run ahead, while some suggest that it may see a dip before a rally. Although overall market sentiment remains bullish, its recent court victories in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC have increased investor confidence. If a possible settlement is announced, Ripple ETFs may be approved, which would raise the price of XRP even further. Analysts predict that a combination of clear regulations and the use of cutting-edge technology will boost XRP pricing and help Ripple cross its previous highs. By mid-2025, the price of XRP may rise beyond $3.50, depending on when Ripple achieves critical mass for institutional adoption. As more financial institutions use blockchain technology, the price of XRP is anticipated to increase. Why DTX’s Cutting-Edge Features Could Deliver Huge Returns in 2025 While Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) think they can outrun each other, experts think completely out of the box. They are betting on a new viral altcoin called DTX Exchange (DTX) to lead the year with big gains and surpass some of the big names of the crypto town. DTX Exchange is a soon-to-be-launched exchange platform that is setting itself apart by bridging the gap between centralized and decentralized finance, bringing the best of them on one single platform. The platform offers unmatched potential, offering an exceptional ROI, powered by its cutting-edge features, including 1000x leverage, distributed liquidity pool, and diverse trading options. Furthermore, its innovative approach removes any KYC requirements, enhancing users’ experiences while maintaining privacy. Its success is credited in large part to its novel trading option, which provided access to more than 120,000 digital assets, including stocks, ETFs, forex, and cryptocurrency. Additionally, DTX Exchange is dedicated to offering enhanced protection with its noncustodial wallet, which gives customers complete control over their private keys and digital assets. The project is currently in its presale stage and has been showing an amazing performance since the day it was launched. The presale currently stands at $11.5 million in funding at stage 7. Each DTX token is available to be bought at a $0.14 price point. Analysts claim this project stands a better chance of delivering big returns as compared to Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL). This is because the project is backed by solid technology, has a devoted community, and is in the early stages, hence higher profit margins.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $4.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction.

The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bears strengthen their position as they hold the price below the EMA trend lines. Bulls are maintaining buying confidence as the dYdX price aims for further surges. dYdX price chart The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.54, showing that long-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend.

The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $1.3734, it will fuel a bullish rally to $1.6771. dydX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.2772, beginning a bearish trend to $1.0999. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? Today, dYdX faced intense selling pressure as it failed to surge above $1.5. However, buyers are defending further declines and aiming for a quick recovery. Will dYdX price recover? If buyers hold the buying momentum of dYdX and send it past the $1.5 mark, we might see a significant recovery in the coming hours. The current low might be a good time to buy and this might create a strong support level for dYdX’s price. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiments, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX, and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future.

Deposits via ERC20 after this date will not be credited, risking asset loss. Other networks for DYDX transactions on Binance will remain available. dYdX price prediction January 2025 December was a bullish month for dYdX as the altcoin made robust surges following Donald Trump’s victory. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $2 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $2.6 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $1.3. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction January 2025 $1.3 $2 $2.6 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $3.86 by the end of 2024.

According to analysts, SOL and BNB are poised to continue their excellent runs and set new all-time highs (ATHs) soon. However, $BNB and $SOL holders looking for more gains have turned to Remittix (RTX) , the new PayFi giant. As the platform looks to transform the $190 trillion cross-border payment industry, analysts believe that $RTX is the next 10x coin. Solana (SOL) Retests Breakout Level. How High Can It Go? Like other top altcoins, Solana (SOL) joined the Bitcoin plunge following the sell-off by the US government. From a weekly high of $225, the Solana price plunged to test the $180 support level, based on the 1W chart from CoinMarketCap. While the Solana crypto still looks bearish, Crypto General has said that the altcoin was just retesting the previous breakout level. He believes this was a much-needed correction, and it prepares Solana (SOL) for a major rally. The Crypto General 4H chart shows $185 to be a very important support level that bulls must hold. The analyst believes that the coming days will be very bullish for Solana (SOL) and the rest of the crypto market. Crypto General has forecasted that the Solana crypto could skyrocket to a new ATH above $285, an increase of more than 50% from its current range. In other Solana news, the approval of spot $SOL ETFs may take longer than expected. Binance Coin (BNB) Retains Strength Despite Downtrend Although Binance Coin (BNB) joined other top altcoins in the recent market decline, it has continued to show remarkable strength. $BNB saw a strong bounce off the $680 support and the Binance Coin price is now looking to recover back above $700, per data from CoinMarketCap. This strength has been highlighted by CryptoZeinab who said that Binance Coin (BNB) continues to hold its upward channel and remains entirely close to the ATH levels. Why the crypto analyst does not write off a possible decline to retest the bottom channel support at $650-680 in the coming days, she believes a bull run will follow. Based on CryptoZeinab’s Binance Coin price prediction, the altcoin price could trade as high as $920 for a new ATH, making $BNB one of the top altcoins to watch. Why Remittix (RTX) Has Been Gaining Attention From Top Investors While $SOL and $BNB faced declines, Remittix (RTX) was soaring up the charts. The $RTX DeFi coin has pumped from $0.015 to $0.0199, outperforming the crypto market. The price rally comes amidst an increase in interest in the project which has led to Remittix raising over $2.4 million in presale. There has been a lot of chatter about Remittix because its innovative PayFi protocol could be the next big thing in global finance. The PayFi protocol provided by Remittix makes it easy for users to transfer funds across borders and consequently, creates a perfect connection between the crypto and conventional payment systems. Remittix users can convert 50+ cryptocurrencies into fiat and instantly deposit funds directly into any bank worldwide. Remittix supports more than 30 different fiat currencies, outpacing the likes of Wise and Stripe. Its decentralized solution also means that transfers are faster, fees are lower, and there are no hidden fees. Because of its innovative solution, financial experts believe Remittix will be perfect for promoting financial inclusivity. Solana and BNB Holders Jump To the New DeFi Project, Remittix While they look set to hit new ATHs, the expected price increases from Binance Coin and Solana are just under 50%. As a result, they are moving to Remittix, one of the best cryptos to buy now. As the project gains ground in the $190 trillion cross-border market, analysts believe $RTX could skyrocket by more than 10x in January.

Several projections have been centered on the growth of artificial intelligence (AI), which is expected to boost financial markets across every industry. But as history may have it, even good gambles can end in unrecoverable losses. How much more bad ones? During the 1970s, Wall Street investors admitted to favoring the top 10 to 15 stocks driving the US market, which accounted for 40% of market capitalization at the time. They completely failed to consider external factors like geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic policies, as chronicled in George Goodman’s Supermoney . Many “go-go” US equities of the 1960s crashed, leaving fund managers with nothing, not even scraps. “We didn’t pay attention,” said a speaker at a financial conference. We are now in a parallel situation; the top 10 US stocks account for 30% of the market. Like clockwork, forecasters are calling 2025 the year of “AI and tech innovation.” Suppose 1970 happens all over again, are the “financial experts” really to blame? Or is 2025 a year of common sense? Lessons from the past: Eyes open to the bigger picture In 2024, Wall Street had nothing short of a remarkable performance, delivering the strongest back-to-back returns since the prosperous Clinton-era markets of the late 1990s. However, some market analysts are concerned that the stock market’s rise is “too good to be true.” Critics warn that certain stock valuations have become detached from economic fundamentals. Much like the 1970s, they fear a potentially severe market correction that could ripple through the broader economy is looming. “ I’m very concerned because the stock market is pricing in nothing but blue skies and sunshine forever, ” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told CNN. Zandi further cautioned that the current market environment is “ very richly valued, bordering on frothy. ” The seemingly unshakeable confidence in the market’s trajectory could face a reckoning, and if investors are not wary, they could be in for a rude awakening. Financial forecasters often sidestep accountability, says Elliott Appel, founder of Kindness Financial Planning. He likens their predictions to gamblers chasing a streak, noting the near impossibility of finding historical records of accurate stock market forecasts. “ If stock market forecasts were useful and accurate, you would have an easy time finding past predictions, ” Appel reckoned. “ If you don’t believe me, try searching for historical stock market predictions from any company or individual. They are nearly impossible to find. ” Verdad Capital’s Portfolio Manager Dan Rasmussen seconds the sentiment around market predictions. In a recent podcast , he called long-term projections “pure coin flips.” “If you could forecast immaculately, it still wouldn’t help you much. Even with full retrospective prescience, you can’t explain most of the volatility in markets. Knowing the numbers can’t tell you how people will react to them.” Rasmussen reiterated. The AI cycle: Opportunity or mirage? AI has hijacked investment headlines and portfolios. However, Rasmussen argues that not all of them will yield returns in the long run. He pointed out the difficulty of distinguishing between firms creating value and those “incinerating capital.” Rasmussen favors fast-growing Eastern European stocks, particularly Polish small caps, which could benefit from a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These thinly traded equities contrast sharply with the heavily scrutinized and often overpriced American AI stocks. According to CNN, equities were driven by the surge in artificial intelligence and the dominance of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. They soared by 29% in 2024, following an impressive 43% rise the previous year. The S&P 500 added a staggering $10 trillion in market value during the same period, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices . The markets have experienced pullbacks in recent weeks, and Zandi fears a downturn exceeding 20% is imminent. He admitted to not feeling this uneasy about overvalued markets since the late 1990s, during the height of the dot-com bubble. “ The run-up in stock values has played a critical role in the economy’s success. It’s driven a lot of spending. The wealth effects are quite potent ,” the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics explained. “ But if the stock market went down and stayed down for a lengthy period of time, that would knock the wind out of high-income spending. And that’s a threat to the economy. ” US policy uncertainty will affect markets Meanwhile, a JP Morgan research projects a challenging economic landscape for 2025, characterized by elevated inflation and diverging monetary policies. Global GDP is expected to rise by 2.5%, while core CPI inflation could remain near 3%, pinning down central banks’ ability to ease rates. Bruce Kasman, JP Morgan’s chief economist, predicts a “high-for-long” rate environment, challenging consensus views of inflation easing to 2%. Goods price disinflation has ended, he argues, and service price inflation is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels. Western Europe could emerge as a weak link, with euro area policy rates forecasted to drop below 2%. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve and most emerging market central banks are expected to take minimal action, sustaining higher rates. Kasman warns that extreme trade or immigration policies could disrupt global supply chains and sentiment. A more aggressive inward turn by the US, including large-scale deportations or sharply curtailed trade, could trigger a significant global economic shock. JP Morgan analysts believe retaliatory measures and a slump in investor confidence would amplify the economic strain.

Technical indicators show bearish momentum, but narrowing MACD bars and oversold RSI suggest potential for reversal. Options data highlights bullish sentiment, with a put-call ratio of 0.48 and a max pain point at $3,450. Ethereum (ETH) is at a crossroads with traders weighing conflicting signals from its technical indicators and the overall market sentiment. ETH, currently trading near $3,300, is facing key support and resistance levels that could determine where it goes next. Technical Indicators Flash Warning Signs Ethereum’s technical indicators show a bearish trend with the price trading below all major exponential moving averages (EMAs). The 200-EMA at $3,697 is a major resistance point, while the $3,200–$3,300 range is acting as strong support. If ETH were to drop below this range, it could spiral down $3,000 or lower.

The objective is to bring down the circulating supply to create scarcity and spike SHIB prices by leveraging the concept of demand supply. It is anticipated that prices of the second-ranked meme coin in terms of market cap will rebound in the coming days. Shiba Inu Community Burns 87 Million SHIB In the past week, the Shiba Inu community has burned as many as 87,175,135 SHIB tokens. This translates to 87.17 million tokens in the last 7 days with an increase of 52.74% in burn rate. The X post by Shibburn has further highlighted that the burn rate is down by 90.17% in the last 24 hours. A core objective here is to control the circulating supply of the meme coin to mark upticks in the prices. SHIB’s circulating supply now stands at 589.25 trillion. As per an early report, Shib burn rate had declined by 72% in a single day. Thereby, triggering speculation over its impact on the price. Effect on SHIB Price SHIB prices, so far, have reacted positively to this development by marking an uptick of 1.33% over the last 24 hours. However, SHIB price remain significantly down by 9.52% in the last 7 days and 23.63% in the last 1 month. The 24-hour trading volume has also taken a hit of 10.29% while Open Interest has gained 31.32% of value. Overall sentiments towards SHIB are bearish with an FGI of 69 points and volatility of around 10.09%. Removing tokens from circulating supply has worked in the past and Bitcoin is a prime example of it. BTC prices are now hovering above $90,000 months after Bitcoin Halving which happened in April 2024. Therefore, the Shiba Inu community is optimistic that the prices of its SHIB holdings will eventually navigate a way for a bull run. What’s Next for the Shiba Inu Community? Two factors are at play for the Shiba Inu community, namely drawing speculation for future SHIB prices and experiencing the launch of the TREAT token . SHIB prices, according to Coincodex, may grow by almost 0.52% to touch the value of $0.00002216 in the next 30 days. The nearest speculation is extremely bullish with a growth of 105.39% in the picture. It is important to note that the crypto market is highly volatile and price movements could go North or South at any moment. Finally, the launch of the TREAT token is scheduled to happen on January 14, 2025. This has been teased as a revolutionary endeavor for the Shiba Inu ecosystem across the world.

Ripple (XRP), SUI Blockchain, and IntelMarkets (INTL) are distinguished projects with different characteristics and high growth prospects. These altcoins are not only coping with the fluctuations of the market, but they are also leading the development and gaining the attention of investors. For those who want to have the magic of getting 100 times their invested value, holding these tokens can bring benefits. Ripple (XRP): Challenging Lawsuits to Achieve New Heights The Ripple XRP price token has been in the spotlight within the crypto market due to its problems with the US SEC. In December of 2024, the Ripple XRP price reached $2.7. Following that, the XRP price went below the $2.5 mark in early January 2025. Source: CoinMarketCap Currently, it seems the XRP price is still having a hard time staying above the $2.40 resistance. Furthermore, Trump’s recent meeting with Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, also inspired investor’s hope. Some analysts believe that the XRP price could go above $4 in the upcoming days. Due to such historical performance as well as the uncertain regulatory environment, it may be wise to hold Ripple XRP price tokens just like IntelMarkets until it gets to 10x its current price. SUI Blockchain: Sustaining Bullish Momentum SUI Blockchain has attracted attention in recent years for its high stability and abundant technological innovations. In early January, SUI went over the $5 mark and touched it’s all-time-high value of $5.35 but is currently down by over 15% from it. Source: CoinMarketCap Currently, the token is priced above $4 in the second week of January 2025, so it shows that investors consistently buy it. Analysts maintain an upbeat attitude toward SUI’s long-term performance and anticipate that it could hit a high of above $6 in mid-January 2025. SUI blockchain solves the problem of scalability and security and therefore promises greater impact as the cryptocurrency space continues to expand. If investors want to keep SUI for the long term and wait for its price to grow 10x or more, given that SUI has recently gained popularity and its price trend is bullish, they can benefit from this altcoin. Similar to SUI, IntelMarkets uses innovation to reshape industry norms and combines blockchain and artificial intelligence. IntelMarkets (INTL): The AI Powerhouse Redefining Crypto IntelMarkets is not just another crypto platform, but it is a unique project that incorporates artificial intelligence into a blockchain system. Intelmarkets is currently at Stage 9 of the presale. The INTL altcoins are being sold at $0.08, and the platform has raised over $6.5 million during this presale stage. Source: IntelMarkets These impressive presale results show that IntelMarkets has successful access to international investors. It is due to its innovative approach to trading automation and AI development. The Intelli-Array integrated platform simplifies decision-making by combining several trade alerts into an orderly report. IntelMarkets has dual-chain functionality and is integrated with both Ethereum and Solana. This allows users to select whichever blockchain they wish to use depending on the rate of transactions, cost, and network capacity. From automated arbitrage to AI-based cost averaging, IntelMarkets connects the worlds of traditional finance to blockchain, which marks the company as an industry leader. Analysts believe that the official listing on major exchanges is expected to happen very soon, and this will definitely lead to a very high price hike. Conclusion Sticking to Ripple (XRP), SUI Blockchain, and IntelMarkets may be the best bet for cryptocurrency investors if they are seeking high returns. Many institutions adopting Ripple XRP price, SUI’s strong bullish run and IntelMarkets’ revolutionary AI can explain why these altcoins are worth waiting for. IntelMarkets could be listed as the most prospective one as the platform deals with promoting an artificial intelligence-based blockchain that will bring a significant shift in the trading market. As the market evolves, these three projects are meant to be at the forefront of the next chapter of the crypto success stories.

What to Expect in the Long Term?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-has-bitcoin-price-declined-recently-what-to-expect-in-the-long-term/,"Bitcoin faced fresh pressure in the first week of 2025 as stronger-than-expected U.S. employment data and ongoing inflation concerns weighed on investor sentiment. Economic concerns are increasingly overshadowing the post-election euphoria that initially fueled Bitcoin’s rally. Optimism about President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office had fueled hopes for clearer regulations and more crypto-friendly policies, including the potential for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Bitcoin Opportunity Fund co-founder David Foley shared his views on recent market dynamics in an interview with CNBC’s Crypto World. Foley noted that Bitcoin rose significantly in anticipation of the Trump administration’s potential pro-crypto stance, but recent economic data has shifted the focus back to macroeconomic factors. “There’s no doubt that Bitcoin is bullish on sentiment like Trump’s victory, better regulatory clarity and strategic crypto moves,” Foley said. However, he noted that the market is showing signs of hesitation as inflation concerns and a hot jobs report have contributed to the recent volatility. Related News: Attention Analysis Company Announced! ""If This Metric Fluctuates, Bitcoin Volatility Will Increase A Lot"" Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional financial markets, particularly the Nasdaq, remains a key factor. Foley observed that while the broader stock market has struggled, Bitcoin has shown signs of resilience and is acting as a “flight to safety” asset similar to gold. “Bitcoin is thriving and will likely evolve into a risk-off asset in the medium term,” he added. The conversation also turned to MicroStrategy, a company closely tied to Bitcoin due to its significant BTC holdings. “Michael Saylor and his team created a flywheel effect by leveraging various capital markets products, such as convertible debt and perpetual franchises, to acquire Bitcoin,” Foley said. Bitcoin’s price could see fluctuations as the market adjusts to changing economic data and the expected policies of the new administration. But Foley remains optimistic about the long-term growth trends in the crypto space. “Markets are taking a breather,” he said. “Bitcoin may be taking a break before it continues its rise.” *This is not investment advice.

This debate over the agency’s accountability has taken center stage in the digital assets industry. This comes in when Judge Katherine Failla granted Coinbase an interlocutory appeal against the US SEC. Meanwhile, FDIC Vice Chair Travis Hill had also criticized past federal actions that limited banks’ involvement in crypto. He calls for an end to restrictive practices like “Operation Chokepoint.” Coinbase challenges FDIC In an X post , Grewal stated that the FDIC’s response to Coinbase’s FOIA requests had raised more questions than answers. He asked the agency to explain its public report about why it does not run complete text searches of all documents within its Regional Automated Document Distribution (RADD) database. He added that documents from tools like Microsoft Teams were also excluded from FOIA responses which limited the disclosed data. Grewal highlighted FDIC guidelines that classify documents as “deliberative” or “attorney-client privileged.” Coinbase claims that this move restricts disclosure as more than 150 potentially related documents were allegedly omitted. Coinbase’s CLO pointed out that these practices raise critical concerns about transparency in regulatory processes. The crypto industry must push for clearer rules and fair oversight. He stated, “This will not stand.” Their response so far? ""Given the expansion of your requests we will take time necessary to consider your communication and respond."" This will not stand. 3/3 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) January 11, 2025 Judge Katherine Failla has granted Coinbase an interlocutory appeal. This allows the crypto exchange to challenge the SEC’s claims at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. It implies that the exchange can contest the commission’s accusations of running an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer, as well as selling unregistered securities through its staking program. The district court case is now on hold. Coinbase and the SEC have been locked in an intense legal battle where the agency argues that the exchange is violating federal securities laws. It mentions that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933 were infringed. Earlier, Judge Failla issued a mixed ruling which didn’t fully dismiss the SEC’s claims but also did not entirely accept Coinbase’s defenses. However, the interlocutory appeal is a chance for Coinbase to present its case to a higher court. FDIC Vice Chair advocates for crypto Travis Hill, FDIC Vice Chair, in a fresh speech , highlighted how actions like “pause letters” had impacted innovation and created a perception that regulators were blocking such developments. He stated that FDIC sent “pause” letters to more than twenty banks instructing them to refrain from “all crypto-related activity.” Hill highlighted the need for a balanced approach where banks are allowed to evolve while managing risks prudently. He is expected to serve as acting chair of the FDIC moving forward, a development the crypto industry would consider a green flag.

It’s the same with crypto investment opportunities—a well-curated portfolio is key to extraordinary gains. Analysts have tipped Ethereum and Solana as the A-list altcoins to HODL this year. While Ethereum and Solana may have maxed out their growth potential, top-tier sub-$1 cryptos like Rollblock and Stellar Lumens are capturing attention with predictions of 50x to 100x this year. Rollblock: GambleFi solution and presale success spotlight new breakout star Rollblock is making waves in the iGaming world, cementing its position as a rising star and profitable investment opportunity to buy now, HODL later. The platform’s GambleFi presale has shattered expectations, surpassing $8.5M in raised liquidity and a remarkable 600% surge in new registrations last month. A key factor behind Rollblock’s explosive growth is its relentless innovation. The GambleFi protocol brought out the first cutting-edge AI blockchain casino. The recent launch of its sports betting options, which added to an impressive 7,000 titles, ads to the allure. The result is a massive 600% surge in monthly deposits and signups, and the figure is expected to explode this month. The focus is on provably fair gaming, but Rollblock is expanding the horizon with an ecosystem that rewards users. Its passive income stream rolls out 30% of generated revenue and 18% staking APY for holders that HODL. As demand rises and supply tightens, analysts predict a further massive price surge for RBLK, which is currently priced at just $0.045 in the ninth stage of its presale. Ethereum Price On A Bullish Path Amid DeFi Growth And Institutional Interest Ethereum is another high-potential token to HODL before the next altcoin season. Fundamentally, Ethereum has always made an excellent bullish case with its scalable and enterprise-grade DeFi solution. Right now, Ethereum is massively discounted, trading at psychological support near $3,300. However, Ethereum’s institutional adoption supports bullish optimism, especially with the spot Ethereum ETFs. Simultaneously, the rise of DeFi is driving demand, with Ethereum remaining the backbone of this burgeoning ecosystem. Solana: Supercharging scalable DeFi Development Solana is rewriting the rules for DeFi by bringing unparalleled speed, efficiency and scalability with its Proof of History consensus algorithm. Recent groundbreaking developments have made Solana an exceptional investment opportunity for HODL. In its quest to outpace Ethereum, Solana is exploring lattice-based scalability solutions and quantum-resistant measures. The upcoming Firedancer upgrade has also promised a more scalable Solana, translating to more adoption. Stellar Lumens : Decentralized Global Cross-Border Remittance Stellar Lumens has redefined global financial connectivity since its cross-border remittance solution launched in 2015. The mission to link financial systems, payment providers, and individuals has continued to make a bullish case for Stellar. Recent partnerships and ecosystem growth bolstered the positive sentiment Stellar is getting. A few weeks ago, Stellar joined hands with Fonbnk to unlock financial access for over 350 million unbanked Africans. This positions Stellar as a frontrunner driving financial empowerment and, thus, an exceptional investment opportunity for HODL. Conclusion With Ethereum, Solana, Rollblock , and Stellar Lumens leading the way, 2025 promises substantial returns for crypto investors. However, Rollblock stands in front as the best A-tier all-rounder to HODL this year. Its ecosystem growth and presale acceptance have been phenomenal. Together, this power-packed portfolio offers an unbeatable investment opportunity for exponential gains. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!
