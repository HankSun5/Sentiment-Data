On top BlockDAG (BDAG) is surging in presale, with a collection surpassing $178.5 million, shines, especially with its LAUNCH300 offer that promises simplified portfolio expansion appealing to many. Ethereum’s potential rise to $12,000 by 2025 is propelled by its Pectra upgrade and expected regulatory clarity, reinforcing its role as a stalwart in decentralized finance. On the other hand, XRP’s trading boost to $3.8 billion indicates increasing momentum and strategic ecosystem alliances. BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 Streamlines Growth for Crypto Buyers BlockDAG’s crypto presale has been an extraordinary voyage, amassing over $178.5 million and securing the backing of over 170,000 holders. Indeed, it’s the enthusiasm and trust from an expanding community that has pushed the BDAG coin from $0.001 to $0.0248, signaling strong faith in its future. Furthermore, to enhance the experience, BlockDAG has rolled out the LAUNCH300 promotion. It’s straightforward and effective—use the code LAUNCH300 during your acquisition, and your BDAG holdings instantly triple. For example, acquiring 1,000 BDAG results in receiving 3,000 BDAG, making portfolio growth straightforward and accessible to all, whether experienced or new. Additionally, the LAUNCH300 initiative acts as a bond between BlockDAG and its community, a symbol of mutual commitment. Coupled with the presale’s achievements, it’s evident that BlockDAG is nurturing more than a blockchain—it’s cultivating a supportive, confident community. Ethereum Eyes $12K with Pectra Upgrade on the Horizon Ethereum’s value might hit $12,000 by 2025, influenced by crucial technological and governmental factors. The anticipated Pectra upgrade, scheduled for early 2025, is designed to boost Ethereum’s efficiency and minimize transaction delays, potentially bolstering its prominence in decentralized finance and smart contracts. Furthermore, political shifts, including the expected pro-crypto stance of President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, might provide clearer regulations, boosting Ethereum’s appeal. The options market is also showing signs of confidence, with a preference for call options suggesting anticipated price increases. Additionally, the percentage of long-term Ethereum holders has grown from 59% to 75% over the past year, indicating increased confidence in Ethereum’s prospects. Nonetheless, Ethereum faces challenges if Ether-based ETFs falter, as newer blockchains like Solana could present strong competition due to their speed and lower costs. These elements together forecast a positive path for Ethereum. XRP Rallies with $3.8 Billion in Trades as Market Eyes Upswing XRP’s trade volumes have surged to $3.8 billion, reflecting a significant uptick in market interest. Currently priced at $0.55, XRP has maintained stability despite general market volatility. Market analysts highlight its Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63, signaling strong momentum without being overextended, thus drawing attention from traders eyeing upcoming price shifts. Key resistance is noted at $0.60, a breach of which could significantly lift XRP’s value, while a support level at $0.50 offers a robust buffer against downward trends. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bullish trend, supported by increasing trading volumes. Additionally, XRP benefits from Ripple’s strategic partnerships and strengthening network, making it a focal point in the crypto trading arena, engaging both institutional and casual traders. Last Say The successful presale of BDAG, along with the LAUNCH300 campaign, highlights its commitment to providing value to its community. Ethereum’s anticipated Pectra upgrade and its future market influence underscore its continued impact on decentralized finance. Meanwhile, XRP’s trading activity and network growth underscore the varied opportunities available in the market.

This indicates that U.S. mining operations are becoming more important. The report also mentioned that mining profits increased in December. Bitcoin Mining Profits Increased in December This rise was mainly due to a 15% jump in Bitcoin prices, which grew faster than the network’s hashrate, which went up 6.5% during the same time. This rise in Bitcoin price helps miners, making their operations more profitable. However, the difficulty of mining is also rising, as shown by the growing network hashrate. Miners who work efficiently and have access to cheap energy will benefit the most from the higher Bitcoin prices. Meanwhile, Jefferies has lowered its price target for Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), a leading U.S. Bitcoin miner, from $24 to $20. The bank keeps a “hold” rating on MARA shares, advising caution because of increasing network difficulty and the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency prices. Shifting Focus: Bitcoin Miners Diversify to Stay Ahead The competition for resources has grown more intense, with Bitcoin miners now competing with AI developers to access power grids. AI technology needs a lot of computational power. As such, many companies are leasing their data centers to AI firms to cut costs. Companies like Hut 8 and Hive Digitals are exploring this option to ease their financial pressures. Meanwhile, others like Marathon are expanding internationally, moving to countries like Kenya and Paraguay. This is because these regions have surplus, affordable, and sustainable energy. Additionally, many companies are turning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to reduce high expenses. These sources offer stable pricing and lower reliance on the fluctuating power grid, helping to offset high mining costs. Bitcoin Records Largest Drop in Mining Difficulty As reported in May, Bitcoin mining difficulty fell by 5.7%, marking the highest negative adjustment since December 2022, when it fell by 7%. Notably, this negative difficulty adjustment is correlated with a 10% decline in Bitcoin’s hash rate since the previous adjustment on April 24. This is evidenced by a drop from a seven-day moving average of 639.58 EH/s to 578.74 EH/s. However, the average block times increased to 10 minutes and 36 seconds before the adjustment. The dip in hash rate resulted in Bitcoin’s hash price plunging to an all-time low of $50 per PH/s per day ($0.05 per TH/s per day) on April 29. Simultaneously, the BTC’s price retraced below the $63,000 level.

According to the country’s Ministry of National Treasury and Economic Planning, the draft regulations were developed through a multi-agency task force. The Kenyan Ministry of National Treasury and Economic Planning published a request for public comments on two draft legislations related to crypto. The Ministry also rolled out the Virtual Assets Service Providers bill, which is set to be tabled before parliament. Kenyan government invites the public to make comments on draft crypto regulations The Ministry of National Treasury and Economic Planning set January 2025 as the deadline for public participation in the two legislations. The first legislation is the draft policy on virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, and the second is the Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill 2024. According to the ministry, the two legislations were formulated by a multi-agency task force within the country. The ministry added that the bill and policy would be accessible to the public on its official website. The government agency highlighted that public participation was in accordance with the Statutory Instruments Act 2013. The act provides that citizens should air their views on any intended laws and regulations within the country. The ministry added it would also conduct public participation forums nationwide and outlined the schedule in the announcement. John Mbadi, Kenya’s cabinet secretary for the National Treasury and Economic Planning Ministry, appreciated the need for financial inclusion through technological advancements within the county. He also recognised the rise in virtual assets in the global space presented opportunities for innovation in the local financial system. Mbadi also acknowledged the rise of virtual assets presented challenges such as terrorism financing, money laundering, fraud and cybercrime. The cabinet secretary noted that these challenges underscored the urgent need for a legal and regulatory framework to govern virtual assets. He emphasized that the Kenyan government was committed to leveraging opportunities presented by Virtual assets and Virtual asset service providers. Mbadi added the policy was intended to create a fair market for virtual assets within the country. In the policy, the cabinet secretary commented, “The policy takes account of regulatory approaches from various jurisdictions and provides a framework that is adaptive and flexible for domestic and international cooperation, compliance, consumer protection, financial innovation and management of risks.” The ministry outlined the intended act’s objectives as providing a legislative framework to regulate virtual asset service providers and address risks associated with misusing virtual asset products and service provider services. The bill’s objectives also included establishing virtual asset service providers and issuers of initial virtual asset offerings in Kenya, licensing virtual asset service providers, and approving the issuance of initial virtual asset offerings. The ministry also specified that the agencies that would enforce the act would include the Capital Markets Authority and the Central Bank of Kenya. It stated that agencies should ensure financial stability and market integrity within the country. Kenyan government shifts position despite warnings from the Central Bank In 2015, the Central Bank of Kenya issued a press statement cautioning the public on virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. The central bank raised concerns over the public’s trading of cryptocurrencies despite being unregulated under national laws. The CBK informed the public that cryptocurrencies were not legal tender and that consumers would have no recourse if the virtual currencies failed. It raised some risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including the fact that the assets were untraceable and highly volatile. Despite the global regulatory shifts, the Central Bank of Kenya has reportedly maintained its position on cryptocurrencies over the years. The capital markets authority warned the public against crypto-related transactions; however, the agency later softened its stance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) advised Kenya to implement a regulatory framework to help address the risks presented by virtual assets. In its report, the IMF stated that crypto exchanges could not obtain licenses within the country, exposing consumers to potential fraud and financial losses.

Amid the turmoil, the protocol's USD0++ token, which represents a locked-up – or staked – version of its $1-anchored stablecoin USD0, fell briefly below 90 cents from $1 on decentralized marketplace Curve. The protocol's governance token, USUAL, plummeted as much as 17% through the day before recovering some of the losses. The selloff was caused by a change in the redemption mechanism of USD0++ token introduced by the team on Thursday that caught investors and liquidity providers off-guard. By design, USD0 is backed by short-term government securities to keep its price at $1. Stakers on Usual receive USD0++ that comes with a four-year lock-up period, meaning that investors are locking up their funds without being able to redeem in exchange for rewards earned in the form of the protocol's USD0 and USUAL tokens. Yield farmers rushed in, catapulting the protocols total value locked (TVL), a key DeFi metric, to $1.87 billion earlier this week from less than $300 million in October. However, the new feature called ""dual-path exit"" will allow investors to redeem the locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price, or at par, by giving up a part of the rewards earned, calling the 1:1 exchange rate into question. The abrupt implementation drew criticism across DeFi users for changing the design without warning. In certain liquidity pools , the token's price was hardcoded to worth $1, causing havoc among borrowers and liquidity providers. ""Did they just allow degens to jump in at 1:1 and then rug the USD0++?,"" prominent DeFi analyst Ignas said in an X post . ""They pushed for the largest USD0/USD0++ pool on Curve knowing all well that USD0++ shouldn't trade at 1:1."" ""DeFi continues learning the most important truth about pegs: a peg is a story about why two things that are not the same are interchangeable for each other,"" noted Patrick McKenzie, advisor to payments firm Stripe. The Usual team said in a statement that the design change with the early unstaking mechanism was communicated in advance from October. The protocol will also activate the revenue switch starting on Monday and start distributing the protocol's earnings to governance token holders who stake their coin for longer-term (USUALx). ""The current situation regarding USD0++ stems from a misunderstanding of the protocol’s mechanisms along with a communication that should have been better articulated,"" the statement reads. ""We apologize and we’ll continue to do our best to communicate transparent information to users."" The episode is another lesson for crypto investors about the potential risks of DeFi products that entice users with high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels. ""Users who are taking risk need to know what the exact rules are and be able to trust that they won't change, otherwise it can result in market panic,"" Rob Hadick, general partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly, told CoinDesk. ""We should be thankful this happened now, before the protocol became a risk to the broader DeFi ecosystem."" Still, USD0++ traded recently at 0.91 USD0 in the Curve pool, while the protocol's total value locked , a key DeFi metric, dropped below $1.6 billion.",Markets|DeFi|Stablecoin|Yield,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-10 22:26:55

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS.

Here Is the Pertinent Level To Watch,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-30-decline-discount/,"Recent price action has seen Dogecoin stuck in a correction path for over a month now, and the meme now finds itself trading just above the $0.3 mark. Particularly, Dogecoin has retraced by about 30% since it reached a recent multi-year peak of $0.48 in early December, and bullish traders are now patiently waiting for the next leg up. According to technical analysis, Dogecoin’s recent confluence at the $0.3 price level presents an attractive opportunity to load up more of the cryptocurrency before an upward bounce from here. Dogecoin’s $0.3 Support Zone Holds Key Significance The $0.3 price level has emerged as a critical support zone for the meme coin moving forward, with multiple analyses referencing this price point. According to a technical analysis of Dogecoin’s daily candlestick price action on the TradingView platform, this level aligns with historical support zones that have previously served as reliable demand areas during market downturns. The technical appeal of this zone is more notable due to its correlation with broader market sentiment, as the Bitcoin price is currently hovering near its own significant support level. Related Reading: What To Expect After The Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 With this in mind, Dogecoin’s retracement to $0.3 could not only serve as a potential bottom for the current correction but also as a launching pad for the next bullish wave, provided Bitcoin and other market conditions align favorably. Furthermore, it provides traders the opportunity to load up more Dogecoin tokens at a 30% discount and position themselves for maximum gains before the wider crypto market recovers and resumes its upward momentum. Is A Broader Market Recovery On The Horizon? As one of the largest cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is easily influenced by market dynamics, including things like news updates and Bitcoin’s price action. Particularly, Dogecoin’s upward momentum in the last quarter of 2024 had no reason to be derailed if not for Bitcoin’s failure to hold above the psychological $100,000 price level. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Unsurprisingly, on-chain data shows some Dogecoin whale addresses might already be capitalizing on this discount in anticipation of this market-wide recovery. Whale transactions involving Dogecoin recently surged by over 400%. Furthermore, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows that Dogecoin’s large transaction volume recently rose to over $60.9 billion in a 24-hour timeframe. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3328 and is down by about 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The $0.3 price level remains a pertinent range to keep an eye on, as a successful defense of this level paired with strengthening BTC prices could lay the groundwork for a renewed Dogecoin rally. A prudent approach would be to set stop losses below this level in case of a deeper correction, which could invalidate short-term bullish momentum.

33767162,[object Object],1736550018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ethereum Hints At Key Accumulation Zone Amid Waning Price Performances,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-hints-at-key-accumulation-zone/,"Volatility continues to reign over the general crypto market, causing major digital assets like Ethereum to retest key support levels that previously prompted an upward move. With ETH experiencing notable bearish pressure, its price performance shows that the altcoin is on the verge of entering a crucial zone. A Potential Accumulation Zone Ahead For Ethereum Recent price movements show that Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset, is at a key moment that could determine its next direction. Technical analysis platform Rose Premium Signals delving into ETH’s price action highlights that the altcoin might be gearing up for an accumulation zone. The platform’s prediction comes as ETH shows signs of waning momentum, fueled by a bearish performance in the general crypto market . Interestingly, long-term investors looking to take advantage of lower prices before a potential rebound may be drawn to the present slump. Given the ongoing consolidation after recent volatility, this phase can set the stage for ETH’s upcoming major price upswing, possibly toward a new all-time high . In the meantime, watching key support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining the strength of Ethereum’s market structure to undergo another significant upward move. According to Rose Premium Signals, Ethereum has now broken below the critical support zone in the 4-day time frame. This breach coincides with ETH’s inability to sustain key price levels amid unfavorable market conditions. Considering the current Bitcoin correction, ETH might keep retracing toward $2,807, providing a possible accumulation zone before a rebound . Nonetheless, if the altcoin fails to produce a rebound, this breakdown could pave the way for increased volatility toward lower support points. Rose Premium Signals’ chart shows that ETH has formed a bullish pattern that points to an upward trajectory. However, this chart setup suggests a potential deeper correction prior to the resumption of bullish continuation. Should Ethereum resume its upswing, Rose Premium Signals has predicted a huge rally to the $7,000 mark. With the rising adoption of the Ethereum blockchain , this positive trend might support the altcoin’s next upswing as investors assess potential resistance levels. ETH’s Downside Movement Crucial For A Major Surge Rose Premium Signals’ bold forecast aligns with that of Ali Martinez, a technical expert and investor, who has predicted a significant upswing to the $7,000 level. Interestingly, Martinez also anticipates a notable decline to a key support level before ETH resumes its upward direction. Martinez points to a drop to $2,900, which is bullish for ETH as it forms an excellent buy-the-dip opportunity to the $7,000 threshold. His forecast is backed by a key chart formation, particularly the Head and Shoulders pattern, often acting as a precursor for a rally. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $3,297, indicating a slight increase of about 0.43% in the last 24 hours. ETH’s trading volume has dropped nearly 7% in the past day, suggesting waning investors’ sentiment.",Ethereum|Accumulation Zone|Ali Martinez|Altcoin|ETH|Ethereum Blockchain|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Head and Shoulders Formation|Rose Premium Signals,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|ZK|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-10 23:00:18

Analysts forecast that this token could skyrocket to $1.2, positioning it as a game-changer in the crypto space.

With cutting-edge AI innovations and a robust ecosystem, WallitIQ (WLTQ) promises not only substantial returns but also practical applications that appeal to both novice and experienced investors.

Analysts project a staggering 30,000% growth for WLTQ, taking it from $0.0420 to $1.2 after its launch. This impressive surge potential is rooted in WallitIQ’s AI-powered platform, which delivers unparalleled functionality in digital asset management.

WallitIQ’s 30,000% Growth Forecast XRP has long been a cornerstone of the crypto market, with its efficient cross-border payment solutions and strong community backing. Currently priced around $2.450 according to CoinMarketCap, XRP’s goal of hitting $5 represents a significant 10x growth. However, while the XRP price offers stability and a promising future, its growth potential pales in comparison to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) anticipated 30,000% rally.

With AVAX experiencing swings and DOT showing steady potential, enthusiasts are keeping an eye on these significant projects. Avalanche is boosting scalability with its exciting Avalanche9000 upgrade, while Polkadot is expanding its influence in decentralized apps. In this scenario, BlockDAG stands out with its $1M Raffle, a clever way to spread BDAG coins and boost adoption. The raffle not only offers a hefty 200% coin bonus, reflecting the success of the presale, but it also sets up participants for immediate rewards and future ecosystem growth. With the mainnet launch approaching, BlockDAG (BDAG) promises not just prizes but a gateway to what’s coming. BlockDAG’s $1M Raffle: Pave Your Path to Massive Wealth BlockDAG’s $1M Raffle is more than a chance to win big—it’s a strategic initiative to increase adoption and enhance its network. Offering big prizes along with a 200% BDAG coin bonus, the raffle offers immediate benefits and motivates long-term involvement in its expanding network. This approach keeps the momentum going even when the crypto market is down, showing the project’s forward-thinking strategy. The raffle features three ticket levels, catering to various budgets. The Bronze Ticket requires a $250 BDAG buy-in for a chance at a $250,000 USDT prize, the Silver Ticket at $500 offers a shot at $500,000 USDT, and the Gold Ticket at $1000 gives participants the best chance to win the $1M USDT grand prize, positioning the raffle as an appealing option for both newcomers and long-term backers. Following a successful presale that garnered over $178.5 million and sold more than 17.8 billion BDAG coins at $0.0248 each, early participants have enjoyed a substantial 2,380% ROI. These achievements underscore the community’s confidence in the project, despite the wider fluctuations in the crypto market. With the upcoming mainnet launch, the raffle is not just an isolated event but a part of BlockDAG’s broader vision to distribute coins widely, reward its community, and establish a foundation for a decentralized future. 2025 AVAX Price Movements: Riding the Waves of Change Avalanche (AVAX) continues to capture headlines as its price movements suggest both challenges and opportunities for 2025. Currently valued at around $36.68, the coin has recently seen a 5.95% decrease due to overall market shifts. However, its prospects are bolstered by the Avalanche9000 upgrade, aimed at boosting scalability and reducing costs, ensuring its vital role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and more. Last year, AVAX reached a peak of $65.39 but fell to $17.29 in August, displaying its unpredictable nature. Analysts foresee a possible recovery, with price expectations possibly reaching up to $81 by the end of 2025, contingent on market trends and its ecosystem’s development. Avalanche’s continuous technological progress and growing use make it a focal point in this year’s crypto watchlist. Prospects for DOT: Poised for Consistent Expansion Polkadot (DOT) stands out as a formidable force for 2025, with forecasts indicating a possibility for consistent expansion. Trading at $6.65, Polkadot is enhancing its infrastructure, promoting interoperability, and facilitating decentralized applications. The network’s unique parachain auctions and increased utilization reinforce its status as a prime blockchain resource for developers and various initiatives. Despite the ups and downs of 2024, where DOT fluctuated between $10.50 and $4.30, the outlook remains guardedly positive. Estimates for DOT’s 2025 performance suggest an average price of $12.50, potentially soaring to $40, driven by heightened activity within its ecosystem and strategic alliances. As Polkadot’s presence in DeFi’s Total Value Locked (TVL) escalates, it continues to be recognized as a dependable, enduring blockchain choice amidst the crypto evolution. The Decisive Trends of 2025 As we step further into 2025, both Avalanche and Polkadot are making significant strides. AVAX’s price dynamics reveal both instability and promise, with its technological enhancements capturing market interest. On the other hand, DOT’s expected growth is supported by its broadening ecosystem and rising acceptance in DeFi sectors. Amidst these trends, BlockDAG introduces an appealing prospect with its $1M Raffle, merging immediate incentives with prospects for prolonged development. The 200% coin bonus echoes the triumph of its initial crypto presale , emphasizing its dedication to community enhancement. For those in search of ventures that offer immediate advantages while promising future opportunities, BlockDAG’s raffle stands out as a pivotal initiative this year.

The Chainlink rally has captured attention with a remarkable 18% price surge in three days, fueled by heightened whale activity. Meanwhile, Injective’s 3.0 upgrade has entered its first phase, marking the beginning of its deflationary journey and setting the stage for future growth. Among these exciting trends, Web3Bay (3BAY) , a leading decentralized e-commerce platform, has smashed several presale milestones. The platform has raised over $560,000, with more than 150 million 3BAY tokens sold, further showcasing the potential of web3 technology to revolutionize e-commerce. With such notable movements across the sector, it’s clear that the momentum for innovative blockchain solutions is stronger than ever. Surge In Whale Activity Boosts Chainlink Rally Chainlink (LINK) has been gaining attention for an impressive 18% price surge in just three days. This Chainlink rally was ignited after the token retested a critical support level near $19, drawing significant attention from crypto whales. Over 1.40 million LINK tokens were purchased within a span of four days. On-chain metrics further support this Chainlink rally, with a consistent decrease in exchange outflows, signaling that fewer investors are preparing to sell their holdings. Analysts speculate that whales are strategically positioning themselves for potential gains as the “altcoin season” approaches. New Injective Upgrade Strengthens Its Deflationary Mechanisms The latest Injective upgrade, Injective 3.0, has introduced a disruptive deflationary model, making the network more adaptable and inflation-resistant. By adjusting the token supply based on staking activity, this upgrade enhances efficiency and aims to boost the deflation rate by an impressive 400%. Currently, 56% of Injective’s token supply is staked, offering a competitive yield of 10.68%. This figure outpaces other major networks like Ethereum and Solana, signaling growing confidence in Injective’s long-term potential. Despite its progress, Injective struggles to attract significant developer activity, especially when compared to networks like Sui, Aptos, and Coinbase’s Base. 3BAY’s $550K Success Story: An E-Commerce Gamechanger Web3Bay (3BAY), a rising e-commerce platform powered by web3 technology, is setting a new standard in digital commerce by utilizing blockchain to create a secure, transparent, and community-driven platform. Built to enable seamless transactions and ensure user data remains fully protected, Web3Bay’s decentralized approach removes the limitations of centralized e-commerce platforms. At the heart of the ecosystem is the 3BAY token, which facilitates transactions, incentivizes participation, and empowers the community with decision-making capabilities.

According to a new report by The Financial Times, the CFPB – which aims to protect consumers from unfair financial practices by institutions – is proposing a new rule that would mandate crypto firms refund money stolen from customers via exploits or hacks. The report says that by proposing this new rule, the CFPB is extending the same protections traditional bank accounts have to the crypto wallets of crypto users. If the rule is accepted, it would change the definition of “funds” to include any asset used to make payments and would force crypto wallet providers to compensate users if their funds are stolen. Previously, data from market intelligence platform Chainalysis found that in 2024, crypto platforms lost a staggering $2.2 billion from hacks in 2024, a 20% increase from the previous year. Chainalysis also found that exploits significantly slowed down in the second half of 2024. However, the firm also found that in 2024, North Korean hackers stole more digital assets than ever before. According to the data, North Korean hackers stole $1.34 billion worth of crypto assets in 2024 while in 2023, they stole $660 million.

According to data insight from Santiment, the number of HODLers for these altcoins has fluctuated thus far this new year. The crypto analytics platform hinted at the implication of the HODLer count within each protocol’s ecosystem. The Ethereum and XRP Standout Santiment profiled six digital currencies, including the aforementioned Bitcoin and Chainlink. While Chainlink underperformed with 3,300 drops in hodler wallets, Ethereum and XRP stood out. The shared data showed that Ethereum had recorded a 645,000 uptick in its hodler wallets. This figure underscores its dominance as the top altcoin among retail investors. XRP followed closely with a total hodler wallet recording a 58,000 count since the start of the year. Ranking as the only meme cryptocurrency profiled by Santiment, Dogecoin has seen a 29,000 jump in investors holding it for the long term. Cardano scored the lowest figure, with just 2,800 wallets committing to long-term growth. As 2025 has kicked off with roller coastering prices for crypto’s top assets, the amount of hodlers have fluctuated wildly since the new year: Bitcoin $BTC : +102K Wallets Ethereum $ETH : +645K Wallets XRP Ledger $XRP : +58K Wallets Cardano $ADA : +2.8K Wallets… pic.twitter.com/W07x43GgW4 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 10, 2025 It is worth noting that the term ‘HODLer’ denotes token holders with plans to hold their assets in the long term. As the data provider hinted, when the hodler count grows, investors or the community will be comfortable with the project. This can aid ecosystem stability and long-term token growth. The opposite is true when the hodler count drops as investors focus on Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). Ecosystem Projects and Dogecoin Advantage Despite the ongoing bull cycle, fluctuations have shown how volatile and uncertain the market is. As reported earlier by Coingape, ETH price lost 9% of its value in under 24 hours, a trend visible in other altcoins. Amid this uncertainty, investors focus on developer activity, and other utilities focus beyond price. While Ethereum developers are working on the Pectra Upgrade, Ripple Labs launched RLUSD stablecoin to boost XRP liquidity. Input Output Global developers are also working on perfecting the Cardano community governance. In all, Dogecoin might take more of the spotlight in the altcoin market in the long term. This is based on the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), which might fuel DOGE popularity. These ecosystem trends might explain why more users are betting on the altcoin’s long-term prospects. ETH and DOGE Predictions for 2025 Amid the fluctuations of the past few weeks, experts believe the altcoin season is still ahead. Galaxy Research said the DOGE price will top $1 this year in its projections. The Mike Novogratz-associated firm tied this forecast to the D.O.G.E ties around the coin. Top experts also believe this year holds something big for Ethereum. Bitwise predicted that Ethereum would hit a new all-time high this year, and the asset manager said it is possible for Ethereum to reach $7,000 by the end of the year.

According to the report, countries such as India, Vietnam, and Indonesia made it to the top ten countries with the largest crypto-savvy population worldwide. Foresight Ventures, a crypto-focused venture capital firm and Primitive Ventures, a frontier prop investment firm, recently unveiled their “GTM in Asia” report. The report showed that the Asian region was the epicentre of global crypto activities, accounting for 60% of the world’s crypto population. The tally reveals that the Asian continent contributes the largest share of global liquidity in the crypto arena. The 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index shows Asia leads in crypto adoption The Chainalysis 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index revealed that Asia continues to dominate the global cryptocurrency landscape, with nine of the top 20 nations. According to the 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index report, five out of the top ten countries are Asian countries, including India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The report highlights the growing trend in crypto adoption among Asian countries, which is primarily driven by centralized exchanges and price-sensitive communities. Crypto is Booming in China! Asia Leads Adoption with 60% of Global Users pic.twitter.com/pHnosfuEJF — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) January 10, 2025 Indonesia emerged as the region’s stronghold, ranking third globally in crypto adoption. Between July 2023 and June 2024, the country received $157.1 billion in digital assets value, leading Southeast Asia. The Global Crypto Adoption Index report also revealed that centralized exchanges such as Upbit and Binance dominate the Asian market by facilitating crypto trading and investing activities—the exchanges operating in the region account for 37.1% of global traffic. The report also revealed that Asia–Pacific (APAC) region has a unique socio-economic diversity that fuels dominant speculative behaviors, including airdrop farming and meme-based speculation. This diversity allows Asian users to underscore on-chain opportunities for tailored crypto products. The report also emphasized that Asia’s internal trade and capital flows illuminate its global connectivity. According to the study, the region’s interconnectedness unlocks 57% of intra-regional trade and 55% of FDI inflows. The Chinese market remains active despite harsh regulatory scrutiny The study revealed that despite tough regulatory scrutiny, Chinese citizens have been active in the crypto industry. The report noted that the Chinese market thrives in OTC markets and DeFi platforms, with Hong Kong serving as the pivotal gateway for resilient Chinese crypto enthusiasts. Unlike China, Singapore has a conducive regulatory environment for crypto investors and is widely renowned as a global hub for innovation. The country has a high crypto ownership rate of 24.4%, and its progressive regulatory framework has attracted major crypto platforms such as Gemini, OKX, and Upbit, which were licensed by the Singaporean regulator. The report termed Vietnam a rising star in GameFi and blockchain education. The Vietnam Blockchain Association controls the digital asset education process alongside successful projects such as Axie Infinity. The Philippines is a leader in blockchain remittances and capitalizes on its English-speaking diaspora and strong gaming community. On the other hand, the report highlighted the South Korean market as a highly liquid market primarily controlled by retail investors. South Korea boasts native crypto platforms such as crypto exchange Upbit that are strongly integrated into the Kakao ecosystem. Wealthy individuals in the region are increasingly exploring the digital asset ecosystem. In a report, Aspen Digital revealed that 94% of wealthy investors in the region are already investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The global crypto adoption index measures how nations are interacting with crypto assets. The index considers user count, trading volume, and the growth of crypto businesses. A major driver of increased crypto adoption in developed nations was launching spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. The funds sparked a wave of Bitcoin activity, particularly in North America and Western Europe. On the other hand, lower-middle-income countries such as Nigeria turned to crypto as an alternative to their national currencies, which were often weakened by inflation or economic instability.

With less than two weeks before he steps down, the man who’s been the face of the Biden administration’s anti-crypto agenda has opened up about the toll it’s taken on him, and let’s just say, it hasn’t been a walk in the park for Gary. He admitted that the barrage of crypto-related cases during his time at the SEC left him “traumatized.” Oh, and about Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E? He thinks it’s pointless. Speaking from his Washington, D.C. office, Gary was quick to attack the crypto industry, as per usual. According to him, it is a mess — sentiment-driven, unstable, and riddled with scams. “These 10,000 to 15,000 projects—many of them will not survive,” he said, comparing the crypto space to high-stakes venture capital, except with more pump-and-dump schemes and fraud. For Gary, it was less about innovation and more about survival: of the markets, the investors, and maybe even himself. Crypto chaos and Gary’s Wild West show When Gary walked into the SEC in April 2021, Wall Street was still reeling from the GameStop short squeeze. But crypto quickly took center stage. In his first few months on the job, he was already fielding questions about how he’d deal with an industry that seemed allergic to rules. “I came in, and my predecessor, Jay Clayton, had brought 80 enforcement actions in this area. We’ve brought in about 100 in our four years,” Gary said. “It was consistent. I’ve been around finance for over four decades. And everything in the markets trade on a mixture of fundamentals and sentiment at any given time. But I’ve never seen a field that’s so much wrapped up in sentiment and not so much about fundamentals.” That might be a little bit true, but the work clearly left its mark. From the collapse of FTX and the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried to the collapse of Terra and the downfall of Hyung Do Kwon, Gary’s SEC went after crypto with the kind of vigor you’d expect from a guy who famously describes the industry as “the Wild West.” And yet, the sentiment he’s leaving with is exhaustion. Gary’s own background made his stance even more controversial. Before his time at the SEC, he taught blockchain and digital assets at MIT, leading many in the industry to believe he’d be their ally. “When you’re in academia or not in this job, you can study something and observe it. But when you’re in this job… you do what you can to protect the investing public,” he explained. In other words, teaching blockchain and regulating it are two very different ballgames. TikTok celebrations and Trump’s promise to fire him If you thought Gary was unpopular in crypto circles, wait until you hear how TikTok reacted to his resignation. The announcement started a wave of celebration on the platform, with users calling him a “demon” and celebrating the end of what they saw as his reign of terror. “This demon has been torturing companies for like three to four years,” one user said. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump made firing Gary a key part of his campaign, promising to remove him on day one of his administration. But Trump won’t get the chance. Gary announced he’d be stepping down on Inauguration Day at noon, effectively sparing himself from what would’ve likely been a high-profile dismissal. Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E: Gary isn’t buying it One of the most surprising moments in Gary’s interview was his blunt take on Trump and Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E initiative, the department that was started to cut out government spending linked to spiraling national debt. They want to remove at least $2 trillion per year, which is an insane amount of money that could break an economy. And even Elon himself has admitted that it’s impossible to achieve. When asked how the SEC would handle a staff cut, Gary said: “I think it would be unfortunate because we’re already spread too thin. We get 40 or 50,000 tips, complaints and referrals a year. It’s unnecessary.” He added that crypto accounts for roughly 18% of those cases. “At any given time, we only have the staff to maybe investigate some small portion,” he said, adding that the workload forces the SEC to triage constantly. Beyond crypto, Gary also warned about the potential risks of AI in financial markets. From robo-advisors to opaque algorithms, he argued that the rapid growth of AI could lead to conflicts of interest that harm everyday investors. He asked: “Your robo-advisor, are they giving you advice on behalf of the asset manager or you? And who are they putting first?” As he prepares to leave, Gary has already met with his presumptive successor, Paul Atkins. The two had a private conversation, but Gary shared a piece of advice he’d received from former SEC Chair Richard Breeden: “Every single day in the job is one day closer to when you will join the formers club.” Gary took that to mean he should use each day wisely—a sentiment he tried to pass on to Atkins. “It’s really about our capital markets that are 40% to 45% of the world’s capital markets,” Gary said. “You gotta keep it good disclosure, free of fraud manipulation, and really have, as best you can, competitive all-to-all trading.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",Regulation|SEC|United States,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-10 23:15:51

Some of them include Rep.Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.) and Rep.Mike Collins (R-Ga.), who have invested in cryptocurrency. Recently, Rep. Reschenthaler disclosed that he holds some cryptocurrencies, such as Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Bitcoin (BTC). His assets are worth between $1,000 and $15,000 in total. This is in line with the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which prohibits members of the United States Congress from buying and selling stocks and other cryptocurrencies. Rep. Mike Collins and others join the trend Rep. Mike Collins from Georgia revealed earlier this year that he bought Ski Mask Dog (SKI), a relatively unknown cryptocurrency. He revealed that he had invested between $1,001 and $15,000 in Ski Mask Dog (SKI). The disclosure report shows that Rep. Collins bought Ski Mask Dog three times in succession on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of December 2024. Each purchase was made in the $1,001-$15,000 range, which corresponds to the period of increasing prices of many cryptocurrencies. In the past, he revealed purchasing Ether (ETH), Velodrome (VELO), Aerodrome Finance (AERO), and The Graph (GRT). Source: US House of Representatives Others include Rep. Barry Moore (R-Al) and Rep. Jeffrey Jackson (D-NC) who also revealed high-value cryptos transactions. With interest in cryptocurrencies on the rise, the U.S. Senate is stepping in to regulate digital assets. Sen.Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) will head a new committee on digital assets. Lummis is a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency and has submitted a bill that mandates the US Treasury to buy 1 million Bitcoins in five years. Lummis has also revealed her own Bitcoin transactions, with the first one made in 2013. Donald Trump’s rising crypto portfolio Apart from Congress, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has also come under the radar regarding his crypto investments. Recent report shows that he has accumulated more than $11 million worth of crypto assets, mostly due to the Trump-based memecoin. Trump’s assets include various cryptocurrencies, including Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), USD Coin (USDC) and several memecoins. However, he has no investment in BTC, though he once expressed the desire to use it to pay off the national debt.

Ki Young Ju, market analyst and CEO of CryptoQuant, compared altcoin market performance to Bitcoin (BTC), which has doubled in value since 2021. “Only a few altcoin projects with strong use cases and narratives will survive,” Ju noted. According to Total3 — a metric representing the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) — altcoins currently hold a market cap of approximately $943 billion. The altcoin market briefly touched an all-time high of $1.1 trillion during a rally from November to December 2024, but quickly retraced to current levels. Changing Dynamics of Altcoin Seasons Ju has warned that this market cycle deviates from previous ones, where altseason was traditionally triggered by capital rotations from Bitcoin to altcoins. Instead, he suggested this altseason may rely on stablecoin liquidity and the expansion of stablecoin trading pairs. “A rise in stablecoin trading pairs suggests fresh capital entering the altcoin market and reflects true demand increases, rather than just capital rotations,” Ju added. Capital flows into Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also signify a major shift from prior cycles. These flows are siloed within the ETF ecosystem, limiting the ability to shift funds from Bitcoin and Ether investments into smaller-cap altcoins, Ju explained. Market Outlook Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, predicted in December 2024 that most altcoins would face a “slow bleed” until late January 2025. Hartmann argued there was little opportunity in altcoin investments during the current consolidation phase, suggesting the market may only pick up following its conclusion.

Whale Buys 470 Million DOGE On January 11, 2024, a prominent crypto expert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that crypto whales have purchased a significant 470 million DOGE in the past 48 hours. Whales bought over 470 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/d7oPvnfB6o — Ali (@ali_charts) January 10, 2025 Looking at DOGE’s daily chart, it appears that this significant purchase of DOGE occurred between the $0.314 and $0.355 levels. This data indicates that the current price range might present an ideal opportunity to add or buy more meme coins. Current Price Momentum Currently, DOGE is trading near $0.334 and has experienced a price surge of over 4.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 15%, indicating that more investors and traders are engaging with the token as sentiment appears to be quietly improving compared to the past few days. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level However, DOGE has found support at the crucial $0.31 level and is poised for upside momentum. Historically, the meme coin has bounced off this support level multiple times, each time witnessing significant upward momentum. This time, experts and analysts are speculating a similar outcome for DOGE, which explains the reason behind the 470 million accumulation. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, DOGE is currently facing minor resistance at $0.34 and appears to be struggling to breach this level. Based on recent price action, if DOGE surpasses this resistance and closes a daily candle above the $0.345 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 15% to reach the $0.40 level in the near future. RSI Signals Recovery Potential In addition, DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing the oversold area, indicating a potential recovery that could unfold in the coming days.

According to a Friday filing in the US District Court for the Northern District of Delaware, FriendliAI entered into a “confidential agreement” with Hugging Face on January 8. The company has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit “with prejudice,” which means the case cannot be brought back to court. FriendliAI filed against Hugging Face in 2023 The settlement comes almost two years after FriendliAI filed a lawsuit against Hugging Face over the infringement of one of its patents. The Korean AI startup however reached a settlement on Friday. “FriendliAI and Hugging Face hereby stipulate to dismissal … without costs and fees to any party of this case,” reads the filing. “The court shall retain jurisdiction over the parties’ settlement agreement.” Court papers. In its lawsuit, which was filed nearly two years ago, the Korean AI startup accused Hugging face of violating its patent on “batching with iteration-level scheduling.” FriendliAI also claims that the patented technology described in an application to the US Patent and Trademark Office improves the process of batching data fed into the AI system to allow the system to handle multiple requests at once. According to Tech Crunch , the patent also covers AI systems that enable finished requests from within a batch to be sent to a user and new requests to be added to the batch before the full batch has been processed. According to a complaint filed on July 28, 2023, in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, Hugging Face’s “Text Generation Inference” server for its large language model AI used the Korean AI startup’s patented method to batch incoming requests to increase the tool’s efficiency. As such, FriendliAI wanted compensation from Hugging Face, enhanced damages for willfulness, in addition to a court order preventing further infringement or awarding a licensing fee and attorney’s fees and costs. In the meantime, Microsoft releases model on Hugging Face According to a Bloomberg report, FriendliAI’s method which the startup refers to as “batching with iteration level scheduling” and markets as Periflow or Orca, enhanced the process of batching inputs to allow the AI to process multiple requests. FriendliAI also has an office in Redwood City, California. The VC-backed startup was founded in 2021 and primarily develops infrastructure solutions for the fast-growing AI tech. According to TC, Hugging Face has raised a total of $235 million from backers, including Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Intel, and Salesforce. It is one of the largest repositories of AI tools and models in the world. Apart from hosting models and tools, the Brooklyn-based Hugging Face develops its own, and it offers consulting services to help enterprises fine-tune, customize, and deploy AI. Meanwhile, tech giant Microsoft has officially released its latest language model, Phi-4, on Hugging Face. According to AINews , the model is available under the MIT licence, which allows for broad usage by developers, researchers, and businesses alike. The move has been described as a significant step toward democratizing AI innovations. Phi-4 was unveiled in December last year.

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK.

The recent Blockchain Roundtable held in the German Parliament brought out some of the key proposals for realizing this objective. The event included remarks from Christian Lindner, former Finance Minister of the country, and also included contributions from Patrick Hansen, the Senior Director of EU Strategy & Policy at Circle. Strategic Bitcoin initiatives Christian Lindner proposed three key measures during the roundtable discussion. The first one is the provision of government bonds on the basis of the blockchain. This could help increase the bond market’s transparency and effectiveness and potentially put Germany at the cutting edge of blockchain financial technology. Another proposal is to have the German government, or even the European Union, use Bitcoin as a reserve currency. This would align it with other governments around the world, using Bitcoin as a store of value and as an inflation hedge. The third one focuses on the possibility of launching Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the European Union. Currently, European markets do not have Bitcoin ETFs and use exchange-traded notes (ETNs) or commodities (ETCs). The entry of ETFs could offer investors regulated and institutional-grade investment avenues, thus increasing adoption and market depth. Impact of previous Bitcoin sales Germany’s interest in Bitcoin comes after its government recently auctioned off 50,000 BTC seized during an operation against the Movie2k piracy website . This sale happened in mid-2024, influencing the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin’s value decreasing from $70,000 to $56,000. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $94,806 and is still below the $100,000 mark, which market analysts say is because the asset is still in the distribution zone. Analysts expect the prices to rise again due to increasing usage and utilization of the digital asset. In December, Lindner spoke in the Bundestag, pointing to the government’s missed opportunity to harness Bitcoin’s potential and comparing Germany’s position to that of the United States. He pointed out that the US is ready to adopt cryptocurrency-friendly measures after Donald Trump’s victory in the recent election. In his campaign, Trump suggested buying Bitcoin and labeling the US as a home of cryptocurrencies. During his speech, Lindner complained about the fact that Germany did not have a strategy, arguing, “The US will use the advantages that we could also have with Bitcoin. What an omission, what opportunities are being lost to us.” Still, Lindner’s renewed interest in Bitcoin has also attracted controversy. German crypto analyst and trader Furkan Yildirim expressed his doubts on X . Stating, “The man had almost 4 years as finance minister to have the necessary debates, and now that there’s a fire, he notices? Bitcoin doesn’t need politicians. Politicians need Bitcoin.” Lindner’s recent statements come at a time when German politics are more active than usual, with a federal election scheduled for soon. Critics have suggested that Lindner’s outspoken support for Bitcoin is an attempt to re-ignite his party’s flagging popularity as the polls suggest that support for the party is waning.

This approach is designed to streamline operations, addressing issues of efficiency as transaction volumes grow. Similarly, BitTorrent (BTT) market trends reveal potential, with its integration into the BitTorrent ecosystem offering advantages in decentralized file sharing. However, challenges such as competition and token supply remain hurdles for growth. As blockchain technology continues to reshape industries, Web3Bay (3BAY) is the fresh-faced Web3 crypto project gearing up to redefine e-commerce. Having raised over $560K, with over $50K being raised in the last 24 hours, its blockchain-powered e-commerce platform emphasizes security, transparency, and accessibility. As traditional e-commerce platforms face disruption, Web3Bay is ready to claim a significant portion of the market with its decentralized approach. SOL Network Aims to Improve Efficiency The Solana network continues to address scalability challenges with its latest proposal, SIMD-215, a homomorphic hashing system designed to enhance account verification efficiency. This shift targets the longstanding issue of “state growth,” where recalculating the entire state of accounts slows network performance. By adopting incremental updates instead, Solana’s developers aim to streamline operations and reduce resource strain on nodes. Replacing the current Merkle-based hashing system, this approach could significantly improve scalability and strengthen the Solana network’s ability to handle rising transaction volumes. The proposed changes will require nodes to adopt the updated calculation methods, ensuring smoother transitions and uninterrupted operations. These advancements highlight efforts to maintain competitiveness as Solana continues to adapt within the blockchain ecosystem. BTT Market Trends Show Potential Despite Challenges BitTorrent market trends indicate a mix of opportunities and hurdles as BTT navigates its position in a competitive crypto landscape. Currently trading at a fraction of a cent, BTT has seen volatility reflective of broader market conditions. Its integration with the BitTorrent ecosystem offers a unique advantage, leveraging a massive user base for decentralized file sharing. Despite this edge, BitTorrent market trends also underscore challenges, such as a high token supply and stiff competition from bigger platforms. Strategic partnerships and technological advancements are key factors shaping BTT’s future trajectory. As interest in decentralized solutions grows, BitTorrent market trends suggest room for growth if adoption continues to rise and technological hurdles are addressed. Web3Bay Crypto Goes Viral: Presale Jumps to $560K Web3Bay is making strides toward changing the way digital commerce operates, surging past a half-a-million raised, sitting at $560K in its presale with 148 million tokens sold. Web3Bay is quickly making a name for itself as the decentralized alternative to traditional, centralized e-commerce platforms. Web3Bay integrates blockchain technology to offer secure, transparent, and cost-efficient transactions. This presents Web3Bay as a serious player set to take up some market share traditionally dominated by giants like Amazon. The appeal lies in its focus on user security and global accessibility, removing reliance on centralized online shopping systems. Web3Bay’s plans include a robust ecosystem featuring an NFT marketplace, DeFi integrations for staking and lending, and cross-chain compatibility. These features position Web3Bay as a forward-looking project combining real-world application with investment potential.

The token protocol claims to build a “trustless world computer for Bitcoin,” offering solutions that address limitations in programmability, data availability and asset creation. In an X post on January 10, Nubit announced : Today, Bitcoin has 100+ asset protocols—fragmented, inefficient, and isolated. Every new feature requires building a new protocol from scratch. However, Goldinals changes everything. ~Nubit Goldinals is developed on BitVM and already works well with BRC-20, Runes and Ordinals According to Nubit, the new token protocol, Goldinals, is fully compatible with experimental token standard BRC-20 and the fungible token Runes. The token protocol is also built on BitVM, a system intended to execute complex computations and smart contracts on the BTC network. In a series of X posts, the company insisted that Goldinals is fast, secure, reliable, and fully decentralized , claiming it could help streamline the very fragmented BTC ecosystem. It added that the Bitcoin protocol can now hasten development time, working ten times faster. Moreover, Nubit argued that the protocol is programmable and interoperable and hence will address all the inefficiencies that come with Bitcoin’s ecosystem fragmentation. Developers can also specify token attributes such as supply limits or transfer rules using smart contract-style logic. All transactions are also verifiable directly on the BTC blockchain. Furthermore, Goldinals will utilize zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for on-chain validation. ZK proofs will help the protocol to trace and identify invalid transactions on the Bitcoin network, reducing the need for third-party verification. Nubit aims to revolutionize Bitcoin with programmability and trustless computing Nubit co-founder Hanzhi has maintained that the firm will prioritise programmability, arguing that Bitcoin needs “real programmability, not duct-taped chaos.” He added that with reliable foundations and standards, the Bitcoin ecosystem will evolve into a space of interoperable, win-win innovation. Nubit is also developing a compiler to convert user-friendly code into optimized BTC scripts, with formal verification to validate each program’s integrity. Additionally, the firm will continue to develop BitVM to operate Turing-complete programs on Bitcoin. The company still expects to complete the establishment of a Trustless World Computer for BTC, with support from Polychain.

Despite the drop, the popular meme coin still holds a bullish structure, keeping investors optimistic about its potential for recovery. However, the current levels are critical, as Dogecoin is testing key demand zones that could determine its next move. Related Reading: Key Metrics Reveal Bitcoin STH Support Levels Around $89K–$86K – Is BTC At Risk? Top analyst and trader BigCheds recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that DOGE is testing crucial demand at $0.31 on the daily time frame. This level has historically acted as a strong support zone, and holding above it could set the stage for a bounce and continuation of its bullish trend. Conversely, a failure to maintain this level might open the door to further downside. Market sentiment remains cautious following the broader crypto market’s decline, but DOGE’s ability to hold current levels could restore investor confidence. All eyes are now on whether the meme coin can defend this key support and potentially pave the way for a new rally or if additional selling pressure will lead to a deeper correction. Dogecoin Holds Pivotal Support as 2025 Begins The start of 2025 has taken a different tone for Dogecoin compared to the explosive end of 2024. Beginning in early November, DOGE experienced a massive price surge, gaining over 230% in less than three weeks. This meteoric rise saw the meme coin reach significant levels, reigniting interest and optimism among investors. However, since finding a local high, Dogecoin has entered a consolidation phase, testing critical levels of support. Currently, Dogecoin is trading around $0.31, a key daily demand level identified by top analyst BigCheds. In his recent technical analysis, BigCheds emphasizes the importance of this support zone, as it could determine the next major move for the cryptocurrency. If DOGE manages to hold above $0.31, it sets the stage for a potential breakout into higher prices, reigniting the bullish momentum seen in late 2024. This consolidation phase is being closely monitored by traders and investors, as Dogecoin’s ability to maintain its bullish structure depends on this level. A clean bounce from the $0.31 demand could trigger renewed buying pressure, propelling DOGE toward new highs. Conversely, losing this critical support might signal a deeper correction, testing lower levels before any recovery.

A successful defense of $0.31 could mark the beginning of another significant rally, solidifying DOGE’s position as a top contender in the cryptocurrency space. DOGE Eyes A Breakout Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.33, showing resilience after holding above the critical $0.31 demand level. This support has provided a foundation for DOGE to stabilize following the recent market selloff. However, the cryptocurrency remains at risk as long as it continues to trade below the $0.40 mark, a level that could reignite bullish momentum. For bulls to regain control, the price must reclaim $0.40 decisively. This would signal a shift in sentiment and provide the momentum needed to challenge the $0.43 mark. Breaking above $0.43 is a crucial milestone for Dogecoin, as it would likely trigger a significant rally into price discovery, attracting renewed interest from investors and traders.

Prolonged trading below this level increases the risk of a deeper correction, potentially testing lower levels of demand. The next few days will be pivotal for Dogecoin’s trajectory, as the broader market sentiment and DOGE’s ability to reclaim key levels will determine its direction. If bulls succeed in pushing above $0.43, the meme coin could quickly gain momentum, solidifying its place as a market leader in this cycle.

On Friday, the bureau issued two proposals for public participation and feedback. One proposa l seeks ways to prevent intrusive data collection when clients make digital payments on large tech platforms. The second proposes strengthening laws protecting clients against fraud to cover those who make digital payments through gaming and other cryptos. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. When people pay for their family expenses using new forms of digital payments, they must be confident that their transactions are not tainted by harmful surveillance or errors. ~ Rohit Chopra Trump’s leadership transition sparks uncertainty over CFPB proposals It is unclear how the proposals will end as the current leadership may change upon Trump’s swearing-in on January 20. There has been speculation of Trump replacing Chopra, yet no specific name for the replacement has been tabled. Trump has taken a pro-Bitcoin stand, suggesting he wants to model the US as the world’s crypto capital. He looks forward to enabling the crypto environment than the Joe Biden administration. According to the CFPB , they proposed consumer digital payment privacy after conducting research that revealed that some payment mechanisms gather more data that is irrelevant to transactions. According to the CFPB, this data could be used to allow payment companies to facilitate personalized pricing, where a price is based on factors specific to an individual consumer. The deadline for public comment is April 11. CFPB tightens rules on big tech to protect digital payment users Some big tech companies collect too much data using their platforms as surveillance tools. Chopra felt that strengthening regulations would be critical. The CFPB’s open banking rules, released in October, curtail companies’ ability to use payment data for advertising and marketing purposes. A rule finalized in November gave the CFPB the mandate to supervise payment tools from Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and other large digital payment providers. The other proposal seeks to establish the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which shields consumers’ right to dispute payment carters for new payment systems. Although stablecoins operate around trading and settlement, they are likely to grow beyond that scope in the fullness of time. Both Stripe Inc., Visa Inc., and PayPal Holdings Inc. have stablecoin initiatives. The regulator explained that the proposals aim to reexamine marketwide expectations regarding the available payment laws through consumer lenses without seeking court orders and decisions. The deadline for the second proposal is March 31.
